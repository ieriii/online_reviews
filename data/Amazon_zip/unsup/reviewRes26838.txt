Came here a little before closing on a weekday night only to be told there was still a 30 minute wait. Sit at the bar and avoid the lines... Firstly, let me start by saying that I may have found my favorite beer thanks to this restaurant. Frontera has a special Goose Island brew all to itself--the Marisol. I love Goose Island beer, and the flavor of this Belgian ale was the best of any of them. Give it a try because it may be hard to find anywhere else and it's actually a somewhat cheap $6.50. The food: I honestly didn't try as many dishes as I would have wanted, but I will update this review as that changes as I will definitely return. Frontera guacamole: Other reviews rave on and on about this guac. I've honestly had a lot better at several Mexican restaurants...probably would skip this next time, especially given the small portion size as well. Street food trio: I love meat, but the vegetarian avocado dish may have been the most flavorful one of the trio. Of course, the skirt steak and shredded beef were also fantastic. TINY portions. Mole trio: Great value for the $. The pork in clemole was downright amazing. Mole poblano enchiladas were also very good, and the vegetarian green peanut mole was a truly unique flavor that I enjoyed more with each bite. Surprisingly, this was enough to stuff my girlfriend and me so we didn't even venture to the dessert menu. We will definitely be back...even if it is for nothing else but a quick trip to the bar for some Marisol.
