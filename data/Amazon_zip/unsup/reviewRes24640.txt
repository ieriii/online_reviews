Artopolis will always be my favorite dessert place. The decor is warm and friendly, and I love the cafe feel. There are a large variety of dessert choices, ranging from traditional Baklava to mousse cakes to chocolate decadence. There are also many drink choices, and my favorite is the peach bellini. My friends and family are frequent patrons, especially in ordering the ever-so-popular mango mouse cake for birthday celebrations!
