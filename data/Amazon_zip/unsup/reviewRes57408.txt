Worth the trip! I read the reviews before coming to Chicago to find a good mexican restaurant and found the Mayan Palace had 1/2 price margaritas on Tues/Thurs. We were arriving Thursday so this was great. Did the touristy thing at Navy Pier, ate a so so hot dog (know that is not the place to get a good Chicago dog but we were hungry after taking the L from O'Hare. Finally made it to Mayan Palace around 4 pm, no one was there so thought the reviews were some how off, but ordered a small pitcher of Margaritas and could smell the tequila when the server poured a glass. NICE!!! We had the cerviche which was ok and ordered another pitcher since we weren't really hungry. The server was so nice and didn't get mad that we didn't order any food. I'd go back to try some food and get more margaritas next time I'm in town.
