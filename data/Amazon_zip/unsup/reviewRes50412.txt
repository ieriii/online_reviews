i came here on a sunday night after - to-my-disappointment - mirai is not open on sundays - and stumbled upon this place. i got a couple of small burgers - i really liked the turkey w/swiss. and ordered the corn but once again to my disappointment they were out of it so i got the sweat potato fries instead. they have a pretty big out door seating area and its a great people watching place. i will probably go here again and even check it out at night too.
