My boyfriend and I LOVE eating here. Fortunately, it's about 7 blocks from his apt in Rogers Park! This was the second time he and I went there and every time it was enjoyable. They had bottles of wine half off on a Thursday, December 2nd. He and I got sparkling wine for $25! (originally $50!) This place has great food and exceptional service! Their wait staff were very informative on the food being served and very friendly and patient with us. At the same time, they were also very attentive. I will definitely be coming back!
