The food and drinks here are great but I think the prices are a bit out of hand and I'm used to places in Boston and NYC. I had a halibut that was great but $17 for tapas seems to defeat the point. Menu is from like $10 to $25 when it should be more $6 to $18. Doesn't seem big but it is since it changes the way you would eat here for one or two people.  If you can deal with that I would highly recommend it.
