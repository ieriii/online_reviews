Long wait late on a Friday nite, but ample hangout spaces to have a few beers while u wait. (an hour plus quoted at 930pm) The brisket is acc to waiter a hit or miss, but this time it was a major hit. Not dry at all, really tender and moist with a good mix btw lean meat and fatty meat. The stilted Mac n cheese is delicious, made w gruyere or Brie, which I'd never had before - it worked well. The Cb&j is good, no protein so not my cup of tea. Duck reuben was very good (it's basically what it says it is - a reuben sandwich that uses instead duck as the protein). Mussels were plump and well portioned, tho the sauce or broth was not the dipping delight that many had raved about (too light, coulda used more butter flavor or something). Dessert of brownie was dry. Took a bite but could barely swallow it down without a gulp of water. Great place all around if u make the trek uptown.
