I walked in to Simply It with a friend about a half hour before they closed on a Friday night. We just wanted a quick bite before going out and didn't want to be an inconvenience for the staff. No appetizers, drinks or desserts. Someone came over with a pot of hot tea as we sat down. He said we looked cold and could use something to warm up. Our food came out remarkably fast. I ordered the Clay Pot Chicken and my friend got the Tofu and Pineapple with some plain white rice. As we were finishing up our meals, the same guy who brought us the tea, came over with a tempura battered bananas with strawberry ice cream for dessert. Needless to say, the service and generosity at Simply It are a rarity these days and I would go back just to experience their great hospitality. The food is pretty darn good too.
