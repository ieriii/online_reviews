yummy drinks, fast service, great ambiance -- food's a bit rich, but good place for a date. notable dishes: - chicken shumai - tuna tataki drinks: - divine lychee drink was a great refreshing drink to go with the food downsides: - service was just okay, host/hostess seemed a little haughty - trendy place but worth it for the $$ / food? not sure - a little loud
