I adore this place. The award-winning, hand-crafted beer is fantastic. They have a regular lineup on tap, along with some rotating specials. I recommend the Dysfunctionale and the IPA. The Full Frontal Pale Ale is also good. The pizza--both red and white styles--is delicious. It's build your own style and there are lots of fresh ingredients to choose from. I haven't tried any of the appetizers, salad, or dessert yet (calories are saved for pizza and beer) but it sounds like they wouldn't be a disappointment, based on other reviews. Their Sunday special is awesome, too. Large pizza and a growler of beer for $25, takeout orders only. I can't recommend this place more. I take away one star simply because it can get insanely crowded and loud, and they don't take reservations for less than 10, but I'm definitely willing to deal with it. Their pizza and beer are totally worth it.
