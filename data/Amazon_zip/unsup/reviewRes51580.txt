Welcome back Garcia's!!! The owners definitely did this restaurant justice by expanding the space and accommodating the crowds that come to this restaurant. Not only have I been here for those late night munchies, but finally a place to come enjoy a nice dinner or come in for some FANTASTIC margaritas. the burritos here put chipotle to shame (cheap and more bang for your buck!!) I highly recommend their guacamole, but it unfortunately has been lacking it's usual kick the past couple of times. their fajitas are amazing and you could never go wrong with their tacos. If your looking for great margaritas, this is the place. It's like they put the fantastic word of Willy wonka all in one drink..sweet and definitely gives you a zing. (DISCLAIMER: don't drink and drive :) ). If your looking for a place to chill this is your place. You might not consider this place as a first date as it can get loud and make that first intimate connection a little cumbersome.
