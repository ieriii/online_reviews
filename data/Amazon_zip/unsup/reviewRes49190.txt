We started with a cheese flight accompanied with red and white wine flights. I learned two things from this - I love cheese and I can't really tell the difference between four distinct red wines even when they are labeled and described in detail on my table. They went together well and tasted good so I guess those are the only things that really matter. I ordered the Cassoulet, which is a French slow-cooked bean stew / casserole with pork and sausage. It had great flavors, textures, and was overall a very unique and satisfying dish. My wife ordered the sturgeon which was pretty meh in both of our opinions. In the end, Bin 36 has a nice atmosphere, great wine selection, and is a fun place to take a date or some friends or family in town, but its not going to blow you away with its quality.
