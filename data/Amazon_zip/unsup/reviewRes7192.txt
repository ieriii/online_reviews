This place is the definition of uninspired. Why is it always crowded? The food had no flavor and seemed over priced. The decor is awful and everything was very blah. For someone looking for unique or memorable (in a good way) dining experiences and bang for your buck, stay away from this place. For those of you that enjoy such establishments like TGIFriday's and other generic restaurants, this is the place for you.
