I called in an told them I was proposing to my girlfriend later in the evening. They gave us fantastic seats and treated us really well. The food was great, and the place is pretty romantic. I plan on going back for our anniversary. The only problem is they didn't have bacon on the menu. NO BACON? CMON. do I really have to sneak it in under my coat?
