OMG! YUMMY on the Sunday Brunch! This was our last meal in Chicago before heading back to Mississippi. It was the BEST brunch I have ever had in my life. I am 52 years young, and have eaten at a lot of nice restaurants for Brunch. We started with a bloody mary then we hit the cold bar. We opted for the oysters on the half shell, ceviche, and a king crab cantaloupe mixture served in a champagne glass. Sounds weird but it was FAB! Next we had the lobster bisque, king crab with drawn butter, and huge fried shrimp. If you want breakfast fare, they have it but we weren't wasting our stomach fill space with eggs, omelets and bacon. Lastly we managed to hit the dessert room. Yes, I said ROOM. The little raspberry tarts were scrumptious. This spread is only $39/each. I don't know how they make money with the expensive items they offer, but I guess they do. I will never go back to Chicago and miss this Sunday brunch. You shouldn't either! If you like seafood, this is the spot. Bon appetit!
