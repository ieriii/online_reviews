What am I missing? This is a serious question. Having been here several times, including once with a Cuban-born friend, I found the food neither tasty nor interesting. Cafe 28 is very disappointing if you have had Cuban food in Miami. Fish tacos with pickled red cabbage are odd. The Cuban sandwich is a panini by another name. Soup and salad?? C'mon!
