I will not stay here if we go to Chicago again. Rooms are dark and need updating. Bathrooms are well lit but tiny. You can hear EVERYTHING  Seems like the walls are made of paper. I knew every time our neighbors went to the restroom & when they left. Lobby is beautiful but does not reflect the quality of the rooms. However, the sheets & bedding were clean & nice (the only reason I gave 2 stars). don't stay here.
