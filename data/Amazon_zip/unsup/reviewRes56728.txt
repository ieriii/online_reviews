Ok, the name sounds Japanese, but it's the best lasagna I've ever had. It helps to have a reservation, even on a rainy day. The do-it-yourself valet parking arrangement is a big plus in Lincoln Park. The place is often packed which distracts the wait staff , so it's hard to get out quickly, but the food is well worth the slower pace. Excellent personalized marketing by the chef keeps us coming back on special occasions at a discount.
