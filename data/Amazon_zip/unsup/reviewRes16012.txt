Wow. 600+ reviews have been written for the Violet Hour. Although I realize that there is nothing I can say in this review that hasn't already been said, even if I could I wouldn't want to.... for your sake. If you are reading this review, do yourself a favor and do not read any reviews beyond this one. Allow yourself the anticipation and the fascination of what this mysterious occult place is all about. The Violet Hour has maintained an average of 4 stars and I've given this place 5 stars. Hopefully this is reason enough for you to visit. Stop. Reading. Now. Just. Go.
