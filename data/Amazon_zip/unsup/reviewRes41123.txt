My third time at Ruth's Chris this past weekend, each visit has been at a different location in the area. I would put this location downtown above Northbrook but below Barrington in terms of ambiance, service and overall dining experience. The restaurant is in an older building but it is very cozy and pleasant. We were seated in the dining room upstairs. The harvest salad and lobtser bisque was excellent. The steak was very good but my wife's shrimp dish was a little bland. It was billed as a New Orleans style dish but the only flavoring was from massive amounts of butter. The sides are good but not on par with other high-end steak houses such as Mortons. I like the concept of sizzling steaks on hot plates dripping with butter but that said, the butter can become overwhelming. Service was very good. We felt neither neglected nor rushed. I also knocked off one star right off the top for the lack of tap beers. While they pride themselves on an extensive wine menu a quality cold beer on draft is what I crave with a steak dinner.
