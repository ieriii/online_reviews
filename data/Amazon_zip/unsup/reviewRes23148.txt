The best place to have a party :) The ambiance and decor are just awesome : don't come here expecting a fine-dining experience (read calm 'n quiet); come here if you want a loud fun time. A jovial set of waiters and very good service. Had a birthday party here 'n all the waiters came around to sing Happy birthday with the added Greek touch, plain awesome ! The food : I come here for the Arni (braised lamb) : my favorite is the one served with the spinach rice..yumm yumm try out the cheese for the appetizer if you're a first-timer, the way they serve it is worth the price :) Overall this place can cheer me up anymday. Make sure you make reservations and I think on weekend nights : its a first come first serve, well the cons of being a great place and serving delicious food !
