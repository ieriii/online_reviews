LOVE Glenn's! Seriously the number one gem on the northside. Excellent food/service. The servers are fast, funny, and efficient and definitely know their stuff when concerning seafood. (I should know as I also work at a seafood restaurant.) Their selection of fish is vast and always fresh and I've never been steered wrong by the staff, even when trying an unusual catch. Must haves: the Salmon, Crab cakes, trout, lobster linguine, and "Best Seafood Salad You'll Ever Have." (Seriously- it's effing amazing.) My ONLY complaint is that it's always crowded however if you're smart enough to make a reservation then getting seated is a breeze. Best kept secret in the city- almost wish it was still my secret gem. ;)
