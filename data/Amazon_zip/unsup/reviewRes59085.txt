My greatly anticipated brunch visit to Yolk was not "yolktastic" or as "yolkalicious" as I would have liked. It was brunch so at the very least it was fine (like drinking a shitty beer...it's still beer right?). The place is nice and I could eavesdrop on other people's conversations since all my brunch parter could talk about was her hatred for honey melon.But beware...you can valet your car at the garage next door but there are men there in uniform, running around the garage, but I don't think they know they work there. I had to validate my own parking, get my own keys and get my car myself. Since I was the only person working in the garage that day I didn't pay. Plus, being drunk from the night before made the whole experience a little bit confusing.
