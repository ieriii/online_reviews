Since the remodel, Calo thinks they are much better than they actually are. The quality of the food hasn't changed, but the prices have gone up as as the atittude from the staff. It was a great place when it was just a neighborhood Italian joint where you could get some pizza and beer, but now it's just overpriced and snobby. Last time I attempted to go there, the parking lot attendant yelled at me for parking before I could explain I was actually going to the restaurant, so I turned around and got in my car and left. Not recommended. Let's hope Calo's owners try another "reinvention" soon.
