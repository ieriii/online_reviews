This place definitely gets 5 stars for its "wow" factor--the decor and space itself are truly unique, bright, and cheerful. Clientele is mostly large parties and couples.  The food falls a bit short of my expectations. While the rum glazed pork shoulder I had was good, it wasn't anything amazing. It came with fried plantains (which were slightly burnt), rice, and beans. My friends liked their vegetarian empanada entrees, but one friend who ordered the Amish chicken wasn't happy with it--she said it was dry and tasteless. To make up for the so-so food, the drinks are fabulous here. I ordered the frozen white sangria and it both looked and tasted delicious! Had a taste of the raspberry mojito and that was excellent too. The fun atmosphere here and the great service from our waitress made for a good overall experience. It is pricey, but I would definitely recommend this restaurant for large parties (they know how to handle parties of 6 or more) or drinks and appetizers for two at the bar.
