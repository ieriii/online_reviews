Yea, enough reviews of Irazu, but I gotta' do it for my lists. And because having lived in the Irazu neighborhood of San Jose, Costa Rica, there is just that special connection. Love the people. Food's OK, too. This is one of my favorite spots for a steak sandwich. Well-constructed, tender and reasonably-priced. Love the "gallo pinto" rice n' beans, the oatmeal shake, and the "Casado," a plato tipico of your choice of meat, rice and beans, plantains, salad and veggies. Probably one of the most well balanced meals any gringo could have. In the six months I lived in Costa Rica, eating a plato tipico or roasted chicken for lunch everyday, washing everything down with the fruit (water) shakes, and eating no junk food, a lite dinner, and very little dairy, I lost about 15 pounds. So the benefits of a Costa Rican diet are well founded. I need to go there one of these day to tighten up my BMI. (A couple blocks east of the Western stop of the Blue Line)
