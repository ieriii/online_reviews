It's OK in a pinch, but can be absurdly noisy and can feel like a child care facility if you go on the early side. Pizza is tasty but for the money, damn put a little more cheese on there why don't you. Antipasto plate is a nice alternative. Pizza with truffle oil is definitely the pick at this place, it's outstanding.
