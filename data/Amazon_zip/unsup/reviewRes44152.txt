Alliance made my wedding cake and did a truly splendid job. For starters, they accommodated our need for three people at the tasting and we're pleasant and easy to deal with from our first contact. To be honest, I never intended to have a traditional wedding cake. But, it was included as part of our contract with the hotel we had our wedding and reception at. And when it's included you go for it! I've never really ever enjoyed wedding cake. It's usually dry and the icing is gross. I was so surprised when during the tasting I actually enjoyed our final choice. I mean, I really liked it! We ended up going with a hazelnut cake, strawberry preserve filling, and a buttercream frosting. It tasted like strawberry shortcake (my favorite dessert!) and how perfect is that for a summer wedding! I didn't hold out tons of hope that the cake would actually taste that good at the wedding but the final verdict was fantastic! I won't lie. I never actually got to have a piece that cake at my wedding. I was so busy making the rounds that I just never actually got to eat it. That said, it was absolutely how we had envisioned it and I've received so many complements on how tasty it was. Actually, when it's all said and done I've probably gotten more comments about how good the cake was than anything else!
