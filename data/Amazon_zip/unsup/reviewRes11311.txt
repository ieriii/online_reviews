What can I say that has not been already said. I am a pizza cat yo. And everyone in the city of Chicago loves their pizza. There is nothing quite like it really. I had my Piece pizza many ways. And each time I am so in love with what I have ordered. I love sitting there with friends eating a delicious pizza filled with scrumptious toppings while also enjoying some really stellar beer. Ohmagod the beer. Lets. talk. about. this. beer. Succulent ales. Astounding IPAs. And some badass mo' fuckin bier.  Enjoying Piece could bring about world peace. And I am seriously not joking.
