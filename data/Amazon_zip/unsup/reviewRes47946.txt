What differentiates ZED451 from the other Chicago Brazilian steakhouses? Not only do you get to chill-out in the swanky lounge with mahogany tables and Napa's top rated Caymus by the glass as you wait for your table, but the Zed takes the salad bar concept foody-heaven direction with the kicked up artisan cheeses, roasted veges and 6 different antipasti meats. But that may all seem like noise when you've saved up your calories all day for some serious bottomless meat on sticks. Your $50's gets you a carnivore pass to 4 beefs, 2 lambs, pork ribs, chicken and, how'd a thunk, 3 fish. The meat quality was not really any different than what they throwing in fire pit down the street at Fugo and not sure I understand how the fish thing fits in here. Actually, the fish tasted like tofu when my pallet had just been through 3 beefs and a lamb. So all and all, you need to check this place out if you're devour a plethora of fresh cooked meat in trendy new spot and want a new selection of sides, but don't get your hopes up if your a foody looking for an innovative master chef menu.
