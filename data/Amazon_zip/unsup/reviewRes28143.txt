My own anecdotal experience (deliciouso!) plus some meta-analysis of the other feedback I see here -- as some quick advice: 1. Order the ceviche trio. Yum. Yum. And awesome (the tuna). 2. It's a walk-in restaurant friends. Expect as much. Dear haters, while you're standing outside being annoyed for 2 hours, I'll be in eating and drinking at the bar. Take a step down off your lil' horsey and enjoy yourself, eh? I also had the aqua del dia, which was mango-limeade for my visit. I assume it varies. And tacos del carbon with pork. All spectacular. Lives up to the promise of master status for me, Rick. Good stuff. Looking forward to another trip to Chicago.
