What a charming and romantic restaurant. =) I thought all the nooks and crannies of the place were nice, but all the non-booth tables were very crowded together. The live classical guitarist was great, but we were seated so close to him, I could've counted his nose hairs. If I were you,I would definitely request a booth - which all looked very nice and intimate. In any case, overall, the meal was still enjoyable. =) Notes on food: Frangeliccino (frangelico, espresso dessert drink) really good! Ete white wine is refreshing, Geja's had good wine specials Get both oil and broth to cook with ... Oil good for veggies especially potato and onions, except broccoli which is good in broth ... Meat and scallops good in both Hold the scallops against the side of the le creuset pot as they cook to get a nice color Beware of cooking the shrimp and lobster too long! The chocolate fondue delicious The cheese fondue was just ok Notes on service: The restaurant was very courteous in placing a "Happy Anniversary" card on our table, which I thought was a very nice touch. =) We didn't know until we got there, but in honor of their 46th anniversary, they had a 46% off deal =) They said they would have a 47% off deal for their next anniversary ... but what about their 75th or 99th anniversaries? 100th?? I would go for that deal!
