I live about 10 minutes away from the Bad Apple and I am hooked!!! I love the beer selection (I miss the Dragons Milk, I was addicted) and the drinks are great too (Pickled Pixie Punch and The Lime in the Coconut are my favorites!). The food is also GREAT! Fried cheese curds- need I say more...but I will, the burger topped with the pork and onion rings is fantastic- I don't know what that guy who complained about the pulled pork is talking about, he must be lacking taste buds- also the fries are incredible and the PBJ is awesome!!! Ooo and that appetizer- the fries topped with cheese curds and gravy is insanely good!!! I will definitely be frequenting this spot!!!
