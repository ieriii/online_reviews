If you love pig and cheese, this place is pretty much as good as it gets. I couldn't believe how many different dishes involving every part of the pig were offered that didn't involve sausage (which I also love, but this is not a sausage type of place). I had the fried pig's ear with crispy kale, truffle tremor cheese, milk-braised pork shoulder, and tripe parmigiana. The ear and cheese were my favorites, but I'd have all four dishes again. There were some pretty good-sounding non-pig dishes, like a tuna appetizer, but, being unsure when I'd have the chance to return, how could I not roll with maximum pig? The only negative was the self-consciously hip atmosphere, created mostly by the patrons, but it's something to be aware of because you'll stick out in a bad way if you don't dress up at least a little bit to come here.
