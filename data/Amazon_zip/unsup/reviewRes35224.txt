I came here for a lunch conference and everything was so great. Every person I came in contact to was friendly and warm. I had the chopped salad (delicious), Maryland crab cakes (moist and browned perfectly) and a mini key lime pie slice for dessert (small and perfect for something sweet). Everything was delicious. Sometimes with big conferences the timing can be off - where you wait a long time in between courses or half the table gets food and half doesn't. But they timed everything perfectly. They have a huge lunch crowd, I was surprised! $10 valet during lunch - not sure if it increases for dinner but you pretty much have no choice but to do valet as there is little street parking.
