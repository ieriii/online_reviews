I'm giving Sun Wah 5 stars because 1) it's my favorite Chinese place in the city and 2) the Roast Pork and Duck are amazing. If you've never tried the Peking Duck chef's special (~$30 and you get a full duck cut-up table side, duck fried rice and some soup, among other things good enough to feed 4 people), then head down to Sun Wah ASAP! I've been to Sun Wah plenty of times and I always leave full and satisfied, but not weighed down and greasy like I generally do when I go to lesser quality Chinese places. I no longer find that going to the neighborhood Chinese take-out is even worth it anymore these days, even out of convenience. Regularly going to Sun Wah reaffirms that the drive up to the 5000 block of Broadway is worth it every time. One thing that surprises me is that Sun Wah is closed on Thursdays...which I feel is a popular day for people to eat out. And for some reason, I always crave Roast Pork and Duck goodness on Thursdays...go figure.
