Shaw's has very extensive seafood menus with something for just about anyone who wants seafood. We had lobster, lobster pasta, and clam chowder. Everything tasted really good. Service was very good. Ambiance was very cool... with a well preserved 1930s era look and feel. We felt like we were dining in Chicago from a different era.
