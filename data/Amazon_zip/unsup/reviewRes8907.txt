I've been going here since it opened - I used to live around the corner. It was a total dive in the beginning and due to constant great word of mouth they've remodeled several times into what they are now.  Try these things (besides the kabobs because those are great) Kash-Ke-Bademjan (appetizer. it's awesome), Hummus is great and Shirin Polo is so insanely good I crave it.  And here's something dorky but totally true, that rice...you can microwave it and eat all that leftover rice for a few days. It's still awesome two days later.
