I was able to meet some of my classmates here for brunch. Was ok with paying $10 for the valet parking and honesty.. if a Louisiana Girl can tell you that their Beignets are DEVINE.. TRUST!!!! The rest of our food was great but my friend even got a box of Beignets to take back with her to Virginia. They are that scrumptious ! It isn't my neighborhood Go To Place but it is more or less a better Cheesecake Factory... Wait ! are they owned by the same Corporation ? I can see the same vibe just a change in menu items
