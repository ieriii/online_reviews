I really really wanted to like this place. My friend used to live by here and absolutely loved it. So, I don't know if I was there on an off day (a Sunday morning?) but the food was eh. I got a breakfast burrito and there was so much tortilla and the black beans were runny. I tried my friend's cheese grits which were pretty okay. Overall, I think there are better brunch places in the city. I may try Wishbone again for dinner but have to pass on the brunch..
