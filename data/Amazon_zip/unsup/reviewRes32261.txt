S-L-O-W. Service. They are on Addis-Ababa time, for sure. My friend and I decided to try Demera for a girl's night out. We ordered the sampler with three meat and three veggie dishes that were: Spicy Lamb, Spicy Beef, Chicken Drumstick, Mixed legumes, Collard greens, and Potatoes and Carrots.  My first bite of the lamb, and crunch! I bit into a small piece of bone. I kind of lost my appetite after that. However, my favorite was the spicy beef, and the potatoes and carrots. The injera bread was great, but served cold. I didn't miss utensils, but got a little messy and sloppy. It took such a long time to get our food, that I had to ask for quarters to go refill the parking meter outside (and I started with two hours). We also told the waitress right away that we planned on Ethiopian tea or coffee after the meal, but it took a really long time for that, too. My friend loved the atmosphere and artwork in the restaurant. I wasn't as impressed. It was a great value for the amount of food we had, about $32 for both.
