When I was in Chicago a few weeks ago and a colleague said, "We're going to Frontera, come on," I had no idea this was the same Frontera as the salsas and other products I see in the store. Surprisingly, the restaurant was able to accomodate our group of 10 people just before the lunch crowd - and all at one table! (OK, well a couple pulled together, but still...) Several of us wanted to try a ton of different things, so we got a few small plates to pass around and also ordered some entrees to share. None of the appetizers stood out to me except the guacamole - and holy delicious guacamole, it was! Another lady and I both wanted to try the tacos, so we each ordered a different kind of meat and shared - she ordered the skirt steak and I ordered the pork. I won! The skirt steak had good flavor but was really tough to chew. The pork was delicious though - had an excellent sweet flavoring from diced pineapple, but also had a fair amount of heat for a little kick. I washed everything down with the the fruity drink of the day which was yummo - mango, pineapple, and something else. Most people really liked their food, but I don't think anyone was absolutely blown away by it. (However, we all fell into a food coma about an hour later, so it's a good thing our hotel had lots of caffeine for us during the afternoon portion of our meeting!) Our server was really good and also gracious enough to split our check 10 ways (and that's saying a lot, especially during the lunch rush!), but it seemed like she got slammed right around the time we were all finishing our meals so it took forever to get our checks.
