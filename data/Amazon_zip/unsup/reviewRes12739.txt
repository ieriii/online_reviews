We ate brunch here and it was heavenly! It was a saturday and there were only a few other tables inside, so we were sat right by the window, which is the best spot to people watch. I ordered the stuffed french toast with awesome raspberry sauce (and i coulda swore there were supposed to be bananas in there, but there weren't), and my boy had the breakfast burrito that was huge! Prices were reasonable and service was consistent. My coffee was tasty, too! I need to come back here and try dinner for sure.
