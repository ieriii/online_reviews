Um... yum! Love Sultan's. You most certainly cannot beat their prices, either. I absolutely love their salad bar, with great salad accompaniments and other things--like dolmas-yum! I've had their Tilapia only once, but I will definitely be having it again. I didn't expect much for a little place like this, but the flavors were so fantastic. The only downside--I usually carry very little cash, so I can't always just drop in when I'd like. Otherwise, great!
