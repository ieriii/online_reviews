Seeing the great reviews this place has received from various sites, I've really wanted to try this place out. My friend and I decided to stop in before we have class. Love that this place is rather small, but lively and almost like an Italian villa ;) Once again, ambiance caught my attention. Next was their wine list. Everything there is at retail price...as if shopping at Binny's (was how my server explained it ) so you don't have to worry about a Beringer being $20 ;) Next the food. Loved the whole small tapas style dishes ;) We tried the ragu which was absolutely amazing ;) great presentation and every bite had a different surprise. We also had a salad....with I believe goat cheese and grains? Nice harmony of a slightly sweet flavor and the pungy goat cheese taste. Then we had a pizza with mushrooms, onions and truffle oil. OMG orgasmic ;) Couldn't finish the entire thing but if we had the time, Im sure the both of us have devoured the entire meal. Our server was great, very informative, always checking how we're doing and most of all friendly. Must go back to try out their other dishes ;)
