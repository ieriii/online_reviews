Really nice space, lots of room and good decor. I'm usually not a huge fan of asian fusion. However, this place has some menu items that made me change my mind. We started with the raw shrimp tempura, probably the best tempura appetizer I've ever had. The sauce was amazing and they had just the right amount of batter so that you could really taste the shrimp. We also had the corn fritters, which were good but paled in comparison to the tempura. For my lunch I had the ramen noodles. It sounds plain, but was definitely not. Not only did my huge bowl have an endless supply of noodles, it also had braised pork belly, fish cakes, and a poached egg. Easily the best ramen noodles I've ever had and I'm curious to try some of the other menu items that they currently have to offer...
