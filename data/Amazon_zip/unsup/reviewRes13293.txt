Do you wear a dorky little fedora? Do you wear skinny dark jeans and ride a "vintage" bicycle? Do you fetishize bacon because you mostly eat wheat grass and spelt pancakes choked down with some miracle soymilk drink? Are you facing a shortage of things to spend your money on? Then this is the perfect place for you. For everyone else, Revolution will seem like a joke - from a $14 "Thai Chicken Salad" that is 1/2 a chicken breast and a bunch of iceberg lettuce to the bacon fat popcorn (mmm, tastes like grease!). Everything on the menu seems designed to appeal to 22-35 year olds that find overpriced bar food charmingly ironic. And it is *heavy.* Everything is topped with cheese and bacon and bacon and cheese, because that's also charmingly ironic. Allegedly. I just found it gross. I felt like the owners are probably laughing at their customers in a dark room somewhere, saying "oh yeah! let's see if they'll pay $15 for this! No! Wait! Put bacon on it! BWA-HA-HA-HA.!" Did I mention it's usually mobbed? I guess the beer is good. And everybody there is pretty good looking, as long as you don't have to talk to them. Unless you're some sort of anthropologist working on a paper about up-speaking and crackpot nutrition ideas in generation Y americans. In which case, you've just found the motherlode of subjects.
