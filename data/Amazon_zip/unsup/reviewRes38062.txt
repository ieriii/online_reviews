Hopleaf has a decent beer selection but if beer is your thing then checkout the Map Room on armitage. We went for dinner and had the Toasted Nueske Ham sandwich and the Organic Montreal Style Brisket platter, the latter was all show now taste while the ham sandwich was delicious. I plan to go again but just for the beers. Ah and service was tremendously slow with the place 1/3 full.
