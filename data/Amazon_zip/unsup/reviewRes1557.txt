"There are no two finer words in the English language than "encased meats," my friend." This was the last place in Chicago I hit up before heading east again on my road trip. Boy, am I glad I took the time to stop by! We got there at about one on a Wednesday, but by the look at the line coming out the door, you would think we hit lunch rush on a Friday. I heard a rumor that they had a foie gras hot dog, which I had to try. It took almost a half hour before we got to order, so it gave us plenty of time to decide which hot dogs we would order. Because it was a Wednesday, I was not able to try the fries fried in duck fat, but they were serving the foie gras dog, $9. That was the only hot dog I ordered, but I was fortunate enough that my sisters both ordered two different dogs each and we shared an order of the crinkle cut cheese fries. All our hot dogs were amazing! The foie gras dog was actually a duck sausage served with a mousse and foie gras sprinkled on top with sel gris on top of that. The bun was special too! It was the most amazing hot dog I've ever had in my life! I'm bummed that I can't treat myself to one anytime I've had a bad day. I also got to try the Chicago dog-hot dog, pickle spear, neon green relish, mustard, tomato and celery salt-which was fantastic! There are some pretty awesome hot dog places in Portland, but none of them compares to Hot Doug's!
