As often as I go to this place and as much as I love it, I've been too lazy to review it. I dine in and carry out on a fairly regular basis. The staff is super friendly, they always ask how I'm doing/have been and they really make me feel like a valued customer. On top of that, the food is fantastic. When I dine in I take advantage of their roasted 1/4 chunk of a chicken and 2 sides and drink for like 6 dollars. It's amazing. It's probably the best chicken I've had in Chicago. When we carry out it's always pizza, they do buy one get one half off, and my favorite is the Allexia. We order online from work and pick it up on the way home, it's always ready when we get there, and it goes great with Fat Tire or 1554. If you're going to have a pizza and beer night, do it with Fogo. Just a forewarning. This place is SMALL. They have maybe 3 or 4 tables for sitting so it's not a good place to dine in with a group.
