Excellent quality, but you pay for it. Seriously, I know it's all organic, etc, but to pay $12 for a sandwich? Even if it's all organic, on excellent bread, with top notch quality, for a sandwich (with no sides), that does come in a little steep. I read an article that said 65-70% of the food price goes towards ingredients, and that Bayless has inquired whether people would prefer he not go organic thus being able to go a bit less expensive.....YES, do it! As far as I am concerned, as long as his product is a result of humane animal treatment practices, I'm all for skipping an entirely organic product. Still, I cruised right into the place last night (no line) and had an excellent torta followed by a churro (fresh and hot out of the fryer). I will also definitely go back, and simply suck it up in terms of pricing -- excellent.
