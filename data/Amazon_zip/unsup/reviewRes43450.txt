I have some mixed feelings rating this place 4 stars due to some issues that I will lay out right away-when I was first trying to order, another woman who was leaving kept interrupting me and talking to the woman working the counter when I was trying to ask questions about combinations, dairy content, etc. I found her behaviour rather unprofessional, and something about the way the woman at the counter was acting made me thing this blonde woman may have been the cook/co-owner/someone higher up. Please, whoever you were, it was def. NOT a good first impression. Your rude behavior was so disruptive that I almost turned around and left. If I was so damn hungry and knew the city better I would have. Secondly, the vegetarian options were mostly dairy based, and being lactose-intolerant, I made do, but adding some non-cheese based options in the future would be appreciated. BUT... -The decor was amazing-minimalist, bright by the open windows, goregous simple set up. A cross b/w a museum cafeteria and a bistro. -The food...was damn good. And I thought reasonably priced. I had wine, a warmed up ricotta tart, beets with sweet potatos and a tomato soup served with toasted bread. - The service, other than that first woman, was extremely friendly and sweet and really efficient. I was so hungry I wasn't making sense, and the counter woman was humorous...and good at deliverin the yummies to my table. When I think about a review, I think if I would recommend this place to others for the rating, and for this place? Yeah, actually I would. I wouldn't go miles out of the way, but if in the neighborhood and want a great lunch/brunch on a weekday? It would be a perfect choice.
