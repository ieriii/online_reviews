Bad Apple's beer list is a personal challenge. I want to try every single one of them. With dead on descriptions of the flavors, any newbie to the craft beer scene will be able to choose a winner. Burgers here are supposed to be amazing, I'll have to come back and try the food. I want to give this place more stars, but when you ask for a water four times, it's hard to give out more than three.
