Warm & cozy (perhaps a little crowded) atmosphere, but the food's the draw. Terrific food. BYOB is great, and big enough servings to have a doggie bag for lunch the next day. Yelp says they take reservations, but the gentleman on the phone just told me that they don't. So: hmmm. It also gets real busy, and I have always had a pretty good-sized wait, so reservations would help... Anyway, there are some downsides to Caro Mio but they are logistical; the food is absolutely excellent.
