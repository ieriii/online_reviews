Another fine Westin property. I especially enjoyed drinks at the bar where the bartenders surely found my group to be a bit boisterous...my girls from South Carolina and Georgia can be a bit out of hand. I stayed here 3 years in a row during the RSNA conference that takes over Chicago right after Thanksgiving.  The bar is reminiscent of the previous property style of the Nikko, Japanese and serene. A decent sushi bar when you don't want to head out into the cold Chicago winterness.  The rooms are nice, I would definitely ask to be on the river side for a nice view. I love when it snows and to watch it cover the city in a soft white blanket from your cozy hotel room...that is the best! This hotel is within walking distance of several fine restaurants, shopping, and the theatre district. Great location, since its not on Michigan Avenue, it doesn't have the crowds making noise outside your windows. Harry Caray's right across the street, House of Blues and a decent Thai place on Clark.
