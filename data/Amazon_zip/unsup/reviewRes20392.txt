**UPDATE!** Jesse now works at the Coast in the South Loop. pretty good. my good friend is a head in the sushi line. if you ever sit at the sushi bar, sit by Jesse. He is a really good roller. Sushi Wabi alum.  I do love the white dragon roll also. they also have quite a nice sashimi plate. Yellowtail was my fave.......they also have super white tuna, but I don't really like fish that 'buttery.' I like my fish a bit meatier. Some people think that it's to die for, so that's why I'm mentioning it. Love that it's BYOB. I heard Oprah was there a few months back too (eating, not filming).  beware...there's a font problem on the dessert menu. Some of the items are in BOLD, and some aren't....making some look like they aren't part of the series. It looks as though chocolate chip and black bean are not flavors of mochi ice cream, but they are. I had the coffee....still good, but I love chocolate !!!!!
