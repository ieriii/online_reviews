Who can beat an oldie? Al-Capone's hangout has been a relaxing place to go when all the 2am bars are closed since the Green Mill closes at 4am. Good music, Ok drinks, Historical edge to the atmosphere = Great Jazz/Blues Bar! The only qualm I have is the seating... I wish there was more seating available ... especially where you can have a good view of the band.
