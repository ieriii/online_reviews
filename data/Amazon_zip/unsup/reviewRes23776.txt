I've come twice already within one month! It's like #82 or something out of the top 100 restaurants in the nation. Didn't make reservations both times during a fri or sat and never had to wait. Inside is big and looks like your walking into Greece....so beautiful! And it's a more upscale greek restaurant, but prices are not expensive. You can bring your own wine with a corking fee..but wine at this place is perfect! first time i tried the combo plate...the lamb is very tender and juicy! And the 2nd time my friend and I shared the chicken kebab and the grilled octopus. The kebab was a little bland, but the octopus was delicious! Must get the saganaki, which is a cheese that they put on fire infront of you. Goes great with the bread and wine. Ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it was very light and had a yummy coffee taste. Just love the food and the ambience of this place!
