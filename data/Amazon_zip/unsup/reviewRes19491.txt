After work can be crazy here. I sat at the bar waiting for friends to arrive and was immediately surrounded by two huge groups on both sides and behind me. Give me some space why dontcha?!! I guess I should've tried to fit in and get on their tab! I liked the feel of the bar, but it fills up pretty quickly. We decided to eat some light fare and were seated in a charming area in the back next to the working fireplace! Anything with meat on the menu seems fairly overpriced, that's my only complaint about the Gage. That and the being engulfed at the bar like it was feeding time in an aquarium. But I will be back, definitely.
