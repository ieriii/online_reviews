I LOVE The Publican. The place has a very energetic vibe, with long wooden tables in the middle and booths/small tables around the sides. The beer selection is huge, and our waitress let me sample a few different kinds to help me decide what to order. We had the chef's selection of oysters, chef's selection of three hams, sweetbreads, and an arugula salad. Everything was really delicious. It was fun comparing the flavors of the different kinds of oysters, and it was also interesting to compare the distinct flavors of the three hams. The sweetbreads were yum, but I always love sweetbreads as long as they're cooked properly (in this case they were cooked perfectly). Even the salad was really tasty! I will be going back in the very near future...can't stay away!
