The pizza here was pretty much what I had expected based on other reviews. The ingredients were incredibly fresh and the combinations were very good. I really enjoyed the pizza with prosciutto and arugula, and the margherita pizza was delicious too.  I was really puzzled by the pizzas when they came out - they weren't cut into slices, instead just came out whole. I saw another table with a pizza cutter, but none of the other tables around us did. I'm definitely not a fan of having to cut my own pizza... The Menabrea beer was really good and light! It might be my new favorite beer :). Also, try the tiramisu - it's amazing! Otherwise, service is pretty minimal. It was pretty busy on a Friday night...I'd recommend making reservations.
