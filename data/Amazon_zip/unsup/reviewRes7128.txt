We dined here for the first time and more than likely won't be back. The food was average and slightly over priced. Fun sauces. My wife had the espresso brittle ice cream which I tried because she said it was fantastic. It was. I appreciated the many gluten free items. Our server, Jonathon, was on top of his game and gave us enough attention but didn't hover of us. Good beer selection.
