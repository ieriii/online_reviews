Seriously, be prepared for a wait. Bring a snack along. Wear comfortable shoes. You're in for a long night... I get it, Saturday night in downtown Chicago...no matter where you end up you'll have to wait to be seated. We waited a little over an hour which was exactly as long as the hostess said it would be...kudos for being precise with the time estimation! Anyway, you go in, they tell you it's gonna be forever, you decide to stay, you stand in the "waiting area" until your table is ready then... you eat the most delicious pizza on earth! There were 9 in our party so we got 3 large stuffed pizzas and the family appetizer...big mistake...way too much food! We could have done with no appetizer and one less pizza. Needless to say we have leftovers that will last us the entire week, if not longer! Pizzas were hot and delicious, our server was on top of our drink refills and was super accommodating when we wanted to pay with cash and 2 separate credit cards.  Can't go wrong with Giordanos on a rainy spring night!
