After hearing a lot about L&E I decided to check it out for myself. My friend and I went on a Sunday for brunch. Only a short wait, which was surprising, but great. My friend ordered the grits w. prawns, and said they were amazing. Even the grits were up to par, although she wished there were more. I ordered a bloody mary and the market omelet. Not my favorite bloody in the city. It seemed to be missing something (besides olives). The ingredients were super fresh, but unfortunately my dish wasn't overly impressive. I will say that the greens that accompanied my dish were amazing, especially the dressing. I'll have to come back for late night drinks because it was a pretty good atmosphere with a nice patio.
