My worst take out experience ever....1. it took an hour and a half to get to the apartment (after I called twice, and was told it was on the way both times) and it initially was promised to be there in 45-60 minutes2. Obviously the food (crab rangoon) was freezing cold, I have never received food this cold in my entire life...3. The delivery person didn't come to the door to deliver the food but called us from her car instead4. There were two hairs on the edamameTo say the least, we ended up throwing away our food and I ended my night in tears. It was honestly the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant
