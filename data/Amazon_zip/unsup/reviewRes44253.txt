I would love to write a review about how delicious the baked goods are, but I can't... Alliance is open until 9:00pm. I walked in their open door at 8:54pm to buy some cookies that were sitting in the glass case, only inches from my grasping fingers. Instead of taking my cash for some cookies (that would sit out all night if they weren't bought), the hipster behind the counter told me that the bakery was closed. She refused to sell me the cookies. In disbelief, I politely asked her if she really wanted to turn away a purchaser and informed her that she was losing a customer. She responded by saying, "no, it's really YOUR loss."  Unbelievable. No matter how sweet, the cookies in that place must be bitter from all the attitude. I've never been back. I only regret that I didn't hunt down the owner and inform him or her of the offensive "customer service" on offer.
