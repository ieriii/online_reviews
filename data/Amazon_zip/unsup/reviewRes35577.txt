Haven't been here in like 4 years when they were at the mad ghetto hole-in-the wall location....I remember it was good though... But man, coming back today....better than I remember. This place is legit. Dare I say I like this place more than any other Chinese BBQ place in Chinatown. The Cantonese style noodle soup is pretty on point too. The bright new shiny and big location is a nice upgrade too. Plus $3.00 Tsingtaos and Goose Island beers are money. Next time I will return with a bigger crew to get that Peking duck.
