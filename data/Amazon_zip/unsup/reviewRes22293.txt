the day i decided to make the trek, the reader published superdawg on the cover. an omen in the most positive sense. the only things lacking...a veggie hot dog alternative (come on...it's the 21st century and honestly...it's just good business), and a bathroom minus the funk. oh...and depeding on what direction you're coming from that parking lot is a bitch to get into...a 37 cross street intersection and a moat filled with alligators. a chicago must-see.
