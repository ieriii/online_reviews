4.5 I knew we'd be stuck downtown after the Wait, Wait taping (yep, I'm turning a smug 57 next week), and too hungry to skate all over the city looking for dinner. I was reasonably intrigued by Purple Pig, given the price points. I then noticed a withering takedown of the place on this site by a guy who seems to specialize in oleaginous reviews. That clinched my decision. We had salted beets; endive and mixed green salads; sobrasada; sardines; pig's ear; and sepia. Granted, some of the stuff was a bit heavy for ordinary consumption. (I'll resist a joke at the Second City's expense here). The beets, for instance, lost all their nutritive value in a dense mousse of goat cheese. And fried pig's ear with fried egg and fried kale might not be on my cardiologist's short list. But Purple Pig exceeded my expectations. The "foodie" generation seems to venerate esoteric ingredients and outre pairings over taste and enjoyment. But not until the dessert card came out did I see evidence of the chef's impulse towards food chemistry. Olive oil ice cream...And while the meal was heavy and occasionally oversalted, it was delicious. And the service was friendly and excellent. Quite a trick at a tapas place. Right now, Purple Pig's biggest deficiency is its dessert list. Made in Chicago, I suppose, but Nonna wouldn't have made it past 22 if her life were a constant procession of semolina cream, Sfogliatelle, and Italian pastry.  For $25 pp before wine (yeah, yeah) and after dinner drink, I'd be very surprised if one could do better without losing the tablecloth, atmosphere and pretty young things (That apparently means different things here: the guy to my left was enormous and was wearing a novelty watch with embedded rhinestones in the shape of a skull...his dates called him "Daddy").
