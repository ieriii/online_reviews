Pretty darn good bar food. Probably the best chicken tenders and ranch dressing I've had anywhere in recent memory... definitely fresh and not frozen. The seating is a little awkward and tight when the place is busy, and on my first visit here last week, the service was so-so, but overall, it's a spot I'll be trying again.
