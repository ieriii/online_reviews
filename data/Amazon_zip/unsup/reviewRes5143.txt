Just about perfect in every way. The space is hidden on the side of the 500 N. Michigan building, but once we made our way in, we were immersed in the soft glow of amber lighting bouncing off of the brown wood and splashes of blue, white and yellow from tiles on the wall. The atmosphere is relaxed, with the servers IPod mixes serving as background music. The greeter enthusiastically did his job. We sidled up to the bar. The bartender greeted us like old friends that he had been expecting, and then he began telling us all about his favorite wines and cheeses. From the moment he started speaking, he was thoughtful to listen to our likes as he made suggestions, and his passion for both the wine and main menu was obvious. The food was obscene. I was like a child in a candy store, heart racing as I went down the menu like a checklist. Cheese? Well, we have to have cheese. And some olives. And of course, a couple of the "Smears" - dishes ranging from mortadella whipped with olive oil, to eggplant caponata, all served with crusty bread to smear it on. And for good measure, I should have the bone marrow. Had I paced myself better, I could still be there right now doing that. Between the relaxed atmosphere, the passionate, super-friendly staff, the fantastic food, and the relatively reasonable prices, it was decided before we left that this was our new Monday night ritual. A little bit of goodness to ease into the work week.
