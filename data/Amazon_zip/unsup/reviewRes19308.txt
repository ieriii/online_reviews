I came here for dinner with friends on a Sat night. Was seated immediately. At first glance this restaurant is huge and has plenty of tables. The lighting is dim. We started off with some spicy miso soup (soy bean soup with tofu scallions and jalapeo) and Gyoza (pan fried shrimp and vegetable pot stickers). The soup was extremely delicious. I am glad i tried the spicy version, it added a nice kick to the soup. The jalapeos were not very spicy. Definitely tolerable. The soup was fresh and a great start to the meal. The Gyoza was good. The combination of shrimp and vegetables was great. They were perfectly pan friend and were not too greasy. We tried a couple of sushi rolls, all of them were tasty and very fresh. I was impressed with the quality of the food. The ones that we tried were: White Dragon: shrimp tempura, wasabi tobiko, cream cheese avicado, scallion spicy sauce, wasabi dressing, eel sauce, tempura crumb Scallops: scallop, avocado, masago, spicy mayo Spicy Tuna: tuna, scallion, spicy mayo One of the vegetarian rolls. The service was great, the food was good. The ambiance was OK, for a saturday evening it might be dull. This was probably not the best sushi I have eaten but definitely flavorful and good. I will visit it again if I am in the neighborhood.
