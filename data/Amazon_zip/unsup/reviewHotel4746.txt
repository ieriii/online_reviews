I rented a hotel room for my boyfriends birthday. I got the room last minute at a great price but the hotels service can be much improved. The room was amazing, very clean, the bathroom stylish as can be! However I was running late and needed help decorating the room with roses and candles and when I called the front desk the concierge couldn't do nothing for me other than except flowers I ordered to the hotel which I had no time to do either way as it was late. I asked if they can possibly help put some candles in the room and they stated they were a smoke free hotel. I had to rush to downtown and do everything myself. In the morning I called the front desk to see if they had Advil and the lady said "Umm no. We have a pharmacy behind the hotel" very inconvenient I taught for a hotel in the middle of downtown Chicago. As far as how beautiful the hotel is- the decorations are to die for.
