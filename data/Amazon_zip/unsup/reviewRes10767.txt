Something about this pizza makes me want to come back all...the...time. We stay away, though, during peak hours because I find that the level of douchness is high and service can be really bad (not to mention the place will get really, really loud, and well, I'm old). But if you go at an off-peak time our experience has always been plesant. This past Saturday our server was Eric, and while most waiters here tend to be the quiet "Whataya want" types, Eric was very friendly and knew his beers. Our pizza took forever to come (as in 30 mins), but it was worth the wait. I scarfed down six slices and then rolled outta there. Another perk: $1 beer tastings in 3 oz. (I think) glasses.
