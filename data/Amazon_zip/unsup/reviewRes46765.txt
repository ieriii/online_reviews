I love this little restaurant. I try to go there in October because they have an amazing pumpkin milkshake (seasonal). It's tight in there and you're damn near sitting next to everyone in the restaurant, but the staff is friendly and the food is good. I usually get the buffalo chicken nachos...they are 'd-lish'. Also, the vintage tuna sandwich is huge but the tuna can use a little mustard..but it's good. They also have a great salad bar and the prices are decent! Street parking is hard but they have valet for about $9 I think.
