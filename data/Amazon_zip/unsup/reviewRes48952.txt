Outstanding food! Seriously! Dining out, the primary focus is the FOOD! The Publican delivers! However, the service is sub-par at best, and the atmosphere is so loud, don't expect to have any type of dialogue with your guests. And, it would be nice if they could invest $300 or $400 on proper meat knives for table service. Their menu's focus is MEAT!
