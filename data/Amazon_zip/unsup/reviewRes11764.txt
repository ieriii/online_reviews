Let me start by saying that I despise everything Wicker Park - the bars, the restaurants, the lack of parking, etc. However, my group of Tuesday-night-dinner-friends wanted to come here. So, around 8 we show up and this place is PACKED. Seriously? on a Tuesday night?? However, the pizza smell was intoxicating and I agreed to stay. We ordered a red pizza with sausage and giardinera, and a white pizza with chicken and basil. The white pizza was delicious! Not the best pizza I've ever had, and certainly not worth waiting an hour for a table. I did leave full and satisfied however - our waiter was super friendly and and the service was great. Some of the tables are super close together, as one of my friends found out as some guy's ass rubbed against her back/shoulder as he tried to get into his seat.
