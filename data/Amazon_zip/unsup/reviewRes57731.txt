This place is amazing!!! The service is amazing. The servers are very friendly and the setting is so inviting. Its a great place for a date. Full drink selection great choice for dinner and very relaxing. Its a nice place to set down and have a few drinks with dinner before a night out on the town. I will for sure return and ask for Mike to serve me!
