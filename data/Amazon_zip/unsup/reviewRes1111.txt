It is worth the wait. It doesn't matter if it's 30 min or an hour and a half. Just deal with it and wait! Complainers go home. I'm not sure why anyone would go there to get a Chicago style dog. You can get that anywhere. Live a little!! Try a fancy one! I love the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel!! Mmmmmmm! The duck fat fries are great and a good old fashioned corn dog with cheese on the side is the shiz.
