505 Hopleaf reviews, really? Shut Up. Why do I bother? I should be the one to shut up. Yeeeeah, I should... but why do that when I can shamelessly use this weaksauce review as an opportunity to gain the next tick on my review-o-meter? Bwahhahaha! So the things you already know: * Hopleaf is a cozy tavern in the front and tasty restaurant in the back. It's sorta like the proverbial mullet of dining establishments. * A fabulously smashing beer bar with yummy bottles and even yummier foamy drafts! * Draft beer is on constant change which is actually a great thing. Find your new hoppy Belgium favorite a la my Bells Hopslam right here, just don't expect it to always make a repeat peformance. * Staff knows their shit so don't order a Bud Light, Douchey McDoucherson. * Super busy on weekends, not nearly as much on weeknights. A Wednesday night at Hopleaf with a Delirium Blonde and an actual blonde (ahem, me) by your side ain't at all a bad thing. Some things you may not know: * Hopleaf has righteous bar food; specialty white wine mussels, escargot, steak frites, even sweetbreads. Mozzarella sticks need not apply and will, in fact, be laughed out the door. * They take their wine seriously. Not as seriously as the beer, natch, but the Hopleaf wine list is nothing short of impressive, albeit affordable. Not one bottle over $35. Huzzah! * I tend to get absurdly drunk here. On beer. It goes down like mad dog. Who knew? Take a trip to Hopleaf - like the rest of Chicago obviously has - and find out for yourself exactly how enjoyable a unique and fabulous cold one saddled up next to some Stilton mac 'n cheese truly can be!
