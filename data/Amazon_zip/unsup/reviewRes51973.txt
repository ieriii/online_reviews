We originally wanted to go to Giordano's but the wait was ridiculously long (45-1hr) so we decided to head to Gino's and we were seated within 20-25 minutes. It took me a long time to "appreciate" deep dish pizza being a California girl I love my thin crust. The deep dish wasn't really all there. It was lacking something for some reason and I didn't like their crust. My bf and my friend (here for job training from SF) of course liked it and had no complaints. Oh well, I guess that's just how it is being a girl sometimes... "complain, complain complain..." Their garlic bread didn't taste like garlic! It was way too oily. Lesson learned... I think I'll stick with Giordano's if I have out of towner friends visiting. There is a reason why there is such a long wait. On the other hand, our server was really nice but it took him hella long to bring my bf's beer.
