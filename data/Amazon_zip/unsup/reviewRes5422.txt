First I just need to WOW!! Went to this place for one main reason and that was to try the swine. Started of the purple pig platter which is their signature dish, and this is where the magic began. Generous portions of cured meat and also the everything on the platter was house cured except the Jamon and Prosciutto. After the platter tried the fried pigs ear salad with the fried egg and pickled peppers, for me this dish was close to perfect the only complaint I have about it is I would of liked to have more of the peppers to cut through to richness of the fried egg. Then finished with the sardines which were perfect they came with a shaved fennel salad and lemon vinaigrette. Another one of my favorite things that came unexpected was the beer list which included some of my international favorites at good prices. ecspecially considering being on Michigan Ave. Will definitely be returning to The Purple Pig, as a matter of fact I was planning my next visit before I ever left.
