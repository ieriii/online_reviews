So I just recently visited Costa Rica and craved a taste of memory and tried this place out. I went to their 20th Anniversary Block Party and loved the vibe! The music was spot on, the crowd was good, the neighborhood was perfect. We ordered the following: "Casado Bowl" Black beans and Rice - Good Fried Plantines - Completely uncooked properly. Besides the fried batter on the outside, the plantines itself was raw and hard. I couldn't even bite it. Chicken - Barely any chicken, but it was decent Beef - Very tender, good. Strawberry Milkshake - Very close to what I've had in Costa Rica, Good Oatmeal Milkshake - My bf said he loved it since he finished the whole thing. Costa Rican Sandwich - Good, but a lil messy So you asked, "WHY THE LOW SCORE??" - Although I've enjoyed the taste of the food for the most part, I GOT SICK FROM IT!!!!! (A lil background on myself... I am not allergic to anything nor have I ever gotten sick from eating in my life. I am positive it was something from here because that was my first meal of the day.) About an hour we finished eating and walking around, I literally PROJECTILE VOMITED off of my freaken bike. It was horrific! My BF was fine, so I am going to guess it was either the bad Plantines or the Strawberry shake (since I had those and he didn't). Although I love Costa Rician food, I regret trying this place and I will not return.
