Yes, the wait is annoying and the place is pretty small but I think it is TOTALLY worth it. The food is simply amazing. I've been there three times since it opened, which is a lot since I don't live or work anywhere near there. It is kind of expensive for "street food" but the quality and flavors are unbelievable. I wasn't a huge fan of the soups (and they're kind of expensive) but the tortas are wonderful. The chips and guac are solid. The piece de resistance, in my opinion, is the hot chocolate. Holy cow the hot chocolate is amazing. This is what chocolate was made to be used for. I can never go back to that swiss miss from-a-packet junk again.
