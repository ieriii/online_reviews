I was quite disappointed with this hotel. You are paying entirely for the location (which is admittedly wonderful, sitting just off Michigan Ave), however the amenities are sadly lacking and the rooms are tiny. We had a standard room, which regularly goes for $190/night (although we had a Goupon for $89). The room was spartan and small - the king size bed taking up nearly the entire floor space. The bathroom has a tiny, uncomfortable toilet and the sliding door, while stylish, provides no privacy or sound dampening (hope you enjoy hearing everyone do their business). The bed itself, however, was quite comfortable. If you forget anything (toothbrush, toothpaste, etc), the hotel has you covered - for prices that would make the mafia proud. No complimentary toiletry items here, but you can buy a toothbrush for $5 or toothpaste for $8 from the minibar. WiFi is $10 per day, which I found to be rather ridiculous. Free WiFi is standard these days in almost every coffee shop, yet at $200 hotel it is extra? I expect far more from a supposedly higher-end place.
