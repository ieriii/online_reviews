A rather forgettable hotel, I'd even forgotten that I stayed here a weekend ago until I was going through receipts. Because of business, I was delayed checking in until 6 AM. (Yes, 6 AM. Yes, business.) At the front desk, I was told that they had cancelled my reservation because I hadn't shown up. I pointed her to my watch and indicated that it was still before check-out time, so I'd please like my room. I also mentioned that I have Platinum status with Marriott. She quickly reinstated my reservation and checked me in. The room was just right for a Courtyard with a view looking west. Oddly, it was two separate windows with one of the support pillars in between. After crashing for a few hours, at 2 PM I took the "do not disturb" off the door and headed back to the client. Returning much later, the room had not been done up. I was too tired to complain. The little tent card in the room clearly said that rooms are cleaned until 5 PM. Oh well. Bed? Comfortable. Room? Clean. Bathroom? Clean and stocked properly. Would I stay here again? Probably.
