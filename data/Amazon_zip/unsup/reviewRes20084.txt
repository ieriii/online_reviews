The best cuban sandwich I've ever had! I guess one of the only ones, but it was amazing. Perfectly crispy bread, just the right amount of spiciness, just awesome. My friend just chowed down on two slices of leftover deep dish pizza, and he couldn't help but eat the whole sandwich it was so good. Seating was surprisingly prompt. It was busy, so we had to wait in line for about 15 minutes to place our order, but we were seated right after that and the food came out soon after.
