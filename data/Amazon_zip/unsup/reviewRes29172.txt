If I were basing this review off of drinks, atmosphere, appetizers and deserts 4 and half stars. But since I must include the entree..3.  I went with 5 other people and it was a consensus around the table that we should have just doubled up on appetizers because our meal was pretty blah and not worth the price. I had the catch of the day (swordfish)- lots of fat still on it and surprisingly gummy. The tomato sauce was excellent...but not enough to save the dish. I recommend going for drinks and appetizers...only.
