I'd never had Costa Rican food until I went to Irazu and now I love it! Those oatmeal shakes are to die for and I love the rice and beans and the chicken with onions dish they make. Very friendly service too. The family that ownes this place is so welcoming and customer service oriented. Which seems to be a lost art in a lot of other restaurants out there so I appreciate it when I see it. The only reason I didn't give Irazu 5 stars is because I feel that the portions could be a bit larger for the price. I've only ordered takeout so I'm not sure if the dine in portion sizes are larger.
