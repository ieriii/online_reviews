It seems almost excessive to write yet another rave review, but how could I not? This was a perfect evening, with the most incredible menu I have even seen. We spent four and a half hours in heaven. The service was perfect, the wine pairing impeccable. I wouldn't want to go too frequently, it's too special (and, yes, it's expensive, but SO worth it!) If you go, get the Tour. There are too many great things to miss if you don't.
