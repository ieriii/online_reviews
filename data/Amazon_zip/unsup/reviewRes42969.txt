Last few days all I've been seeing are reviews, lists and threads popping up about the search for Chicago's best pizza. Chicagoans are nutty about pizza; thin crust, deep dish, stuffed, it's all different. Especially the last two classifications of pizza are different, stuffed and deep dish. So much so, that when I ordered my large "deep dish", I said stuffed and was told they don't offer that. What they do offer, is deep dish, see the distinction. What makes the taste good, fresh toppings cooked till it's soft and tender. I.e the veggies have that cooked and soft feeling without the crunch. The pizza crust still has a doughy feel, its not crunchy, its a bit undercooked so its easy to enjoy the entire slice without leaving any crust behind. Those that love to order double dough, doughy, would love this slice. A large deep dish gets you two 24 oz bottles of Pepsi products, free. I thought it was a pretty good pizza and could see myself grabbing slices when in the area. However, having other pizza places nearer to me, I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I enjoyed the pizza with other Chicago-style pizza fans (excuse the expression aka "Pizza Nazi's"), two of us thought it was a good pizza, another three thought it was just OK, nothing special. I see reviews about this place saying, "best stuffed", remember the distinctions, its a good deep dish, but not the best stuffed. Best stuffed goes to Martino's on Peterson Ave.
