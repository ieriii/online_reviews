Initially the expected 2+ hour waiting time scared me to the extent I consider cancelling my order, if possible. So much for that, the pizza arrived within 1 hour, and we thought it was really good in flavor, ingredient freshness, topping quantity, very rich, filling, delicious pizza. Delivery person was also very friendly! took 1 star away simply because I wish I could order a broader variety of pizzas, unless if I missed something. We will certainly, without a doubt order from here again for pizza, and to try other items on the menu! :)
