We trekked to Greektown on a rainy day for delicious breakfast. We had read a bunch of bulls#%t reviews that said that this was an upscale breakfast diner, in actuality it turned out to be garbage food. Nothing tasted good, the cornbeef hash tasted like it was out of a can, and it the worst hollandaise we had ever had...and we love hollandaise. If we had to sum this place up in one word, we would say: BLAH. Food Ninja Rating: Whimpering sissy slap
