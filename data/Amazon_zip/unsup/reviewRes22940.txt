First let me say , I am a fan of the hot dog cart in down town saint Joe . But we were in chicago this weekend and we had to try a few places we hear about on the food channel and Super Dog was one of them. I now understand the diffrence. Super dog's hot dog had a nice snap and a fantastic flavor. So much better then the vienna style http://dog.it made me a bigger fan of chicago style hot dogs then I amd already. Only wish the had a chile cheese dog also on the menu . the chicago dog was the only one on the menu. but then again why mess with perfection.
