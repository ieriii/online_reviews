I hate to say it because Ive been coming here for years, but Bin 36 is really slipping and its not my imagination. Yes, the wine and cheese flights are fun, but there are big problems with the food and even more with the service. Its been on a downward slide for about a year now. The last several times I have been here, we have had really slow service and non-existent servers. Our waiter tonight just literally never came back and the manager had to wait on us. The waiter didnt seem to give a crap either. He also completely ignored the table next to us. The burgers, which used to be quite exceptional, are now extremely fogettable, and are never cooked the way you order them. Did I mention a side of fries is $5 and not very desserts are an overpriced $8? The majority of entrees are $20 or more and I just dont think that this restaurant is up the the level to get these kinds of prices anymore. The service is terribe and if you had the green pile of overseasoned vegetable mush that I had the displeasure of eating tonight, you wouldnt go back either. Poor.
