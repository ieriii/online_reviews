When my fiance and I first started dating, we realized that we very strongly disagreed on the best pizza in the city. We decided on a "Chicago Deep Dish Pizza Challenge." My favorite was Lou Malnati's, and my fiance's was Pequod's. We went to both pizzerias and compared our sausage pizzas. The result: Pequod's is hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. In fact - my fiance and I are having our Rehearsal Dinner at Pequod's next May. We were able to rent out the back room, and for a VERY affordable price, have all you can eat pizza and beer/pop for about 50 guests. Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago, hands down. The crust is carmelized which sets it apart from the competition. The sauce and cheese is fantastic as well. I've had just about every combination of pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, veggie, extra cheese), and I've never been let down. Pequod's also has a decent beer selection and for a good price. The appetizers are good as well (mozzarella sticks!), but I highly recommend not ordering any since the pizza is so good and worth the wait. Pequod's also has carry out and delivery. The atmosphere is very casual and a great place for families, date night, or a night out with a few friends. The wait can get long, but you can put your pizza order in while you wait. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations, especially on a Friday/Saturday night. The service is great - everyone there has a smile on their face even when it is crazy busy. It truly is a great experience with the best deep dish pizza in Chicago.
