La Villa is my favorite restaurant EVER! The food is great, the staff is very friendly, they're open late... Heck, I'd give them 5 stars for the bread alone! I've been there for lunch and dinner and have also attended functions in their banquet hall. I was really impressed with their banquet hall staff. They definitely have the most attentive and friendly banquet servers of any place I've ever been. They made sure that everyone had everything they needed and did a great job of serving each table the same course at the same time.
