In the mood for some Cuban/Latin fare then this Irving Park eatery is definitely a must. My roommate and I went here on a Tuesday night for dinner, so luckily we didn't have to endure a long wait. We started off with the coconut shrimp that is served with a medley of vegetables and drizzled with this delicious sweet and spicy coconut sauce. All I can say is WOWZER...definitely licked that plate clean. We also ordered the papa rellenas appetizer which was very delicious, a little bit on the heavier side but something worth trying, especially for those who haven't sampled the Latin staple. When it came to an entree, we decided to get the steak comal, which in many ways is similar to a fajita. You are given your choice meat and some flour tortillas and vegetables. The steak was very succulent, and again the sauce was key here. Overall it was a very enjoyable dining experience, and I will definitely have to hike back to Irving Park for another Cuban food extravaganza. I have heard that is best to avoid dining here on weekends, seeing as the wait and service can definitely ruin the evening. Maybe ropa vieja sandwich for lunch?
