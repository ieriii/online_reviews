we celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night with friends. service is always superb, even when you go on a busy friday or saturday night. the hostesses and maitre'd (we love bruce!) always make you feel so welcome. they have the best oysters in town--and the best selection too. if you don't order wine, they do have great drink specials. i recommend the saketini, prickly pear margarita, key lime pie martini, or banana creme pie martini. i usually get the lobster when i come here and my husband orders their fresh daily fish entrees. last night, because of the recent red tide issues, lobsters weren't available. i had to settle for king crab legs......heavenly. i didn't remember that they have the best i've ever had!! i'm just so happy we got engaged here so i can celebrate all my anniversaries here! btw, shaw's is a little pricey (and worth every cent!) so if you are cost conscious and like oysters, they have 1/2 off oysters in the bar area everyday from 5-7pm.
