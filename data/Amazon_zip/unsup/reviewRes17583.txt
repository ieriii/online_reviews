I've been here in the past for dinner and it was pretty good but kind of pricey. And then I went to the lunch buffet today... it was amazing. I'm not a food snob and I don't know what anything is called, but I do know that it was delicious, it was quality grub, and it was a billion times better than the Indian Garden lunch buffet. The service was great -- a couple times I'd think about asking for more water and then realize that my glass had already been refilled. Used plates would just disappear. It was mysterious, but still great. If I were like 20lb underweight, I would eat the fried dough balls soaked in syrup nonstop all day. That's how good it was.
