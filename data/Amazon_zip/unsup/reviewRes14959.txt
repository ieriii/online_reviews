Oh, The Violet Hour. You introduced me to the delicious cocktail. Your menu is amazing, well-organized, and never ever stale. Your exterior art changes from time to time to keep me wondering if there's still something magical behind that plywood door. And your restroom lights still turn up and down with a dial. This is a wonderfully classy but not-too-pretentious place for a date with friends, a date with someone cute, a date with a mentor you haven't seen in awhile, or a date with yourself to the barstools in the back. The servers are wonderfully competent. Please don't use your cellphone. The music is young enough to keep the place feeling lively even though it's quiet enough for a great conversation. Over time I resolve to also try the munchies, because they are available, look good, and probably ARE good.
