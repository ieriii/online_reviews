This is a very trendy (well, more hipster), busy breakfast spot! There was about 45 min.-1 hour wait when I went over the weekend although we did have a party of 6. I ordered the Spinach, feta eggs benedict and was very pleased. I am tough on hollandaise sauces for eggs benedicts and thought this one was good, overall. It was buttery, thick and overflowing on my plate! They have several different types of bloody Mary's. I ordered the simple bloody- it had a subtle chipotle flavor and very spicy just the way I like it!
