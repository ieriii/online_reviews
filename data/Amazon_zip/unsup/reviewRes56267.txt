I've had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam, and this is the food I had the pleasure of discovering there: bright, seasonal and fresh ingredients, surprisingly subtle and refined flavors, masterful simplicity. For authentic, thoughtfully prepared Vietnamese cuisine in Chicago, Simply It really is simply it. Standouts: Pho (beef), Asparagus and King Crab Soup, Five Spice Duck Salad, Simply It's Fried Rice
