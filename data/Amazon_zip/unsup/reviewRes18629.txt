Hamburgers are a true love for me, so off to the bad apple i go. My dad was in town and knew the bad apple would have the kind of food we'd both like-- sandwiches and burgers, which i must say, keeps ordering less confusing. sometimes there are just too many options when you're hungry. after reading yelp reviews, i expected heaven on a bun, but it didn't really taste like it. i mean, i did get the standard burger, but it seemed a bit too charred, like i could taste the black griddle build-up from the grill or something. ... of course, i couldn't pass on the truffle fries (my first time eating any sort of truffle anything), but in all honesty, i could hardly tell the diff between regular and truffle, except the 75 cents extra (not that that broke the bank or anything). Service was pretty good although our waitress seemed nervous or something, like every time she came up to us we were gonna bite her. I did notice some disorganization. however, i know with new places it takes time for everything to settle. I did see a couple walk out though b/c the hostess hadn't come around to the front for the maybe 10 minutes they had been waiting. I did see a lot of beer floating around though, and i would like to go back to try that out.
