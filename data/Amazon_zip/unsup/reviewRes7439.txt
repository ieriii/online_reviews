This place is fantastic! The breadth of their smoked meat selections is only surpassed by the richness of their incredible bbq sauce. The staff is attentive, but genuinely seem to want to be there. The beer selections is impressive, but lacks certain local favorites. I highly recommend the competition baby back ribs, as they truly deliver on flavor and tenderness. The corn bread is out of this world, and literally melts in your mouth, not crumbles! Overall a great experience, and outrageous meats!
