Came here for an friend's birthday who was in from Las Vegas. Definitely a lively place with good service and good food. I had the filet mignon sliders and they were excellent. (Initially the waitress misheard my order and brought me a full $$ filet mignon. Fortunately that was straightened out quickly and I m sure one of the staff had a nice after-work meal).
