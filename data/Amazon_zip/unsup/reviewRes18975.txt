We tried Xoco for a Saturday breakfast. Got there about 8:45 am, not too crowded. We were able to get seats at a community table. Looking over the menu in line, everything looked (the empanadas of the day and the aqua frescas) and sounded good. We tried the chilaquiles (loved the fresh jalapenos on top and the red sauce in it) with scrambled eggs, chorizo torta (BIG sandwich served with very tasty tomatillo sauce), and the french toast (good, but VERY sweet). My favorite parts of the meal were the churro (should have ordered more than one to share!) and the almendrado (it was like drinking liquid good chocolate). We all enjoyed our breakfast and i would definitely go back for breakfast or try lunch/dinner next time. YUM!
