As far as sushi goes, Coast is definitely above average, but it's certainly not extraordinary. I tried raw oysters for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised. It can get pretty busy and they do take reservations, but only for half the restaurant, so you can still walk in and get a table. It's a bit more expensive than I'd like it to be, but it has the atmosphere to qualify as a 'fancy' dinner for date night.
