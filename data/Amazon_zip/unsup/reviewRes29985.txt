This is a 4.3 or 4.4 on a 5 scale. The place has consistently good food. The Tiger Cry appetizer is incredibly savory and flavorful. The spring rolls are fresh and delicious. But I really enjoy their crab rangoons, which actually have a crab flavor to them.  Entree wise, I've had many quality dishes, but usually stick with the currys. The catfish curry is excellent! The service is polite, but not over the top. And of course, the BYOB with no corkage fee is reason enough to visit this place monthly, if not bi-monthly. Yay, Opart.
