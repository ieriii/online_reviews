Yes, it actually happened - A vegetarian in a steak house. I'll pause for a moment while you think about the contradictory complexities of that situation. Oh, did I mention that they were happy to have me there? Yep, take that all you vegetarian/vegan haters. I guess I am allowed to exist after all. And, no, I didn't eat the meat. Err.. I mean the steak. Obviously, as it was a steakhouse, it wasn't my choice to grace their halls, but I'd seriously consider a return visit based upon how they treated me. My date had the cheese and meat fondue plate with a side of meat. I nibbled on a few of the vegetables that came with his plate, and the host asked me if I really was a vegetarian, said "hmmmmm...." I didn't think much of it until he showed up 10 minutes later with my own dish of cheese and vegetables. Really, it's the nice touches like that that make a place. Plus they had an absolutely divine salad bar, which is a total misnomer since it's really a buffet (but do rich people eat at buffets?) and the decor resembles a murdered forest. Who doesn't like wood? Err.. I mean dead trees.
