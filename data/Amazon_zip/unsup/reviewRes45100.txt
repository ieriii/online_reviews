Welcome to my new favorite restaurant! Delicious rustic Italian food with fresh, seasonal ingredients. What more can you ask for? We went with another couple and weren't incredibly hungry. So we got the 8-app sampler, 2 half-order pastas, and 2 entrees and split everything. PERFECT amount of food. Pasta is fresh as a daisy. The eggplant app is to die for. The halibut is incredible, and, my friend from Wisconsin who is a huge meat eater said that their pork chop is the BEST she's ever had! (It was pretty juicy and delish...) P.S. The Chen Chen (sp?) cocktail is NOT for everyone. If you like Pimms & ginger ale, you'll like this. If you don't like yours, I'll finish it!
