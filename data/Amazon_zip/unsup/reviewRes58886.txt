Apart from that special-night-out-feeling that Sunda lets you have, I am also happy to say that their food is excellent, while the service is friendly, discrete and professional. We love Asian food and Sunda offers both innovative as well as delicious dishes! We ordered sushi rolls, the pork tuna salad, truffle soaked tuna, the 'toast and jam', Malaysian fish..it was a great dinner (for my husband's b-day) and we look forward to a next visit!
