Lockdown... I had high hopes for you. First of all, service leaves a lot to be desired. There shouldn't be three people messing around at our table throughout the evening.  I get that your a metal bar and it's your thing to play loud music and all, but I feel like someone is taking a baseball bat to my forehead and a drill to my ears. Come on, if you're going to play music that loud invest in a better sound system and learn about EQ and all that fun stuff. Your burgers are okay. Better than average but not the best in town. Your Mac and Cheese however, might be the best in town. My experience has been so unenjoyable in the past that I'd be hard pressed to give you more than one star if it wasn't for that Mac and Cheese. And further props cause everyone has Mac and Cheese on their menus now but yours blows them away. Train your staff better and fix the sound system and you might be one of the coolest places in town! BTW - You have great specials... don't ever get rid of them.
