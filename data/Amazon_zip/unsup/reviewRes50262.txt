Had a terrific dining experience at Big Jones. While the food and drinks (and especially their corn bread) were delicious, I was particularly impressed with service and how accommodating our waiter was. I was with a large party (6 people) and we were in a timing bind. We had second city tickets for a show that started in an hour, which was clearly my and my party's fault. After letting the hostess know our situation, our waiter quickly took our order and even made sure that the kitchen prioritized our table's order! We were able to enjoy our meal and get to the show on time. It's a beautiful restaurant with a wonderful ambiance. It's great for long relaxing dinners AND for a dine and dash (as in my case).
