3.5 stars for me. It is one of the better indian restaurants I have been to in chicago. Chicken tandoori and chicken tikimasala was decent. While its one of the better choices in Chicago, it pales in comparisson to the indian restaurants in the san francisco bay area, which is where I lived before chicago.
