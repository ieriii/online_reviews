Good, solid choice for your brunching needs as they have a mighty big selection. The service was fine and the food is good. I'm just not really in love with the place as I thought I should be...maybe it's b/c there are no bloody mary's or mimosas? And I feel like it's a bit pricey...or am I just cheap? I dunno...but it's not far from me and it's cozy and does the job. But that wait is insane. And it always is on the weekends. They are obviously doing something right and I'm still a fan...I just don't frequent it as I hate waiting and there's nothing I crave to justify that wait. Weekdays are def better for this spot.
