Some people are blown away by Ethiopian food. Some people are grossed out by it. I'm somewhere in the middle. Went here on a Friday night around 7. About an hour later it really started to fill up. Live jazz and authentic decor. My favorite food of the night was a vegetarian appetizer with lentils. For the main course we had beef, lamb, chicken, and salmon to try. Nothing really blew me away. The bread is like a spongy pancake that has a neutral taste. A little uncomfortable if you're sharing food with someone you really don't know (or really don't want to swap germs with). Our waitress....not so good, but I'm guessing she was new. Not in a hurry to return. I would like to try other Ethiopian restaurants....
