I have wanted to come here ever since I saw the place on No Reservations. We waited about an hour to get in, and I got the South African Beef and Pork boerowoers (or however it is spelled). Also, duck fat fries.  The good: I like that Doug uses your name after he asks for it. He did it with EVERYONE in line that I heard. That means a lot. The sausage was GREAT, and the mustard, and the cheese on it was fabulous too. The only thing I was wondering, maybe someone can tell me, but the duck fat fries seemed dry and overdone. Could that have been just that batch? GREAT experience otherwise, I would definitely go back!
