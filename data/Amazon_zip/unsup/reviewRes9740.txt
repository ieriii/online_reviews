We were really looking forward to trying this establishment from the reviews and it was every bit as good and better than we ever expected. OMG, you are in for a treat. We had the fixed price meal and it was glorious. Opened with the Octopus and the Scallops. The scallops were perfect - just perfect. And the Octopus was something that was very unique, but when we go back, the scallops will be our choice for the first course. I had the short ribs and my dining partner had the wagyu (Japanese beef). Both were superb, but the short ribs were just to die for. I couldn't believe the flavors and the tastes that lit up my mouth. For dessert, pineapple and butternut squash with donut holes. Both were excellent and I would have either one again. Basically, this is just one of the best restaurant meals you can have in the city today. The food is just outstanding and you will really feel as though you were treated like royalty. The food is great, the service is superb, and you will leave with an extraordinary sense of well being. I highly recommend Sprout and will be back with friends to enjoy the wonderful food. This is one of the joys of living in this great city.
