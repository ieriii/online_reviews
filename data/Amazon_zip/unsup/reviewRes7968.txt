Another great pizza place in my neighborhood. They have expanded their restaurant and the past few times I have not had to wait. They also have a very nice outdoor patio. Their pizza is very good. It's even been verified by the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana. There aren't many pizza places in the States that have that. My only dislike is that they could use some help with their beer selection. My favorite pizza is the "white" mushroom pizza with truffle oil. YUM! Can't wait to sip some wine, eat some delicious pizza and relax on the outdoor patio this summer.
