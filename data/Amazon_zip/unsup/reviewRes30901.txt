Nana is my type of cafe. Inside its quaint, bright, airy, and chic. Moving past the aesthetics, you'll find a balanced menu with plenty of choices without being overwhelming. I really like that all of the dishes are home-made and stress organic, local ingredients. I wish there were more restaurants that followed the casual cafe style with attention to detail like Nana. Everything we ordered was perfect - can't wait to go back soon.
