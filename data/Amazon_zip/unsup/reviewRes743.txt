One of the absolute best meals of my life! I loved the decor, the glassware (including the depression-era glasses one wine came in!), the staff were *excellent*. My friend and I even got to go into the kitchen to watch Achatz (from afar) work! Every dish left me wanting more. I forgot to take a photo of one of my desserts, which the waiter asked Achatz if it was okay to bring me a second one, which he happily obliged. The staff makes sure that you have an incredible dining experience, and I was not disappointed! I would fly out to Chicago again just to go here!
