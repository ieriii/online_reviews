Brilliant Thai food! I used to live literally around the corner, over on Leland and loved walking over there for dinners every once in a while. Had a great Beef w/Basil dish that was amazingly spicy (Pad Kra-Proh??) several times, just excellent. Restaurant is BYOB which is pretty cool and has a nice old school thai atmosphere that even includes a picture of the king of Thailand.
