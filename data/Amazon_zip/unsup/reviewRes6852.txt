This place is serious about their BBQ. I really loved it. I came here with some friends for my 5th bday dinner, oh.. details, details. Anyway. This place deserves to be tried at least once if you like BBQ. DO NOT LEAVE HERE WITHOUT TRYING THE BBQ WING APPETIZER!!! I seriously think about those damned wings all the time, when running, shopping, bathing etc. We loved them so much that we ordered a 2nd order and almost fought over them - ridiculous. Our waitress couldn't have been nicer. We had to move to a larger table to accommodate the ever increasing group. Our drinks and things were moved without a hitch. She gave us a few minutes to get settled and we started ordering. We ordered some apps, the wings and the hush puppies and both were delicious. i got the ribs for my entree and they were 'fall off the bone' fantastic. I loved that the sauces were on the side because I could try the meat without the sauce to get the true smoky flavor. The sauces were very good, but I found myself wanting more of it. Sure I could have asked, but the tablespoon of sauce that they give you just isn't enough...come one, it's BBQ, afterall, fancy or not. As my side dish I got the cole slaw and it was just...meh.  I tasted my friends BBQ pulled chicken and it was perfect. Smoky, tender, just perfect. The desserts were nice and our waitress added a candle to each of them for my bday. Again, she was fantastic. They have some really nice specialty drinks that rival some of the best new specialty cocktail bars.  I like this place and I will definitely go back. I didn't find it overpriced at all. Actually just perfect.
