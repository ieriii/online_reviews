This is the place that I always recommend to visiting friends and family. Shoot, I'd even recommend it to enemies -- maybe they would be nicer after a meal at XOXO... I have a gluten allergy, and a problem with dairy, so I have not sampled as much of the menu as I would like, but I usually either get the seafood caldo (which only used to be available after 3:00 PM, but I was thrilled to see that it is available earlier now), or the XOCO salad with pork, and I ALWAYS get chips with salsa and guac. And hot chocolate is a must, must, must!! PS Rick Bayless, I love you. Seriously.
