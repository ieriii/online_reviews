Definately, just a-ok. We had a junior suite, with two doubles and a pull out couch, and the 6 of us sharing the space were all very comfortable. The beds were so soft - without being two soft - and I slept so well each night, which is fairly uncommon for me without my own pillow at least. However, the service was less than ok. We were told we could have a refrigerator brought to our room upon request. So we asked Friday night and were told it would be in our room shortly. Well, three phone calls and 24 hours later, we finally got one. Too bad it was too late for our Friday night leftovers. Also, our rooms were not cleaned until maybe 6pm each day, much later than any other hotel I've been in before. Even when they did clean, they didn't give us a new roll of toilet paper... With 6 people, that's a problem. Also, there were more than a few bugs in the bathroom. The location is great if you want to be really close to the Magnificent Mile, so maybe that helps.
