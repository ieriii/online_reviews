An experience to remember!!! We had a 15 course meal with the wine pairing. Every course was unique in its own way. The wine pairing enhanced all of the dishes as long as you don't mind spending $150/person on top of the $210 meal. As long as you enjoy seafood and trying new things, I would highly recommend to try this place once in your lifetime. Many of the courses could only be explained as having "explosions in my mouth!" Oh yeah.. the wine pairings made us quite tipsy!!!!!
