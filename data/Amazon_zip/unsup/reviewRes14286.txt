I live just around the corner from Glenn's so it's a frequent destination for lunch or brunch (and the occasional dinner), especially when we have guests and are feeling lazy. They don't have a ridiculous amount of vegetarian options but what they have is done well; the parmesan and chive eggs are my absolute favorite, but the egg sandwich and grilled cheese are also great choices. The best thing about breakfast/brunch is the perfectly buttered toast and potato pancake that accompany your meal; total food bliss! The Mimosas are also not to be missed: you get your own little bottle of Champagne to mix as you like it with fresh-squeezed OJ. Service is prompt and friendly, prices are reasonable and you usually don't have to wait an obscene amount of time to be seated indoors. I'm glad Glenn's is in my 'hood but it's totally worth your time, even if you live elsewhere.
