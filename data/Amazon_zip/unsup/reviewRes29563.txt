Opart is my favorite Thai restaurant in the neighborhood. The food is always very good and it is a BYOB restaurant which makes it a great bargain. If you forget to bring along some alcohol you can go two doors down to the liquor store for your spiritual needs. I usually opt for the spring rolls and the pad siew and they are always very good. Opart is about average in terms of cost, but you can expect very good food and service. That makes it a bargain in my book.
