Tru continues to be my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It's "tried & true" if you'll pardon the pun. I know there are other rock star chef's doing their thing at "Next" and "Trotter's" but Tru has been quietly producing top shelf meals with a flourish for years and it shows. The "Obama-like" master of ceremonies is my favorite character in the staff line up. He's smooth, cool and knows his food. He manages your meal like a commander in chief. I love how the servers surround the table with each course and present them simultaneously....it's like "synchronized serving", it should be an Olympic event! Our table had the Chef's tasting menu which is a 3 hour affair that includes these highlights: -white sturgeon caviar- a play on caviar, the sturgeon is formed into little balls and then served in a caviar tin, they are over an avocado puree- this was a delight for the eyes and the taste buds -Dashi flan, edamame, yuzu- an "Umami bomb" that left you wanting seconds -Scottish salmon served on a tray of clear glass with a still smoking cedar "log" underneath, great flavors and texture, presentation was memorable -Jidori chicken with asparagus and foie gras, black truffles- presented as an oblong cube, not what I expected but the flavor was wonderful and the presentation made you think -vegetable "leather" of tomato, basil and other spices on separate sheets, served on a "clothesline" over lawn (turf) held on by tiny clothespins. Artful, tasty and imaginative. -dessert was a tropical selection of flavors- pineapple sorbet, banana creme served by a porcelain monkey. It was tasty and whimsical. A large selection of petite fors was served after and nobody went away hungry. Tru is still my favorite place in Chicago and I can't wait to go back.
