Not that this place needs anymore reviews but it's that good. The coconut shrimp app was just the right amount of sweet....shrimps were cooked perfectly and the plantains mixed in made my night. The salmon and halibut entrees were also perfect. The jalapeno mashed potatoes are nice and spicy. And they don't mess around with their ritas. If this place was closer to my house we'd have a problem.
