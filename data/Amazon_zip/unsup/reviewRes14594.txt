So this place was great. The food was amazing. The ropa Vieja sandwich was delicious. And they were dog friendly, with the water and biscuit for my min pin. So good that I couldn't get enough, I had to come back the next day. 2 days in a row you say? That's insane?! Is it? You might just do the same as I did. Plus it didn't hurt that the girl taking my order was hot. I never got a chance to ask her out tho because she left the state for school.
