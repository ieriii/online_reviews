Did you know you needed a $30 bottle of olive oil? Or some fancy Fleur de Sel?  I didn't, until I walked in. I was instantly wooed by the excessively yummy treats, especially behind the prepared foods case where the equally yummy staff will let you sample and munch to your heart's content. To this day, I can't leave without investing at least 45 minutes to browse, fresh loaf of bread in hand, wrapping up the afternoon with an Amex charge of (minimum) $80.
