Wait, what neighborhood am I in? This isn't Lincoln Park? I had no idea this many douchebags venture out past Damen. Walking into this 'upscale' sports bar I could already tell this was a start to an awful blind date. We sat on the main level and it was jam packed. The service was horrible. Our waitress took 15 minutes to take our order but had plenty of time to walk around flirting and making small talk with other customers. Customers who sat at the bar, not her tables. The food was mediocre. I felt like I was at a UFC viewing party. Oh and my date.. He took it upon himself to stare at our waitresses breasts every chance he got and mention how hot her lower back tattoo was. Thanks Aunt Mary, you know me so well.
