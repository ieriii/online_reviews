I had been dreaming of Hot Doug's since we first moved here in May but the hours are not work friendly.  The hubs and I had our future condo inspected on a Friday at noon and then headed over after we received the news.  My coworker could not understand how I wanted to try a chili cheese hot dog. I LOVE chili cheese hot dogs, preferably the ones I make at home. I'm a plain Jane, but do a love a good chili cheese hot dog, so for me to properly judge Hot Doug's I'd have to order something different. 35 minutes waiting outside, well worth it. Doug was so nice and patient with me, I really appreciated that. The steamed chili cheese hot dog was amazing. And, the duck fat fries, oh my god. At first I thought these taste just like every other fry, but as I put down fry after fry, I could taste how truly magical it was. I had a bit of the Elvis, and oh was that a tasty polish sausage! The hubs and I left very full and happy, so we went back today, Saturday and arrived at 11:30 am. Had we not loved our first adventure, we would not have waited outside 70 minutes!  I don't think our toes fully thawed until we finished our meal today, ahhaah. I'm still very full 1.5 hours later.  God, I love hot dogs and Doug, he makes a good hot dog!
