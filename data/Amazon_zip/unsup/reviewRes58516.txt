Just a little background before the review: My wife has been a food professional for 35 years, worked with (or hired) many top celebrity chefs and has been on Food TV etc several times. We love food. Last week, we were in Chicago and had just attended an event in the morning which included food and drinks. We were walking up Clark St at about 1:00pm when my wife saw Frontera Grill and thought it would be great to stop in and try a couple of appetizers before leaving town. We actually got a table right away, but when we only ordered soup, an appetizer and one entree, the waiter became extremely rude. He actually said The salads are at the top of the menu, the appetizers in the middle, and the entrees at the bottom. The appetizers are very small...you will not be filled up...you need to order another entree.He was so condescending. We stood our ground obviously, since we knew what we wanted and it was served a few minutes later. The appetizer (I don't remember what it was) was fine, the Chili Relleno entree was good, though not much larger than the small appetizer, but the tortilla soup was aweful. It was completely out of balance...way, way too much salt (probably more than a tablespoon of salt in a small bowl).We would have told the waiter but he never came back to the table to ask us how our food was...in fact, we had to finally wave him down after waiting what seemed forever for the check (we were going to order dessert, but he never asked...just threw the check down and rushed off).Horrible service and food that ranged from OK to terrible probably means we will skip Frontera Grill next time we're in town.
