Visited on the Sunday evening of President's Day weekend and it was PACKED. There were two of us for dinner and we stood in the little alley way between the bar and the dining room sipping on an excellent selection of beer while we waited to be seated. The wait was probably about 20-30 minutes. They had a killer metal Orval sign high up on the wall that I wish I could have absconded with. I'm still looking high and low for something similar but hopefully I can obtain it legally. The food menu is Belgian-inspired which was one of many reasons that I wanted to go here. I ordered mussels and some kind of stew (I can't recall exactly and it doesn't appear to be listed online any longer). My friend ordered steak frites and both dishes were very good to excellent. I love that they not only have an impressive bottle list but they also have a killer draught selection!
