Lou Malnati's will probably always be my #1, but this place got me thinking twice! Pequod's looks small on the outside, but we were seated upstairs and there was sooo much room! Who knew? We ordered a SMALL deep dish with mushroom and sausage for 2 people and we still had a slice left over! The pizza is very filling. I love the crispy crust and the sausage topping was really tasty. Will be back soon.
