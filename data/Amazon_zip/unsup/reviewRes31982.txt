How did I *never* eat here before? I feel like a very bad, non-supportive vegetarian! I thought I had eaten here years ago, but after visiting, realized I was mistaken. This place is tofu-friggin'-tastic! I had the "meat"loaf and mashed potatoes and my friend Becca had the Ruben sandwich. Everything here is meat-free. They do some amazing stuff with NO MEAT! You know it's a good place when there are several things you want to order and can't decide. I can't wait to go back to try other entrees! The service was great, great crowd -I was happy to see the place packed. I never knew there were so many committed vegetarians. I felt like I was in good company. Even if you are a meat eater, it doesn't hurt to try new food. This place prides itself on being tasty no matter what your diet. I can't *wait* to go back!
