Very crowded for dinner in Saturday night, but that's a good sign. Excellent beer & wine selections & pretty good menu. The food was a lot more expensive than I'd planned on but we both enjoyed our meals. Go for the Gouda-potato croquettes appetizer; they are the most yummy thing I've ever tasted. I'm going to try and make them at home as I can't face life without them.
