Most places that try to be most things to all people fail. Fifty/50 is a restaurant, sports bar, and lounge, yet amazingly pulls all 3 off in a classy, inexpensive fashion, right from its opening this week. It's been a while since I've been to a new place in Chicago worth yelping about, but I was really impressed with how two of the guys who helped make Joe's Steaks, Stone Crabs, etc so bad ass translated their experience at fifty/50. This venue is a tri-level affair, with the upper level being a chill, restaurant space, the midlevel having a few tables plus a big bar, and the bottom level a loungey space with a small bar and a bunch of big, comfy booths great for a group. Like most sports bars, fifty/50 is filled with big plasma tv's, but here they actually sprung for high quality HD signals for all the tv's, so not to waste the full Panasonic plasma glory. Better yet is the food. We ordered about half the menu to get a good sample size, and were stunned with how pimpin' they managed to make casual fare. The spicy wings were made with the highest quality wing meat I've ever seen, with each a gigantic cornucopia of deliciousness. The barbeque fried chicken was even more awesome. Not to mention the pulled pork sandwich, succulent sliders, lobster roll, and, for folks really strapped for cash, the "Just One Rib." The menu has more fun pop culture choices, too, like the 10$ milkshake (that's always half off) and the 40oz of the week, complete with its own brown paper bag. The wine list is solid, as is its full bar which has pretty much any cocktail you'd want, including nice single malt scotches for 9 bucks a pop, and a bunch of innovative new cocktails that all have beer in them. All in all, I've never been to a smoother opening, or been to a casual place that delivered such a great mix of great food, fun atmosphere, or adroitly juxtaposed vibes. Well done!
