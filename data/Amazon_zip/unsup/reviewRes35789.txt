I never realized how full you could get just on crab meat until I came to Shaw's. I had the crab sampler which includes king crab, dungeness crab, and soft shell crab. Yum yum yum. All were amazing- I couldn't even finish it all.  I was somewhat inebriated half way through them meal so take this review with a grain of salt.
