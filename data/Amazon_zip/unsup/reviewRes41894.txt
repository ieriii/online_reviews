One of the best meals I have had in a while. Group of 4, everyone liked it. Bone marrow, foie gras, and steak tartar apps were all great. $4 house red wine and $2 PBRs: Fantastic! All of the entrees were dynamite, house made pasta with some kinda beef, whitefish, steak, and my pork belly was fantastic. Service was good too. No complaints.
