Reasonably priced; fast and friendly service; and good, honest food. Way better than the chain pasta/noodle shops, Pasta Bowl cooks up a dish just for you using quality ingredients. Kitchen is right there for you to see, and it's fun to watch the cooks whip up just what you ordered. Servers are informal and friendly and happy to take any special requests. Never had a bad meal here.
