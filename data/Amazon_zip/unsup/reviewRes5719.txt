My boyfriend and I were there on Sunday and what a GREAT experience, from the wine selection, HUGE selection of WINE, we started with the butternut squash and it was delish, had the Octopus and WOW the flavors were AWESOME, we had the Pork with Honey really, really good, and the service was great.  Kelly was friendly, outgoing knew the menue very well from the wine to the cheese. All in all it was a great experience I will definitely go back there again, maybe next week.
