This was our third and last visit to Giordano's. I love deep dish pizza, but next time I make the trek to Chicago, I'll go elsewhere for it. We were told it would be a 1 hour wait and that we should wait 20 minutes after putting our name in and head over to the pre-order window to order our pizza. We pre-ordered, walked down the street to Jakes to have a beer, came back 30 minutes later only to wait another 30 minutes packed like sardines in the cramped entryway for our table. We were finally seated and our pizzas were brought out shortly after. It was so disappointing, I almost cried. It was just a bit warmer than room temperature, and still doughy. I've had deep dish pizza numerous times, and this pizza was clearly undercooked to begin with, then had obviously sat out for awhile. Our waitress pulled the "it's 'wet' from the mushrooms" schpeel (sounds like they're used to reciting that), but I just wasn't having it. I finished the one piece that was served to me and left the rest. They were nice enough to give us 1/2 off, but we will not be returning. It's just not worth the hassle.
