the churro was the best, however a little pricey for a churro. But i can't stop thinking about how i need just one more. My husband and I split a cuban sandwich and some of the homemade hot chocolate. I have always been a big fan of Bayless. He stays true to good, local flavors and ingredients. XoCo is not to be missed. The line was a little long (about 25-30 minutes), but isn't it everywhere in Chicago?
