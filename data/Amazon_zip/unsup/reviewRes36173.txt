This place is a must try- it beats anything I've ever seen in the much more touristy chinatown. I couldn't believe how great their duck was- and I couldn't believe how well one of the co-owners can handle a knife. She was a very social asian woman who had about the coolest personality I've experienced recently at a restaurant. She explained that she and her siblings were taking over the restaurant from their parents- so the owners of this family restaurant are clearly very hands on. She actually cut the duck for us at the table. While we devoured the extremely tasty duck making little sandwiches,she ran the rest of the duck to the kitchen, where they made a soup and fried rice out of the remaining meat. We also ordered a pan fried noodle dish, which was spectacular, but not necessary, as just the duck was too much food for 2 people.  The price was unbeatable. we spent all of $30 on an entire high quality duck. I loved the duck sandwiches, but wasn't too blown away by the soup or rice. But it doesn't matter, because just the duck sandwiches were enough food. I suggest you pre-order your duck well before you arrive at the restaurant. Otherwise, you will be waiting for that duck to cook for a LONG time. Fortunately, I knew that and we were able to eat shortly after we got there. And this might be the coolest thing of all- the owner actually requested that I NOT recommend her to "check please." After all, they are busy enough without a new frenzy of TV watchers swamping their place.
