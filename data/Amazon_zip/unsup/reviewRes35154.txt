Previous review said the best item was the crab bites. Now the worst item are the crab bites. They are miniscule, and they switched the hots ones to snow crab, but all I saw was the nasty white top parts, I didn't even bother-yuck! Everything else was very good, but I've lost some enthusiasim. UPDATE: After the above review Shaws management contacted me. I'm very impressed that a company this size would make the effort to do so. The manager spoke at length with me, and sincerley promised to investigate and hopefully correct what he can. And I do believe him.
