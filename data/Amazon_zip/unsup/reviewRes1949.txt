There is, and I absolutely stand by this statement, some sort of mystical connection between the University of Chicago and Hot Dougs. Each of the half-dozen time's I've been up there I have either heard someone discussing the University or actually seen someone who attends it. It's bizarre. I wonder if everyone has had this experience... Ah...what can I tell you about Hot Dougs? I would only be saying o'er what has already been said before. Only in one respect do I differ from the 150+ reviews already posted: I think duck fat fries are overrated. There, I've said it. They're good, but not significantly better than the regular fries, and certainly not deserving of the fetishistic worship that they receive. The sausages, on the other hand? Yeah. They're that damn good.
