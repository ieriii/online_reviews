Longman & Eagle is always awesome...go for a relaxing brunch with some seriously good flavors, or for a more intense food experience at dinner. Although both outside and in are very cool spaces, in my book Longman's patio is worth a one-star bonus. The wait can be a little hefty, but this isn't a bad place to wait around for a table (and you can always go down the street for a drink while you wait if the bar here is full). I have never had anything here (meat, game, organs, eggs, vegetables, starches) that hasn't been perfectly cooked, and everything is full of flavor. This is a really fun place to eat some adventurous, high-quality food in a more laid-back atmosphere than other establishments with this type of culinary quality. Wicked good sweetbreads.
