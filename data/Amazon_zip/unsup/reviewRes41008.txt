Bonsoiree is a fantastic experience; though not for everyone. The front of the house and back of the house work seamlessly in tandem. We were greeted by our waiter who works the entire dining room; as it is small. We decided to let the chef decide our fate and went with a prix fixe menu. After being asked about food allergies, dislikes, and informing them that my wife was pregnant (some restrictions) we sat back and let the games begin! From the chef's muse taster through the dessert we were very impressed with the dishes. Flavor, creativity, presentation were all right on. It is a b.y.o.b which adds nicely to the intimate atmosphere and helps with the bill as well.  Bonsoiree is not cheap nor is it pretentious. It is a cozy, well executed restaurant in line with Avec or Blackbird.
