Yes it is a beautiful restaurant on magnificent mile with a gorgeous view. Yes the service is wonderful, our waiter was so nice. The food however...a disappointment. My father ordered the roast beef...very bland and chewy :/ my fiance ordered the fish and chips and the fries were stale :/ for dessert I ordered the creme brulee and you can clearly taste the egg. (can't put too much eggs in creme brulee) Grand Luxe, a beautiful setting but not great for foodies.
