I had seen this place on tv and while driving i recognized it and decided to go give it a try! When i walked in i was intrigued by all the cool middle eastern vibe going on...Sat down and almost right away the waiter gave us all water with a mint leaf, Which was rly refreshing and actually didn't taste "dirty" like most restaurants!...I ordered the Icosium crepe with just the vegetables and thought it was VERY good for something that's not deep fried,greasy and very fattening!...I never thought healthy could taste so good!...I also tried the dessert crepe with strawberries and chocolate and WOW was it good!!...Definetly one of the best desserts i ever ate!.... Overall i thought this place was really awesome!...The food was fresh and rly good!...I left feeling satisfied & full...The service was grt...The middle eastern theme was vry cool and chill!...Definetly going back!!
