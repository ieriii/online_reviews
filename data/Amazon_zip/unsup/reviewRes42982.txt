Just reheated and finished the last slice. Really good pizza. Maybe the best I've had in Chicago. We used a Goupon and got the Veggierama. Great sauce. Great crust, Interesting toppings. The downside is that this place is so expensive I know I couldn't afford this place again without getting a deal.
