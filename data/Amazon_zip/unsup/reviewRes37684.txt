Things have indeed changed at Hopleaf, since even a little over a year ago. What's that you say? You saw them on "Check, Please!"? Yeah. Join the club. What used to be a great bar with a solid group of regulars who knew that it was one of THE places to find a selection of beer unequaled elsewhere in the city has now become a place filled with people that don't understand why there isn't any "Lite" beer on tap. If you like Light, Lite, or American junk, don't go here! It's that simple. For the rest of you who want a stupendous variety of choices of Belgian and other European and North American beers (think Canada), then this is indeed the place to be. Does it get crowded? Yes, it most certainly does. Here are some tips to deal with that: Show up as a small party, like four or less. Call in advance to put your name down for a table in the back, if you wish to eat in the dining table. Be aware that *especially* on Friday and Saturday, they can get hit to the point that you won't be able to get in. Bring cash if you want to hang out upstairs (open Friday and Saturday); there are two ATMs directly across the street and one down the block. For those commenting on the attitude - many, many, MANY times I have seen attitude when it has first been generated by a customer. I kid you not. And, BarnacleBilly - this obviously wasn't a bar for you. But in terms of beer selection, food quality, and ambiance when it's not overflowing, Hopleaf continues to be a great bar, and will more than likely continue to be long after other bars that are hot now close their doors for good.
