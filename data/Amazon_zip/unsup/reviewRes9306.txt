Ordered the chicken soltani with an extra kabab of chenjeh - deeeelicious. Highly recommend the dill rice, and put the sumac that comes with it (even with take out! a tiny packet of sumac!) ALL over everything. The delivery was fast and there's enough rice with one order for at least 4 people. Tried two desserts - the zulbia and the bamieh - both were great and very sweet. Will definitely be frequenting this place.
