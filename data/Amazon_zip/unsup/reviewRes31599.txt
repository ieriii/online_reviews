I REALLY wish I could give Sunda 5 stars. The food is always amazing and consistent. From the appetizers (think Beef Lollipops) to the creative sushi rolls, it all rocks. Unfortunately, the service could use some improvement. Sunda has been around for a few years now, but you you'd never know, as it's always still packed. You would think they would have the service side of things figured out by now. When we arrived for our 8:00 p.m. reservation, we still had to wait to be seated for a bit. Once seated, we had to wait a bit longer for anyone to take our drink orders. Our server, while friendly, seemed to be all over the place. It got to the point that the hostess came to take our appetizer order, after noticing how long we had been waiting to see our server reappear. She blamed it on the large party seated next to us, but looking around, there seemed to be plenty of large parties seated everywhere. I understand you're busy, but really, figure it out or hire more staff. Our food was delicious as usual, but one of our sushi rolls we ordered never arrived and we had to ask for it. I could really give 3 stars based on the service during our last visit, but the food is just way too delicious!! And yes, I'll still be back.
