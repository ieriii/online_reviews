Maybe I am overzealous by giving this place five stars....but it is probably the best vegetarian place I have been to in Chicago. They had so many options with different types of cuisine. We went on a Sunday night, and it was SO crowded. The host was super quirky and fun, and we were seated within twenty minutes.  The atmosphere is very diner-y and full of gays and hipsters. It's fun. I ordered shwarma, which was GREAT. The red sauce was too spicy, but overall the food was good. We also ordered a chocolate chip peanut butter milkshake, which was TO DIE FOR. It was amazing and I would go to the restaurant to order this alone!  The service could have been more attentive, but she was nice, and patient so cheers to that!
