Make no mistake about it, this is a totally ordinary chinese restaurant. By "ordinary" i mean this quality of food could easily be obtained by your local flyer-on-your-doorknob delivery joint. Potstickers and Hot and Sour Soup were passable. Crab rangoon was essentially straight up stagnant imitation crab meat in a won ton. No silky cream cheese nectar filling, just sea food scraps with red food coloring. We ordered the beef fried rice, sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and moo shu pork. The mongolian beef was the only reasonable dish of them. The sesame chicken was your standard run of the mill "whats the lowest quality food my clientele will still consume" situation. This translates into "don't cut your fried chicken chunks in half without being prepared to see fatty grayish dark meat." The remainder of the dishes came in at or slightly below expectations.
