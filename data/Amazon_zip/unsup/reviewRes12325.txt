Piece is the perfect place to go with a group for a casual (and pizza-licious) dinner and drinks. I would seriously go back just for the beer. Loved the Top Heavy beer. We ordered a large white pizza with spinach, artichoke and feta cheese and I was not the least bit disappointed. I ate all of the left-overs the next day before my boyfriend could get to them. I also tried the beer that has 9% alcohol in it and LOVED it. Enjoy.
