Being a born, raised and still residing New Yorker I can say we know how to make a pizza. But EVERY time I visit my sister in Chicago(which is pretty often) the first thing we do is dart over here. Sometimes we get it twice a day or multiple times in the week it is THAT GOOD. The classic pan pizza with just cheese is amazing but my all time favorite is what I believe is called stuffed(the crust isn't stuffed it's just made with the sauce on top of the cheese as opposed to the cheese on top of the sauce). I absolutely love it. The sauce is so tasty which is why I like it that way the best. Last time we were in Chicago I brought some home(we drive to Chicago instead of flying). I have a hard time eating pizza at home because Art of pizza has really spoiled me.
