The food is as good as the place is loud - which is to say it's delicious & deafening. Prices are steep, but if you can get in, your tastebuds will thank you. Well executed food & great flavor profiles. It makes up for the spotty service. Too bad it's such a loud "hot" spot right now, otherwise I'd be tempted to go back.
