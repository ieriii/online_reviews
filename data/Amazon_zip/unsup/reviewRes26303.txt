Going to Geja's is not just about good food, but about the whole experience. I have never had cheese or chocolate fondue that compares to this place. The atmosphere is dark and romantic. It is definitely not a place to go for a light meal and the oil smell can turn some off. However, this place is very unique and very well worth the visit.
