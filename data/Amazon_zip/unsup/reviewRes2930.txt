I very much enjoyed dinner at Tru with my friend Theron back at the end of April. If you have read the reviews - you will know already that you have a bevvy of waiters serving you in unison. Or, as I wrote when we were sitting there at our 10 PM time slot: "At Tru, and it's full, and we have to squeal, 'yay!' So begins the waiter ballet!" It has been too long since I dined here though to give what I would like to give - one of my extremely verbose, detailed reviews on every dish. From the jump, the amuse bouche was amazing - taste and texturally, and for the most part every dish was exquisite. I of course didn't find the frog leg dish to be all that exciting, but the artichoke consumm that followed was not only very good - with many flavors - it was also so fun and cute and interestingly served! The ramp and rabbit risotto - well it was too salty to be true, and just the garish green color of it was enough to unfortunately turn my friend's weak stomach on it's side for the rest of the night. I, however, powered through.  The foie gras served atop a seared scallop with smoked gelee was some of the best foie gras I have ever tasted. What a great way to serve it also. Delish!  The simple with fish in a spicy broth was a fine follow up, not too decadent, yet still flavored-well: a decent palate cleanser.  I also loved the varied raspberry dessert amuse - not that it was necessary as I took and tried every dessert on the dessert cart. We also had them make a special dessert for us as they were out of the one we really wanted. It was chocolate with lemon sorbet - exquisite! This has to have been one of my favorite dining experiences to date. I hope to have many more of this caliber :)
