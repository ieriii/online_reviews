If you know me, you know I don't like chains or touristy spots. But, of course when family and friends are in town you end up wearing a fanny pack like the rest of them. So here I am, walking down Mag Mile wearing my "I'm not a tourist, I live here" t-shirt. The lunch was surprisingly very tasty. I had the teriyaki salmon, served with veggies and rice. Nice, tender, flavor full and would definitely order again. Dessert was my favorite part. The fried donuts.......well, they were fried and tasty like State Fair fare: greazy balls of awesomeness! Will not go back until friends and fam come back in town........ State Fairs come once a year, and I usually don't go every year......It's looking like that with Grand Lux.
