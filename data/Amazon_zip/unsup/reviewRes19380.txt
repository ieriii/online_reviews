One of my all time favorite sushi spots. If it wasn't so out of my way, I'd eat here a whole lot more.  I love that they have spicy miso. Every sushi place has miso soup - how hard is it to throw a couple jalapenos in there and make it spicy miso?? Apparently hard because not enough places do it. I've never had anything from here that I didn't like but some of my favorites are the coast crab and the white dragon. I don't find that the prices are too expensive for the quality of the food and the freshness of the fish. I also love that this place is BYOB and that there is a liquor store conveniently located down the block. Coast - please do me a favor and relocate right outside my front door.
