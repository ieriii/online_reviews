I ate here with friends the other night. The food is not all that great for the hype this place has generated. We sat at a tall bench-like table with bar stools. After about an hour I was tired of sitting with no back support. The wait staff and service are great. If your thing is going to the hot spot and seeing all the people - this place is for you. If not - try Japonais at 600 West Chicago or Yokohama in Westmont.
