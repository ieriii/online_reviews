Upon stumbling past the old Tsunami restaurant, I discovered Chicago Q; a contemporary finer dining BBQ restaurant. I first thought, I will come back,but decided to venture in. I found not only the staff to be extremely attentive, but absolutely found the food to be phenomenal. Get this........Honey buttered cornbread, Kobe baked beans, St Louis Ribs, etc. This restaurant is moderately priced for what you are getting. They make their own sauces and am just in love. In addition, they have a remarkable whisky list and make delicious Mohitos. Highly recommended. Food and atmosphere is superb.
