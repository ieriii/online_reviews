I came here yesterday and it was amazing!  I had the pepito sandwich and a milkshake. The bread was nice and crispy,the lizano sauce was delicious. My milkshake was kind of watered down but still good. The service was great and our server was very friendly! The only thing was our table was wobbly because the napkins under it were holding it steady and were slipping out, I looked around and there was another table with napkins under it to also keep it balanced. They should probably fix their table problem but other than that I will definately be back!
