Oh, how I wanted to love this place. First off let me say the wait staff was amazing. From the hostess to the bus boys they were top notch; however we literally got all of our food at once. My boyfriend and I thought we would start with the oysters, follow with mussels and frites then end with the 28oz chop wrapped in pork belly.....amazing right? WRONG!!!!!! First, they brought us a bowl of what at first looked like awesome mussels until I looked closer to discover that our mussels were DRY! That to me is a cardinal sin. I LOVE the broth that mussels come in and even enjoy dipping my bread in it as well. Well, as if that wasn't bad enough about 3 minutes in to eating our dry mussels we then get our frites and a huge tray of oysters bought to us at the same time. For anyone who has eaten here before you know how cramped eating space is already. This made for a very uncomfortable first few courses. Ok, dry mussels aside, I was ready to try the oysters. Right away I was a little disappointed not to have cocktail sauce but I'm game to try new things. The oysters were good, but then my boyfriend and I spent the next five minutes picking oyster shell out of our mouth. Whoever shucked those oysters needs to go to Shaw's to get a lesson on how to work fast and clean! Next we tried the frites. These were by far the best part of the meal. Perfect in every way! Ok now .....The best part. 28 oz of porky deliciousness right? WRONG!!!!! How disappointing!!!!!!! The pork belly that was wrapped around the dish was completely burnt and charred so you almost couldn't recognize it for what it was and the majority of the pork in the center was pure FAT!!!! You had to search through the fat to actually find pieces of pork that was edible.....and might I add that we paid $42 for this dish. I have to say that I was truly disappointed with my experience and will not be returning. When I have a culinary night out like this I want food sex from soup to nuts...This was a big bust.
