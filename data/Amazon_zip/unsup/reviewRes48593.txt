Great food - tasty and somewhat unique. Be warned that each portion is quite small. My boyfriend and I ordered the: half dozen oysters, pork belly, scallops, and the seafood stew. We originally ordered just the first three based on our server's recommendations, but that wasn't enough.. and we are not massive eaters. So I would say the dishes are very pricey for the amount that you get. The atmosphere of the place is awesome. The variety of tables makes the place accommodating to all sorts of crowds - the two seater tables make for a great date-night spot and the booths make for a cozy group outing.. Not so sure about the communal tables in the middle though. Had the house pitcher of beer. Extremely tasty! But be warned it was really light on alcohol.
