Food is OK. I am not 100% sure, but maybe 85.8% sure Garcias adds sour cream to their guacamole. This is troubling, to say the least. Guacamole doesn't need very much, and in moderation, it is good for you. Why add sour cream? Without spelling it out, I suspect the answer is to add volume. If you are ordering the guacamole, you may want to ask your server if they add sour cream to the guacamole *especially* if your are lactose intolerant, like me :(
