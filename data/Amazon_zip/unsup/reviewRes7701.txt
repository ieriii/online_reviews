The pumpkin ravioli, lasagna mia and veal scallopini dishes are excellent- well, everything is excellent. My husband and I go every few months and are never disappointed. We also have checked out one of the wine tastings, which was a lot of fun.  Definitely try one of their special martinis, the melon martini in the summer is one of the best I've ever had!
