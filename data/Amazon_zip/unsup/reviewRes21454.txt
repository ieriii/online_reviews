I rounded up from a 4.5, We have been coming here nearly since they have opened and come here once or twice a week. Some of the employees kind of know are names, which is sad for the amount of people in here. Can't really say anything that has not been said but go here with an appetite, grab yourself a Victoria or any other craft beer, Chips and Guac (guac better than you have ever had), a sandwich such as the Ahogada on a cold day (nothing better to warm up) and some churros. Meal of the decade, I see some people saying that the food was salty, THIS IS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. Personally, in the 100 or so times I have been here, I never though anything was overly salty. And if there is one thing I hate, it is overly salty food We haven't even made it to Frontera or Topolo yet because when we see how long the wait is in these 2 restaurants, we just say ahhh f*** it and walk next door and get seated within 20 minutes!
