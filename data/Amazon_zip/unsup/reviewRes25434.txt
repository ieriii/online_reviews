This place was brilliant! I haven't had a chance to go to some higher end places in Chicago yet, so when an opportunity to go here came along I jumped at it. Service was great even though we were there close to closing. We managed to get our orders in before the kitchen closed and they were all brought out in quick succession and were well prepared.  The bacon wrapped dates were wonderful! And it was kind of scary how flavorful the bruschetta was. We had great squid paella. Everything we ordered was delicious, basically.
