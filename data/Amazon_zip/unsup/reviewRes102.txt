What's there to really say. Its rated the best restaurant in North America for a reason. Service was great and despite the strict dress code the atmosphere was a lot more laid back that I expected and about as unpretentious as a $500 dinner can be. It definitely had a playful aspect to it and the staff added just enough casual conservation and humor that kept everything very relaxed . I won't deconstruct my meal course by course and ruin the element of surprise as it was one of the most enjoyable aspects of the meal, but to put it simply it was like Disneyland for your mouth. There are very few dishes that can make you take a step back and just say wow, yet Grant Achatz manages to do several times through the experience.  Don't read any more reviews, don't look at the menu, just trust the world class staff to take you on a culinary journey that is truly a lifetime experience.
