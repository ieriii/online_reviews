We were amazed at how friendly the entire staff was however the owner, Tuan Nguyen, treated us like we were his own family. He was very warm and friendly. This was our first visit but my sister, who was visiting from out of town, thought we must dine here a lot. Well, we will definitely be going back and ordering delivery. The food was wonderful. We enjoyed everything we ate. For appetizers we had Shrimp Spring Rolls, Grilled Lemongrass Beef, Chicken Puff, and Saigonese Crepe. Another reviewer mentioned the sauce for the Spring Rolls, which I agree is a don't miss, however all of the sauces we tried were great and paired well with each of the appetizers. The entire meal was fresh and tasty from beginning to end. The meal ended with a juicy orange which was perfectly refreshing.
