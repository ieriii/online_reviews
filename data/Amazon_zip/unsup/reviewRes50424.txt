Love it! Have been searching for a bar with a great burger (surprisingly hard to find). We agreed on eating at Fifty/50 only after finding out our original choice wasn't open for some reason, and from now on this will be our first choice. They have all the ingredients for a great bar/restaurant: delicious food, great drink selection, very friendly and prompt staff, comfy atmosphere. I feel like at least one of these factors is always missing from places I go, which is why I am highly recommending Fifty/50. The burgers and waffle fries were done to perfection and with 10 flat screen tv's, we got to watch all of our favorite teams lose simultaneously :)
