Pretty good, I cant give it a five because I know art of pizza exisits and I love it, love it. But I liked this brunt cheese theory. My pizza was pretty cold when it was delievered though, required a quick micro zap. The mushrooms were good those, great quality. The crust was eh. So basically the burnt cheese made this thing.
