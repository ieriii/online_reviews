So my dear friend and yelper, the awesome Anne S. and I, along with her hubby, created a new tradition last weekend of the bike and brunch. Lucky for us, Nana's is really only a 6 minute bike away. Maybe unlucky that its not longer considering how much we ate. Convenience aside though, Nana's was fantastic. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was, by far, the best breakfast sandwich of my life. That English muffin was soooo goood........nom....drool...........Ok, momentarily distracted by the delicious memories. Anyway, we came, we saw, we ate. The giant glass of fresh squeezed OJ, the fantastically dressed green salad, the cute interior, our lovely waitress who even gave a fanfare presentation for the guy that brought the plates out and told us how awesome he was. Really, it was a lovely meal all around.
