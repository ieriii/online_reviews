I had clients in from Europe and wanted to impress them with an outstanding meal. Kinzie delivered, and then some. The hostess and staff could not have been more sincere in their interest in seeing that our meal was to our satisfaction. We were seated in a somewhat private booth at the end of the bar, after I mentioned that we want a quiet place to talk. Then, one of my clients offered several food allergies and needed to know ingredients of seasoning and sauces. The management came over and spent as long as it needed to see that he felt confident he was not going to get sick.  We had lamb and two steaks. Everything was perfect and extremely tasty and fresh. I could not give a higher recommendation. Perfect meal.
