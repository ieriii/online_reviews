Came here with a friend on a business trip. The service was very attentive, personable, and authentic. The character of this place is a little overwhelming for my tastes as it is decorated as an island and we sat on top of a tiered area mimicking the houses of a Greek island. This is not the best Greek food I've had outside of Greece and when I go back I would stick to the basic mezdes menu (small plates) and the entrees we ordered were a bit to pre-fab for me. Otherwise the food was great and service was great. 4 Stars!
