At long last I have tried Spacca Napoli. This falls somewhere between 3.5 and 4. I really enjoyed my pizza, but was not as blown away as some. We both ordered white pizzas (no tomato sauce). I had one of the specials I had read about on Yelp with asparagus and prosciutto, as well as asparagus and cheese stuffed into the crust. It came out fast, hot, had the perfect amount of crispness to the thin crust, and was quite tasty. My friend ordered another special with truffles and fried egg on top. I was disappointed with this one, the truffles were pretty sparse and the egg was under-fried (the whites were very runny). For dessert I had a delicious (and big!) serving of tartufo.  The space is tiny, so be prepared for a lot of neighbor/waiter contact. While it took a while to get our waiter's attention, once he came over he was very helpful explaining ingredients and flavors, and the food came out lightning fast.  I really enjoyed that I received 30% off my bill thanks to booking with Savored http://svrd.co/pHAC19. It's a nice addition to the neighborhood, and I'm sure I'll come back.
