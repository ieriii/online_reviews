My husband and I LOVE Mayan Palace. It is close to our house and definitely our favorite spot for Mexican. We probably eat here an average of two or three times a month, especially in summer when their lovely covered outdoor patio is open in back, doubling the capacity of the restaurant. We usually order the taco dinner and the tacos al pastor are a hands down favorite, although other dishes I've tried have been delicious as well. I'm not a huge fan of refried beans, but I enjoy them here with the rice and tacos! My husband is from El Salvador and he loves the guac, salsa and unlimited slices of lime here. The waitstaff and manager recognize us now and are always very friendly and attentive -- and it's a great place to practice your Spanish if you're trying to learn, like me! Service is great, the food arrives quickly and is very tasty, drinks are well-priced (love the pina coladas!), and there is usually not a long wait for a seat. A great place for a nice, reasonably priced meal out with friends or a date!
