I had been to Garcia's in over a year and noticed that they had done a major remodeling when I drove through the area the other day. This prompted the desire for a visit so we tried it again last night (a Thursday night). The place is twice as big as it used to be. The tables and food are pretty much the same as they used to be. Contrary to Katy's review though... the tables were not crammed together. There was plenty of room in between. However, the place sure is LOUD. I think they need to bring down the ceiling to complete the remodel and maybe the loud echo will disappear. I had steak tacos with rice and beans... tasty, but I wish they would use a better quality steak... I'm not a fan of "chewy-gooeys". My friend enjoyed his steak fajitas. The guy in the table next to me had a burrito the size of Florida!! Talk about huge!! A burrito at Garcia's can easily be shared by two people. Will have to go again and try something different on the menu.
