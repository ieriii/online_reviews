DELICIOUS! Everything we ate was delicious and the whole experience was pleasantly surprising. Not that I wasn't expecting greatness, but GB still somehow managed to exceed my expectations. What I liked about this place was that in both aesthetic and cuisine, it was city snob & foodie friendly without the expected pretentiousness. This created a wonderfully comfortable atmosphere for a varied group of friends whom I brought here for a celebratory dinner. The menu is simple and includes an array of contemporary American fare and comfort foods with a focus on quality ingredients and preparation. Case in point: we ordered a bread, balsamic, and roasted garlic appetizer. Because the bread quality was high and the garlic was roasted to perfection and spread on the bread like butter, this simple app could easily be a forerunner for a last meal on earth. I want to draw attention to the pasta dishes only because I don't typically order pasta at restaurants due to the fact that more often than not, it's nothing special. However, pasta was ordered on the urging of some fellow foodie friends and it was love. Service was also on par. Servers and staff were understanding and very accommodating to our party of 8. From being courteous and helpful when answering table inquiries and patient to our more indecisive party patrons and later arrivals. I will definitely be returning again soon.
