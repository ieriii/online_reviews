Oddly enough the topic of discussion after getting seated was diabetes, and how my uncle just got diagnosed with it. Such a surreal moment. How did it affect us? "CAN WE GET SOME ONION RINGS OVER HERE??" Not a good toilets to people ratio as far as the restroom is concerned, but the food is pretty good. We had onions rings for an appetizer, and they were pretty wonderful. A softer but flavorful batter, but still maintained a nice crispiness. I probably could have ate the whole order by myself, but I decided to be polite and not kill 'em. Fortunately for my family, I wasn't the one paying. I ordered the "Green Chili Burger" which featured a fried poblano pepper, topped with cheddar cheese and other normal burger fixings. It was quite good. I especially enjoyed the homestyle potato chips. The rest of my family ordered BLT's, and French onion soup. While I didn't have any of their food, I have to say everything they had looked wonderful. If we weren't pressed for time, I would have loved to try their milkshakes, which I guess are pretty renown there. I saw some kid at another table having one. I thought about punching him in the mouth and taking it from him. But it was a little too early in the day to get arrested over a milkshake. Pretty damn good eats here. Though parking is a pain, would definitely love to come back.
