I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The chopped salad is amazing! so good, so fresh and the service is fast friendly and knowledgable! I have been her 5 times in the past 2 months because I love it so much. I get the prime rib and everytime its so perfect and so good!!! The chopped salad is great, the deserets are great as well, they have a huge menu that has a wide variety of steaks, cuts, and other options for fish, chicken, pork and anything else you could possible want!! A huge wine selection and martini menu, I ilke how they have the mini martini flights, you can try a couple different martinis w/ out having a huge glass to finish. I usually get the prime rib w/ a glass of red wine. I would go here every night if I could! for two people for dinner and an appetizer and a drink it averages around 100bucks not including tip.... love, love, love this place!!
