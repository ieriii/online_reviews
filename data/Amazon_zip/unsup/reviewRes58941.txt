I had an amazing experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb...the service was great, the ambiance had a very pan-Asian, New York-like style and it's definitely a place to see and be seen. Every dish I tried, which was nearly everything on the menu, due to being with a group, was absolutely amazing: rich in flavor, exquisite presentation and left me wanting more, but I didn't have any room left. The service was great--although the space is very open, the staff made me feel very welcome. I encourage people to try this restaurant--I love it and everyone that I was with shared the same experience! Oh! and don't forget, they now offer brunch--the french toast with carmelized bananas is amazing! Other dishes to die for on the regular menu are the spicy tuna rolls, pork shank, pork belly, dumplings, potstickers...I mean the list goes on!
