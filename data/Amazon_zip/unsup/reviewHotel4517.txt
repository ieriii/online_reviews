Fancy hotel. However, it's being remodeled. Hence the great deal I got on Hotwire. It'll probably be great in 2008, when it's slated to be completed. Our room was spacious and clean. Walls are a little thin, though. Not only did I hear the headboard being jackhammered by our neighbor, but the walls were thin enough to hear how much the female was enjoying her jackhammering.
