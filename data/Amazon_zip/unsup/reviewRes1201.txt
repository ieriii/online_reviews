Duck fat fries on weekends. Madonna & Britney, everyday. Yum. Encased meat rules here where Mr. (Hot) Doug defied the city's foolish foie gras ban to make sure carnivores got what they deserved. This hot dog sit down joint with the oddest location imaginable - across from a electricity hub (think overhead wires) is the best place to taste what should be the future of the pup on the bun. I love the specials that give me the chance for tastes hard to otherwise imagine always with timely, relevant names. Fascinating posters and pictures on the walls that detail the history of the hot dog. Wish they took credit cards, but with Doug "It's straight cash, homey." Besides the cuisine, Doug - the man at the register - makes Hot Doug's a friendly place to dig a dog. No ketchup please.
