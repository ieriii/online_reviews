I don't know why I let so much time elapse between Hopleaf visits. I went back last weekend and had the most wonderful dinner. I think this is the best place in Andersonville for food, the best place in the city for beer. We had mussels and the CB&J and a fantastic sampling of beer.  I'll definitely be back VERY soon!
