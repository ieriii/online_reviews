I just moved here from NYC baby so this is my first review of a Chicago place because I really liked it. THere was a line outside which is always a good sign to me . Once the ladies and I got inside it was great . Wonderful drinks , hot guys . I think I can learn to like Chicago ! Thanks for making me feel at home violet hour ;)
