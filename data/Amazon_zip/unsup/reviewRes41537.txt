This is my favorite go-to place for pho - the bowls are HUGE, the meat is tender (and they give you TONS) and the soup is flavorful. Im never disappointed when I go especially in the wintertime when Im craving a big bowl of hot soup. However, the three stars are for the pho and the pho only - its about the only thing going for this place. The place is somewhat dirty (but try to find a cleaner pho restaurant anywhere on argyle), the service isn't great (you'll never see the waiter after you order unless you wave your hand and call them over - I guess Im use to getting the typical asian service so I don't expect much) and the prices are outrageous. That's why I never order the $4 egg rolls (only 2 pieces versus 3-4 at other restaurants), the $3 cafe sua da (a small glass of viet iced coffee with condensed milk) or any other item on the menu. Its simply not worth it when you can get it for cheaper (and probably better tasting) at another restaurant. The pho IS $7 which is a little on the higher end but again the bowls are HUGE so its pretty comparable to paying $4-5 at other restaurants for a smaller bowl with less meat. The thing that really irks me about this place is how they try to sit different parties together at the same table to be more efficient. Um no thanks - I dont want to have to sit through an awkward lunch with random people I have no interest in getting to know. I guess some people like the "cafeteria" style seating but I'll stick with a table for two please. Go here if the only thing you're looking for is EXCELLENT PHO. (But remember to wipe down the chopsticks and spoons before you use them!)
