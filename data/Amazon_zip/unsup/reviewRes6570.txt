Let's go in chronological order. You sit down and they bring you a bowl of homemade bread and butter pickles. Delicious. You also get a bowl of homemade BBQ potato chips. Yum. Both of these can be refilled as .much as you want. Take advantage. They'll even pack some up for you at the end. Oops. That's not chronological. So next we had the hush puppies. Sprinkled with what I can only describe as magic dust. I imagine that pixies, fairies, and BBQ masters sneeze this stuff. Next up was a BBQ combo plate. Pulled Pork, Brisket, Cornbread, Slaw. Also three types of BBQ sauce. Vinegar based, mustard based, and another that I forget but it was what I recognize as traditional. Then for dessert...I was too damn full. We packed up more than half of our food plus full servings of the pickles and chips, but you already knew I was gonna say that. The service was good. It was fun. Great spot. I also went for lunch a few weeks later. They have a prix fix menu. I think it was $15 for an appetizer, entree, and dessert. They were the full portions and again...too much food. Pickles and chips at lunch too. Did I mention the pickles? What about the chips?
