Mmmm! This place is delicious! It's especially good for someone who is a vegetarian like me who has friends who aren't vegetarians. Everyone gets to be happy! I've eaten here twice and I was happy both times. Their vegetarian food is tasty and wholesome without being spicy. I love their plantains. The portions are huge and the prices reasonable. They are a little slow. I knew that from Yelp before I went, and ordered take out and it still wasn't ready when I arrived. Actually, they just started making it when I arrived...almost gave me the wrong food and then had to go back to the kitchen. But they did make sure that they got it right, so that was good. This place has delicious food and I will definitely be going back here in the near future.
