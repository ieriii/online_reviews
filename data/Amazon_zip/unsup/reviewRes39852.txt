Good late night drunk chow alternative to bar food, diners, pizza, fast food, Mexican or Chinese. Although the side dishes are good in the main, the selection and number vary considerably from visit to visit with no discernible pattern. I have a suspicion that I am served more side dishes in proportion to the number of Asian people with me. However, that might just be a long standing, remarkably, consistent coincidence. Note: you have to order at least two BBQ dishes to cook at your table.
