We have been wanting to go to GE since it opened, and I made reservations for my husband's 30th birthday. A few things - we were seated in the bar area; which they confirmed when I was making the reservations. I was hesitant b/c I wasn't sure how comfortable it would be; but it ended up being OK..tall table and chairs. There were 6 of us and we all got something different; and a few of us got oysters as an appetizer..including myself and my husband. Dinner was mediocre, I didn't think that anything was amazing. I did however love the popcorn snack they give - asked for more in fact and the drinks were good!! Anyways, after dinner, my husband got violently sick for hours- he didn't drink a lot so it wasn't from alchol and the only thing we could attribute it back to was the food; thinking it may have been a bad oyster. He called GE the next day and let them know and they were very non-sympathetic saying no one else got sick that night, so it wasn't their food...well it really takes one bad oyster for someone to get sick. Even so, we thought to have a nice restaurant like that respond in that manner was not right. Needless to say, we won't be going back again; nor will we recommend to other people. Oh, and it was very pricey for what it was...we don't mind paying for a nice dinner; as long as the food is good.
