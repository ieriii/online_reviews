I'm not a huge fan of asian fusion and Sunda seems to try and incorporate a little something from every east asian and southeast asian cuisine. I've only sampled their sushi and will give it a B- rating. The variety of fish was pretty mediocre and the quality/freshness was decent. Rice on the nigiri and rolls was cold and a bit too wet (meaning that the chefs probably dipped too many fingers in the water when they scooped up the rice). Perhaps the dark lighting did not help the visual appeal of the fish... I feel like really good and fresh fish seem to look very vibrant. The rolls were pretty weird too and definitely had a local influence (who puts BACON on rolls?!?!). If you consider yourself a sushi snob, then I would not recommend this place. Certainly, people there seemed to be enjoying what they thought was sushi... but my table seemed to be the only one that actually ordered nigiri. One great thing was that the servers and chefs there were really friendly and helpful.
