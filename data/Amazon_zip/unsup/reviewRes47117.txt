Perfect! We had a group of 8 for a joint birthday party on a Monday night. We gathered in the lovely bar and weren't rushed to our seats, which was nice, though the communal table in front of the big front window was all ready for us. Great wine and food, lively but not too loud to talk to everyone in the group, attentive and friendly service. I'll go back many times.
