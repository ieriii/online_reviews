Went here with a group of 8 on a Saturday night and they were able to accommodate us with very little advanced warning. The Gage is best described as an upscale gastro pub. Decent beer selection and a trendy cocktail menu accompany a menu that ranges from burgers to elk to steaks. I tried the pork chop and it was perfect at medium, nice and juicy. The mash potatoes are definitely a pass--certainly not worth the $4 for such a small portion of really average mash. Get the fries instead, they were delicious. The burgers all looked very good and at the price they're charging for they better be. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and was able to handle our large party with no problems. The Gage may be a little expensive for what it is, but you are paying for that prime time Michigan Avenue real estate. I would definitely recommend The Gage for eaters in the downtown/touristy area, or as a spot for after work drinks with some coworkers.
