wow, great authentic greek food. I am greek and i have tried many different greek restaurants, but what keeps me coming back to this one is the great service, nice staff, and outstanding food that they serve. The gyros platter is very tender and juicy and comes with fresh grilled pita. The pastitsio which is like greek lasagna is baked to perfection and comes with potato and rice. Great place and highly suggest you try if you haven't already. :)
