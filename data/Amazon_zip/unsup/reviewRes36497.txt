Food is consistent and inexpensive. The sushi rice is plain rice (not flavored like true sushi rice), but the rolls are good. The Thai food is also good and rich! For the price it is completely worth it. A couple things you should know... - bring a coat or wear a sweater if you go during the winter. They keep it cold in the dining room. - don't feel rushed. We had two waiters doubling their efforts to take our order and get us drinks - but they don't really rush you. I think there was just confusion (which happens often when we go there). - be prepared for big bites. They cut our roles into 5 pieces instead of 6, so they were quite a bit to chew. - don't BYOB. They have a full bar, and their wine is VERY inexpensive.
