I cannot get enough of this place. Tonight was my third visit and I was not disappointed. We even managed to somehow go at a time when it wasn't crowded. The place was practically empty, which was a surprise...we were planning on waiting a long time (The last time we went, we had to wait an hour). Wait or no wait, this place is worth it. Incredibly delicious food, with ingredients coming from local farms. The spanish peanuts are mouth-wateringly delicious. I love the woodland mushroom torta, and the churros are to die for - dipped in rich chocolate and mexican vanilla soft serve. Mmmmmmmm. Can it get any better? If it weren't so far from where I live, I think I would go every week.
