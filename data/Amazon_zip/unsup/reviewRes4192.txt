Michael... you and your cast of kick ass chefs, rock my world. You do. I first was here about two months ago. Then, when I came back again on Friday, one of your chefs asked me if I had been there before and how similar was the menu from the first time, (and I said yes, much of it was the same), you then flipped the switch on me. You kicked it in to high gear. You took about four or five of the courses and made me different dishes then my dining companions. Some complemented what my friends get, some completely different. Still visually awe inspiring, still amazing to taste, still filled with your rock and roll, passionate and fun cooking skills. I don't mind that you called the day before to see if we could come in, I know you do it your way, that's how you all roll. Some people don't get that. They may rant about how they called you last minute, they just don't know... so.... does that mean I can have their reservation?
