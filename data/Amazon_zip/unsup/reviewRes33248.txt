Went here for my roommate's birthday; an acquaintance of his was playing jazz here that night. The atmosphere: Bigger on the inside than you would expect from the outside. Good lighting: soft but not too dark. I liked the brick walls and the stained glass. The food: We had the saganaki appetizer; large flames and cheese: the flames definitely add entertainment value. I had the sausage-stuffed chicken. I wasn't blown away, but it was good. The polenta that came with it was fantastic, however. For dessert we had the Strudel cu Mere (apple strudel). The strudel was good, but I thought the gelato was what really shined here; very good. They also have a small Romanian wine list. Their mojitos are also quite good (there is a definite difference between a bad mojito and a good mojito, and this was of the latter). The service: Staff were friendly, though we felt some of them did not understand us very well (possible language difficulties). The owner was extremely friendly and genuinely happy to have a full dining room that evening. All in all a good experience and I would go back to try a different entree and consume more gelato.
