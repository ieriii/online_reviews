One of the things I've learned to accept is that I'm not a huge fan of Chicago pizza. I'm an East Coaster at heart, I think. I have friends who live in New Haven, CT and I get pizza every time I go there. I love the crust and the way it's slightly burned in sections. I think it's some of the best pizza in the universe. Piece does a great job of recreating this style of pizza in the Midwest. Yeah, it's a microbrewery -- there will definitely be bros there, amid all the WP hipsters. Yeah, you may be annoyed by them, but so what? Just go there with friends, sit there and eat your pizza, and then leave. Or, better yet, get it to go, or if you live in the area, get the delivery. The pepperoni is always a standard choice (and is pretty amazing as a white pizza with red sauce on the side), or the mashed potato pizza is actually really great and is a particular favorite of the carb conscious ilk. Okay, all sarcasm aside, why are you at a pizza place if you care about carbs? If you're feeling particularly gluttonous, get the chocolate pizza. It's coma-inducing and doesn't taste nearly as great cold (but it can be microwaved, I've learned), but it's fantastic and gooey when you first sink your teeth into it. Piece is definitely one of the things I miss the most about living in this area.
