Best breakfast in town! The chocolate tower french toast is one of the most amazing breakfast items I have ever had. It's 3 pieces of chocolate french toast with a white banana creme anglais sauce poured over it with fresh sliced bananas and shaved chocolate on top! It's decadent and delicious. I usually can't finish it so take it home and have it as dessert at dinner time. Also very good there is the sweet potato & egg burrito, or the burrito with egg and avocado. There's usually a line so I recommend getting there early or just put your name in and hang out in front or shop around the shops along Milwaukee to pass the time. Definitely worth the wait in my opinion.
