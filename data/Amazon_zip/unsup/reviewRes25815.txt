The ambiance is great....too bad I wasn't with a date. The food was amazing, but I guess you can't really screw it up if you cook it yourself, right??? So, I love Chicago & would recommend this place. The lighting is dark, so it's more of a romantic setting. A place to go on a date, rather than with co-workers after a tradeshow. Either way, I always have a nice time & this isn't a place you can go wrong when in the right company.
