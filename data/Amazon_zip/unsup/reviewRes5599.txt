So good! It is how dinner should be everywhere! Just off Michigan Avenue north of the Chicago River. Extensive wine list, amazing dishes like raw corn & tomatoes with arugula pesto, milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes that will melt in your mouth, and octopus with summer beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde. Sounds simply however masterfully put together.
