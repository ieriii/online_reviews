Last week's trek to Davanti Enoteca marked my first voyage to Little Italy...now I'm devestated that it's so far away!  This restaurant has it all. So cozy inside. Phenomenal food. Possibly the best priced wine list in the entire city. We had...everything. Meat and cheeses, burratta, focaccia di recco - all perfect. I loved the truffled egg toast, although some of my friends thought it was too truffley (is there such a thing?) My only disappointment was the pork belly - not awful, I've just had much better. It looks like there will be a patio come spring time. I can't wait for it to warm up so I can gorge myself on cheese and wine, and then check out the rest of this neighborhood. No reservations and the small front bar is bustling, so getting a drink or finding a place to wait can be trying. On a Thursday at 7:30 pm, it took about 30 minutes to seat our party of 5. Not too bad, but be prepared for a crowded wait.
