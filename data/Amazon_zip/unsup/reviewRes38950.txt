la villa is our tuesday night standard. you really feel like you're at home there. the owner, christina petrancosta, is always there and treats her customers like kin. she gives us big hugs and kisses, talks bout her kids, and keeps everybody in line after a few drinky poos! that is, when she's not back in the kitchen cooking. food wise, la villa serves up italian and sicilian home style cooking. personally, i love the pasta y fagioli, the farfalle with pomodoro sauce (be sure to order the banquet style pomodoro...fresh and light with lots of perfumed basil), and they offer a killer chicken breast and portabella special that is to die for! the kitchen will even make it for you if its not on special, it's that good. the pizza is excellent too. pork chops are great, sandwiches are wonderful too, if you don't wanna pig out. and can we talk about how much food you get! the portions are huge. we always take doggie bags home. AND they mix a mean drink too, not shy with the booze and the prices are still old school cheap. how many places still do that? not many. finally, the staff is so fricking good and friendly. most have been there for a long time. lydia waits on us every tuesday and she is the best! funny as hell, and attentive. she snaps those bus boys in line! we are always well taken care of and entertained by her too. she's a gem. la villa is a throwback, ok? a real family run, chilled place with great eats and old school italian restaurant atmosphere. btw, we always eat in the bar side. it's more intimate, we can smoke, and all the regulars at the bar watch the cubs and sox. chris runs a tight ship, bless her heart. the banquet business they do is phenomonal. we've had many a birthday party in the banquet rooms and it's a great experience. http://lavillabanquets.c is the site to book a room.
