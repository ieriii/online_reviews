Prelude: I made my reservation the first week January. I also realize it is Valentine's Day weekend. Huge fan of Jerry Kleiner; two of my favorite Chicagoland restaurants are 31 Club and Il Poggiolo. I have always laughed about the concept of Mistress Saturday (Saturday before Valentines) and didn't really believe it tell I found where the majority of douche bags wine and dine their hoes. At least they classed it up a notch and left their Affliction T's at home. This place lacked maturity; honestly, there were two tables of obviously suburban winter pre-formal partying going on here. One of my biggest pet peeves is restaurant ambiance that is more exciting than the food. My expectations were not met in the slightest. If you are craving Latin fusion cuisine Nacional 27 is far superior. - Crap ass table - Waitress didn't know her menu - Guac. I have had better at Chipotle + Cheap valet ++ People watching
