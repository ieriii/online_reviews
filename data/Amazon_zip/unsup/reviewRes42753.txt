Quickly has become one of my favorite places to grab a quick bite. The food is hot, fresh and delicious! The staff is always friendly and easy to talk to. I started going for the amazing chicken, cooked on an open grill and blended with spices and sauce that taste like angles dancing on your tongue. Their variety of pizza's is a plus too. You can buy two slices with a refillable drink for about $7. They fuse a bunch of different ingredients that make each pizza unique.
