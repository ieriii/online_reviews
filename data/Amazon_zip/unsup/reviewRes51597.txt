Holy portions Batman! These plates are gigantic. The food is super tasty at Garcia's......and CHEAP! Not a whole lot of room to stand/sit when you're waiting for your table. I'm sure it's better when it's warm and you can stand outside. But this is a great spot in good ol' Lincoln Square. Will be back for sure.
