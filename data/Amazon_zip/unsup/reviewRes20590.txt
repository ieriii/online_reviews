Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. It's one of my sushi staples because of it's consistency and BYO status. We always go before 6:30 to avoid a wait. Great seaweed and Gomaae salads. I love the Coast Crab and Volcano roll. And the sushi is always super fresh. Last night we had Tuna, Bigeye Tuna, SW Tuna(like butter), Hamachi, Fatty Hamachi(awesome), Salmon, and, Fatty Salmon. Cool spot, decent service, and the price is right.
