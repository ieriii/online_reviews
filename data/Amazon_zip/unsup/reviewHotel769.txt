Just came back from a quick 1 night stay celebrating our wedding anniversary (and being kidless for a day/night) at this Westin. Overall =4 stars Location = 5 stars. super easy to walk anywhere in the vicinity. hancock tower is right across the street. shops, restaurants, etc are everywhere. Service = 5 stars. have read the other reviews about shoddy service, but ours was excellent overall, except for the car parking folks who took forever to get our car and didn't acknowledge that we were there for 15+ minutes. We would give 6 stars to the front desk if possible - EDYTA Fizmaurice checked us in and she was super pleasnt, efficient, and friendly. She is the front desk director - if you see her, get in her line or ask for her. Room quality = 3/4 stars. 4 stars for the great view of the loop. 3 stars for the very bare room and just ok bathroom. Parking = 1 star. get that it's chicago. get that's it expensive to park anywhere, but $57 for parking, seriously? Price = 5 star. we got an amazing deal right off the westin website literally the week before at $89+ tax. You can't even stay at a motel 6 for that in the downtown area. Misc = 5+ star. about an hour after checking in, we get a knock on the door saying we had room service. and we didn't order any. it was a suprise of champagne and strawberries - on the house - in honor of our wedding anniversary. that was an amazing touch and had us smiling from ear to ear. Overall, we would stay here again even if it's not the best Westin property around.
