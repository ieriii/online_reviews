Came across Wildfire by chcking out other Yelpers and all I can say is wow - you need to check this place out!! The ambiance is perfect....it has a 40's / 50's steakhouse feel to it with lots of great photos all over the place. Even though it seems very upscale, we didn't once feel out of place (one of us was in shorts and the other in a sundress).  We found the menu to have a great variety of salads, poultry, fish and of course, steaks. Wildfire also had an extremely expansive 'specials' menu with a great variety of selections. We choose the short ribs and macadamia nut encrusted halibut (both on special), along with a caesar salad. The salad arrived very quickly - within less than 5 minutes - after we ordered it. Overall, we were extremely impressed with the timing of the entire meal. We didn't feel rushed...the food came at the exact time we were ready for it. Back to the salad. We would have prefered it to be served on a chilled plate (the plate was actually somewhat warm...like it was recently washed) and the salad itself also seemed to be closer to room temperture than chilled. Albeit a small thing, we are caesar lovers so this was really the sole reason for the '4' rating...otherwise, we would have made it a solid 5. Shortly after we finished the salad, our meals arrived. We're both big on timing....a good "casual" restaurant shouldn't fire your meal once your salad is done but also shouldn't bring the meal when you're still eating. We found the timing here was perfect. Both meals were absolutely outstanding. We simply can say nothing else. Everything was perfectly cooked and was delicious. We would highly recommend Wildfire and are already planning on returning another time for the wine flights and another meal with our folks. Definitely a "must see"!!
