Not a place to celebrate. I took my friend and her fianc to Publican for their famous Sunday brunch. While the food was amazing the service was awful. I was so disappointed as I had been very excited to try this place. We ordered drinks and the frites with fried eggs. Our frites and fried eggs arrived before our libations. The egg was cooked a little too much (we should have known that the eggs in our meals would come out similar). My friend and I got our drinks but her fianc's still didn't come. Then the wrong drink came. Finally while we were eating our meals his drink arrived. Publican gave it to him on the house and later our waitress brought over some sparkling wine since we were out celebrating their engagement and she had felt bad. While I appreciate the gesture it does not take away the disappointing service. Not once did anyone ask as about out meal and if we liked it. I would recommend the duck confit hash and the maple-glazed pork shoulder. The publican bacon was like nothing I had ever had.  Food great...services not so much.
