I am pure Cuban and Miami raised so I KNOW about Cuban food. I am sent what I like to call a "Cuban Care Package" monthly in order to survive! 90 Miles is the most authentic Cuban cuisine in Chicago (other than my very own kitchen)! I love this place and I make an effort to go any chance I can! The outdoor dining is nice. My personal favorite touch is the rooftop 90 Miles sign that is almost identical to the one in Key West. If you want to know what to order to have the most authentic experience: Begin with the empanadas. The chorizo empanada is better than any I have ever had! Next, you must have the Bistec de Palomilla with rice, beans, and get maduros on the side. The flank steak has consistently been delicious. Finally, end your meal with a dessert either Flan or the Guava con Queso. I personally love the Guava con Queso because that is a very rare dish to find outside of Miami. Also, wash the meal down with a Materva!
