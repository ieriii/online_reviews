What more can be said about Frontera that hasn't been said before. The food combines the best of authenticity with the nuevo cuisine styles of Rick Bayless. The drinks are ridiculous. The Golden Margarita (the standard) is better than any that I have had. The service is very helpful (although the Topolobompo service is something to behold, and just across the restaurant). My only qualm is that I can never get a seat here. Seriously, why can't we take some reservations for groups smaller than 6?
