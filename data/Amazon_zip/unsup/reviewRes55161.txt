The BBQ, service and atmosphere at Chicago q is out of this world! My group ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppy appetizer which blew our minds with the slightly spicy and fluffy flavor. The picture on their website of these delicious puppies is enough to make you drool. You are also served a delicious pickel appetizer as well as some southern spiced chips. I ordered the kobe sliced brisket with a side of poblano cheddar corn bread and I couldn't have been more delighted with my choice. The beef was smoked to perfection and the array of sauces brought to table made for a fun mix-and-match of tastes. My entire group was highly pleased with our selections of food and drink.What truly made Chicago q stand out was the attentive, knowledgeable and passionate wait staff on a crowed Saturday night. Our waiter suggested pairings of food and drink, had extensive knowledge about each bourbon on the list and was prompt from us being seated to wishing us well as we left with full bellies and a positive taste from this upscale restaurant.
