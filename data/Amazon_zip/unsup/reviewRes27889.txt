I read a blip in one of the freebie DC papers that named Frontera Grill the best restaurant in the USA, so I just had to check it out! Although the drinks, service and food were all good, I'm still trying to figure out what makes it the best restaurant in the country! Unfortunately, the article didn't specify what the accolade was based on. I will say the chips and guacamole were really good, don't miss out on those!  Frontera was good, but there are so many great food choices in Chicago.
