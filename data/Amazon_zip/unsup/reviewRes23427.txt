I have now also been to the Chinatown location with a group of 7~. It gave me the chance to try a few others things, but nothing was mentionable other than what I always order (detailed in other review). The service was as good as the other location, however there was a hair in our kimchi. It was replaced, but it was tough to get the appetite back. I still recommend it. One of the better Chinese/Szechuan restaurants in the Chicago area.
