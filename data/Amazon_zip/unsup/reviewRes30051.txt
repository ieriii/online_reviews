im actually a big fan of this place for a few things... 1. the expectation that a real well known chef in chicago is going to deliver a solid meal 2. the hope that maybe one day i actually grow a pair and go to topolabamba 3. the jicama salad 4. the huevos rancheros or any breakfast option they have i guess what id do if i was you..is sit in the bar area..its double the size of the dining room and its first come first serve..the chips and salsa are a 4 star..but they do not ever give you enough...i am a huge fan of any breakfast dish they cook there and you must get the jicama salad..its perfect spice..the drinks are pretty small..but the ice tea is good...its a loud and energetic atmosphere and i nominate the waiter that i always get for one of the best in chicago...once i figure out his name i will throw it up here..he's top notch..the decor is cool...the menu is small but its a secondary restaurant to its mothership downstairs..i cant speak for that since i havent been yet..but i hear that its really good..dont go here for tacos..i made that mistake one time..they are overpriced and small...but do come here to try their dishes from the yucatan..these are actually good.
