Best Korean I've had in Chicago, perhaps anywhere.Authentic cuisine and ambience, incredibly generous portions, and reasonable prices.Wait staff are ethnic Korean, so do not expect a lot of chit chat. Decide what you want, order, and stand back or get singed by the hot coals dumped in the hole at the center of your table.They're open 5 a.m. to midnight (no kidding!)Eatent there three times in last month, and am having our Climb For A Cause VIP Party there on 2/27/10.Only downside: if you plan on being with a loved one afterwards, keep the windows wide open or plan on an evening on the couch.
