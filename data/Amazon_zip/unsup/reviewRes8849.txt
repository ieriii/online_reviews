Honestly if people do not like this pizza then there is an issue and you don't know the 'real thing'. Sure Chicago style pizza is good but having originated and lived in Napoli itself this is the closest thing you will get to it. People complaining about soggy pizza? and charred crust? GET REAL! It is absolutely amazing. The owner is such a nice guy, the people who wait on you are just there to bring your food and answer questions, they aren't really into small talk which personally I like because I hate the overly agressive wait staff that I see at other restaurants it makes me uncomfortable when it's too much. Anyways, the tiramisu is unreal also and they have pizza to go which is good when you just want to scarf it down on the go : ). It's Friday! That means i'll make my down here tonight I think.
