We've stayed there twice and suggested to several people. Good location and good price. The bad part is you have to ride from the lobby to the 15th floor just to get to the hotel lobby and then you ride another to your room floor. I did enjoy the bar. The view is great, the drinks were good and Aaron was an awesome bartender!
