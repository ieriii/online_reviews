Really wonderful food is new and exciting neighborhood. I have lived in Pilsen for a while and it's fun to venture to restaurants nearby. I've been here for brunch and dinner - both are great but dinner was even better. The pork shoulder with bacon grits was to die for - partially because my I left with my arteries slightly more clogged than when I entered but mostly because it was OUTSTANDING. A friend ordered the gumbo which again, was out of this world. The flavors were not very short of an orgasm in my mouth.
