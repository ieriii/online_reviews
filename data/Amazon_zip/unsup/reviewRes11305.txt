My friend and I were in town on a glamorous mid-February Chicago holiday and came to Bongo Room for breakfast. I ordered the pear tartine pancakes: buttermilk pancakes with carmelized pear slices baked onto the surface, then covered with this caramel-butterscotch-ish sauce, with french vanilla heavy cream on the side. The pancakes were thicker than most pancakes - all the better to hold up to the sauce and cream slathered on them, I guess. The dish was one pinch of sugar away from being too sweet, but it didn't quite cross the line. It's a lot of breakfast though, and afterwards I thought I would throw up. But I kept it together. So don't go here if you plan on eating anything else the rest of the day. Also, for all you fellow tourists out there, if you're thinking of making it morning and grabbing some breakfast then shopping around Wicker Park a bit, go later. We finished breakfast at 10 am and most of the shops were closed. It seemed like were were a few hours too early.
