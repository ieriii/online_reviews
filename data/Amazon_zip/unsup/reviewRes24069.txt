Love their veggie dish - can't find the same great veggies at other Greek places. Love the free valet and excellent service. Don't waste your time trying the Lombard, IL location - it's sub-par to the downtown location and I believe they were out of bread or was it chicken kabobbs - can't remember which, but my fiance and I were disappointed when we went there!
