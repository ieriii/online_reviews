I had a wonderful brunch here while on vacation in Chicago. I ate around 10:30/11 and was sated throughout my flight back to Boston--the ultimate test for brunch!  I loved the ambience here, and what I actually ordered was very good--I had a breakfast burrito with potatoes and chorizo (that rhymes!) However, I did have some order envy when I saw what my sister and friends got. My friend Erica had red velvet pancakes, complete with cream cheese frosting, and my sister had french toast with a literal tower of assorted fresh berries. I'll just have to come back to try everything else!
