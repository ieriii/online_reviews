YOU MUST MAKE A RESERVATION... even on the weekdays. coast is very delicious. why do i love the ginger salad so much? it's only spring mix with a very yummy, fresh, light ginger dressing -- but, i still can't help but order it every time i go. BYOW. none of the following will disappoint: *spicy crunchy tuna *seaweed salad *sweet potato tempura roll *unagi (eel) *mochi ice cream *oshinko
