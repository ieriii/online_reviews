This place was excellent and I'm a fan -- oh wait, that's what 4 stars means, right? I went with a Coast-extraordinaire and she told us what's good and how we can order special rolls not necessarily listed on the menu. Bonus: The waiter actually knew the menu and could tell you anything you wanted to know and offer up some tasty recommendations. I had the jalapeno miso soup, sunny side shitake (which was surprisingly tasty), a few of the posted rolls/non-rolls (including the sliders? I think). It's unfortunate I cannot remember what I had. If I find the receipt, I'll update. Let's just say presentation, freshness, service, price, and BYOB is all pretty fab!
