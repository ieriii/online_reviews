Tried it for the first time last night. Excellent food. Service was OK and water glass was kept full. We had drinks, main course and dessert. Everything was entirely perfect. (I don't recall the names from the menu, but my wife's dinner was vegetarian fajitas, mine was almond crusted fish.) However, this place isn't traditional Cuban... maybe Nouveau Cuban would be a better description.
