Went on Publican's 2nd night of business, when the kinks were in full form. They took the spirit of Avec and tried to force it in a room 4 times the size, which doesn't work too well. The never-ending shared wood tables make you feel like a guest at the Last Supper. Then there are the weird enclosed stalls that border the room, which have swing doors you'd find in a barn. Maybe they'd look cooler if the room wasn't so bizarrely well lit. The food was disappointing. The oysters were ok. They ran out of the Dungeness crab, which was upsetting. The steak tartar was ridiculously salty. I was actually in heaven for a couple seconds since I'm a huge salt addict. To the point where I make individual salt piles and dip all food directly in them to get maximum potency. But it was too much for even me. Hoping the clumsiness of a line cook is to blame. The seafood stew was relatively good, though it was served in a full size pot with a larger then life spatula. Not really cool, just comical. The communal sinks outside the bathroom are fantastic, if you're in the area and looking for an unorthodox pit stop. Considering the all star team involved, the restaurant will only flourish in time.
