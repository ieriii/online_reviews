Too many tourists and I really feel like this place is over hyped. I mean it's decent pizza and you a solid sense of what Chicago style pizza is but it simply didn't blow me away. I probably won't be going back here with so many other options for pizza. The deep dish is a less quality than a few other joints but the thin crust is solid but nothing to write home about. Possibly this spot gets a ton of business because of it's location and they skimp on ingredients or cooking times. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not what I was hoping for
