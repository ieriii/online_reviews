I have been to Cafe 28 a few times now, once for lunch and the other occasions for weekend brunch. The cuisine has consistently been well above average and it is a great venue if you are not in the mood for a run of the mill brunch menu. In addition to have some standard brunch items such as omelets and pancakes they have several more exotic offerings, featuring Cuban fare. If you still want pancakes, but want to try something different they have Caribbean Banana Pancakes. If you want something on the savory side, my favorite menu item is the Cuban Steak Sandwich; the meat is quite good and not the typical inferior low quality steak often used in steak sandwiches. This steak is good enough to stand alone. I also always order a side of their plantains here (Platanos Maduros), they are sooooo good. The empanadas make for a great appetizer. In addition to having a stellar menu, the ambiance at Cafe 28 is pretty nice and the service has generally been pretty good as well. There is a nice outdoor patio when the weather cooperates. They have a full bar and serve some tasty bloody Mary's during brunch and the coffee is quite good (and strong) to boot. The price is a tad steeper than most brunch locales, but just by a couple of bucks and the quality of the food makes it well worth the nominal increased cost.
