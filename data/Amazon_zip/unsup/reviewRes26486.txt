This is an amazing culinary experience! I can't believe I have lived in the south loop this long without trying Mercat a la Planxa. The highlights were this delicious salad with spinach, Serrano ham, fresh figs, lardon, and other yummy bits...sweet, savory and delicious; mushrooms with lots of butter, garlic, and some potato and onion; and the a la planxa scallops. The sangria was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxing yet you feel like you are out to dine well, and the service was very nice. I will go back and enjoy this gem again now that know how delicious it is!
