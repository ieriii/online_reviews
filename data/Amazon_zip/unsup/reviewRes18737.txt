A nice, unpretentious, sort of hip gastro-pub. The selection of beers is amazing and changes frequently. The food has always been very good - they specialize in burgers, but their pork dishes are quite nice too. You won't go away hungry from Bad Apple...I do recommend that you fork over the 8 bucks and try the deep fried cheese curds...unbelievable. This place is good for a casual date, a night out with the guys or the girls, mixed groups etc...we did New Years eve there last year and I thought it was quite a reasonable package deal and a fair amount of fun. I would certainly do it again
