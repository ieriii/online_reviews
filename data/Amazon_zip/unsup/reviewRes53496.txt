My friend dragged me to this place for lunch because she said it was incredible and it was...an incredible wait. I stood in line for almost 30 minutes for a hot dog. These people who wait here are nuts. I don't see how this is any better or worse then other hot dog joints. I chalk it up to herd mentality.
