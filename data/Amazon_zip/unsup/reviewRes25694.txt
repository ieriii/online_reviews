Came during lunch and ordered the lunch special: 7 inch personal pizza with one topping and a soft drink or miller lite draft for $5. Available weekdays btwn 11 and 3 or 4. Ok for this price this place automatically gets 3 stars. Freakin' steal. I was very excited to come here because Pequod's is frequently mentioned as one of the best deep dishes in town, especially by locals and by people who know pizza. Sure if you are visiting for a weekend you might want to try some of the more famous pizzerias but if you've done all that, Pequod's is a must try. So I tried... "OMG OMG." That's the reaction I wanted to have when I ate the pizza. But I didn't. It was a very good and solid pizza but it was missing the magical "wtf" moment that I had when I first bit into my pizza at Lou's or Uno's. Each bite didn't make me crave the next here. I think it's the crust. It wasn't special enough. Good but not special. I won't walk away remembering how great the crust is, and that's not good considering the incredible amount of competition in Chicago. Overall, a very good and solid pizza, and would be my go-to place if I were anywhere else but Chicago. But because I am in Chicago, I don't think I'll really ever hunt this place down again.
