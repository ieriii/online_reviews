We've been to Frontera numerous times and the food is amazing!  You cannot go wrong with any of the dishes! The waitstaff is super informative about everything (Rick sometimes makes guest appearances at your table). The margaritas are one of the best! And a must do for dessert is their chocolate pecan pie.  The only thing I don't like is that they no longer take reservations and the wait time could be ridiculously long (go EARLY!), but the food is worth it. Oh and FYI - the chile rellenos are not on their menu (they are awesome). I believe they only make 5 a night, so act fast!
