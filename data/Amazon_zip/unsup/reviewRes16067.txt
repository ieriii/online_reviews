I am a self proclaimed hater of hard alcohol. My roommate and I collect half used bottles of vodka for months after parties because I would rather use it to clean with. However, Violet Hour has made me appreciate that liquor can be delicious.  The seating is intimate, so I suggest limiting your group to four people who you really actually want to talk to. Also probably a great date location. Go on an off hour or evening or there will be a wait.
