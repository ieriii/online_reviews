This is a very colorful, vibrant restaurant with two large outdoor seating areas. Although it was very hot the evening that we came here, there were many fans and it was very pleasant. We brought a bottle of wine and ordered the sangria mixer (very good!) Food-wise, it was a very tasty meal. Not the best Cuban I've ever had (ba-dum-dum), but I would definitely come back, especially for the outdoor dining. We sampled the wanna be cuban and chorpian appetizers, as well as the churrasco. My favorite was the wanna be cuban: a portabella mushroom topped with ground beef, beans, and cheese. The waiter was very friendly and helpful with menu selections. Too full for dessert. Boo.
