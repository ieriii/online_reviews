Long, long ago, Garcia's was my favorite, go-to Mexican restaurant in the city. This is before I knew about neighborhoods like Pilsen, hole in the wall taquerias or new joints like Los Nopales. My best friend and I would stuff our faces with chips and salsa and sip on their delicious horchata, which is the closest thing to a dessert drink as the oatmeal shakes from Irazu. I would ALWAYS get the enchiladas suizas with either chicken or steak. You get FOUR, slathered in creamy tomato based sauce and melted cheese. I hadn't been in a good two years, mostly because I've grown fond of other Mexican restaurants. But the other day, with a craving for al pastor tacos, I decided to go with my boyfriend on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. With tummies grumbling, we inhaled a small guacamole. It was a little too smooth for my taste and kinda bland...not enough salt or kick. He had a steak chimichanga, which he enjoyed. I was happy with my two al pastor tacos. However, the rice and beans, much like the guacamole, were pretty bland. So there you have it. The entrees are great, the horchata is dreamy, the chips are great, the sides and guacamole are "meh".
