I've been eating at Opart for seven years now and I think it is the best Thai food in the city. Their Pad Ki Mao is the standard I judge all others by. The noodles are thick and have perfect texture while the beef manages to be both thin and juicy. I have been impressed with everything I have eaten from Opart, and I've eaten a lot of their dishes. Every employee I've ever dealt with here has been friendly and helpful. Plus they are BYOB, which is great. Their food holds up well as take-out too.
