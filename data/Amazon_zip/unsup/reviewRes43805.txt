Just so everyone knows, the owner of Kinzie personally contacted us to explain that our issues were server related. She went above and beyond and we will be giving Kinzie another shot and we will update this review again when we get a chance to head to Chicago. We really appreciated Susan really listening to our concerns. She truly cares about her customers!
