Excellent selection of beers, especially lambic. They had some lambic that wasn't the usual Lindemans brand, which I thought was pretty cool.  Tried the brisket as well. Great tasting beef, with flavorful mac and cheese to go with it.  If you go with a group, they don't do separate checks, so be prepared.
