Here's the lowdown on Hot Doug's. Live it and preach it, my friends. Skip the weekend mecca. The lines are too long and the duck fat fries are overrated - there, I said it! Simply put, they are not sufficiently different in flavor from regular fries to justify the longer lines. If you want great tasting fries in exotic animal fat, go to Longman & Eagle any day of the week and get the beef tallow fries. That, my friends, is flavor. Instead, take a weekday off; I recommend Wednesday to bisect the workaday grind. Order a duck sausage dolloped in foie gras butter; not simply because such an order was briefly illegal, but because it is DELICIOUS. The gorgeous flavor comes mostly from the Sauternes sauce, which provides a sweet balance to the smokiness of the duck. Skip the fries completely and choose a second game sausage - the buffalo and elk combination with cheddar cheese is an excellent choice if Doug has it on the menu. But any random wild animal will do. Consume said sausages with a root beer, and go home for a well deserved afternoon nap. Wake up and get game at Longman & Eagle or RevBrew. Rinse and repeat. America, what a country!
