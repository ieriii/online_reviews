breakfast ! at uncommon grounds on Devon ! my first time there and it is nice but a tad expensive ! I was going to go to a Sunday brunch but at the last moment got intimidated by the crowded parking lot ! today the lot was empty in fact I even wondered if they were open ! I had a Montana omelette  allegedly with bacon and onions and cheese - mostly cheese ! a two egger there were potatoes on the side  with just a hint of garlic  and I had the house coffee a hearty robust coffee ! cream came in a tiny dollhouse sized mini silver pitcher looking for all the worlds like something from a child's play tea set ! OH and I had the sourdough bread toast (one slice - two points )  which was delightful ! 15 bucks for a two egg omelette toast potatoes and coffee is just a tad outta my price range but ...I am worth it ! the restaurant itself is lovely lots of local artist paintings hanging on their walls ( for sale no doubt) the rooms are a warm brown  chairs are comfy  and I sat at a booth back area  very comfy ! one note I was surprised  at the heavy weight of the silverware ! big but not clunky and the wait staff ! the boy (Peter) was young well built and good looking ! flat belly and pecs and very sweet to an old codger like me he really worked this old man for a tip I was generous to a fault indeed even to the point of hiding a folded dollar under the coffee cup ! hope that he found THAT winky flirt ! there is more to this place  there is a very nice wooden bar area and  a venue area for live music  and nice fireplaces too !
