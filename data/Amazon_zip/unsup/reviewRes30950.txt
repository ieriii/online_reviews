I'm glad this place exists. It's not the best brunch I've had, it's not the best lunch or dinner, but it's vegetarian or vegan friendly.  I like that it's in Lakeview, but roll my eyes at the amount of skinny jeans complaining about not getting a seat or having to wait.  Hello! It's sunday brunch, kids! YOU GOTTA WAIT.  by the way... the peanut butter chocoate cookie dough shake is on a short list of the best stuff on earth.
