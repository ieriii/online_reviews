I feel like this hotel should be rated much better in hotel class and overall rating than it is. I think very little credit is given where it's due because this is quite a nice place to stay. It has a fantastic location, the rooms are comfortably roomy for a city hotel and the price is literally just right. I was here for a week and I felt absolutely comfortable and happy to stay here. The room service was impeccable and very consistent, the bed was ultra comfortable, the showers were pretty awesome. The only complaint is that their toilets are so high off the ground. You know what I'm talking about ... The staff is friendly, the lobby is small but cozy. The bar at the lobby is nice and they have free wifi in the lobby. The bell men take extra good care of your bags when you need help or to check them in and I only paid a small price for being right around the corner from Louis Vuitton and Gucci every, single, day. I should take that back, I actually ended up losing 90% of my wallet contents inside LV since I saw it every day, day in and day out while I was there, but that's another story. I recommend this as a steps away place to Michigan Ave and a fantastically priced, well located, well amenitie'd hotel in the heart of Chicago.
