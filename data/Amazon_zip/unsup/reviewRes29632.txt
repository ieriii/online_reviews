Such a good Mexican Restaurant. We were here about 1 pm on a Saturday afternoon. There was going to be about a half hour wait for the dining room, but the bar was only half full, so we sat in there. Lunch is definitely the way to go in this place. I could see how it would be next to impossible to get a table at dinner. On Saturdays, they only serve brunch, so we didn't get to see the normal lunch menu. I'm not complaining though. We all had the tacos of some sort...pork, chicken, steak. So good. The little handmade tortillas were the best. And the guacamole, don't skip the guacamole. And go ahead and splurge on a $10 mojito. They're made fresh by your waiter and are so good. The service was a little spotty. It may have been because we were there right before they closed for the afternoon. It seems like it was always someone different who came by our table. We had a hard time tracking down our original waiter. Once again, probably an isolated incident.
