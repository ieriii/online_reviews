After reading Roy's review of San Soo Gab San at the Chicago Gluttons site, and my friend being transferred to South Korea - I knew I finally had the chance to savor this wonder. I think I was introduced to Korean food in the form of bim bi bap from the now defunct Bbop. I never knew Korean food was all about Barbecue. And an indoor BBQ? What were these people thinking? Of course I want to smell like Kalbi after I leave the place. It's a pick up line or ice-breaker at the bar.  I think all restaurants should grasp on the concept of banchan (about 25 amuse bouche portions of randomness). The chips and salsa or bread with butter just doesn't cut it anymore. Free food lures people in - the Koreans know what their doing.  Now it might seem a little demeaning to cook your own food, maybe a little "why-the-hell-am-i-cooking-my-own-food-i-don't-like-this-idea" - quoted by the snobby bitch next to us. But you know what? Get over it girl - maybe your boyfriend is trying to tell you something (learn how to cook). Besides that little episode - everything is amazing. We ordered the Kalbi, chicken, and pork to grill and the Asparagus wrapped with beef as the appetizer. The kalbi was the best out of the meat and asparagus beef was out of this world. The complimentary rice and soup made our stomachs grow and extra inch or so in order to fit the deliciousness.  And to wash this all down - Coke and Jinro? Ehh - Jinro is soju which is a distilled rice alochol. It's popular in Korea like Absolut is popular here in the U.S.  We both thought is was gross. Not even coke could water down the taste. I don't mind the smell of meat on my clothes though - I think it's kinda sexy.
