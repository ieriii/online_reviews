We stopped in for an early dinner on Sunday.  The Service was great. Very friendly and efficient.  We had a great appetizer, and two entrees. The first was the sorghum glaze chicken. Very tasty, but very skimpy. The other was the etouffee.  It was a little bland.  Given that it is early on, we will gladly give them another try.
