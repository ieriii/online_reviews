I have ordered take out several times from Wakamono. Generally, the sushi is pretty good. We ordered last evening and it was tasty - the classic maki rolls are good as well as their specialty rolls. The delivery service is prompt - told us on a Sunday evening it would be 45-60 minutes and it only took around 25 minutes. We were very impressed as this never happens in Chicago. My only complaint is that its a bit pricey but this is true of many sushi restaurants in the city.
