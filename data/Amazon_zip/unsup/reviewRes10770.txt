The pizza here is pretty decent. Better than average, for sure... it's not my favorite by any means, but I can't say I disliked it at all and I'd definitely eat here again. The beer selection is certainly above average - it's not the Map Room but it's certainly got a good range and is well-balanced. I had the Hitachino Nest White Ale with a spinach, mushroom and pepperoni pizza and rather enjoyed my meal. The big downfall for Piece is, as others have mentioned, that it's SO LOUD in here, which can make conversation a daunting task. I recently met up here with a friend of mine that I hadn't seen in years and I was lucky he picked me out of the crowd and we had to speak pretty loudly to be heard, but I guess I can't expect much else on a Saturday in the early evening, but the setup and atmosphere of the place don't really encourage a quieter crowd, either. Prices are okay. Not great, not terrible. Karaoke is fun here - but beware, especially for live band, you may or may not ever make it on stage. I guess it helps if you know the guys running it and they're not too drunk to skip you for someone else they like. I'd go back for sure, it's just not my first pick. I gave it 4 since I can't give it 3.5 and I had a really nice waitress and good company. Still want to try the dessert pizza.
