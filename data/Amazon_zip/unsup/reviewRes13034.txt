Pros: Excellent Salad bar choices, Sushi, Excellent Meat choices, prompt service, large wine selectoin. Cons: $2.50 bottled soft drinks so no refills. Things you should know: Dinner price $44.95/pp as of 3/2010. Sign up for email updates and they send you 2 for 1 offers on your birthday and anniversary. Last year during the summer they had 50% off dinners Monday-Thursday via email promotion. Currently you can purchase a VIP Card which gives you 50% off dinners for up to 12 dinners. I have been to this restaurant many times. I have never been dissapointed with the service or food. i don't care for the schaumburg location as the service was poor and salad bar choices were limited compared to the Chicago location...no sushi.
