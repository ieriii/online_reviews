I must say the BEST lunch special I have come across. Simply Incredible is more like it. A soup, salad, entree, and desert for the price of an entree which ranges from 6-9 dollars. I go here enough that a friend commented that I can point out sublet differences in the soup, and I have to say I have not found a better lunch special yet. Food is great, recommend the tropical calamari or Beef simply it sandwich. Amazingly friendly waitstaff. Remember to grab a dum dum as you leave. Dinner is a bit pricey for my college wallet. But would recommend lunch here to Everyone.
