I absolutely love this place. Yes it gets crowded because it is AWESOME! Their mussels are delicious. I have convinced a few skeptical friends to try them and they are hooked. They have beers for just about any taste and everything I have had off them menu has been tastefully prepared. It can get a bit loud at times so if you aren't into crowds you may want to choose another option. I highly recommend Hopleaf. You won't be disappointed.
