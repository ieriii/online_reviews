Although Piece is not as good as BAR in New Haven, it definitely does the job of fulfilling the craving I've had for mashed potato and bacon pizza since I graduated from Yale. The crust is not as charred/crispy as it is at BAR, but it is pretty good. We were with a relatively large party when we went last night, so we ordered two large pizzas and a medium pizza. The first large was a white pie with mashed potato, bacon and artichoke hearts. For those of you who have never experience the awesomeness that is mashed potato and bacon pizza, you are truly missing out. The second and third pizzas were mostly for the rookies who doubted the awesomeness of the first pizza. The second one was a red pie with spinach, mozzarella and banana peppers. The banana peppers were key in this pizza -- they brought a relatively plain, but good slice to a much higher level of amazingness (the little red line is telling me that amazingness is not a word, but whatever). The third pizza was much more classic -- red with mozzarella, tomato and basil. It was good, as expected, but nowhere near as good as the other two pizzas. I downed all this pizza with some Golden Arm and Dark-n-Curvy Dunkelweizen. Good stuff. All in all, if you can't get to New Haven, this is really the next best thing. Four stars for the food and beer, but five stars for satisfying my nostalgia.
