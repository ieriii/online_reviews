I feel like I should give this place 5 stars just because everyone else does...but I would NEVER do the a little over an hour wait again. It's totally worth doing it once, but any other time I'll go on a weekday and skip the duck fat fries. I had 2 sausages as well as bites of 3 more of friends. My favorite hands down was the chicken sausage with mozzarella and spinach and bacon mayo and something else delicious. All of them were good and very unique. Hot Doug should really think of expanding to cut down on the wait time and speed up the seating process. My friends and I finally got people to leave a table (stared them down) after they sat there and just chatted over their sodas with a ton of people waiting...rude.
