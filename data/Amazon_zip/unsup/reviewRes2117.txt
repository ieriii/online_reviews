i had been wanting to try this place FOREVER since seeing it on a pbs special and hot dog paradise on the travel channel. at that time, i was still eating meat and was really interesting in trying the fois gras dog. i can't give this place 5 stars, since i am not eating meat anymore and didn't get to try all the interesting sausage/hot dog choices. however, i will give the duck fat fries a big thumbs up!!  so my bro and i walked here, and he used handy dandy google maps in order to find the closest L station. we got off at belmont off the blue and then proceeded to walk a LONG way to find it. after walking about a mile, he thought that perhaps he didn't zoom in on the map, so it was a lot further than it looked. geez. thank god it wasn't super hot, but by the time i got there, i was about to pass out. then i saw the line, and i really was going to faint. the line took about 1 hour, but once you get inside, it is worth it. i just had the veggie dog chi-town style, and my bro had the chicago dog and the game of the day, which was buffalo w/ a remoulade. service here is really fast, and doug himself takes each person's orders!!! i felt like i met a celebrity when he took my order since i've seen him on tv so many times! i wish i was eating meat still so i could try all their sausage choices. maybe by the next time i come to chicago, i will! btw, my brother says he would give it 5 stars, b/c even the regular chicago dog is good, and at $1.75, it's a great deal!! he's a superdawg fan, but i guess that is more expensive.
