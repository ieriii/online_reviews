My favorite of all the big Greek restaurants in Chicago-land. Both locations are equally consistent and good. Lombard is very nice decor but the Halsted St. is really the Mother-ship. Great decor. Great neighborhood. Free valet parking. For lunch on Halsted we had Flaming Saganaki Cheese, Olives, Broiled Octopus, Braised Lamb Marina, Artichokes with lemon and no liquor, $59. We love the attention here. Service is always, always, always Top Notch!
