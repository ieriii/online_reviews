Good place to hit up but could be better. Beer was good and definitely the main reason to visit. Food was not bad at all either. I wished the bacon fat popcorn was a little better put together. Maybe have it warm with the fat actually mixed into the popcorn and not just as a topping. The pork belly sandwich was pretty good. Not as heavy as I had thought. The only complaint was the wait. We got there at 7 for a table of 5. We waited over 2 hours and still no table. Eventually we had to ask for a table of four with a extra chair pulled up. Why they did not do this is the first place is beyond me. There were tons of tables for four that were filled after we got there. Instead of asking us if we would want a table of four with an extra chair the staff just had us wait over 2 hours. I understand that there is going to be a wait on a Friday but they definitely could had cut our wait down to 30 minutes. If this whole ordeal never had happened I'd give this place a four.
