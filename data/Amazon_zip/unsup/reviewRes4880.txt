The Purple Pig is one of those refined family joints that you just can't help but fall in love with. I mean honestly, is there anything better than cheese, wine and swine? It gets super crowded so I recommend going after work for happy hour, grabbing a few drinks and be prepared to wait. It's worth it. What I like about the menu is that it is flavorful, approachable, a balance of rich, fatty, fresh and earthy all in one bite. Delicious. Some favorites include: -Bone Marrow -Peas & Bacon -Charred Cauliflower -Beets (!!) - there are good beets and then there are great beets, theese are the latter -Deviled egg -Pig's Ear -Pork Shoulder - one of my favorite dishes in Chicago -Sepia -Razor clams I could go on and on and on. The point is that whether you're veggie or major meat lover, on a date or with a large group of friends this place is a perfect destination.
