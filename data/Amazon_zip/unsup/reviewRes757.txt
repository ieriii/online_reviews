This is not a "let's grab a quick bite to eat" kind of place. It's equivalent to waiting in a long line for an amusement park rollercoaster ride... but for hot dogs... in a fast food setting kind of place. Ironic, you say? Yes, I say. If you plan on dining here, please don't arrive starving or hung over, and make sure to check your bloodsugar if you're a diabetic or else you WILL break out in a cold sweat, feel dizzy, and possibly pass out. That's not something you'd want to disclose to the paramedics when they have to carry your limp body to the ambulance, and all you have to say for yourself is "I just wanted a hot dog". Although, if you really NEED to have a hotdog here, arrive to this place well prepared. Perhaps bring a sleeping bag/folding chair, and camp out in front the night before, because the early birds get the hot dogs and duck fat fries. Maybe stand in line with a beverage, a book, your ipod, knitting supplies, or practice the art of meditating or staring blankly into space for long periods of time. Don't plan any dental appointments or things of the sort, and be prepared to answer the question to "what did you do today" with "I waited in line for hours for a hot dog". If you don't prepare yourself in this somewhat of fashion, you will become grumpy and the grumpiness will take away from the experience of what you just ordered. The hotdog will taste like any old hot dog and the fries will have just as well come from McDonalds.
