My girlfriend and I had been planning on going here for years to celebrate a special occasion, mainly a new job. Sort of a competition of who would get the big one first. Well, she beat me and landed a great job in New York, which unfortunately meant we had to leave Chicago, but I had to pay up. So I took her to Alinea under this guise, and without her knowing I planned to ask her to marry me as well. Needless to say dinner was amazing, especially the ring course. She said yes.
