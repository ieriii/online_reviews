Fantastic Mexican street food! While waiting for a table at the Frontera Grill, the wife and I took a short hop over to XOCO to check it out. First, don't expect to get a seat. You are better off enjoying it outside or in a warm hotel lobby, like we did. Second, I don't think there is a bad choice to be had here. We settled on a Churros, Cubana Tortas and a cup of classic hot chocolate. The Churros was sweet and delicious, the Cubana Tortas was succulent and although my wife didn't care too much for the hot cocoa, I enjoyed immensely. If you are looking for a quick bite or waiting on for a table at the other Rick Bayless' restaurants, stop by this jewel of a place.
