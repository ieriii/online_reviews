This place is like a Golden Corral for people with money. We had no idea what we were walking into when we went here. We had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, we were just hungry and wanted a nice meal without have to wait for a table. This place served that purpose. Service was great, cocktails were good, and the food was, surprisingly, phenomenal. I will say that it is all you can eat, so it is overwhelming. My advice would be to just get the salad bar. There is MORE than enough for a meal on the salad bar, and it would save you $40 (which is the price for the endless meat - the salad bar is an extra $20, I think). We were also amused by the acrobat in the wine storage area. Very neat addition during dinner hours.
