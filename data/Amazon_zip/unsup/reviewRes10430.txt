Went here last night with my daughter who lives nearby. While the place comes with great reviews, including those from 3 of my kids, I was not impressed overall. The decor was very nice, classic, crowded without being claustrophobic. Service was friendly and attentive from the minute we walked in the door. A very nice wine was recommended (only Italian choices,which was great). Where they dropped the ball was in the food, at least to my taste. We started with a grilled seafood appetizer of calamari, octopus and shrimp which was slightly overlooked and was cool by the time we stopped eating it. This was followed by specials, a pasta with chanterelle mushrooms for my daughter and sea bass for me. The description of both sounded very good. The pasta had singular flavoring; we expected that it would have the various tastes of the ingredients, but it didn't. The sea bass was basically mushy and flavorless. It had been stuffed and baked with fruits but nothing popped. This was not our original restaurant of choice, but on a very cold night, it was a shorter walk. We should have sucked it up and driven north to Clark and Aldine.
