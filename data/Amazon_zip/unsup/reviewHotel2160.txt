I stayed here for 3 nights this summer. First off, the hotel from the exterior is very impressive and the hotel is in a prime location right on Michigan Ave in walking distance to shopping and across the street from major bus lines. Close to major sightseeing spots. Overall, a prime location. According to a friend who came here for work, the meeting rooms are very fancy. Except I wasn't here to use anything but the rooms and lobby. Apples to apples, for their 4+ star hotel rating it was an okay experience. I was bumped to a suite which hey, I'm not gonna complain about!  Except a few things I found oddly sub-par - the picture quality and sound of the flat screen TV were very poor and the channel line up was very limited. It was the shabbiest TV reception I've ever encountered at a hotel. Even my 1 star hotel experience in Spain had better TV reception. Each day I ended getting charged incorrectly by housekeeping for allegedly taking things out of the snack bar (which I did not). The Ipod dock for my alarm clock did not work. The Business Center which is contracted out to a third party, messed up my printing job and double charged me. Otherwise, the hotel is very impressive from the outside and opens up to a spacious and busy lobby when you walk in. The decor is a little bland and old-fashioned but otherwise everything about my room comfortable and what you'd expect.  Some of the employees are polite and helpful, but not to any greater extent than what you'd encounter at Days Inn. And some employees were brusque and not as helpful. Overall, I thought the customer service was just meh. I would say this hotel was solid but I was not impressed. I realized after my stay here that I am perfectly happy with a recently renovated room at 2 or 3 star non-boutique hotel with a younger, more modern decor. Because that's usually where I stay as a budget savvy traveller.
