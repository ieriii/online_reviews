I've been here twice in the past month and have enjoyed it both times. First off it's not what i expected. It's MUCH better than I expected! It's huge and absolutely lovely. The decor is so warm and inviting. LOVE IT! It looks gorgeous decorated for xmas and I think they should leave the lights up all the time. I can't even describe how gorgeous this place is. You just have to go see it. Anyway, the first time I went it was a Saturday night around 10pm. It was packed and we got the last 2 seats at the bar as a couple were being seated for dinner. The bartender was very friendly. I ordered a pear martini which was very yucky but I won't hold that against them. The crowd was a great mix of people and I think just about anyone would feel comfortable. The next time I went was on a Monday for a late dinner. Not as crowded as the Saturday, but still a decent crowd for a Monday night. My friend and I had trouble deciding because everything sounded good. I settled on the portobello sandwich with fries which was awesome. My friend had a burger and their champs which are fancy mashed potatoes. She was happy with her meal and the service was efficient and friendly. This is one of my favorite new spots! What a great addition to Lakeview!
