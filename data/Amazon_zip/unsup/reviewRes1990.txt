This place has incredibly great service with a nice laid back mood. Doug is always behind the counter taking orders and the runners are ready to help customers find seating. I found it amazing that 2 Chicago cops actually waited in the 1 hour line in 20 degree weather instead of sauntering up to the counter. Props to them for respecting the line. I don't think I saw a single grumpy person in the place. Cased meats do bring out the best in people.
