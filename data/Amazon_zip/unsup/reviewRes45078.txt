Fattest country on the planet or no, the portions at this place are way too small for the money. I am not fat. The people I was with were small, thin, and from other countries. None of us were full. The food itself was overpriced and disappointing. The menu sounded inspired, but the execution just wasn't tasty. Seven of us went and I was the only one who had read any reviews before hand. I kept my mouth shut but everyone voiced their dissatisfaction afterwards. On the plus side, it's a cute spot both inside and out.
