Very cute little restaurant, but it's hidden in a run down area on Chicago Ave. Once inside the ambience is great. They're usually playing a movie on a large projector on the wall. The spicy tuna, salmon and avocado, and spider rolls are great. What's especially nice about Sushi X is you can build your own rolls. They list the add ons and you build from there. On the hot menu, the beef asparagus roll and wasabi mashed potatoes are really good. They deliver, but the drivers are rarely on time and once even called me to walk to their car. If you don't mind BYOB, eat there.
