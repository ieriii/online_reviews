Mon-Thurs, full rack of baby back ribs $12.99 (reg price I think is $17.99). Oh yeah, and just for good measure, toss in complimentary pizza and french bread, butter so good I think the devil churned it himself, a side salad AND a side of potatoes or pasta.  These ribs are fall off the bone good. Mind you, these are baby back so it's not crazy amounts of meat, but by the time I was done I still had most of my pasta and 3/4 of my ribs left. And that's AFTER eating 3 pieces of bread and the salad. lol The sauce isn't the best I've ever had, it's kinda smokey with lots of spices, but it's good. I actually really liked my side of pasta with meat sauce. Even though it's a side, you can still tell that they take pride in their spaghetti sauce, it was full of flavor and crushed tomatoes. I would totally order it just as an entree. My friend had some kind of sausage pasta and said it was 'delicious pasta goodness'--so good, in fact, that she did not even want to try my ribs!  Deeelicious.
