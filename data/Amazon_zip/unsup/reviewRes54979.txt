I am from out of town and this was my third time at L&E. All three times were for brunch spread over the past one year. The first time I had biscuits & gravy, the second time I had the La Strada (which was not offered this past weekend), and this most recent time I again had the biscuits and gravy.  The gravy was excellent and you could see the herbs in it. My companions ordered the duck hash and the mac 'n cheese; both were delicious. We sat in the back room and it was a good mix of bustle but quiet enough for conversation. The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. Breakfast food options at brunch were between $8 and $15. I also ordered a bloody mary, and it came in a pint glass garnished with a little cocktail sword with a cornichon and a square of cheese on it which I greatly enjoyed (plus a lime and a lemon wedge on the glass). The bloody mary also came with a small (2 oz?) little cup of beer too. (The bloody mary was not clam-like at all but it was spicy).  It is good to remember that the brunch cocktails are on the brunch menu so you don't have to go searching through the extensive drink menu. I believe my bloody mary was around $8 and it was well worth it.
