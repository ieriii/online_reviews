One of the best sushi spots in Chicago. The prices aren't outrageous yet the ambiance and scene would make you think otherwise.  On the weekends it is very crowded but the BYOB feature is key. The hostess will open your bottle while you wait for your table. The quality of the food is awesome and without an outrageous drink tab, the prices are pretty reasonable. One of my Chicago fav's.  There is also another location in the South Loop on Michigan Ave. (not BYOB and doesn't have the "Po-Boy Roll"...but still trendy and delicious!)
