Only a few minor drawbacks, I'll get to that. Overall, fantastic food and atmosphere. I had carpaccio first and then the rabbit. Outstanding food. Simple yet elegant and very tasty. Highly recommend. Service was above average. Few nitpicks. 1. My single wine glass pour was small. Too stingy. 2. The menu situation is confusing. It's prix fixe yet the offer a la carte. The problem was when we wanted to order a la carte they failed to bring us an a la carte menu with the prices. If you order a la carte at a prix fixe place you should be offered an a la carte menu with prices. However I wouldn't let this deter you. Overall it was a great experience with excellent food.
