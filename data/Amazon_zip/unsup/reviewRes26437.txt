The claypot catfish here is my favorite. I've had it twice and although I've been here probably four or five times, every dish I've had has been outstanding. Plus, the owner is probably the most welcoming restaurant owner in the entire city of Chicago. If you can't be seated right away, he'll bring you out a glass of water and he'll make sure you have a place to sit while you wait.
