I really want to love you, Dana, I do... but you disappoint me a tad bit every stay. This time, it was the phone beeping because of a low battery. I did tear it out and the next day it was put back together yet still beeping. It was the TV that didn't turn on, the drain that got clogged, and the wireless that didn't function so well... Kudos to the friendly doormen and concierge, the comfy bed, the chocolate dipped fortune cookies, and the complimentary breakfast in the mornings. I noticed Mariah's pluses and minuses cover pretty much everything I observed as well, so I cannot really sum it up better than that. Dana - you're a solid four stars. I'm sure I'll be back, although maybe next time you will annoy me less?!
