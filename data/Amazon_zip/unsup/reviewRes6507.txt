I've been here a few times and I have enjoyed it every time. Their prime rib is my favorite and they have AMAZING french onion soup. I'm not a big fan of their sides, I've tried the mac and cheese, spinach, and potato au gratin and they were okay but nothing to brag about. But overall I do always have a good meal. And the service is always great.
