GREAT service, ok roasted meats on a skewer. My only other Brazilian steakhouse experience was Fogo de Chao in San Diego. The meat at Fogo seemed a lot tastier, particularly the garlic-heavy roasts. The service at Brazazz however swarms to you when your disc is black -- at Fogo, service seemed slow and infrequent, hard to eat my money's worth. I intend to try the Fogo in Chicago for further ... "research" purposes soon. Compared to my San Diego experience, for the price, I'm not impressed with Brazazz.
