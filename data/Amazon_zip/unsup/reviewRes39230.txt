It's official. I'm a Korean BBQ bitch. After tonight's Yelp get-together organized by Mike K. and Vaughn C., I'm more carnivorous than ever. We ordered one thing and one thing only: Galbi. Two tables with charcoal pits, eleven chairs, 1200 side-dishes - or panchan - and two bottles of soju. These, my friends, are recipe for primitive and caveman-like behavior: Chopsticks flying across the table fighting for the best piece of charred, or uncharred, meat. And when all that was left was the rib bones, well, we ate them too. Grilled to bony-perfection, we wasted no food. All $28 per person worth. San Soo Gab San. A difficult name to pronounce, but you've provided a safe haven for foodies, meat and non-meat eaters alike, to satisfy their basic needs. Twenty four hours a day.
