I had been wanting to try Zed451 for several months and finally got the opportunity when my company placed them on its short list for our holiday party and future company events, and I was in charge of the "food sampling." Not only was the food outstanding but the service was excellent and the venue is perfect for just about any size group. One of my biggest concerns was whether or not the "all you can eat" style of menu could accommodate all of our employees; between the summer harvest table (soups, salads, cheese and bread) and the 12 delicious meat/seafood options, I think everyone is covered! The portions were the perfect size and allowed me to try each and every option, which was a plus in comparison to other restaurants of this style that I have tried in the past. Whether its for our holiday party or a future event, I will definitely be coming back to Zed451... special thanks to Sammy Ojeda, who was a pleasure to work with!
