XOCO isn't too far from J's place so we ordered take out the other day. I was very excited and honestly-I was a little disappointed. The food was ok but for the price it should be "fan-f'ing-tastic" food in my opinion and it wasn't. I had the wood-roasted chicken posole. It was good....but not as good as some pozole I've made honestly. The broth wasn't as rich as I hoped-there wasn't a ton of chicken. The "crunchy garnishes" were cabbage and radish from what I could tell. For $10 I was underwhelmed. J got the shortrib red chile soup. It was good but there was one big chunk of meat and the broth was again kind of underwhelming.We also got 3 churros, they were good but churros are not super difficult. Two soups and 3 churros were $30. I will likely try XOCO again, maybe a torta- I'm hoping this time was a fluke.
