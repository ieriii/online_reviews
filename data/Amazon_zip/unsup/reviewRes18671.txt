I was kinda bummed with this place. I was so looking forward to trying some great Italian, it was good, but not great. I did have very high hopes because of all the positive reviews. I had some tortellini and my boyfriend had lasagna. Although my bf loved the tortellini, I didn't. I thought it was decent but I've had better. He really didn't like his lasagna, but I did. It is kinda pricey but they serve huge portions. Overall, ok place. I proably won't return.
