I LOVE Le Colonial !Service here is always up to par. And that's another thing that shocks me. I used to work at a restaurant as a hostess and I would notice that there would be days where the servers were not serving at their highest potential, which is understandable. We are human and have our less than satisfactory days. However, evrytime I dine at Le Colonial the service is always excellent. This restaurant, which includes the decor, the food, the presentation, the service, the wine deserves an A++. I've never been disappointed here for any reason. I've loved or liked everything that I've tried here, and I can almost call their desserts heavenly creations.You can't go wrong here at all.
