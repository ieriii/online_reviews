Arrest me and take me to Lockdown! Me and 7 friends ventured to Lockdown Bar & Grill in Ukrainian Village for lunch a few Saturdays ago and left with smiles on our faces and a few extra pounds on our hips. I don't know why I expected crappy service but what we received was a kind manager who sat us easily (even with an unsuspecting, large group in such a small place) and a server as sweet as pie. Our server answered all our ridiculous questions and put up with our constant indecision (because every burger sounds so good). The burgers are frigging AMAZING! We had everything from the Federale to the Conjugal Visit and every one was just as delicious as the other. I have to say that the Warden burger was everyone's favorite. Oh, and don't forget their mac n' cheese - holy yum. Next time I'll fast for 2 days before I go. Totally worth that extra pound or two you have to work off later.
