There is nothing I love more than Italian food, so I was extremely excited to try this restaurant that Yelpers have given such great reviews. Oh boy was I disappointed. As everyone mentioned, it's packed and you have to wait a while to get seated. The front dining area is designed really poorly and there is barely any standing room while you wait. So everyone is smooshed on top of each other by the door. I didn't mind the wait too much- maybe 15 minutes. But I did't enjoy the standing area- it wasn't even productive for fun people watching. Sigh. The restaurant is cute, very nice ambiance and actually romantic w/little twinkle lights. Service was good. However, the food was not. We shared grilled calamari for an appetizer. It was done right and not bad by any means but it didn't have that much flavor to it. I think it had a balsamic reduction sauce, which I was excited about, but it wasn't tangy or tasty. It was blah. Bummer. So I eagerly awaited the entree, and it didn't arrive for a very long time. And when it did, it was just blah. It was spagetti w/clams, musels and shrimp. The seafood portion was great, however, the marinara sauce was not that great and the thing I coudln't get over was that the pasta tasted like ramen noodles! It's home-made pasta but, seriously, it had that ramen texture. And thats that...a very mediocre experience...me so sad.
