Had lunch with a friend yesterday. Lucky for us, we didn't experience any long lines. Certain aspects of the experience were 5-star, but others were not. Setting: the chalkboard menu and ordering area is beautiful. I liked watching a couple of the cooks do their work behind the glass while we waited. The lines are confusing. We waited to get a table number, then waited to order - it was confusing. Had we been fighting with lines, i think it would have been maddening. The dining area was pretty much like chipotle or something, only slightly better lit. Food: Drew ordered the Ahodaga, I ordered the suckling pig. I tried both sandwiches and there were quite good - the subtlety and richness of flavors that you would expect from a Bayless restaurant. I preferred the Ahodaga and would recommend that. At $12, the suckling pig sandwich wasn't worth it, though it was tasty. At 9-12 dollars a sandwhich they should give a bowl of chips and salsa to the table. I had churros and a small cup of the homemade mexican soft serve. That was the best part of the experience. I would go back just for that and a cup of coffee. Drew had the ice cream with some crumble bacon nut stuff on it and that was great too. However, his dessert came stuffed in a plastic cup... weird. If you're getting a dessert and eating in, why is this in a plastic cup...?!? Not-so-classy. Service: Service was friendly but slow. Also, they switched our sandwiches. We tried to clarify which was which when she set them down and she said that drew had the ahodaga. A little later i noticed that drew's onions were pickled - and i knew my sandwich was supposed to have pickled onions. oooops. Overall: Just not worth the $$, time, or the effort. A good experience, but nothing i would overly recommend. I spent $22 on lunch (chips, torta, dessert). I think i would have rather eaten at frontera for lunch. I will probably go back to try the Caldos. - or if i'm in the neighborhood for some soft serve.
