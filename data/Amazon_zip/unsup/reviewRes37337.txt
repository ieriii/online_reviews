I've eaten in the Fox & Obel caf a few times and enjoyed it, though it is a bit Spartan. This time, we visited the newer bistro, which features table service. Everyone in our party of four enjoyed the food (and the river view). The compact menu has choices sure to appeal to anyone. The staff was friendly and accommodated our need to finish in time for a movie at the nearby River East 21 cinema. Our food was fresh and tasty (I loved the 2 quiches I sampled). The bistro is a nice addition to an engaging market experience.
