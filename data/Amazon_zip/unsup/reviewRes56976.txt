I went to Piece after the hockey game Sunday night with a friend to meet two of my co-workers. They watched the game at Piece and enjoyed a hefty amount of food. I was fortunate to be at the game, and I didn't eat anything at the United Center knowing that some high-quality thin crust pizza would be heading my way when we arrived. The kitchen was about to close, so we called as we were leaving the game and we made the request in time. My colleagues are beer aficionados - one even brews his own - and they were very impressed with several of the Piece brews. I don't drink beer, but there was ample gin in the glass with the tonic. A good time was had by all. We live/work in New Jersey, but will absolutely go back to Piece on our next trip to Chicago.
