I ordered delivery and it arrived at my house literally 15 minutes after I hung up the phone (maybe I live too close for delivery and should have picked up myself..but it was rain/snowing..). I had the big buddha bowl with tofu which is huge, filled with veggies and super delicious. I also tried the fried mushrooms which were excellent. This will become a new regular spot for me!
