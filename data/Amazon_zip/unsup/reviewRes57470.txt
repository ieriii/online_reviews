Overpriced and overrated! I've had a better meal experience at The Melting Pot for half the cost. The restaurant is definitely better suited for couples, but I wouldn't call it romantic given the proximity of the tables to each other. Entrees range from $47-$61 per person and includes a cheese fondue appetizer and a chocolate fondue dessert. The former was skimpy given the size of our group (5) while the former tasted little more than melted Hershey's kisses. Both times we had to ask for more dipping breads or fruit. We only ordered 4 entrees thinking we would have more than enough food. We were wrong. I have had more beef and chicken on a kabob than what was served here. The entree platter was heavy on broccoli, green peppers and onions, not exactly what you would think of deep frying in a fondue pot. To add further insult they hit us a $10 sharing charge for the fifth person. I do not mind spending money at nice restaurants but i don't enjoy giving it away either. Save your money and if you insist on having fondue, go elsewhere!
