XOCO-licious! Am I addicted? Slightly. But for good reason: tortas, caldos, thick rich chocolate, cerveza, churros, and a water bar! Sure, the ordering process is a bit non-traditional (you get a number once a table is open, and then you can order your food) and can be a wait as the restaurant is so popular, but it gives you time to drool over the menu. My faves: Wild mushroom torta, Barcelona chocolate (so thick you could use a fork), churros, and watching the cooks in the window prepare all of the amazing food!!! Xoco is a must for those who appreciate a non-Taco Bell Mexican food experience.
