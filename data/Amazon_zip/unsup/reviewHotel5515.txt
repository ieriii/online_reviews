First I travel 50+ nights a year so I see and experience the full spectrum of hotels. We picked this hotel which is blocks from our house to stay in with our dog while we had some home remodel work done. I have had my mom and aunts stay hear so we have used this before. Staff is nice and the location is great. The down side is the cleaning people do not clean. When we checked in and opened a dresser we were suprised to find condoms,lube and a dirty towel. NEVER ACCEPTABLE. My dog did not want to even stay in this room and we all moved after sticking it out for two nights and were unhappy. Request to stay in the new part of the hotel and experience will be like the higher rated reviews
