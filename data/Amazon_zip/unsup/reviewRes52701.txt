I have been to Texas de Brazil prior to going to Brazzaz. So when I stopped by the salad bar, I have noticed they did not have much of a selection. I am in love with apple salads and it was definitely better at Texas de Brazil. When we were seated, I showed our server the coupon card which was buy one full dinner, get the 2nd free. I saw her expression change immediately. We ate about an hour and decided we were full and would rest a little before eating more. The waitress came back and gave me the impression that she wanted us to finish up and leave. The service was definitely below average for such a nice restaurant.
