The restaurant is charmingly elegant. The chandeliers in the bar are beautiful. I'm told the patio is lovely as well. However, the staff there is TERRIBLE. Never in my life have I felt so uncomfortable. There were SEVERAL employees standing by the front door, which is way too many for such a small restaurant. Not only that, we arrived at a reasonably early hour for dinner and were told without a reservation we could not sit outside. Mind you there were more than SEVERAL tables available. Subsequently, we were seated at the WORST table in the entire restaurant right next to the kitchen and directly in the midst of foot traffic for our entire meal. The employees were snooty without reason to be considering I'm a beautiful & well dressed young woman. To make it even worse our waiter was over the top and in our face the entire meal. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you how the food was because it was overshadowed by such horrendous service. It's a shame because the restaurant is so beautifully romantic, yet I don't think I can bring myself to go back after being treated so rudely.
