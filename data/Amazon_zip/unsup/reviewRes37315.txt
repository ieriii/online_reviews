If I won the lottery, the first thing I'd do is RUN not walk to Fox and Obel and stock my pantry/fridge with as much of their stock as possible. I am not a big fan of pre-prepared, pre-packaged stuff (i prefer to make my own dips, dressings, sauces, etc) but I would gladly partake in anything that store sells.  JOY! The occasional temp job that brings me to the very same building that houses Fox and Obel! I don't think I've been to F&O since the last time I temped in this building, like 2 years ago (praise God I've been a working singer/voice teacher and not a temp) but I do not mind being a receptionist for a day if it means spending my lunch hour in F&O. I stopped in for a cappucino and a muffin before work. Since the only muffins I've consumed in the past few years were from Starbucks (icky), this one blew me away. It was like they had just folded the berries in that very morning (which they probably did). The coffee was nummy too. At lunch time, I browsed around the store. REALLY wanted a $20 bottle of Greek olive oil, but restrained myself. Might go back after work for it tho. Decided on sushi for lunch and a giant bottle of perrier. Delicious and fresh. Also REALLY wanted more baked goods, but again, restraint. Wedding gown to fit into (in one year however, so again, might go back after work for it). The seafood counter looked great. I could do some serious damage here if I were going straight home and not back to work. I could easily spend my entire day's pay here. F&O reminds me why it would be great to be so wealthy that $5 for a banana didn't phase me. I have a feeling even their bananas taste better than normal ones. If you are a foodie on a budget with little to no will-power (me to a T), don't go here. You will cry. If you can muster a little will-power for free samples and a budget of $10, go immediately. It will be the greatest $10 you ever ate.
