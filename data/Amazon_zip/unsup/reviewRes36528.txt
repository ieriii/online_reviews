This place was recommended to me by a friend, and boy am I glad I decided to check it out. If you're looking for a reasonably-priced breakfast/brunch place with an extensive menu of both sweet and savory offerings, this is the place to go. I shared the Stuffed Strawberry french toast and Mediterranean frittata, which left me stuffed, but very satisfied (portions are big -- two dishes among three people is probably ideal). The french toast was more like a dessert than an actual meal, but I was able to balance its sweetness with the saltiness of the frittata by alternating between the two throughout the meal. Though both were delicious, my sweet-tooth favored the french toast, and I'm sure that is the dish that's going to keep me coming back for more. i was a bit too caught up in stuffing my face to really take note, but aside from the high quality food, the restaurant is nicely decorated and very clean, with a friendly wait staff. At about $10 per plate and a wide array of breakfast options, this is a place I know I'm going to be visiting whenever I'm in Chicago. I'm tempted to give it a 5/5, but since I've only eaten there once, the extra star will have to wait.
