This is what I call my Diversey "commuter dinner" stop... Right, because when I return from downtown...I take the brown line to Diversey, then switch here to get the bus west...and so of course, I need some chicken to make it those 12 or so blocks! The price of a half-chicken combo (2 sides, plus drink) at under $8 is truly pretty magical. Always whipped up fresh and I've never been disappointed. My favorite side is the potatoes, but when I want something just a tad lighter I'll go for the salad. Also they just added the chicken pita sandwich special for the same price/situation. Money! Always friendly staff...and despite what the name might lead you to believe, they actually specialize in PIZZA. I've never had it, but it looks great in the windows. True story! Great little spot for takeout, I've been a few times and am a fan. It also means I do not need to cook, or spend more than $10...which means I am in the "domestic person" safety zone.
