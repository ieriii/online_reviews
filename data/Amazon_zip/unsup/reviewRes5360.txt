Great little place downtown to grab some food and some drinks. This is a place for foodies and wine lovers though, so if you're not in one of those categories you might not enjoy it as much. We enjoyed all of our dishes a great deal, from the salted beets with goat cheese and pistachios to the artichoke and fingerlings and the braised pork shoulder. Desert was also excellent: mmm nutella pannini and the ricotta chocolate chip iris. Service was a little slow, but still friendly. Not sure if I'd go here again for dinner per say, as I think its better for just some snacks and drinks as the dishes are kind of tapas style. Also, if you're not a pork fan, you might not appreciate the menu as much (as their name implies).
