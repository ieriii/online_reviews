Coast is my go to sushi place. Delicious, fresh sushi well made. The portions are perfect and consistent. The fact that it is BYOB helps keep the tab at a reasonable price. The white dragon is like no other and I highly recommend it. They have lunch hours as well as dinner. I would recommend making reservations for dinner in advance to avoid a long wait. The only thing that turned me off was the fact that when our party brought too much beer for BYOB, our waiter declined to put our extra 12 pack in their fridge. :( Not that they had to, but it would have helped us out. lol
