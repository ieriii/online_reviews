Menu is impeccable. The wait is long, but for the best Italian I've had in Chicago, it's worth it.Atmosphere is really cool, looks like a wine cellar/wine bar. It's based on the enoteca concept, which is basically a wine bar where you can come check out local/regional wines. In keeping with this tradition, Davanti sells their bottles at retail prices, with a corkage fee if you open it at the table. Decent music selection as well.Anyone who discredits the menu may not have an appreciation for the Northern Italian flavor palette. I lived in Florence Italy for 3 years and know what I'm talking about and this place gets the classic flavor combinations right, while adding some delicious and innovative variations (which are always focused on tasting awesome).
