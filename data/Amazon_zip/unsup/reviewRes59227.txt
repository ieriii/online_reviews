The Duck experience at Sun Wah is something that everyone should try. Splitting a duck between 3 people will run you about $20 a person. A duck is rolled to your table on a cart...where it is then carved and presented. Sweet rolls, raw vegetables and a sweet BBQ sauce are used to make little duck sandwiches. The carcus of the duck is taken back to the kitchen where they make a soup and fried rice for your group. Overall, the food is amazing, interesting and priced well. This dining experience is something that you'll remember for all the great reasons!!!
