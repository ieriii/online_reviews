You know a place is good when your Greek friends recommend it. I've been here several times and it is my go-to pick when hankering for a solid Greek meal. My last minute was a Greek feast. My buddy and I did the dinner for two combo. Sweet Greek gods, that's a lot of food. I highly recommend the assorted cold platter. The lemon soup is phenomenal. I've yet to have a bad meal or bad service here. Plus free valet. Can't beat this spot in Greektown.
