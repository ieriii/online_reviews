Very nice restaurant! Food was fantastic! Service was as expected considering how busy it was (Saturday night) and there were about 10 or so of us with no prior reservations. We ordered A LOT of food - I couldn't finish my serving(s). I think I payed around $25-$35. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cramped atmosphere. Regardless, I'd definitely be going back here again! My rating 1-10 (10 being the best) Atmosphere: 7 Food: 9 Cleanliness: 7 Noise: 5 Service: 8 Overall: 8
