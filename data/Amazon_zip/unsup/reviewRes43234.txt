Met my girlfriends here on a Friday not after work for drinks. It is a nice set-up, we sat in one of the lounge areas which was perfect. I honestly expected it to be very crowded, loud, and scenester-y but it was great. We were able to all talk to each other and have a great time. The waitress and hostesses were very nice and helpful, the waitress suggested drinks. The ten dollar cocktails are a bit aggressively priced but they are very good. Had a vodka grapefruit (recomended by waitress) and it was the best grapefruit juice I've ever had (she said they squeeze it themselves)...unfortunately they "ran out". Also, they have the coolest faucets in the bathrooms and really nice soap and lotion. Overall, enjoyable experience.
