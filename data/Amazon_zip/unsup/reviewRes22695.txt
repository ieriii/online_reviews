I love the greek islands!! I went here with a friend that has never tried Greek food. She ended up loving it! First of all, I love that parking is complementary. It was a nice surprise to see that our waiter spoke Spanish. We had different dishes.. My friend had the makaranoda me kima(ground beef greek pasta) she loved it. We then proceeded to make this a tapas event. We ordered Bamje(okra), Greek potatoes(which are to die for) and fried zuchini and shared them amongst us. And of course saganaki! Having been a waitress in a greek restaurant, I love watching them light it on fire!! even though I almost burned my hair the first time I tried it.. oh well Bottom line, it's a wonderful place. Service rocks and the rice pudding was grrreat!! Go there
