One of my favorite meals in Chicago. The tortas are amazing (not many places get the bread AND the filling right, usually it's one or the other) and the churro was even more awesome. The only things I did not like were how narrow and tight the space was and that it was not open on Sundays. I had wanted to go back for round 2! If you're short on time, you can get your order to go. Our food held up very well- we decided to head over to Merch Mart to eat.  Can't wait to go back.
