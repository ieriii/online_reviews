I went last nite 2/17/11 I sat, I ate, I felt sad. Here are my reasons: I have visited in the past and the food was prepared excellent in a very succulent manner w/ in-depth flavor. But this time I felt cheated and unfortunately feel the ramifications this morning. Our complete meal was discouraging especially when the waitress told us there was no more meat to serve. After that stement everything went downhill, our beverages were warm, customer service was lacking and there was no satisfaction in our dinner. Needless to say, I wont be returning again especially after being red-faced with my friends since I really spoke highly of this restaurant.
