How lucky am I to have stumbled upon this affordable high quality Chicago (even though it's a mini chain) steakhouse? Wildfire is a gigantic restaurant which makes it a little impersonal. Not to say the service isn't good or that the place is too loud. It's energetic and friendly. Luckily, the food is the star here as it should be. I went super basic and got a NY Strip Steak. Turned out to be a damn good cut of meat for like $30. Around the table we got everything else from fish to scallops, and everyone was very happy with their meal. I can't wait to visit Wildfire again and try out some of their different sauces and crusts they offer for their steaks.
