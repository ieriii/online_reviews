I've been to Bad Apple a few times now and all have been very positive and delicious experiences. The burgers are really unique and delicious. I've tried several of them and you can't go wrong. Tonight, I tried the Happy Belly sandwich which featured pork belly, pear, and arugula on a pretzel bun. It was cooked perfectly, and the pear provided and interesting contrast. I will definitely order it again. Their fried are nothing special (I can see why they offer so many additional seasonings, but at 75 cents? give me a break) but their homemade ketchup is the best I've ever tasted. Seriously, it's amazing. Heinz can totally suck it. Anyway, onto the beer. They have an extensive list of really interesting beers. I recommend doing a beer flight at least once. I've tried both the light and dark beer flights on several occasions (the beers change seasonally) with my beau and each one has been quite the experience. I rarely tasted a beer which I would be willing to order on its own. Some of them are really unpalatable but regardless the flight is a lot of fun for beer lovers. The only thing that keeps me from giving the whole 5 star enchilada is their average fries and the fact that they have TVs. True, the TVs are in the bar area, but there are a lot of tables in the bar area. I can't imagine they have a lot of people come in just to watch sports when there are two sports bars right across the street. It just doesn't fit the style of the restaurant. Bottom line: This place is great. I've never had an issue with the service and the food is superb. I will definitely back.
