Disappointing experience at Frontera Grill. When my meal arrived after receiving the wrong entree, steak was overdone and sweet corn tamales tepid. My companion received undercooked bitter rice 10 mins after his entree. Server was unapologetic, saying mistakes happen. Yes, we made a mistake thinking Frontera would be as good as when we dined here several times a month. I was excited when we spotted Rick Bayless in the kitchen- but Bayless is master chef no more.
