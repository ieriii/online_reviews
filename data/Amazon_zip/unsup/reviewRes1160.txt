Hot dogs are only fast food when you can get them fast. When you have to wait 1-2 hours to get them, they cannot be called "fast food." Hot dogs are supposed to be fast food. That's the whole point of them. If you can't get them fast, why eat them? I appreciate a good sausage. Doug's are good, but they are not worth a 1- or 2-hour wait. Despite what 1,000 Yelpers say, they just aren't that good. Not even close. Good hot dogs, just not worth the wait. I think people feel like they have to swoon over these hot dogs to justify the fact that they stood in the sweltering heat or freezing cold for 2 hours to get them. If they weren't the best hot dogs in the universe, they would just feel silly for having spent 2 hours standing in line for them. Perhaps the judgement of some of these reviewers has been clouded by an excessive intake of rendered duck fat. Seriously, anyone can throw some fancy cheese and herb-infused this and chipotle that and such-and-such aioli on top of a sausage, and it's going to be good. But to wait 2 hours to buy it for $9? That is silly. The kitschy decor, hot dog art, and clever menu do add to the experience. Doug is obviously a good guy, and good for him that his place is successful. I don't want to take anything from him, just bring a little perspective, as Anton Ego would say.
