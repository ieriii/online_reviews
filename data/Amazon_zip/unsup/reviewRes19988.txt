I asked the waitress what I should order. She says "everything's pretty good". I decide to call her bluff.  I find the least appetizing sounding thing on the menu. I order it. Ha ha ha. Wait a second, is the joke on her or on me? Fuck. The food arrives.  It's a beautiful amalgamation of Polenta, cheese, vegetables and spices.  It's just plain spectacular.  I am in heaven. Every time I come here it's eerily consistent. Solid times in Gastropub city.
