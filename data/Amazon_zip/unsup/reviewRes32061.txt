I'd say that this place is great for vegetarians and vegans, but not for us meat eaters. Also, they rely heavily on non-fermented soy products. The breakfast sausage is really good, but the bacon was developed by someone who hasn't eaten bacon in a good many years, posibly never. Also, their eggs are amazing - they really are from open range chickens. The only eggs I've seen like that are direct from farms.
