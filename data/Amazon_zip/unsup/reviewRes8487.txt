I can't rave enough about this place. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere wonderful, the staff and owner want to make sure you have a great experience. This is the 1st review I've ever posted on line but I was compelled to write it because a previous post disparaged the owner, Johnathan. Let me tell you this guy is a pro and went out of his way to make sure our group had a fabulous dinner last night. We were a party of 6; we all arrived at the correct time and were seated promptly. Out of nowhere the owner dripped off a Black Truffle pizza for us to start with. He didn't know any of us and we didn't ask for anything special. I think he saw that we were there for a good time and just wanted to make sure we did. Everything from the pizza, appetizers, wine list even the glassware and restrooms is so authentic that for a minute I didn't think I was in Chicago but rather a great neighborhood place in Rome. If you haven't eaten here you need to. It's that good.
