Initially, I thought this was my first "gastropub" experience. Looking back, I have been to similar places around the city but never really understood the concept. Longman & Eagle clearly established what a gastropub should be and how really disappointing the others were. My friend had been there before and asked the waitress if she would just bring out a combination of small plates and two entrees to share. She was very agreeable and selected five different dishes, each of them fantastic. I also had the best manhattan (two actually) that I have ever had. The closest comparison I can make is that the food at L&E in a way reminded me of One Sixty Blue, but more lively and much less expensive. We got there around 5:30 on a Thursday night and about half of the tables were already occupied. They don't take reservations and other than the bar that also fills quickly, there isn't really anyplace to wait. The crowd is mixed, but predominately hipsters sporting Grizzly Adams beards that are apparently popular with the kids now-a-days. The other standout is that other customers stop to chat about what you are eating. It's like having a collective foodie experience. Next visit I'm certainly going to have the boar sloppy joes. I never actually saw one, but just the smell of them was indescribable.
