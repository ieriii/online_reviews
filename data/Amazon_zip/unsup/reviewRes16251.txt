Have been ordering out from here for decades and, while we have our favorites, just can't think of anything on their menu that's not good. Definitely our go-to neighborhood delivery joint. Especially love their mussels in white sauce and shrimp de jonghe appetizers, thin crust pizza, meat lasagna, fried chicken and ribs, as well as their House dressing on the salads. Their mushroom soup is to die for, too!
