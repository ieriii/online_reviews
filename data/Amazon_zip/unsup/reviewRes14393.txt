My wife and I started going here in the mornings for their coffee. My wife's favorite is the cafe con leche and I will drink a colada (a pre sweetened Cuban espresso shot). On a recent trip to Miami, I couldn't find and "Cuban" coffee to compare to what we can get here. The food is outstanding!!! Anyone who doesn't rave about their homemade empanadas doesn't have taste buds! The plantains are always cooked to perfection. The people really top off the experience here. The owners are great people who will always take the time to say hello and thank you for coming by. They are genuinely nice people who deserve all of the success their restaurants bring them. They also make great hiring decisions, because everyone who works there seems to love being there.
