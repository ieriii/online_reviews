Excellent vegetarian fare, It felt like I was in San Francisco, not the Castro District even tough this is in Boystown but just because the place had a pretty hippie vibe to it. I ordered the pancakes stuffed with vegan cream cheese and fruit which was a breakfast special that day and they were delicious. Average service, total bill for 2 people came out to be around 20 dollars, not bad. I was amazed at the amount of choices and the quality of the food considering it was vegetarian cuisine.
