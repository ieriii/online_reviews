I like this place. It's walking distance from home, the food's good, and even though the wait times are a bit long on weekends, it's pretty good stuff. There are plenty of choices on the menu (burgers to veggie burgers to salad bar). And even though there's some time spent waiting, there's a full bar to pass the time away (on sunday mornings they do make a great bloody mary, so go ahead, drink up the night before). There is one downside, this place is cramped. When I go here, there seem to be more tables than should be allowed, and I always seem to have my elbows out in the way of people walking past (best if you can get a booth here, just an FYI).
