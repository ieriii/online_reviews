I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food but this place excites me! The food here is so good. Unfortunately, I don't get to this neighborhood much so I always order the same thing. Hot and sour soup, Dan Dan noodle (spicy,spicy) and sole fillet with black bean chili sauce. The sole fillet is like little disks of heaven. It reheats beautifully the next day. Service has always been good for me. Love the massive menu! I left off one star because the new chairs in this place are awful. Very uncomfortable and awkward. I'd be afraid they would break with anyone over 200lbs.
