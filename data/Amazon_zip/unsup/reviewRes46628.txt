The "Grunt Burger" is the best burger I have ever had, without a doubt. Sure, it's not light fare. It's greasy and full of fat. But I don't care, I eat there three or four times a year and I can deal with it. The burgers here aren't like those 6" high monstrosities that some places serve--you can actually eat these without taking them apart. The cottage fries are great too. The salad bar here was one of the first ones in Chicago. It's small, but good, I think. Be warned that if you eat your burger, there will no room left for salad. The room is not so nice, unless you have been going here for some 30 years like I have. It never changes, and I like that. If you go for lunch, the place is liable to be full of Lincoln Park mommies with a couple of kids in strollers as big as Hummers, but that's OK with me--I like kids. The tables are too close together and the bathroom is about as big as a phone booth, but that's OK--because I LOVE these burgers (did I already mention that?).
