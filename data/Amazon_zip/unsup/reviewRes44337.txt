It was a difficult decision to decide between the red velvet cupcake, chocolate chip cookie and the hazelnut chocolate cupcake. So I was like screw it, and got them all.  Unfortunately it was so stinkin hot outside on their cafes tables (but it was a beautiful afternoon, so whatevs) everything started to melt quickly and since I was already feeling like a HEIFER, I never got to the red velvet. With that said the hazelnut chocolate was amazing -- thick creamy and voluptuous. All I could think of was the band from the movie "Coming to America" -- Sexual Chocolate. The fudge stuck to the roof of my mouth -- it was heavenly. The cake itself was pretty good, and was flecked with bits of hazelnut (the actual nut!) Nice!! The server here was very helpful in steering my fat ass to the pastries of choice. I definitely recommend this place. It's worth every single of my 5 stars and then some.
