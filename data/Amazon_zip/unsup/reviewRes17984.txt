ambiance is really cool. love the high back chairs and the darkness of the place. drinks not so much. i ordered a trio of sammies and just wasn't impressed. they were really heavy for what we were drinking. and the drinks are for sure overpriced and not very good. it was like they were trying to pack a million ingredients into one thing. i like my drinks simple. champagne and a little elderflower.
