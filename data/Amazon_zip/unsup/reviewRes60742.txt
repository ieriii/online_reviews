I live right down the street from this place so I'm here a lot. The alcohol selection is great and the food is good (but I agree it's overpriced--I know it's expensive for the owners of this place to buy local but they don't do enough with the cooking to make it really worth the extra cost). I typically come here during the week and take part in whatever special they are offering, whether it's Tap Tuesdays ($4 draft beers!) or half priced wine bottles (on Thursdays now, used to be Wine Wednesday). The bartenders are friendly and professional, and know what they're talking about enough to recommend something based on what you tell them about your tastes. And when I've taken family here for full meals the whole crew has enjoyed it.
