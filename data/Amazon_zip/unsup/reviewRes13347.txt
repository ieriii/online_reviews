I love Revolution Brewery. It's a really cool spot in Logan Square near a few other fun bars. It's a great date place and even better happy hour spot! The bacon cheddar burger and wide selection of IPAs are amazing. It's also a plus that Revolution's wide selection of beers have a high enough APV, so you only have to buy a couple. The only downside is it's usually very busy, but I actually don't consider this a downside as long as the wait isn't more than an hour. It's perfect if you can get a nice spot at the bar. Very fun. I will definitely be back again soon!!
