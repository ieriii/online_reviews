Finally had the chance to use our Groupon last Wednesday night. The 7 course meal was excellent. The scallop course was unbelievably rich and tasty. I could have ate a whole meal of just that. The lamb course was also very good. The desert was OK but the other table got little doughnuts (benieghs sp?) which would have been the perfect way to finish out the meal. I doubt I will be back anytime soon since the price minus the groupon was still over $150 bucks. The service is incredible and the decor is very minimalist.
