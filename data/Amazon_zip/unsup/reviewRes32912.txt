I asked in the reservation for a server that would be patient and explain the food to us because we were a group of 4 Ethiopian newbies. Our waitress offered no help in explaining the food or answering our questions. We ordered an appetizer only to find it not arrive at all, but our entrees did show up. We asked the server and a host/manager type came over to tell us the appetizer would be removed from our bill and they would send it out anyway. They did not remove it from the bill. There was some great live music, but it was extremely loud from where we were sitting. If you are looking for a food adventure, go to Marigold across the street for Indian, amazing service, great prices, and delicious food. This was not so great.
