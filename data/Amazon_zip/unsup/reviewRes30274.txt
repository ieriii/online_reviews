I love you Chicago Diner!!!! Definately the best black bean burger sweet potato fries and cant forget the carrot cake OMG!!!!! I recently decided to watch what I eat and couldnt figure out how I would do that without missing all the good food and Chicago Diner has helped me see the light!!! Only down fall is that theres only one but I will make the trip everytime!! My boyfriend is hooked on the shakes... Even the cookies are awesome. Ive never had the pleasure of eating in so cant say anything about the table service but everytime we take out its been a very pleasurable experience the staff acknowledges you quick and they start conversations and really help out with the menu options just fun all around.
