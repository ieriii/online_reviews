7.5/10 I'll preface this with, "I'm usually pretty militant about my vegetarianism." But this is a Chicago institution, so I had to try my first Chicago-style dog here in true fashion. I had the Superdawg (with its relish, mustard, onions, green tomatoes and hot peppers on a poppy-seed bun). It was such juicy goodness that if I hadn't gobbled up all of my crispy crinkle fries and downed a heavy, extra-thick chocolate malt... I would have gone for another. The place is gloriously kitsch, and even offers souvenirs. We could have done the car-service, but opted to sit in the little indoor seating area to take everything in. My complaints: it's actually kinda expensive for fast food, and there's waaaay too much packaging for the food itself. It's wasteful - seeing all of these heavy paper products used for mere moments only to go straight into the trash and not be recycled. Superdawg, try to cut down on your waste, save a bundle on your outlay and save the planet at the same time - there's a thought.
