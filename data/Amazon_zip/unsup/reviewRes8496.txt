I love, LOVE this place, and that is just from the carry out. I called tonight to order and was told they don't do phone orders. The pizza takes only 60 to 90 seconds to cook, so when I came in and waited for my order it took about 5 minutes. The owner took my order, he was very nice and offered me a glass of prosecco while I waited.... how cool is that?!?! A free half glass of prosecco. Now I do have to admit, I will caution getting it to go, because the pizza isn't as crisp and gets a little soggy. Yet for some reason I couldn't help myself eating an entire pizza, and the caprese salad.... yeah shhh don't tell anyone that part. I can't wait to go back, but I am eating there... perhaps with a bottle of prosecco as well.
