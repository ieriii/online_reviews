I haven't been here in years, and by years I mean about 5. However, my job used to order a LOT of pizzas from here for inventory, and everyone made sure to hang around just so we could load up on pizza before leaving.  My mom's been coming back here lately because it's cheap and filling and tonight I decided what the heck, I had no patience to cook, why not? Their dinners come with so much food, I don't know how you couldn't be full after. Any slice of pizza is $2.95 (which I still think is a good deal) and I swear, EVERY time I've ever gone in, the same guy is there! Plus, he's friendly. While waiting for my food a massive crowd came out of nowhere and up until the time I got my food (about 25 minutes later), there was a line that would seem to diminish and right before it did, a swarm of people! Personally, I like the pasta dishes...but I'm not hard to please when it comes to pasta, in all honesty. I tried my mom's leftover soup and while I thought it was different than what you'd expect, I thought it was good. Fried chicken? Tasty. Meatball sandwich? Delicious. Manicotti dinner? Ehh...I guess I don't like ALL pasta dishes, but that's because ricotta and I haven't made peace yet.  Regardless, I remember when this place was tiny, and now, it takes up the entire lot. All the workers are friendly and it's good food for cheap. My dinner was $5.25 and it was 4 pieces of chicken, fries, bread and a garden salad. Yeah, I will definitely keep this place in mind when I'm on a budget and I just can't bring myself to cook.
