I live in Andersonville, Uptown actually, work in River North at another restaurant (screen name is just a coincidence). I ate here tonight, probably my 6th or 7th time. Just stupid good, people - go here and often, we need more of this everywhere. I had the Catfish and 2 Abita Turbodogs (beer), and it was the best meal I have had in Chicago in months. I don't really think about all the other restaurant issues (decor, glassware, server uniforms and crap) when I am here, because they put so much into the food, and when they hit it they absolutely hit it. I ordered the apricot tart without the ice cream, and they kitchen "raised an eyebrow". I was at the bar, so I could see them and took the advice, keeping the ice cream where it belongs. Just perfect. Can't say enough good things. Go here, give 'em love. It's tough to do this in this city. I only give 4 out of 5 because the menu needs more focus, but this will come as they see what their hits and misses are. Though I say their hits are so high because of the risks they take. Well done kids.
