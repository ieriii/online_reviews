This is NOT a place you want to go to on a weekend night without a reservation. Who knew you had to make reservations to a pub-like burger place. It is small...dark....and we were a bit creeped out by the walls full of pictures of young ladies from the 70's. Seating is really tight in the middle area...they put way to many tables and not enough space to breathe or move your chair without bumping into someone. Prices were reasonable for the quality and amount you get. Menu is pretty standard..wings, burgers, sandwiches. There is a great (so many choices) salad bar and soup combo. We ordered milkshakes (Strawberry & Oreo)which were great...who cares that they are like a million calories anyways! Many burger options...from bacon..to green pepper. The burgers are a great size.. and the fries are thin cut home-made potato chip like. My mom loved the burger...it also had some great aioli sauce that added great flavor. We also ordered the chicken wings which were crispy and super saucy! Loved them! Overall, just for the food it is a great place for a lunch! Another LEYE restaurant to love!
