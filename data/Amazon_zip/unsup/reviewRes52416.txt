This is another all you can eat place. The meat is very good and the service is generally very good, although one carver carved two ribs right on to my son's shirt and then let the huge knife fly towards him on his next attempt. The server then left the ribs lying on the ground along with the knife and never came back to get them. Warning:They will put a 25% tip on your bill automatically not matter what the size of your, which is outrageous, Also, all soft drinks are by the bottle, no free refills, which adds up after the 25% tip. There are usually coupons in the neighborhood flier for 2 for 1 on nights other than Friday and Saturday.
