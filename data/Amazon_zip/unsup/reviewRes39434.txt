A good place to go for Korean barbecue, but not the best. Open until 5 AM nightly, it's relatively accessible (though not exactly the 24-hours that they claim in the window) with parking that is a bit on the impossible side (at least in their lot - it's quite the cramped lot, especially if it's a busy night). Nothing outstanding, but people are generally nice and attentive. I haven't had any of the wait staff be rude to me at any point, though they don't pay as much attention as I'd like. On the other hand, they've got tasty food, I haven't had a bad cut of meat yet and the appetizers are always plentiful (as it should be) and I appreciate that they use wood chips instead of the gas fire at some places I've been to (which is just icky) - unfortunately the ventilation could stand to be kicked up a notch, but what can you do? I'll just enjoy my 3 AM bulgogi and calbee/kalbi/however the restauarant you're at feels like translating it. Oh, and just so you know, you can't order anything off of the Japanese sections of the menu past, I believe, midnight. I'll also echo the sentiments about paying for the rice, though. That's just a gut punch. At any rate, I'll be back for sure. EDIT : HOLY SHIT THEY REMODELED. It's much easier to sit in now and feels moderately less crowded. Still the same great food, though.
