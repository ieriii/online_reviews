I finally tried Piece. My wife has been there before, she remembers when they were filming that MTV show across the street. That random info aside, we picked up some pizza from there and got our munch on. We got one small 'red' pizza, which is a trad cheese pizza. Johny likey. Also had a plain pepperoni, which is their New Haven style pizza. The latter was decent but I'll admit that my ideal would be a pizza with half as much pizza as the red and plain... I've had New Haven-style pizza before and it's nice but not exactly my fave. I liked the crust a lot and the red pizza was very good. I would say outside of my 2-3 favorite places for East coast style pizza, Piece would be up there with DOC and Apart. Buono Appetito!
