The flavors of the food here are incredibly complex and delicious. I was wonderfully surprised that even on the first visit, they would trust me when I asked for "very hot" and it came out that way. Most restaurants don't trust their patrons on that issue. Opart didn't even ask me if I was sure. I appreciated that. I had the Tod Mun and the panang curry. Both get A++ for the meat. I was only a little disappointed that there were not a bit more vegetables in the curry. But all in all, I'm very impressed and will be back often, I'm sure.
