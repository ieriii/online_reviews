The Schrager crowd all grown up! happy to see a more cosmopolitan crowd and less dancing twenty-somethings in the lobby and hallways upstairs.  Room service from The Pump Room by Jean-Georges is the best room service one can hope for from a hotel. All in all it was a pleasant experience, I enjoyed the residential location as well as the decor and the fact that there is a Jean-Georges outpost on site. Somewhere the tag line "At PUBLIC, service matters most." doesn't quite translate successfully. The staff, although attentive, is not quite there in terms of anticipating a guest's needs. A birthday cake was delivered without silverware or plates to eat it with. A quick call to the front desk solved the problem in less than 10 minutes.  I requested said cake too late in the afternoon the day before my arrival so the hotel was not able to accommodate my request. The concierge was at a loss as well. I had to suggest to her to see if there were any bakeries near by which could come thru. I was able to arrange for the cake from 35,000 feet in the air. I would think that a good concierge would have been able to manage it from less than 1/2 mile away. If the hotel were not to bill itself as a new breed focused on service then I would have given them all 5 stars. But when they are so focused on selling themselves as a service institution and then come short, I simply cannot be an 100% fan.
