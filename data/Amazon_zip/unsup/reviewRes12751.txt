MEAT!!! meat, meeeeat, meaat, more meet? yes, please. i want some meat. bacon wrapped fillet? sirloin? lamb? pork? parmesan chicken? meat! Meat. Meat... did somebody say meat?!?!?! ;) This place is amazing! (although it is pretty pricey). I would recommend signing up for their email newsletter and you will get half off dinner coupons every few months. The meat is unbelievable! I find it one of the best in town. It is pretty salty, but I guess that's normal. I live in Schaumburg and the TdB at Woodfield is really nice too! However, here, they have fresh made sushi, and quite a large selection too! All the selections are fantastic! The salad bar is very filling in itself... but don't make a mistake of satisfying your hunger by just eating salads and cheese, and sushi, and potatoes, and lobster bisque, and cold meats, and nuts, and bacon, and bread... yes! They do have a huge selection by the salad bar, but you do not want to stuff yourself because you will miss out on some great meats! As for the drinks! Delicious!!! Strong, but very well mixed, stirred, and shaken! Bellini Brazilian martini is a dessert in itself!
