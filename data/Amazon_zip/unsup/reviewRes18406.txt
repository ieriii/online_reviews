I've got no complaints about Xoco other than: Come to the East coast! And that's not really a complaint, just, you know, a demand... Awesome salsa and guacamole (but a bit pricey at around $7, I think) although it came with the best tortilla chips ever! Perfect thickness and totally fresh. Yum. The torta ahogada (~11) came in a delicious spicy tomato-y broth that was great for dipping your tortilla chips as well and we also had the shortrib torta (because they had run out of the day's special of al pastor! :( ) Honestly, couldn't tell you which torta I loved more. Each had that perfect crusty fresh-baked bread, which has become my ideal bread for sandwiches, and the meaty/veggie/cheesy/saucy filling just melded together so that the sandwich just tasted of delicious. What else could you ask for? Also, one churro at $1.50= best churro ever. It tastes like they put vanilla sugar or something on top too? I know it's usually cinnamon sugar but definitely tasted some vanilla which made it unique. I'd definitely come again next time I'm in Chicago!
