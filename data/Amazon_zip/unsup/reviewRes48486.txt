Simply delightful. Amazing choices, cool atmosphere, great service - What's not to like? Meat-centric dining but the vegetables were the standouts to me. Had a true Seaonsal Fall dining experience. We tried the 3 Hams, Ribs, Homemade Pork Rinds, Brussel Sprouts, Acorn Squash, Cauliflower, Cheeses for dessert, Beer, Wine...really enjoyed ALL of it. Not a clunker in the bunch. Farm fresh, slightly European in feel... Energetic atmosphere but still laid back at the same time. Portions can be manipulated to eat a multi-course meal or just to enjoy small plates with some drinks. If you haven't been what are you waiting for?
