First, let me say this....They ruined the place by remodeling. Its like a HS gym with tables and Mexican decor. Way too big and way too loud. And no music playing?? The service is slow and indifferent. The prices are too high for the quality of food. The burritos are HUGE but unfortunately have no taste and are VERY greasy.  I got a steak burrito suiza and my partner got pork/steak combo burrito. Both of us were severely disappointed. The meat tastes like nothing...literally. Has this place ever heard of seasoning? Also after cutting mine in half, my plate was a pool of grease. Gross. French fries were undercooked and the the margaritas sucked as well. Definitely from a prefab mix. Again, gross. The bottom line? There are way too many good options in the city for good (and cheap) Mexican food to bother going back to Garcia's.
