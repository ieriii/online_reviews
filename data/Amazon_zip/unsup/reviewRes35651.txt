Oh Shaw's, why are you all the way over there when I'm in California? Why couldn't your selection of scrumptious raw oysters and tasty loaves of bread be closer to me? It's pretty hard to get full on oysters but when you throw caution to the wind and order up an obscene amount of them, it's possible. And it's so worth it.
