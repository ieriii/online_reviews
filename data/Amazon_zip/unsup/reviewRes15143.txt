it seems that there are so many fantastic new places sprouting up in chicago. i consider revolution one of them. love the atmosphere. it would be great for a group because there's lots of seating. the only problem with that is that they don't take reservations. i tried one of their house beers, and loved it. looking forward to going back when the crowds die down. if that happens.
