Made my first appearance here on Friday. The place is ENORMOUS. I had no idea, i was told that it is around 35k sq ft. The drinks are great, we tried a few of their specialty drinks which were all very good. The food there is outstanding, we had the Ropa Vieja and the Filet. A's across the board. The service could not have been better. I will be going back for sure, probably very soon. The Ropa Vieja is a must try.
