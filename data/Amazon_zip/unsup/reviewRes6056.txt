okay, I have to update my review, as I went back to Davanti like 5 hours after I wrote it. Most of the menu had changed for the winter, and I was disappointed...then I ate, and I was not even close to disappointed. The butternut squash salad with farro and goat cheese cream was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth, and I put lots of things in my mouth. Also, we got the ragu, which was milk braised pork shoulder. Always get the ragu...just for the marscapone polenta alone, but the ragu is always amazing. Next, we had the octopus with horseradish aioli and fingerling potatoes. The octopus must have been cooked for forever, because it was so tender it was like cream. Always get the cheese plate, and whatever has the word truffle in it will clearly send a taste-bud freak out to your synapses. Also...always get the Cacio e pepe as your pasta dish...it's delightfully simple and just a great mid-meal course. Two great bottles of wine, 5 dishes, cheese plate, 3 friends, 40 bucks each. I don't think you can ask for much better, honestly.
