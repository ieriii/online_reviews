Gorgeous, gorgeous interior. This place seemed to be styled after an old English parlor. On one of the coldest nights of the year (so far...), I had the luxury to spend a few hours in the 'Library' with a beautiful girl and several glasses of wine. Comfy chairs, decent service, and decadent bathrooms make this place a must-see. (Yes, I described the bathroom as decadent.) However, avoid the whiskey wings like the plague unless you like bland wings with a sweet-yet-tasteless sauce. I will definitely be back to enjoy the much-talked-about food.
