My husband took me here for my birthday this past Saturday, June 13, 2009. The food was amazing!!!! The service was very good also. Our server took the time to describe different dishes to us. It was a little slow, but then I realized it was because people sat around a loooooooong time when they were done. The signature drinks are better than the martini's and the seating is tight. Don't be afraid to be close to others. You may even be able to hear their conversation. Definitely worth it!!!! We will be back! Side note, they have specials throughout the week for really good deals to.
