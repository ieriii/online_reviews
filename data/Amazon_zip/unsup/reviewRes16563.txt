First its an adventure to find the place. You may walk by a few times as we accidentally did. The door is cut out of the main wall and blends in perfectly, Once you get in you'll go through a series of purple curtains until you reach the actual bar. We had to wait a few minutes but they took our number and called us when they were ready for us a service I love! Once we were finally seated it felt like I was in Alice in Wonderland. The chairs have huge backs that kind of keep you blocked from the rest of the bar. It provides a semi private setting with only using the chairs. The lighting everything leads to a romantic night. And finally to the best part of the place. The cocktails. The menu is mouthwatering with hundreds of different concoctions. Some with odd ingredients like egg whites, but everything we had was absolutely delicious. The drinks were perfectly mixed and although the price tag was steep it was well worth every dollar. We got the hummus appetizer, pretty bland all around I wouldn't suggest it. Overall I can't wait to go back to this place. It reminds me of a super private club with the setting and actual entrance and you feel like a vip once inside. I definitely recommend it to anyone who can stomach $12 a drink.
