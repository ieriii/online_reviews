Get the Old Fashion, I got many.Brunch is good, dinner is better. Try to bone marrow. It's absolutely delicious and strangely satisfying to spoon it out of a sawed off femur (I'm guessing on the anatomy).I've found the staff very helpful. My girlfriend and I went there on a slammed Valentines Day night and waited about an hour for a table. The staff took our number while we went to another restaurant for a drink and called us when our table was ready. That's much more than I can say for other local establishments.I appreciate their adventurous dishes. It's really a pleasure
