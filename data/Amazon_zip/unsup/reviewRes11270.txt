In terms of boutique brunch/lunch options in Wicker Park, The Bongo room has been around longer than just about any others and maintained their quality and appeal. Interesting savory/sweet options for lunch, and great croissant sandwiches and amazing pancakes. A touch sweet at times, but always delicious. Priced just right--I've never walked out with even a slight tinge of regret. The weekends are pretty packed for brunch unless you miss the rush or go during a big game or weekend event. But lunch during the week is always a great experience. Good for groups of 3 to 4, since the majority of seating is small table tops and a few booths.
