What a wonderful place! I'm been meaning to stop in for dinner for a while and finally went to one of fixed-price saturday dinners a few weeks ago. The dining room itself is really cozy, our server was wonderful and the food itself was unbelievable. Out of the 5 courses we had only one minor complaint - the pumpkin soup could have used a wee bit less cinnamon. The main course (braised shortribs) was supremely tender- the meat practically fell off the bone as I was just looking at them. I love the fact that they are BYOB since I am on a budget-plus the corkage fee is really reasonable. ($5 per bottle) The only thing that I think could be improved about the whole restaurant is the website layout, if you've never been to the cafe and try to get an impression off the site its a little amateurish, it honestly was holding me back from visiting the restaurant sooner. But now that I've been won over by the wonderful food and friendly service I will be back very soon!
