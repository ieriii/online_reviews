So sorry for such a late review but I'd been procrastinating in joining Yelp for the longest. This was, incontrovertibly, the top of my list for creativity and food. It is second only to Daniel in NYC (http://www.danielnyc.com) for the amount of scratch I'd spent in one sitting. No need to go through the courses as it changes periodically. Just go with an open mind and you'll be rewarded with something celestial. If you are in Chicago and want to splurge on an extraordinary experience? Alinea is your best bet. You shan't forget it.
