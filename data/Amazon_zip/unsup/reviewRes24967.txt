My food was good and my wife's food was pretty good, but I need to say that I think it's ridiculous that they charge $.75 to make something "spicy." It's not about the price, because clearly, if I'm going out to eat, I can afford 75 cents. However, has anyone EVER heard of a restaurant charging for something to be "spicy?" I put that word in quotations because it was not even remotely spicy!
