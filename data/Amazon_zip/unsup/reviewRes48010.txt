I just ate here tonight, Five stars all the way! The staff is incredibly friendly, you feel so welcome just walking through the door. The ambiance is cool and hip - which I love and actually hadn't known what to expect. I ordered a porter and the server accidentally brought me an IPA which I drank without paying attention to. I asked about it because I was just curious and he asked me if i hadn't ordered it - I told him honestly no but I didn't mind, it was good. He took it off my tab - he didn't have to do that at all. I was obviously enjoying it and was just curious where it was from. Being in Chicago and from the Bay Area, I didn't want any seafood because most of it came from Half Moon Bay/Monterey. Everything I got was from Illinois and I appreciated the fact they had it written next to the menu. I started with the spice pork rinds which were really good - my mom would have loved them. I wish I could have sent them home to her. The frites with fried eggs on top are good, but honestly out of everything phenomenal there, I really could have done without it. Now the stars of the show were a Tomato dish with feta and other deliciousness (maybe a chmichurri sauce). The tomatoes were so fresh I couldn't believe it, it was almost like they were home grown. And then the pork belly, it was cooked to perfection in polenta with fresh currents and dandelion greens. Dandelion greens are really bitter if you have them on their own, but paired with a bite of pork belly, polenta and currents, it was amazing. The bitterness is gone and it just turns into a savory bite of one of the most delicious things you've ever eaten. I really want to go back to the Publican, but its honestly the first place I've tried in Chicago so I might have to give it a minute. But I do want to come back to Chicago just for it.
