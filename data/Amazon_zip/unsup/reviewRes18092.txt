Amazing!! My sister took my whole family (including my grandparents) here last week and we loved it!!! Great place for dates too, although it can be a bit pricey even though it's BYOB. My suggestions: -Share entrees if your with a special someone, or bistro style if your with a large group. -Order ANYTHING with the gravy looking Porcinni Mushroom Sauce. -Take suggestions from the wait staff (Caesar is awesome!!!) -Bring Chianti, a nice red, or Pinot Grigio if you like whites. Red wine will totally enhance your meal here, especially if you're trying multiple dishes. Go soon, while you still can. Weekdays are best. This place has just been recently reviewed in the Red Eye, and they also turned down Check, Please! b/c they don't want to have outrageous wait times....Good for you, Caro Mio!!!
