Amazing!!! We went for special Occasion and the service was impeccable. The waiter greeted us at the table with glasses of champaign which was a nice a classy way to celebrate (vs. a big ole happy birthday song and dance). Food was really well done and the presentation was great. I would go back again and again just for the grilled cheese and the Octopus. Five stars all the way.
