I love this place. It's convenient and delicious. Never a long wait for a table and the entrees have good portions for a great price. I'm always pleasantly satiated with gnocchi aurora, which is basically carbs in carbs, and the BV Pescare. And the food is at your table within minutes. De-lish!  Last year, I actually ended up sitting one table over from Jenna Fischer, who most people know as Pam from "The Office." Didn't think it was her until I asked on her MySpace (like a crazy stalker) and she confirmed! Apparently she loves this place and so do I. Jim and Pam forever! And the Pasta Bowl, too!
