This place is pretentious overpriced and the staff are assholes. The bouncer there (a large african american man) was very rude. I was concerned because large grenades walked past the line and he let them in. I am much cuter and was of course suprised that these ugly ass people could get in before me. When I brought this to the attention of the bouncer (who was wearing a really ugly tuxedo) he copped an attitude with me. I said, "look you don't have to bee an asshole about it." he said "well you can just leave now" and I did. There are better places to go and spend my money.
