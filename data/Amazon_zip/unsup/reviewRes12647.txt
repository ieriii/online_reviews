Almond crusted halibut with jalapeno mashed potatoes? Yes please! Not a fish eater but I crave this dish all the time.  I've never had a bad meal here. Service has always been fantastic and I've been here with parties ranging from 2-20 people. I don't live in the area so I don't get up here as often as I'd like and really want to try their brunch. But their mojotios are delicious and that says it all.
