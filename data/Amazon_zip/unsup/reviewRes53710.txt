Staggering home from a night of drinking with the east side frenz, I practically lick the window of crisp.Closed? At 11?The worst thing about Crisp is that it isn't open at those times you need it the most. WHo can resist the fried chicken (I take mine spicy, spicy, spicy), especially when you have a belly full of booze needing to be sopped up?
