Beautiful all the way around. I waited for service a little longer that usually, hence the four stars. The place is breathtaking, and the food to die for. I used to come here regularly in college for the coffee, desserts, and wine. Whether you come here for the cheese platter and wine, or coffee and dessert, this cafe has it all. The staff is very friendly. The dessert selection (being a baker myself) is to die for. Recommend the baklava. Also, the pizzas are delicious.
