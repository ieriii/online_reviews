Been here many late nights - now open until 5am. This is one of my favorite places for Korean BBQ, especially since they are one of few places that use a charcoal grill. The meat just cooks that much better and you get the flavor from the charcoal. Their kalbi (marinated short ribs) is marinated perfectly and you get tons of side dishes. I also love the kalbi-tang, which is soup made with the short rib bones and some meat.
