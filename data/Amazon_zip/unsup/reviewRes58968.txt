First time visiting and we were being treated to dinner before seeing a play. Loved the ambiance of the place! Asked our server for what I wanted in a wine, and she brought out something right on key! The Chilean Sea Bass - divine! I don't eat sushi, but tried the Caterpiller and it was exquisite! I ordered the Thai fried chicken and though it was good, I was disappointed. I ordered because I love the take of coconut in my food - I barely tasted the coconut. Everything else was wonderful - I will be visiting again!
