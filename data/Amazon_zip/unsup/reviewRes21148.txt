This place is defiantly legitimate! There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in the Lakeview area, but have found most of them to serve less than stellar food. This is defiantly one of the exceptions (along with El Mariachi). The only weird thing for me was their party room, down a long narrow hallway, behind the restaurant so to speak. It looks like a small place from the entrance, but there is a big room in back too The Service: It was spot on and the waitress was really nice. Defiantly pushing those $39 margarita pitchers! The Food: We had the Chorizo Fundito for an appetizer, spot on. I had the steak fajitas, tasty! One friend had some type of shrimp dish and enjoyed it too. I would go back, beware- the marg's are strong!
