First off, I'm not a huge fan of red meat. In fact, I occasionally ponder about turning vegetarian. Therefore, when my friends suggested this place a few months ago for a GNO, I was a little hesitant. In hindsight, I'm so glad I found the courage to go. The tender beef (#18 on the menu) is one of the reasons I can never become a vegetarian. The beef is just oh-so-tender, and the marinade is awesome! My boyfriend and I have returned a couple of times since and have tried some more meats, including the bacon, but we always are sure to simultaneously order the tender beef since it's 10x more flavorful. Also, the Fusion roll is always fresh and tasty. The service? I suppose it's a hit or miss. One pro is that they are attentive enough to always keep the drinks full. Cons? Sometimes they are aggressive in grabbing the grill tongs from you as you're cooking (just grab them back). One time they reached over us on the table to grab the lettuce and put the meat and toppings on for us to show us how they suggested we eat, but we just told them to stop. LOL. If you're stern, they back off. My personality doesn't have an issue with this, but I can see where this may be a drawback for some. Overall, the tender beef is wonderful and deserves 4 stars alone.
