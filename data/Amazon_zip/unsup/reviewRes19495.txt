Wow. I wasn't expecting it to be so busy on a weekday! I guess it WAS the Friday before Memorial Day weekend. Because of timing constraints, we sat at the bar for lunch rather than wait until our reservation could be filled. I went for the Gage burger, which comes dressed with camembert cheese, onion marmalade, and the usual lettuce, tomato, and pickle.  Talk about a hearty burger! The cheese was delicious, and I liked the onion marmalade, but there was a surprise. ... orange zest in the onion marmalade. While it was light and mildly refreshing, the burger could have done without it. Camembert and onion marmalade is zesty enough for me. Even though there were only 2 people manning the long bar over the busy lunch hour, service was attentive. I wish the Gage served brunch every day, as Scotch eggs and stuffed french toast sounds good any day of the week.
