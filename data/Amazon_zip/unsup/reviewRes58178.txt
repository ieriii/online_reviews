The menu is a little confusing: On one side you get really basic descriptions of dishes--Scallps, Steak,--and on the other side you get full descriptions of other dishes. I especially enjoyed the octopus with paprika, bacon-wrapped dates and arroz cangrejo. The sea bass was also excellent. Our waiter could not adequately explain the menu, but all the dishes are small and not that pricey, so order many of them. We got our first batch of dishes--goat cheese mixto, ham and fig salad, etc--within fifteen minutes of ordering. But the wild sea bass took an hour to come. Try the spiced strawberry sorbet--akin to the lime-tequila sorbet at Salpicon, it starts fruity and ends with a pleasant burst of heat. Wow!
