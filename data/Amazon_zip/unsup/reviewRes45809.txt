This is a nice downtown establishment right at the heart of Michigan Avenue. While I do think some of the dinner options are bit pricey, the mini bites menu is perfect for price and portions. The beignets are to die for!  I recommend this place for families and shoppers looking for a bite to eat while enjoying the Mag Mile.
