A uniformly amazing, thoroughly manly, decadent dining option. Some highlights: -Beer list is justifiably legendary, and changes with regularity. Went here two nights ago for a drink and ordered a Weihenstephaner, went back last night for dinner and it had already been rotated out. Still, Bell's Octoberfest, North Coast Old #38 Stout, and Autumn Maple (10.5% alcohol) did not disappoint by any stretch of the imagination -Oysters on the half shell were all delicious and noticeably different in taste from one another. The same can be said about the "Taste of Three hams" -Duck liver pate is rich, has an unexpected yet very pleasant mustardy bite, and is served with, but not overwhelmed by, currants -Anchovies are fresh rather than canned, and cooked whole like smelts. Delicious -Hangar steak is perfectly cooked and complemented surprisingly well by feta and blueberries -Country rib is seared to a delectable crisp and melts like butter when you cut it with a fork -Desserts (nectarine tart with salted caramel ice cream, waffle with vanilla ice cream and rosemary syrup) are surprisingly worth saving room for. -Inside decor is like a classed-up German beer hall, but having said that, on a nice night opt for dining outside. Worth any extra wait. Paul Kahan is a true magician with his restaurants, and the Publican is no exception. Every bite is amazing. A worthy splurge and an absolute can't miss Chicago dining experience.
