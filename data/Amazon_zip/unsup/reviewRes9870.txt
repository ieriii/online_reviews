We went to Le Colonial for a birthday celebration. I'd never been there but my girlfriend had been raving about the place after a business dinner. I now understand and agree with her. The decor is French-Indochina colonial, tables are closely set but there is no lack of privacy for diners. Service was as good or better than any place else in Chicago; attentive without being in your face. And the food was superb. I tend to be a Chicago guy: steak, hotdogs, pizza and Italian beef but this place encourages and rewards trying new tastes. Sadly, there was no doggie bag. Happily, there was nothing to put in the doggie bag anyway. Many thumbs up!
