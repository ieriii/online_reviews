I wanted to give this place one star so badly due to the awful service and my fiance's meal, but I give it two to be just in the review, as the coffee was great.....that I had to actually ask if it is free refills as they never once (aside from the time I had to ask, after my cup had been empty for 10 minutes) refilled my cup/came by to ask how everything was/if we needed anything, etc.My fiance and I ordered omelets, in the middle of his were TONS of onions, which he didn't notice at first, as the start of the omelet was just egg - he had ordered cheese and sausage (incidentally, to add sausage or another meat to the already average sized omelet, is 2.99). Onions are neither of our friends. Pros: They offer wide array of cheese including goat cheese      Coffee (and cream) is some of the best I have had *Note* I am not a coffee snob :)       Decor was pretty neatCons: Service: Slow, not friendly, and we waited 15 minutes without seeing our waitress AFTER we had been done eating, actually had to leave, leaving a 20, which would have paid for our drinks and my meal, as we would not have paid for my fiance's meal under any circumstance, as we didn't even have the opportunity to accept a new omelet/Everyone ignored us       Satisfaction: Wrong meal for my fiance, my meal was just average       Price: Way too high for what you are getting, organic or notStay away would be my advice unless you're really desperate for a breakfast place that has goat cheese and Indian flare
