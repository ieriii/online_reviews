I had been wanting to go to Hopleaf for quite awhile. So, on our "vacation" day in the city the husband and I met some friends for mussels and beer.  We ordered the mussels for two and beers to start. Since the portion is not that much more than the mussels for one it was great for a starter. The mussels come to the table in a pot filled with white wine, celery, onions and bay leaves. The mussels were a great texture but I thought the broth had a Thanksgiving taste to them. I think I prefer an Italian style. The mussels also come with an enormous funnel of frites. I used to think that the fries at DMK Burger were my favorite but these are hands down the best fries I have ever had.  We moved on to the CB&J and macaroni and cheese. It was really good and I was happy that my friend shared it with me. The sandwich tastes like a warm fig newton with cheese. An unlikely but delicious combination. The mac and cheese was good. I was glad I could taste the blue cheese.  I also sampled a bit of a side salad and other appetizers. All good but nothing that memorable.  The beer list can be overwhleming. I was hoping for a bit more guidance from the waitress.  I would go back if someone else wanted to but, I feel like I tried enough on the menu so I can move on to somewhere else.
