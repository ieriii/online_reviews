Only four stars? What does it take to get five stars in this city? I've lived here all my adult life, and if this place isn't a five-star place, then there's no such thing. Better food, and bigger quantities than you'll get anywhere else. Impeccable service and a romantic, truly romantic, atmosphere. By the way, you have to get there early and get a booth. Otherwise it can be kind of cramped. But if you don't do that, then it's your own damn fault 'cause you've been warned.
