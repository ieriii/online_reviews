Ordered the millman burger and the uncommon chopped salad...the waitress came back to the table and said that they stopped ordering ingredients for the millman but hadn't updated the menu yet. We ordered the black angus half pound burger instead...DElicious! The juices were running down my hand. The salad was wonderful too but $15 for a salad...yipes. I love it here but I think everything needs to come down in price and then the restaurant will be PACKED with people. Try the sidecar too, fresh and tart yummy apple slices are a nice surprise. I want to give this place 5 stars but the prices are too high~
