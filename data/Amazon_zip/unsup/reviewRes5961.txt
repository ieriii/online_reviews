Absolutely loved this place! I came here last month with my boyfriend, it was our first time there, we made reservations online, but when we got there on time, we still had to wait a little bit for them to set up the table, so it seemed like the reservation was pointless which is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Our waiter was so friendly, I don't remember his name but he was a Hispanic but very knowledgeable, especially with the wine, he talked to us about the wine for about 10-15 minutes, and let us sample wine with different food we were eating and gave us really good tips. The food was really good, wine excellent, service beautiful, atmosphere lovely. I would really enjoy coming back here more often. Our new date spot.
