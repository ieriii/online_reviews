The food is lovely. Serive. Oh lord where do I start. The previous yelp about missing wine bottles doesn't surprise me. It happens A LOT THERE. Oh and don't plan on enjoying your meal UNLESS you tell them right away "I WILL BE HERE AWHILE. DO NOT RUSH ME" You might as well spell it out. They will push you out as quick as they can. The servers are horrid. Rude, Rude, and Rude! The male host is super nice though! Love him. I went with some friends and the server took so long to bring our wine to the table that our dessert had come and gone. She then tried to say they don't "allow" wine after the meal. Well i'm a bit of an HBIC so I let her know that we ordered our wine BEFORE the dessert and that I wouldn't apologize for her slow service. She was very irriated that she had to give us our wine post food removal from the table. That shouldn't have been a discussion in the first place. You screwed up, just bring the wine out and let us finish our meal in happiness with one another. All in all Wakamono. Get better servers. THE SERVERS YOU HAVE ARE RUDE.
