A friend referred this Greek restaurant and mentioned we couldn't find anything better. When we arrived there was free valet parking - thats a plus! Once inside, we were promptly seated. We ordered the Flaming Saganaki Cheese for an appetizer. It was fantastic. I'm not sure how hard it is to mess up, but I thought I was eating creamy melted butter. For dinner my mom and I ordered Dolmades (Grape leaves stuffed with ground meat & rice, topped with an egg-lemon sauce). Until this day, I had never eaten dolmades. I LOVED them! I was soooo stuffed after eating. My boyfriend didn't care for the dolmades because he didn't like the grape leaves. He ordered homemade gyros and said he's "had better"... looks like someone was a little sour! Next time I visit a greek restaurant (or Greek Island) I will order lamb.  Overall, Greek Island had wonderful hospitality, good food, and festive ambiance.
