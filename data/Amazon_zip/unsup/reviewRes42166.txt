You must try the mussels - they were amazing! My sister and I ate at Gilt on a weeknight and were impressed by the extremely-attentive service - consistently checking on us, re-filling our water, and explaining the menu/food as it came out. We made reservations and when we got in early, the staff had no problem seating us about 15 minutes before our reservation although the restaurant was nearly full. There were a few large business groups as well as several couples having a more intimate meal, but the noise level was extremely quiet for the amount of people at Gilt. I'd definitely bring a group back for cocktails or a late-night snack, and it's a great date place, too.
