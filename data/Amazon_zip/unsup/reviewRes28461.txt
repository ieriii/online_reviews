This is one of those frustrating places where I think for every stellar element or thing they do right there is something else done badly that wipes it right out. And it is never the same two things they screw up. I have been here a half dozen times with two mediocre experiences, two very good experiences and two terrible meals to show for it. At this price level and as long as they've been around the consistency is not what I would expect in either the food or the service.  Much of the food is outstanding and relatively unique and the service is usually fine. It is certainly possible to get an excellent meal here. But cold or bad tasting food (room temperature steak that took an hour and stringy duck at these prices? Please!) and terrible service are far from unknown here, so I can't help but think it's overrated and only grudgingly give it three stars. There isn't much in the way of value here and the margaritas in particular are a rip, though admittedly quite tasty. Be prepared to wait, and also be willing to ask yourself at the end of the meal "why did I wait so long?"
