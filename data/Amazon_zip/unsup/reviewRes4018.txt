Finally got a meal in last night after having our reservations canceled by them twice before. Really I think the hype surrounding it is a bit overkill. The atmosphere was far more subdued than I was led to believe, though I suppose it could be different on any given night and time. The food was, of course, "good"... Beyond that, the dishes were certainly interesting and creative. I like simple flavors so some of the bites that contained a million different ingredients were a bit lost on me, but a great experience nonetheless, and definitely unlike anything I've had before, although what could I even compare it to? And the famous quail egg ravioli... It does me great sorrow to report I could taste little else than butter. However, I was assured by one of my companions that the dish was not up to the standard she had experienced multiple times before. At one point I was walking through the kitchen and Michael asked, "How you doing, still with us?" The entire staff was staring at me. I responded, "Terrible," and then went to the bathroom. Thankfully, I'm pretty sure he understands sarcasm.
