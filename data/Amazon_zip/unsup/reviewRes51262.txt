Placed an order for pick up and specifically said NO SOUR CREAM....what do I get in my torta de asada when I open it sour cream! This place sucks, the service sucks and they don't follow directions. Last time I ate there we were seated, and waited about 10 minutes before I can flag down someone to help and when I did the man yelled out as he passed by "someone will be with you shortly." Umm no I need to order ASAP and find me someone now! Totally rude, this staff should be trained because their customer service skills are HORRIBLE! What's the point on having a remodeled restaurant when the staff lacks kindness! Send them all to train, no sirven para nada! Don't eat here people, save your pennies and try Hay Caramba in Park Ridge, best margaritas!
