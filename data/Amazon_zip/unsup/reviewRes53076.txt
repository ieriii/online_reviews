For customer service I give it 5 stars! They have an outstanding staff and I really love what they've done with the place. That alone will have me coming back, love great customer service! I sadly did have to knock off one star for the food I felt the portion was adequate, the way they plated it was very appetizing but as far as flavor, it lacked and I don't eat salt but had to add some to enhance it. I had the lechon (loved the way they shredded it) and my husband had the ropa vieja, we also had tostones. Our work neighbor is in love with their maduros and has gone back a few times. The patio was nice and clean, a little tight on the inside but ok. Their lot is small but street parking was not a problem, overall it was a good experience.
