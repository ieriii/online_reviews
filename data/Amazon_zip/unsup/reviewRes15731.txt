Carnivale is a wonderful place to go to. The decor is amazing with all the beautiful colors and the food is great too. If you go here you MUST try the Ropa Vieja. Next time I come here I think I am just going to order 3 of these and call it a day. The Ropa Vieja is sweet plantains, braised beef, spicy mayo and queso fresco. It is Amazing! Everything else I tried was also very good, but I can't stop talking about how amazing the Ropa Vieja was. SOOOOOO TASTY.
