Woohoo! 5 big red stars. Hands down. You must be crazy not to love this place. A friend and fellow Yelper Aurore L. and I went for lunch, sat in the cozy wine cellar, and dined on the following AMAZING Italian delicacies: - Il Pizzino Robiola (aged, soft, aromatic cheese) - Roasted cherry tomato + burrata + basil pesto - Roasted beets + walnut butter + creme fraiche + candied walnuts - Risotto Carbonara (Italian rice, pancetta, sweet peas, parmigiano, and farm egg yolk) - Pizza dalla Terra (foraged mushrooms, braised leeks, taleggio, and truffle oil) *see photos* The roasted beet salad and the risotto carbonara were my favorites.  The prices are totally reasonable for the high quality ingredients -- much of what I'm sure is imported directly from Europe. The wine selection is outstanding and many bottles are priced in the $10-$15 range.  Davanti has just been added to my list of all-time favorite Chicago restaurants. :) Mangia! Mangia! Mangia!
