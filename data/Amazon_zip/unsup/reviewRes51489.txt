This place is huge now, I haven't been since last April. Great for late night chicken burrito with cheese, avocado, and sour cream. The $1.50 quesadilla is bite-sized, you should be warned! Lots of chips and salsa and if you get the guacamole there is a lot of that also!! Nice helpers, but the waitress was terrible, I didn't see her after she took the order. The guys did all the work and deserve the tip!! I want to try the burrito with melted cheese next time, it looks delicious!!
