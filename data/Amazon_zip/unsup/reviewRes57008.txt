I have dined at all the brazillian steak houses in chicago (Foga, Brazzaz, etc) and Texas de Brazil is by far the best out of all of them. you get endless amounts of meat, the drinks are great, and the service is awesome. It is a little expensive but you get more than enough food for what you pay. For a little tip of advise, if you fill out the survey after you are done eating or if you sign up on-line to there email list you will receive great money saving coupons (like buy one entree mon-thurs get one free)
