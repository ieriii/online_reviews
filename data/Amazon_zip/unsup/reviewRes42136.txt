Had a fun night out here at Gilt Bar - even though the rest of my party was more than 20 minutes late (and we were supposed to lose our table), the hostess was really accommodating and we were still able to get seated (peak hour on a Saturday night!). Great start! While I was waiting for my friends, I sat at the bar and downed 2 Palomas - which were delicious, and from watching the bartender apparently a huge pain in the a** to make. The drinks are fun and taste really good, and of course are probably overpriced for what it's worth - but no more than any other place in this area. Got the pork belly which was sooo tender. I didn't find it very pork-y (as some of the other reviewers have said) and the entire dish went really well together. I was full, but the rest of the girls got pasta dishes and they were still hungry afterwards. Good thing the husband didn't come - we would've had to stop at Burger King on the way home. The fries are amazing. We got 2 orders and wanted more. The desserts were so-so. I wasn't blown away - spend your money on another drink instead. We wanted to check out the bar downstairs, but it was full and CASH ONLY. Oh well.
