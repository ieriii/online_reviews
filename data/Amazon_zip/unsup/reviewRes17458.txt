A great new addition to Chicago...very cool and fun atmosphere, tasy eclectic food, and great service. I've come here for dinner a few times, but even more often just to get drinks at the bar with a bunch of friends. The bar attracts a bit of an older crowd, which we really enjoy. If you haven't been to Carnivale yet make a reservation ASAP because you're missing out.
