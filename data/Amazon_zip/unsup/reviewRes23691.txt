My favorite restaurant in Chinatown after trying a dozen of them! I am Chinese-American and grew up with a mom who cooked authentic home dishes every night. This place somehow preserves that homey, "made-with-love" taste with that special, restaurant taste too. I have never ordered anything here that was just "meh," it's all soo good..and spicy!
