I LOVE this place! I went for brunch today after a long hiatus. It was as good as I remember it. The brunch menu could be a little more extensive, but everything we ordered (biscuits + gravy, five-egg omelette w/ sweet potato hash) was excellent. It was a little loud for brunch w/ my mom w/ the Bears game in the background, but that was my mistake. Otherwise, great service and fantastic food as always.  Replying to other comments, the nachos are pretty awesome. The sliders are also great.
