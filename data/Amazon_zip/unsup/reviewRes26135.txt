Service matters. As everybody else has said, the food here is fantastic. I went with a group of friends during Restaurant Week and shared a bunch of Prix Fixe menus. Delicious cheese plate; mushroom soup was AMAZING; loved the salad; desserts were all top-notch (maybe too rich after all the delicious food!) I can't comment on the meat/seafood items but everybody seemed pleased (I think they had scallops, short ribs, and a few other things) The problem was with our waiter. We were a group of 20-something grad students out for a prix fixe- maybe he assumed we would be bad tippers? In any case, he seemed very frazzled and inattentive. My salad didn't come for close to 20 minutes, at which point I had to flag down a bus boy to ask for it. Nonetheless, I worked in the food service industry for long enough that I tip 20% standard unless something is *really* wrong. So I did. We had spread the tab equally across 5 credit cards; I quietly tipped a couple dollars more than the others (who, it should be noted, were all tipping at least 15%). At the end of the meal, our waiter came to the table where he blatantly read our credit cards slips RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. ummm what? I'm no Emily Post, but that is some bad etiquette. He then said, very pointedly, "thank you [my name]" to me alone, and left. Last I checked, you thank people for patronizing your restaurant when they could have chosen to go any number of places, NOT because you consider their tip sufficient for your (frankly sub-par) service. Again, the food was delicious, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not be back.
