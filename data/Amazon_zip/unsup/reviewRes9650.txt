I am so excited about how amazingly delicious Sprout is. I am a huge Top Chef fan and have been so looking forward to trying out Chef Dale Levitski's new venture. My boyfriend and I came here for our valentine dinner since Sunday was not an option for us and I am so glad that this was our choice. Mark was our server and more than helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. We decided on the Prix Fixe menu since Im sure we would have ordered more food than we could handle otherwise. We also brought our own bottled of wine and paid the $15 bottle fee. Me: Scallop, Venison, Pineapple Him: Veal, Short rib, Lemon The little extras: Blood orange and sparkling riesling shaved ice and "grown up" grilled cheese with red onions, apple and a raisin mustard with tasting of Sauvignon Blanc (A perfect pairing). Wow and wow. I mean, holy crap!!! Perfect textures and complex, layered flavors, made our meals absolute delights. I couldnt figure out the puree for the venison only to find out it was the cauliflower. Small hints of cinnamon, a little chestnut and prunes were absolutely perfect flavor combinations. It will be hard to try something different when I go next time! I will definitely recommend it to everyone I know and make it a point to bring in friends from out of town. I know that its his place, but it was still great seeing Dale walking about talking to tables as well as in the kitchen. I will be back. . . . oh yeah. . . Bambi never tasted so good. . .
