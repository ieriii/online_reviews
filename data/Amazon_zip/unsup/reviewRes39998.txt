Such a fun place,I think it's fun to bb que your own meat,and the meat is high quality too.they bring out a whole bunch of different sides to have with the meat,so a good value for the price,the place gets crowded,but the place is big enough,that you still get privacy,and enjoy your meal there.we would've given this place five stars,except the bathroom was in dirty,tiles missing,and.....and.....no tissue,like no paper at all,good thing I only needed to wash my hands,lol.
