Without question, one of the finest steakhouses in town. I've dined here at least a half-dozen times, and certainly will again. Most importantly, the steaks are just outstanding, with good selection, good cuts, excellent taste. In addition, the service is top notch - always available but never too imposing. And the ambiance is nice too, with a fresher, more laid-back style than most Chicago steak joints. Give this place a try and you won't regret it. Not inexpensive, but ranks right up there with the better-known steakhouses in a very steak-friendly city.
