I ordered delivery from here the other day and it was ok. They do have a unique selection of rolls, but for the price and the quality (or lack there of) with regular rolls, I'd go elsewhere. For one (hungry) person, I ordered the Honey Tuna, Black Widow and tuna (with avocado added for $1) rolls. They were all decently sized, and I ended up w/ half the Black Widow as leftovers. But for $41 (including a $3 delivery charge and tip) it was just meh, nothing special.  I think if I was in the neighborhood, with a group of people, I would def. check this place out, since it would be easier to try a bunch of things for cheaper potentially and from others' descriptions, the restaurant interior sounds interesting. But I will not be ordering delivery again, simply because the cost does not reflect the quality.
