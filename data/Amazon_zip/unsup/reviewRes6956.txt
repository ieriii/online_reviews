Honestly, we are too full to write a proper review, but I wanted to make sure I get a couple of notes in. Very cute restaurant, two blocks from our hotel (PUBLIC). We made a reservation on OpenTable, and were seated right away. Water was offered within a couple of minutes and our server was at our table right behind the water. Ayana was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the food menu. My fiance had the kobe brisket sandwich and I had the pulled pork. Both were great, and tons of food. My only advice would be to have the servers learn a little more about the beer menu. We wanted local beers and ended up with one from CA (where we live) and one from Michigan.... I think this was the best BBQ I have ever had!!!
