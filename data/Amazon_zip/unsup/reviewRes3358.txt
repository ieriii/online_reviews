WOW WOW WOW!!! The Seoul Sassy chicken was moist, juicy, and cook to absolutely perfection. The buffalo wings were plain and nothing special. The burrito was THE BEST. My boyfriend and I split the first one and ordered another one immediately after. It was that good. The vegetables were crisp, fresh, and blended together wonderfully with their bulgogi (Korean bbq) If you are brave and can handle a little spice, order it spicy. The owner was also extremely friendly and took his time explaining the dishes. They are very accommodating and I predict them to be a local favorite. Try the green melon bar (ice cream) and their selected Korean drinks. You won't regret it. Very refreshing.  Although getting there was a nightmare due to congested traffic, it was ALL worth it! I can't wait to go back and get another burrito. oh also, if you order their rice dish (bibimbop) they give this little sauce that's almost pink. Out of curiosity I dipped my seoul sassy chicken in it. The sauce is to DIE for! It's creamy, then ends with this spicy explosion! We had to get a second one. I forgot to ask the name of the sauce but I'm sure the owner will help you find out what it is.
