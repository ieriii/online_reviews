I've been waiting to go here for a year! I immediately love this place because of the nondescript door. We went on a Sunday night before dinner to get some fabulous drinks. Walked in and was of course immediately impressed. Ventured to sit at the bar to talk to the bartenders and see how the drinks were made and what they were made with. I suggest doing this if you haven't. I let the bartender take full control of the drinks I was given - and was pleasantly surprised to find probably my favorite drink... ever. It was a version of a Manhattan that was better than anything I've had. Conversation is easy there and the bartenders are eager to show your their mad skills. Will be here continuously from now on!
