Been here multiple times and each time is great! Consistently delivers great food and service as well an people watching. I think I have dreams of their brussel sprout salad, the rock shrimp and the crispy tuna! The dessert RIDICULOUS is the most amazing dessert I have ever ate and hands down the best dessert in Chicago :) If you can get an outside table in the summer you're in for a treat as it is intimate and very enjoyable!
