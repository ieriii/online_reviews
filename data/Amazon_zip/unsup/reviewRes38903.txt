Came here for a late Saturday brunch yesterday, and was pleasantly surprised by a short 5 minute wait (30 minute wait for outside). The interior of the place is simple, casual, dim lit with dark wood. It's cool. Once we sat down, we were immediately greeted with a (complimentary) fig donut. The dough was really good, but the filling was too sweet. It tasted great with my rum spiked horchata though. And speaking of, their drinks are really strong. By the time we left, I was definitely buzzed, and I only had that one drink. My friend couldn't even finish her beverage.  Though the drinks were a little overwhelming, the food was pretty spot on. I ordered the duck hash, and it was really good. It was like comfort food. It had the most perfectly cooked egg I think I've ever had; a bed of potatoes; succulent pieces of duck; and a vinaigrette that seemed a little out of place, but I suppose it helped to cut down the richness of everything else.  I want to go back, for brunch and dinner, as the rest of their menu looks really good. And even though I'm not a whiskey drinker, I would love to try their whiskey flights.
