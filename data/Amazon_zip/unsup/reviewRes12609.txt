The ambiance here is awesome. This is a very 'feel at home' kind of place. The service was warm, efficient and the drinks were awesome. A mojito here is a must. I got a flavored one, raspberry I think. Delicious. I went with the Honey Jalapeo Pork Chop. It was a really good decision. The shrimp and plantains we had as appetizers were refreshing and not too filling. On the way out the owner thanked us for coming, and asked us to come back again. We will.
