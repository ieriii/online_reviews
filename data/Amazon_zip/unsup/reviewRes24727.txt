I chose to have my last meal at Mercat. No, I'm not typing this from a heavenly cloud, looking down upon the world of Yelpers, reflecting on this South Loop selection. Rather, it was my last meal in my 20s, and since attending the Mercat Yelp event in November, I have been hoping to have a full meal here. Saturday night the nearly four month thought came to fruition. Our wonderful server, Sally, toured us through the menu, highlighting some of the more popular tapas options there, as well as her personal faves. She didn't lead us astray on anything. My group of 4, shared a very reasonably priced pitcher of white sangria. It was some of the more flavorful sangria I've ever had, with a lovely peach taste to it. Since we were planning on being up in da club after dinner, we stuck to a few light options. Here is the list: chef's cheese selection (very generous portion), Verdosa salad, bacon-wrapped dates with almonds, butternut squash dumplings (which melted in our mouths), and short rib flatbread. I loved that the dates had almonds; it was a nice change to a tapas staple. And the meat on the flatbread was about as tender as it gets. We of course did not pass on dessert, which included several excellent options. Our choice was a delicious hazelnut, chocolate, ice cream delight, and some Peg Bundy dessert du jour (Bon Bons). I would definitely recommend this fabulous place.
