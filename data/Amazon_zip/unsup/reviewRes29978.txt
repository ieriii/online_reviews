My wife and I went for the first time just a few days ago. Of all the Thai places in Lincoln Square I would have to rate this as the best. The food was very good and the cost was very reasonable. We had the Tiger Cry beef and Steamed Dumplings for starters. Both dishes were fresh and the Crying Tiger had an excellent sauce.  For the main course I had the Peanut Sauce Lover dish with chicken and my wife had the Lard Nar Talay. The Peanut Sauce dish was quite good, I asked for spicy and it was spicy without being overbearing. My wife thought the Lard Nar was okay. It is BYOB so we brought a bottle of white wine. Total cost including tip (and bottle of wine) was $45.
