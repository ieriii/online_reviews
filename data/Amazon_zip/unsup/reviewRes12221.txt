I can't get enough of Piece. Seriously. I'm typically not a huge fan of thin-crust pizza, but theirs is just awesome. I always get the red pizza and I never regret it. I've tried several of their hosue brews and I've liked them all, particularly the Swingin' Single. Their prices aren't bad. It can be hard to get a table at certain times, and I hate how some of the tables are crowded so close together that you feel like you're on a date with the people next to you, but I'm willing to forgive it all because I love their food so much.
