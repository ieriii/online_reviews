Warning: There will be details about me and this restaurant that will both astound you and maybe even frighten you. When it comes to healthy eating, I sometimes find myself falling off the wagon... but not really in a sane person's kind of way. Let's just say when I found my way into Tank, I had a relapse. With pages and pages of food to select, my head was spinning and being my typical indecisive self, I went into panic/gorge mode. My poor date had to suffer the experience of watching me stuff my face with an order of spring rolls, an order of pancake (stuff with bean sprouts and *ding ding ding* BACON), and zeh peeyez deh rezeestahns... *yelling out of my megaphone now* the supreme pho bowl. Supreme being the key word, with a bowl almost twice the size of my face filled with all the goodies that make pho oh so delicious. I've looked for a place that serves up pho as good as the old Pho Hoa near Argyle but most places I found fell painfully short. Tank was almost as good and had decent prices. The service was fast and friendly regardless even though we arrived near closing time. Overall, it was relatively clean compared to other pho serving peers - it's not as pristine as Tru but then you don't ending up paying for that either do you? Just be happy you don't find your forearms stuck to the table.
