My husband, father-in-law and I ate here last night, on a Tuesday. We had driven to the area for Emilio's, which was sadly closed, so we were left to hunt for a suitable replacement in the pouring rain. Enter Pasta Bowl. This restaurant is tiny -- it probably seats less than 30 people, and to be honest, the table layout is awkward. There are a few two tops, some high four tops, and some squished booths. The restaurant shares the building and an ajoining door with The Other Side Bar, so the small space can be a bit noisy. I thought the food was delicious. We had the Cranberry Gorgonzola salad, a goat cheese/marinara appetizer, seafood spaghetti, fettucini alfredo, and sausage ravioli. It was half price bottles of wine night :) My father in law doesn't each much Italian, but he still found the food to be approachable, which was nice. The bill was incredibly reasonable for American-Italian in the city. As great as the food was, our server was better - really funny, there when we needed him and gone when we didn't. However, the rest of the staff leaves something to be desired. A rude and uninterested hostess and manager (who I only interacted with when asking where to sit) made me deduct one star.
