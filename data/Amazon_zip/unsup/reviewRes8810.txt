...my new favorite restaurant. Wonderful space, excellent, high quality cuisine, lovely staff (nice Polish girl helped us), Lebonese wine that was really nice....great prices. I cannot wait to return and try another dish. I want to try everything on the menu. Right off the Brown line too! Yeaaaa. A perfectly unique and neighborly space. Some table spaces are more Familyish, some more girlfriendy, some spaces would be downright romantic. Everyone should go. Yes, this is one reason why I like it so much it easily can be the right space and meal for so many occassions. I think I'll take mom next time she's in town. I think it would be a lovely place for a group gathering too. This place, El Nuevo Mexicano, and Duke of Perth...and Nomi are now my faves in Chicago.
