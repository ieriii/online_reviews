I went in there on New Years Day 2012 and holy shit was it packed. I got there 30 mins after it opened and wow...so many people. We put our name down and were told that we might have to wait 30-45 minutes. No big deal. I had been there before and knew that their turnover service is quick. We waited maybe 15 minutes and then got seated. I got the Bailey's & coffee...it was ok. Good tasting but I could barely taste the Bailey's. The young lady I was with ordered a Mimosa which was really good. Both of us got different style omeletttes which were very good tasting and hardy as fuck. I absolutely love their house potatoes....mmmm.....house potatoes. I'll definitely be coming back, no doubt.
