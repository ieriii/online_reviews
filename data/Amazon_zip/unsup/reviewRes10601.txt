SO F***IN' GOOD! Really, I can hardly contain myself when I tell people about Piece. This restaurant/bar does two things, basically, and focuses on doing them really well. The pizza is just awesome- they only do one kind of crust, it's thin, and they've simply perfected it. The red sauce is good, but the white is the best (mmmm... garlic!) The toppings are fresh and plentiful, and the cheese is high quality. The other thing is the beer. Piece brews their own, has a good variety, and they're all fantastic. My favorites are the Golden Arm (similar to Goose Island's 312) and the Top Heavy Hefeweizen. The prices are reasonable, too. Seriously, if you like pizza and beer, you need to go here- but take the train (it's right off the Damen Blue line stop) or cab it, because if you're anything like me, you will leave feeling totally stuffed and completely wasted!
