Doug's is the best!!! The meats are tasty and varied, and the toppings really bring out the flavor. There are like 5 or 6 specialty sausages I love the most - can't pick just one. Duck fat fry-days are a can't miss! Doug and staff are real cool and down to earth.  If I had to mention a downside, it's the popularity of the place. You'll have to wait 45mins-1hr to get in on Saturdays, or at peak lunch time. The place is real small, so not too many people can fit at once. I try to get there at 10:45 or 11 on weekdays, to avoid the rush. You can actually hang out and talk to Doug at these times. But if you put it in perspective, all the top Chicago places have long lines. Frontera Grill and Cafe Iberico come to mind - and you have to wait 1-2hrs for these places!
