I finally made it the The Bad Apple, and the only bad was the ketchup. Seriously, why mess with something that Heinz perfected a long time ago?  I am all about creativity in sauces, but not ketchup. Ok, now on the better stuff... The beer menu has a great selection of both bottled and draft beers. The cheese curds are outstanding and a must order as a appetizer. For my entree, I ordered El Chupacabra (topped with braised goat chili, roasted garlic pure, goat's milk cheddar, avocado) and truffle fries. The burgers...they are very good and similar to the culinary masterpieces at Kuma's. I really enjoyed the goat chili and avocado. Really good stuff! The fries are just OK. Top them with whatever you like, and they still will not rock you world. We experienced good service and the place had a pretty good atmosphere on our late Wednesday evening visit. Overall, The Bad Apple ekes out a 4 star rating from me based solely on their burger and cheese curds. Don't get to excited about the fries and bring some ketchup packets with you....
