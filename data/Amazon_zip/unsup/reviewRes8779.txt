Absolutely and bafflingly terrible. I have no idea how a pizza can be made so completely devoid of flavor, but ours was like eating a water balloon topped with oatmeal. The tomato sauce was completely bland to the point of anti-flavor. The cheese was equally tasteless - it was almost like eating fat-free cheese or something, once again just completely devoid of ANY flavor, almost like eating a vegetarian food starch cheese substitute. Even the sausage - SAUSAGE! - was once again entirely and utterly lacking in any flavor. I don't mean it didn't taste "good," I mean it was like eating bran flakes or unspiced vegetarian meat substitute. I'm trying to not exaggerate when I call this the blandest, least flavorful meal I have ever eaten in my entire life.
