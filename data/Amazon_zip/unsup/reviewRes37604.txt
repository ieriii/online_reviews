OK, so I'm not the ultra high-end grocery type of guy, but this just further proves how fantastic fox is because I just keep dropping money there. Many of the products are local items or high end items you can find a lot of places but the real value at Fox is ANYTHING THEY MAKE! Seriously, all the dinner stuff in the cases you can bring home and heat up, any bakery item and especially the pastries and truffles. It's not the place to do your standard shopping but for a special trip most of the time the quality here is definitely worth it.
