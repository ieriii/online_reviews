I went to Big Jones with my mom a few weeks ago, and it was a decent experience, but there were a few bumps in the road. We were seated right away but waited a really long time to be greeted. I thought I was being obvious with my impatient looks, but I guess it was ineffective. I finally got up and asked the host/server, and he took care of us right away. He also offered us a complimentary appetizer, so that was a nice gesture. We started out with the house-made andouille and croquettes, which were both very good. They brought us out mini-cornbreads too, which were absolutely outstanding. My mom and I split the shrimp and grits and gumbo entrees. The gumbo was delicious, though the portion was huge. While eating the grits I discovered the hard way that not all of my shrimp had been peeled. Huge turn-off. It's like finding a bone; it makes it really hard to keep eating. Finally, we asked the server to box our meals (and the leftover cornbread) and ordered the red velvet cake for dessert. Somehow my cornbread never made it to the box, which was sad. The saving grace of this whole experience was the red velvet cake. It was hands-down the best I've ever had. It's made-to-order so it takes a little longer, but it is definitely worth it. I will probably go back just so I can order it. I will give Big Jones another chance, but I hope my experience is better next time.
