Wow. I LOVE this spot for the fun I had here...and I LOATHE this place for how much trouble their saki got me and my buddies into later in the evening. But that's neither here nor there. Sunda was recommended by our concierge at the Peninsula hotel, and they usually know what they're talking about. Like asking Janice Dickinson to refer a Botox specialist. The scene was sexy, vibrant and open but intimate. Good looking crowd. Recommended to grab a drink at the bar for a date before sitting down to dinner. Order the Roasted Duck Hash if you want everyone at the table to love you. We asked the waiter to bring whatever sushi they thought we'd like. The "tail of two tunas" and the "firecracker" rolls were the most popular and incited chopstick wars at our table. Management initially frowned on our boisterous saki bomb sneak attack (as Sunda is "above" such activities.) But they loosened up when we started buying rounds for the birthday party at the table next to us (read: the meter was running, FAST.) Turned into one of those nights where you rely on the receipts in your pockets the next morning to tell the tale of the rest of your evening. Thank you, Sunda. And I hate you.
