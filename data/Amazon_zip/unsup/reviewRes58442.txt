My family grew up on Calo's Pizza. Their Pizza's are made as if we were visiting Italy for the first time. They arive at your door, pretty much after they hang up the phone. The doorbell rings and all you can say is, That was fast. And, it's hot. The pizza, any way you want it, is magnificent. But, that baked mostaccioli, in meat sauce, with extra mozzarella baked on top...YUMMY! It's terrific for any night.We also love La Villa. We chose to go there last Sunday night, completely unaware, that Channel 11 did a Check Please segment on them. We arrived to what seemed to me, was the place to be, when we saw it was jam packed, in the waiting area but, the Hostess was fast, getting everyone a table and making sure we were comfortable. It's such a romantic restaurant, that just like in Italy, they feed you until you're ready to pass out. I actually ate there and, took the left-overs, for two more meals, at home. Extremely courteous staff, excellent food and even if I had to wait an hour to get in, I would have done it!Ladies, watch out for those Mai Tai's ; )Ciao,Until I make it there again.
