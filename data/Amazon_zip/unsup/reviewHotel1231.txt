Let's start with the good things about the Hyatt Regency McCormick: - very comfy bed - decent toiletries (soap, shampoo, etc) - All North facing rooms have a great view of the Chicago Skyline AND Lake Michigan to the right. - Connected to the HUGE McCormick Place and convention center What's so bad about staying there? - There is NOTHING around it. It's a $15.00 cab ride to the loop.  - You're stuck paying a premium on parking, restaurants and even bottle water because there isn't a drug store around. It is close to the Midway Airport. The Orange line cost $2 but once you get out on Roosevelt Ave, there isn't much cabs in that neighborhood, so you can walk 12-15 blocks or wait for a bus. I'm not thrilled to come back in July but that's where the convention I'm going to will be hosted. Edit 08/03/07: overcharges for everything. Surcharge for the privilege for a package to be delivered to the Hyatt. $10/day for Hard Line (not even wireless) internet access at home and if you go downstairs to the lobby the wireless internet is $10/more a day. SHOR restaurant is overpriced bland food.
