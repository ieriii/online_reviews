*Edit: I'm just going to take a star off because we came back for pizza again, this time ordering pepperoni and spinach and goat cheese pizzas. I am admittedly not a big thin crust fan, but I have to say that the pepperoni was really dry and chewy and the spinach goat cheese was watery and chewy. My jaw hurt from chewing so much. It's still a decent place, and the mashed potato pizza we ordered last time was awesome, but as I suspected, the traditional toppings pizza failed to impress. I'd just as soon get pizza from Santullo's two doors down. Finally decided to come here after a friend raved about a pizza with mashed potatoes and bacon toppings. It was good. I'm personally not that crazy about most thin crust, but this didn't disappoint. I was impressed with the size of the pizzas. Holy hell. We almost mistakenly ordered a large because we were starving, but our waiter pointed us in the right direction. A medium was more than enough and we had left overs. The beer was good. I started with the Golden Arm which was standard ok lager. But then switched to the dark porter beer which was a lot more interesting and satisfying. We had two waiters while we were there, and they were both great. Even when I didn't need anything, I saw him looking over to our table frequently to check on us. In large sports bar type places like this where you have a lot of people drinking beer and a lot of tables, I think the wait staff is more important than it is in most other places.  It sucks when you are trying to flag someone down for another beer and they are across a large room, serving a table of 10. If the service was just ok, I probably would give piece 3 -3 1/2 stars. But the service was able to put it to 4.
