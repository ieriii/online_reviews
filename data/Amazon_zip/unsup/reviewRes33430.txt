I really enjoy this breakfast place and this is the only place I've tried in the South Loop. Every time I come, the wait isn't bad or there isn't a wait. The place is HUGE! It's not a typical small brunch place. I absolutely love the Banana Nut Bread French Toast. It's so sweet and delicious! I've also had the standard two eggs, which is always good. The portions are large and the service is quick. I've always gotten my food within 10 minutes of ordering. The omelette's are also tasty but I don't remember the ones I've tried... sorry. I've always spent $10 on a meal, so it's a great deal. You can park next door in a garage and I believe it's $5 for 2 hours... something like that. But you can always find street parking on Wabash or State.
