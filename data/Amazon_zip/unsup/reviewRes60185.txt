We hit our favorite pizza place Sunday. This was after a very busy weekend, and we were just starving. We did our traditional Buffalo Chicken that we almost never pass on, and tried something new called Morumbi(spelled right I belive..don't know what it means).....This might be my new FAV pizza..lots of portobello mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and a garlic pesto sauce..IT is just an AWESOME pizza...(othe stuff too) We did delivery, kicked back, watched a film, and stuffed ourselves with the best pizza in the hood..Great way to finish a great weekend
