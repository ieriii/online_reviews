I've been going here for the best Chinese food in Chicago for a few years now, and haven't found anything better. The only thing I don't like is the service can be poor at times, and the lines can be long. The food is very spicy, which I like, but be warned, there tends to be lot of oil in the dishes. The vegetable dishes are always fresh and not full of the weird sauce that you get at most Chinese places.
