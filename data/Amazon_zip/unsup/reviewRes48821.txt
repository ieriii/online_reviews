This place has a very cool ambience, but the food does not measure up. I was most disappointed with my steak... I should've gotten a clue when the waiter didn't ask me how I wanted it done. The steak came back well done, the texture was tough and all the flavor had been cooked out of it (surprise!), and the cheese accompaniment was overpowering. =P Blah. The broccoli side dish was okay. The only thing that was actually really good was the salad. To add insult to injury, the un-tasty food is overpriced. Overall, a lackluster and disappointing experience.
