De Pasada is closed on Tuesdays. It was Tuesday, Cinco de Mayo, and I had spent all day dreaming about chicken burritos. I sat down here. Chicken burrito, diet coke, and a side of guac. They give you chips, salsa and pico de gallo. They even package everything you can't eat up for you. LISTEN, PEOPLE, LISTEN. Juicy, Juicy chicken, yummy chips, fresh guac (and a lot of it)... $11 fucking dollars. Seriously. I've had tacos here before and those are good too.
