The place has an incredible decoration with marble counter tops with an Asian infusion, the food were served on a AVEC styled kitchenware and the food had Chinatown seasoning with a Mirai presentation. Ordered Firecracker, duck hash salad, sesame garlic noodle, and two other rolls I don't remember. Firecracker was an interesting experience for me with the overpowering sauces. Garlic noodle lacked texture in the noodle while the taste on the contrast was not strong enough. The best dish that night was definitely the duck hash salad, the fried egg makes all the difference. The place will be a fun place with amazing crowd and ambiance, however it was extremely loud for me to have a conversation at the sushi bar.
