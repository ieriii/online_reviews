Aside from the slow elevators and slow internet I enjoyed my stay here even though it was under crappy circumstances (displaced by fire in my apartment building). Luckily the owner of my apartment building (right up the street) owns this hotel so we got a free room for two nights and a few other perks I wont mention. I was surprised to find a room with two sinks in the bathroom and a small room with a fridge, microwave, sink and a coffee maker. The bathroom was better than the bathroom in my apartment and not at all with a generic hotel look. If I ever move away from Oak Park and come back needing a hotel, this is the place I will stay!
