I'm fine being the only person that did not enjoy the pizza here AT ALL. Yes the burnt cheese on the crust is good but I can do that at home. The rest of the crust is TOO thick, too much bread. Not enough cheese. They give a decent amount of toppings but they'd have to give me a mountain of meat and cheese to make that much bread tasty. I know I hate it when I stop eating after 1 slice. I NEVER STOP EATING AFTER ONE SLICE! Also our server was kind of an idiot. When I said "can we get a round of water for everyone", that doesn't mean 4 glasses of water for 7 people. Simple math girl. Simple math.
