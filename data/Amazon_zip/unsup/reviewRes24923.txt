Cheap, delicious, food, and its a BYOB. I've managed to eat dinner for two here and spent under $15. There are lots of vegetarian and some vegan options, including a great veggie burrito. I've brought countless friends and family here, and everyone loves it, even picky eaters. My favorite is the Pepito sandwich (add avocados), and the Tilapia Dinner.  Sweet plantains and yucca with mojo sauce are a must, and don't forget about the oatmeal shake, or any shake. Be prepared to deal with a crowd during peak hours, and they only accept cash.
