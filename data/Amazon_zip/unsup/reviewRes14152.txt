I agree with another reviewer that Glenn's ain't no diner. Their menu and prices sets them up to be more of a bistro. Most of what they offer is pretty good. They were one of the first establishments to offer pies by Hoosier Mama before the owner of that opened up her own shop on Chicago Ave. One night though, we were served a salad that had obviously been prepared earlier that day and some of it had gone bad. It was taken back without any problem. Although they have all those cereal boxes lining one corner, I don't live close enough to try them for breakfast.
