My wife and I went there after her work on Saturday.  The place is big accommodate many people. I think it would be loud though. The place was almost half full when we went there.  Lots of selections to choose from. Great prices. You definitely get a lot of food for the money.  Not only that, my wife really loved the food especially the Duck and Pork. We will be coming back here in the near future.  We didn't know about the Health Violations they had in Nov. 2010 until after we ate there. You can google "sun wah health" for more information. Nothing serious, but I'm sure there are other restaurants with the same issues.
