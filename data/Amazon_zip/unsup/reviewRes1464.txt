YUM SQUARED (is there such a thing). I absolutely love these kind of french fries the fresh cut ones with skin. I can't even complain that I waited about 25 minutes in a hot Chicago day. Thats how good this is. Along with the fries I got the corn dog...I keep it simple! So good!! The breading wasn't soggy it was nice and crisp and the hot dog was done to perfection. $3.75 for a delicious lunch is how it should be!! Im happy to say this place is only 5 minutes from my job so I'll be a regular!! Oh and for the single ladies this place is a sausage fest (pun intended) 95% of the lunch customers I saw were men! Tip: take a friend to chat with in line so the wait doesn't seem so long!
