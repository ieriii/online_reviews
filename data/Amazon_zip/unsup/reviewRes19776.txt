Crowded on a Monday night? Unheard of! We went to Coast impromptu as a kind of commiserative dinner... with the expectation we would get a table, it being a Monday night.. wishful thinking. We sat at the bar and ordered. Coast King crab roll, white dragon roll awesome!! also their crab cakes which was a special starter were yum too. be warned although this is a BYOB it is NOT cheap. For 2 starters and 3 rolls we paid $80 all in. Their special rolls are great but they are $13 a pop. It is still my most fave place for sushi in Chi town and I eat sushi all the time!
