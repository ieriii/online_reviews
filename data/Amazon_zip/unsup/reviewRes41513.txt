People like to debate who has a better steak: New York or Chicago. Those of us in Chicago will tell you there is no comparison (add pizza to that list too, sorry New York). Granted, Ruth's Chris is a national chain that is in many major cities. This fact does somewhat defeat the notion that their presence in Chicago is any better than it is in New York, San Juan, etc...but keep following: The ambiance of Ruth's Chris, with the dim lights, tall, leather booths and servers that are so nice it almost seems like they are afraid to face the consequences of messing up, really make you feel like you are dining like Al Capone used to in Chicago. You feel like a boss, and the servers treat you like the boss. There is a tall guy named George who will probably retire a millionaire thanks to his tips (he never forgets your name, repeats everything you want to make sure there are no screw ups and from start to finish is on point!). The fillet is always cooked to perfection and the mash potatoes are a great compliment to it. You may want to request half the standard amount of butter on your plate, or your steak will be swimming in it. I've been to the best steakhouses Chicago has to offer, and none of them blow Ruth's Chris out the water. Ruth's Chris may not be a Chicago original, but if no one told you they were a chain, you would have sworn they started in Chicago and were visited often by the baddest crime bosses with a taste for a good steak.
