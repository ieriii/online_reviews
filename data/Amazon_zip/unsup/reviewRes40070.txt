While the food does live up to the hype, it is NOT worth the ridiculous wait they have most weekends. The deal-breaker though is the service. Do they train their staff to act annoyed and pretentious? And then the girl couldn't even answer a question and had to go to the back to ask someone else. I have no problem with someone being new and not knowing everything about the food (and in particular the whiskey) which was the question my friend had, but with the way she had acted during our initial look-over of the menu was almost enough to make us leave. There are many good places to get food in logan square, you don't need to put up with that kind of garbage just to get a good meal!!
