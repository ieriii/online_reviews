I have heard great things about this place and was going to a friend's house not far from there, so I figured this would be perfect. It was pretty much what I expected... It was pretty small, but we got there with three around 6:15 on a Tuesday (Cubs game day) and were seated right away. I was surprised at how small the menu was... I had no problem finding something delicious, but I just expected more to choose from! It was quick and inexpensive and delicious... can't beat that. I'll definitely go back.
