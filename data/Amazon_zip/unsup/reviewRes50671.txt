FREE BEIGNETS! oh my, how nice of them! and at the end of the meal, they asked if we wanted more! How nice! But only on sat and sun. Came here with a friend today, and the restaurant was pretty empty, so we were seated with ease. We ordered the Eggs New Orleans and Fried Green Tomatoes. OH, they were so good. And they were soo filling. Heavy, kind of. I ate four hours ago, and I still feel full! But, there was a fruit fly in my water :'[ :'[. Gross. I thought the interior design/decorations were too cute, and parking was fine.
