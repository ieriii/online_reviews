I had the Lechon, the pork sandwich. It was great. The sweet plaintains on the sandwich give it that sweet and spicy taste.  I also had the lime mango iced tea, which was not overly sweet, like other flavored iced teas are. If you're on a budget and are looking for a great meal this is the place to go.
