The duck was fantastic. Greasy soft and wonderful in every way shape or form.I was here for a birthday party and we were having a blast and enjoying the pastries, beer, duck and veggies; in reverse to my expectations we received both the rice and the noodles at the end of the meal. Both were absolutely atrocious. The rice tasted absolutely charred as if someone had burned the rice to the point of on fire. Smoked rice is not good. The noodles that came afterward also were identical and tasted like they had been cooked in the same pan. I'd give this a re-review in the future just due to how cheap it is and I'll likely return and see if that burned flavor was an isolated incident. I'd consider leaving a 3 star for the duck alone but the service was pretty slow and the ratio of diners to service is pretty bad for the weekend we were there.
