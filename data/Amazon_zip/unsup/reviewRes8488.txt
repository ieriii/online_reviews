I called to place a take out order, and was told that you can't call in an order for pick-up. The gentleman who answered the phone explained that if i drove down and placed an order in person, it would only take a few minutes. Based on Hooshna's review, and my experience, this restaurant has more business than it would like. I won't trouble them with my "extreme" demands any longer.
