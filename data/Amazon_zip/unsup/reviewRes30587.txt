I've been to Sunda twice now. First time was for dinner and second time was for Sunday brunch. Both times I was very impressed with the food, but the service, not so much. Which is disappointing because this place has everything going for it. It's a cool space, great vibe, trendy yet still casual atmosphere, and the food is interesting but not intimidating (and above all else, just plain good!). When I went for dinner, we had to wait well over an hour for our 9 o'clock dinner reservation, on a week night. I think having to wait an hour anytime you have a reservation is a little ridiculous, but that late on a Wed or Thurs is just silly. Then when we went for brunch, there was no wait and we were seated right away. However, our server just never showed up. About 15 minutes after we sat down the manager finally came over (I'm guessing the ever increasing pissy expressions on our faces were a clue that something was up). He took our drink order and said the server would be right over (which turned in to another 5 minute wait). Unfortunately throughout our brunch the server was just non-existent. We practically had to do the ole wave your arms in the air across the room to get her attention thing, just to get her to stop at our table. So why the 4 stars you might ask? Because overall I really do like this place and I think the food is good enough that I can put up with the less then stellar service. Plus, I'm still hoping that I just caught them on two off days....that happens right?!
