Saw an ad for the Wednesday Date Night deal - one appetizer, two entrees, and a desert for $20/person. The menu changes every week, but our menu was a spring roll appetizer, seafood or chicken option for entree (they will substitute a vegetarian entree if you request), and scoops of vanilla and chocolate ice cream for dessert. The ad didn't mention this, but you also get a coffee or tea included with the deal. I had the chicken and thought everything was very tasty and well prepared, but my husband wasn't too crazy about his seafood entree. Good but not great.
