I used to eat at bongo room a few times a week, until this morning. As I walked up to the restaurant the waitress was escorting people out of the place. I walked in and she said we are not open. So this blonde waitress says you have to wait outside due to liability reasons? I'm really dying to know the liability reasons. The sign says They open at 8am. It was 8:02am. She said to wait outside for 5 minutes. It's 31degrees out you wait outside! I can't sit or stand around for 5 minutes? If that's how you want to treat customers or regulars go ahead. So within 5 minutes I was Janiks cafe sitting down with coffee and ordering food, most importantly they were nice.
