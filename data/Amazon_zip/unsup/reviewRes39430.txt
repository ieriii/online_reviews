This place is stupidly popular despite being out in Logan Square. Went on a Wednesday, and it was absolutely packed to the brim. The atmosphere is what you'd expect - trendy with dark wood and ambient lighting. Bring your flannel or feel out of place. At any rate, the food is good. The shared plates are not for those with cholesterol problems. We're talking pork cheeks, bone marrow - so fat, fat and more fat. Each dish is prepared with care and balance, and it's absolutely worth the hype. Speaking of the pork cheek, you need to get it. If you love balancing savory meat with a hint of sweetness, this is right up your alley. To balance it out, get the beet salad. It's a roasted beet salad - impossible to go wrong. In terms of the donuts, I could frankly take it or leave it. It's as savory as you think, but it's surprisingly not that heavy. The main frustration for a lot of folks is that the wait is epic (3 hours at 5:30 on a Saturday? Jesus). This is sort of exacerbated by the fact that, according to the hostess, they only have two tables that can accomodate more than 4 guests. The space itself is large enough to where you'd think they can fit more large tables - particularly in the back area. Anyways, spring can't come sooner. I'll be the strangely tall asian guy sitting outside in the patio area, sipping on some whiskey, while scarfing down some tasty, tasty pork.
