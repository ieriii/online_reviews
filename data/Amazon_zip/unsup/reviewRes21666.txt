Absolutely delicious. The wait was about 45 minutes but you can hop to the front, grab beers and wait in line with them-made it far more bearable. I ordered the Pepito and my friend had the Cuban-the Pepito was definitely better. Also ordered chips and guac and churros with chocolate. The guacamole was fantastic, the churros were delicious and the chocolate was...bitter. But I'm assuming I just like things sweeter so I didn't hold it against Xoco. One thing to note: I didn't really notice how salty everything was when I was eating it, but the next day my fingers were so swollen they looked like sausages.
