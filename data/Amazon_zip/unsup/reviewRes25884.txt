Nothing new to report--the place is still lively and still a great use of the beautiful old space that used to be a dive bar with poorly maintained tropical fish--but I have to share this: I bought a friendly tourist a drink here last week, and in telling her friends, by cell phone, where to come and meet her, she said she was at "Meerkat a la Planxa." I've been having images of mongooses frolicking in the surf ever since.
