I think this place is hit or miss. I've gotten food here twice. I went once with the father-in-law and we got the Hot Pot. It was delicious. We got half and half on broth. I wish we would have gotten the regular. The spicy was extra spicy. I like spicy and I ate it, but I think I will take it easy the next time. The last time I got food from here it just ok. I got take out. I think it helps to eat it there. I'll probably return, at least give it anther shot.
