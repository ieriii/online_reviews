Oh, Fogo 2 Go, I so wanted to like you... I really did. But the pizza is nothing better than mediocre to me. I liked how many choices there were on the menu, but overall what I think didn't do it for me was the crust. It just wasn't anything special and made the whole pie just, not good. I was very disappointed since it was super cheap, convenient and had fast delivery.
