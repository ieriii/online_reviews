You are likely to wait a long, long time. Then you will see an overwhelming and huge menu. The food--I ordered simple chicken parm--was in a word "awful". The chicken was excessively pounded thin, sour-flavored, and greasy. The pasta that came on the side embarrassingly clumped together. That being said, my ten year old daughter enjoyed her pizza. The bread before the meal was good and the waiter and staff were doing their very best so I give it 2 stars rather than 1.The made to order chocolate lava cake was good but nothing that special.The place is huge, noisy, and if I were to give it a letter rating MM for must miss.
