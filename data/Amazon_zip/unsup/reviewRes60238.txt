My aunt and I order at from here about once a week and love it. If i could give a delivery driver an award, I would give it to robbie. I have seen him multiple times and he is always charming and friendly. He once ran to the closest Walgreens to get us back our change. The other driver, the big mexican guy is a jack***. The service over the phone is average, The garlic knots are also average. I recommend the Chicken with mash potatoes, It is so good, plus they serve it with a pita bread. It is definitely the best value on the menu. I like the barbeque pizza as well as the buffalo, however the multiple cheese pizza is a little to cheesy for me. Those are the only 3 pizzas i have tried so far, I will write after trying the seafood pizza! Overall, this is a good place! pizza is slightly overpriced, however the chicken meal is completely reasonable.
