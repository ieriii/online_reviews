I recently had dinner and the Chicago Diner and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the "Terrific Tacos" -which were indeed delicious. The three tacos came with a small side of Spanish style brown rice and beans. My disdain for beans is quite similar to that of my disdain for corn (mentioned in previous reviews), but the side order of beans last night were very good. Thats saying a lot coming from me ,Ms.Anti-Beans and Corn. The rice was super tasty as well. Now heres my "beef" with this place. $10.95 for three tacos ($11.95 if they're not the special)?! Surely you jest Chicago Diner, I want a basket full of tacos for that price. Oh and my lemonade wasn't good either. So avoid that and stick with an Izze beverage. Oh, my friend had the Rueben, it was really good too.
