A fun place but not a jaw dropping italian meal. The noise level is part of the ambiance. I always feel like I have been to a concert when I leave... a little ringing in the ears. The food is solid but very basic. The food is good but not sophisticated. You don't eat here and think, I couldn't cook this at home. Service is fast and friendly. The bus staff works like mad and everyone is friendly. To sum it up. It is a great place to go with a group of friends where table wide conversations are not important. You will all have a good time, but don't expect to catch up with anyone. It is fine for casual dining but I don't think I would call it a date place unless you are not interested in getting to know the guy you are with.That said, if you go late on a week day, it doesn't sound like a trash compactor and you can have a conversation. Hope this is of some help to you...
