Just tried the Ceviche Trio Trio Trio! Excellent choice that lets you try the different options of ceviche they have. The Tuna with avocado and mango bits was my favorite! I also order the Primavera Tamal (vegeterian) filled with mushroom. That was ok! All this an a couple of Dos XX made a perfect mid week lunch
