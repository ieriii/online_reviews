Seriously cool. I went her for a drink before a concert at the Aragon and loved the atmosphere. Green Mill dates back to Al Capone's Chicago. There is a trap door behind the bar from where they used to sneak the booze inside. The walls are full of ornate decorations. There are round booths and a large bar that winds around to the back of the lounge. The place was busy with people grabbing a drink before the show. The bartender admitted he was overwhelmed. He made us strong drinks, and I'm pretty sure he undercharged us. Soft jazz was playing in the background. I can't wait to come back for some live jazz!  If you are looking to change up your bar scene, head to Uptown and stop by the Green Mill.
