I was excited to head back to one of my favorite places in Chicago. Cafe 28 has been, for me, a place that I used to always go back to knowing that I would get great service and better food. Recently, I took my brother and his wife from out of town. What a disappointment! First we were told to wait for a table outside and when we were seated there were plenty of tables available. The wait staff was lacking attention and detail and the food was not nearly as good as it was before. The pork chops were once the talk of the town. Now, they are dry and much smaller than in the past. After 10 years of going to this restaurant, I can honestly say that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
