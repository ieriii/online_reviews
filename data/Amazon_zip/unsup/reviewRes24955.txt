irazu has really great food and really great coffee - the service is pretty good too - I have been here a bunch of times for brunch and once or twice for dinner - I've never had anything that wasn't good there - try the hell out of the oatmeal smoothie and thank me later - the outdoor seating is pretty great in the summer
