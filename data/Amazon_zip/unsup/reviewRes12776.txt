My husband and I had an awesome dinner tonight at Cafe 28. We like to share so we ordered the salad special, two appetizers, an entree and two deserts. I am embarrassed to say that we practically licked out plates clean. Everything was absolutely for delicious! I have no doubt we'll be back again soon.
