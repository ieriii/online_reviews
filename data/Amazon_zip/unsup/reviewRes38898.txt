Ah...La Villa. Thanks to a recent complement from another Yelper, I would have forgotten the numerous incalculable times I've ordered pizza from this place. As a matter of fact, it is THE pizza place where I started to order my pizza 'well done'. While I obviously like to venture out into the world of food, I do have my comfort foods, pizza being like right there at the top. One of my strategic ways (doesn't require too many brain cells) to evaluate a good pizza place is to have one in mind when you try a new one, and La Villa is right there when I order from a new place. After having this place around for 5 years, it took me a long time to find my new pizza home. BUT, that doesn't mean discount La Villa. My new buddy claimed that while the pizza was delish, it took a little long in delivery time. Yeah, he's right. It's because in comparison to the numerous pizza places in the neighborhood that deliver, everyone seems to order from La Villa. If you ever get the chance, just venture over to the take out area and get an idea of how busy they really are. Hmmm, that should be a big clue!! But if you are over there, then stay a little while and dine in. It's cozy (slightly crowded), but the food is good. The atmosphere was kinda dying for a change, but I'm not there for the atmosphere, just the food. And that's all worth it. My girlfriend had her wedding here and I've been to numerous functions at La Villa's banquet hall. If you're throwing a small function (I think like 150?), this place provides the goods and services. Check them out. Now, understand, I'm talking about my perspective from over 10 years ago, but if they're still around, that's gotta something, right?
