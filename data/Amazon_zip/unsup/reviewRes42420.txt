Went for Xmas eve pho to Tank last night w/ my friend Mark, who really likes this place. Should have joined the Yelpers across the street at Sun Wah is my opinion at this point. We ordered the roll-your-own spring roll with beef and shrimp. That was tasty I must admit; beef well seasoned, good noodles and of course, the veggies that go with it...mint, cilantro, basil, cuke....all fresh and crunchy. I gotta say, I wasn't terribly impressed by the pho broth that I ordered (#81) It had lots of stuff and should have felt richer, but it was bland and thin. Lucky that Tank has a box of seasonings on each table. Great hot sauces, fish and soy sauces and hoisin. But still, isn't the broth one of the things that pho places take pride in...even competitively with other restaurants? Oh, and I must mention the MSG headache that I got after the soup....delightful. And I know better than to expect sparkling clean in such establishments, but the four-top they led us to had two chairs covered with some chicken chunks and sauce. Ick. Nice people came and tried to clean it, eventually bringing us one chair for me to sit in. So last night was also laundry night....
