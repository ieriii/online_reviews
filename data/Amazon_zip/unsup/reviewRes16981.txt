3.5. Pretty good, traditional Indian fare in downtown Chicago. The menu is HUGE and there are just way too many things to try. I love their naan and their dishes have just the right amount of spice. I do wish that they would not charge for rice as how can you eat curry without rice? Overall, a great place to grab some Indian food and really conveniently located downtown. It is a little pricey in general but for being downtown, totally reasonable compared to the other restaurants.
