Great breakfast spot. I wish they'd stay open later though... I'm one of those people who don't mind breakfast in the afternoon-- breakfast for dinner. It's always busy and the food is pretty good. It's not spicy or anything-- they seem to be going for a natural flavor. (I'm not really sure that I'd go any other way with eggs, per-say...) The atmosphere... it's CROWDED. In the summer, the line wraps around outside and you have to push your way through to get your name on the list. I have no intentions of doing this in the winter. I feel bad having people meet me at this location because parking is hard to come by and expensive if they park in the building garage.
