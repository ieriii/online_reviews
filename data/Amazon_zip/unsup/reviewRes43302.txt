The food takes a long time, is kind of pricey, and the ordering system is extremely stressful but I have to give the 4 stars based on the food. I'm not a huge fan of their desserts but that's what Letizia's down the street is for. There's always a line, whether you're picking up food to go or ordering to eat in for but they have lovely outdoor seating area in the warmer months and they serve a small but quality selection of drinks (of the alcoholic sort) to kick back and sip on whilst you wait. Their sandwiches are pricey but oh, so amazing. My partner in crime and I used to order 2 different sandwiches each time so we could each eat half of the other persons and argue over which of the sandwiches was the best food we'd ever tasted in our entire lives. It's a nice little brunch spot and a good treat once a month for a quick-splurge on lunch. PS- don't order the soups... they'll be delicious but even the large is thimble sized and not a very good value.
