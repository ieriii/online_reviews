I'd heard to prepare for a long line but we went on Sat. and there wasn't a wait although it was later in the day. I had the crab cakes and eggs and they were delicious. The sauce that came with them was SO good. They has some unique as well as traditional dishes. The place is huge the decor is a very, very fun breakfast theme. Egg lights and such. Our waitress was great and the fod came out quickly. Very tasty place for brunch.
