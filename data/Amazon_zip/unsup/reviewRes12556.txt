Texas de Brazil is great. I have been to Fogo de Chao and every other Brazilian Steakhouse around but nobody has better food then Texas de Brazil. I believe the meat at Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao are very comparable in taste and quality but Texas de Brazil has a MUCH better salad bar with a wide range of cold cuts, veggies, oysters, sushi, etc.
