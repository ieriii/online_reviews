Good wines (I wouldn't say the selection is the best but very good). I picked a few names for later consumption so it was worth ordering flights. Food was very good as well. Duck was very juicy and crisp on the outside and polenta with pomegranate sauce was a great side. Cheese selection was also very good (part of the deluxe cheese flight). The atmosphere and service top notch. Another words great place to have dinner while on a business trip to the windy city.
