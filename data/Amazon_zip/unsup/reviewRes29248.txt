The Pasta Bowl was my first review on yelp and for over 10 years now it has remained a favorite restaurant of mine. The staff can be kind of hit or miss, and they did forget my soup last night - just write it down people! I won't think any less of you. But it good food at an affordable price and I can't complain about that.
