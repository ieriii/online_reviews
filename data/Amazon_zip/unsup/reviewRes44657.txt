I don't know, I am on the fence about giving this place a 3 or a 4 star rating.  4 stars...because I liked the pizza, I liked the atmosphere, and I like the history behind this pizza chain?  3 stars because nothing moved me and in all due respect, they should step up and play a better game, especially in a city where pizza restaurant per capita is probably one of the highest in the US? 3 stars. And here is why The Goods: 1. I got the traditional cheese pizza and the signature pizza with the sausage and onions. Very flavorful - generous toppings, good quality cheese, and the crust was decent. 2. Tomato sauce - I almost got the sense that they were being a bit stingy with tomato sauce with me, I am not sure if this is truly Chicago-style, but I was getting a bit overwhelmed by the toppings...or should I say underwhelmed b/c of the lack of sauce? 3. Service - there were plenty of servers, but they just were not utilized. Servers were reading books at their little stations, walking around, but not put to work. When they did serve - they were friendly, but...what a shame. 4. I don't know what to make of when I hear "it takes 35 minutes too cook the pizza" - this had better mean that they do absolutely everything from scratch, from the dough kneading, molding, putting the toppings on, and baking. Unfortunately I didn't get that when I got the pizza. This is just a humble beginning for me, as I am a total novice at Chicago pizzaology. There are quite a few places in my area (SF) where they serve Chicago-style deep dish pizzas. I am not sure if I was more impressed with Giordano's than those wannabe places. I am obligated to try other places - like Gino's East and Lou Malnati's when I return to Chicago.
