I really enjoyed my dinner here. As far as southern food goes I have had better but I really like the way they married the southern cuisine with classic french. We were a group of 4 so we each ordered an app and everyone shared. The duck pate was pretty good. The pickled veg was nothing special but still par for the course. I did have the rabbit two ways for my entree and it was very good. Bunny sausage and bunny tenderloin. Quite tasty. I'm all about local, organic food & Big Jones does make use of local ingredients to the best of their ability. The back patio is also a nice little spot. As one in our party said, I feel like I'm not in Chicago anymore, like I'm on vacation somewhere. I will be back but there are so many other amazing places it may take me a bit to make my way back 'round.
