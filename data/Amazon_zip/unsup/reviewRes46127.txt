Had lunch here with my gf last week.... I don't usually like this place....for lots of reasons....it's a chain, it's huge, the menu is like reading War and Peace and there are always tons of tourists eating there....all signs pointing to at best.....mediocrity. But I went because it was close and easy and on this Monday not crowded at all. We ended up splitting both the hummus app: good way to start, light but slightly too lemony and flat bread would be better toasted and the Manhattan salad w/ albacore tuna (added avocado): Should def split on any of the large salads....this was good, lots of veggies and other business going on...the chop is more like a fine dice so the salad was more slaw-like.....but overall a nice healthy option for lunch. Our server was super friendly and nice, waters refilled etc....the only issue I had was that we asked if they could split the salad for us and when it came out.....it was not. I asked again if they could split it and was told (by another server, not our super nice one) "That the kitchen doesn't do that because it ruins the presentation". Seriously?.....I didn't realize we were eating at Alinea. In the end they did split it for us but I just found that to be ridiculous. Overall.....I went in kicking and screaming but left relatively happy with my lunch....if you're in the 'hood, it's actually a good, cheap-ish (our meal appx $20) option especially if you have a group with a lot of different tastes....that said it does get mad crowded during the tourist season.....so be prepared to wait.
