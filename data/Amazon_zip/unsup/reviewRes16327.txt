Came here with a friend for his bday. Was new to the restaurant, and thought I was at another Maggiano's or Edwardo's. WAS I MISTAKEN!!! Calo's has delcicious food, the customer service is friendly without being pushy, and the managers are pleasant and make sure to make contact with the customers as they walk around the dining room. The host staff listens to your needs, and the bartenders are AMAZING! Victor, the host/manager is super friendly, and introduced himself to me on the first visit. I had a work party catered two weeks ago for 65 people, and then I had another event for 125! Calo was able to prepare a menu that was catering to both diverse groups, and the food arrieved warm and tasted as good as it would at the restaurant. There are NO complaints here, and I am a new fan of Calo. I will always make sure to recommend or look them up the next time I have a private or work gathering.
