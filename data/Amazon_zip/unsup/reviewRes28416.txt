The few times I've had Pequod's pizza, I've been drunk. Very drunk. As anyone who has been drunk before knows, alcohol makes everything taste at least 22% more delicious. This makes Pequod's pizza 122% delicious. VERY good stuff. It looks a little offputting. I mean, let's call a spade a spade. It's burnt. That burnt cheese is actually made of baby kittens and angels and cotton candy though, and will be some of the most beautiful stuff ever to enter your mouth. Insert joke here.
