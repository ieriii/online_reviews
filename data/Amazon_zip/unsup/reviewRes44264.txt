Wakamono is amazing. Every time I have come here the food has been delicious, the wait staff attentive, and the atmosphere enjoyable. My favorite rolls are the Wakamono, Fire Dragon, Peter Parker, and Sweet Potato rolls. I also usually order Unagi for myself since it is my absolutely favorite. If you enjoy appetizers the crabmeat wontons are fairly good as they come. I'm not a huge fan of these in general from any restaurant but some of the better ones I've shared have come from Wakamono. I am always impressed with the attention that you get at Wakamono. Water glasses never make it below half. If you bring wine, they are right on top of it. And strangely, though the restaurant is always crowded, getting a seat has never taken very long at all. The atmosphere is perfect. Perfect for a friendly get together, a date, I would even consider dining here alone. In a turn from most of the other sit-down restaurants in the area, the music is kept at a reasonably low level. Yes, you can actually have a conversation across the table. I highly recommend Wakamono to anyone who enjoys sushi.
