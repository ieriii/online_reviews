My friend took me here for my birthday and I cannot say enough about the amazing experience I had at Piccolo Sogno. The food is AMAZING and the service and atmosphere are top notch. I can't thank Chef Tony and everyone who waited on our table enough for making my birthday so memorable. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant and have already told everyone I know that they MUST check this place out! :)
