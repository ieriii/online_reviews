Coast is my favorite out of all the sushi restaurants I've been to so far! The sushi is fresh and they have really fun rolls. The atmosphere is super cute and it's a great place to go with a group of people since it's BYOB! I recommend making a reservation at least a week ahead of time if you are going with a big group because it's a very popular place!
