Let me start off by saying I'm not a beer drinker, so one of the primary reasons that people LOVE this place is lost on me. However, my husband assures me that the selection of beers is phenomenal, so even though the food is so-so, we keep coming back. Additionally, the service is relatively efficient and family friendly (a plus for us since we have a toddler). On a given night, you're bound to see a mix of families, people on dates, The burgers are good. Not extraordinary, but good. On our last visit, I was suffering from a bit of burger fatigue, so I opted to have the Earthly sandwich (grilled portabella, truffled goat cheese, caramelized onion and spinach on rosemary bun). It was mighty tasty, so when we come back, I think I may stick with the sandwich route. This is a good neighborhood place. I'm not sure I'd make a point of coming here if I didn't live right around the corner, but as I mentioned before, beer isn't really my thing.
