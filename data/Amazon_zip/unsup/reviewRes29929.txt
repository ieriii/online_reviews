I am a huge fan!!! Unfortunately I usually order the same thing. Peanut sauce spring rolls, tofu pad thai, fried banana. I often try others food, and also very good. I just LOVE the Pad Thai so much. Many other places, it is just eh, here it is great! The price is right, its BYOB, and the portions are good. I often have something leftover. It gets really busy, so go early, or be willing to wait for a table away from the door (be courteous if there are folks sitting by the door) The wait is often not very long.
