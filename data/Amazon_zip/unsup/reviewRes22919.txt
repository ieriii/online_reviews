Is it just me or does the food at every Greektown restaurant taste the same. Yeah, I get that it's all Greek but I swear it all comes from the same kitchen.  We were definitely not disappointed but not blown away either. We did really enjoy the family feast (or whatever its called) for only $21 per person. For the amount of food we received, it was a steal. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed the Hellas Beer and one of their Greek wines (sorry can't remember which one).
