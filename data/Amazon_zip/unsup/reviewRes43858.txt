After a 4 hour plane ride to the Windy City, my friends and I decided we wanted some steaks at a reasonable price. And boy did Kinzie deliver! We had a party of 6 and were seated at a nice roomy table. The ambiance was nice and the place didn't get too loud. I was able to have conversations with people across the table. Food: Delicious! Definitely try the Spring Fever Prixe Fixe menu. 3 courses for only $20 (You need to ask them for it though. They won't hand it to you first). I had the caesar salad and beef medallions with jumbo scallops on tomato basil polenta. The salad was one of the best caesar salad's I've ever had, so if you're a fan, I would try that. As for the main entree scallops weren't jumbo, but still tasty and perfectly cooked. The beef medallions were tender and juicy and the sauce (I forget what it was) complimented it all very well. I've never had polenta before, so I can't compare, but I'd have to say it was good as well. Our favorite dish, however, came from the regular menu. We all agreed that the steak risotto was the best dish at the table. So flavorful and not too creamy. For dessert, we had the decadent chocolate cake and butter rum cheesecake. The decadent chocolate cake was a little too rich for my taste and definitely needed to be paired with some ice cream to balance it out, but it was served with some whipped cream instead. My friends and I thought the cheesecake was AMAZING! It's a must try!
