Oh my cat's balls, this place is awesome! My mixologist Derek made me several tasty whiskey cocktails while I ordered the exotic Marrow Bones and a super-tasty Burger with the Beef Fat Fries. There's no way any of this could be made at home. This burger blows away any Burger Bar on any Corner in this city. This is the place you bring your super-snooty-beer/cocktail-foodie visiting from the Bay Area to simply shut him up. These are classic drinks made with the freshest of hand-muddled juices and spirits. It's gourmet hipster at its freshest. We will return. Thanks for an awesome dinner, Derek!
