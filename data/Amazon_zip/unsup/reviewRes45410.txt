This place just doesn't disappoint. Almost two years after my first review of Wilde and a few visits later, I still like this restaurant's consistency for delivering quality food from a diverse menu. Loud, definitely...crowded, can be...yummy, you betcha...expensive, oh yeah. This isn't so much a pub as it is a restaurant with a bar. It's not the kind of place you'll see Butt-crack Bob packing 'em down after his ComEd shift; it's more along the lines of an incredibly fashionable Houlihans with an Oscar Wilde/literary theme.
