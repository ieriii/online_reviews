Love it! Indian food is awesome so naturally I would enjoy this place. But, the service is always good and the food is always great. I do enjoy the lunch buffet the most but ordering a full meal on the weekends is also great. You get free naan bread as an automatic appetizer too. Maybe a minus-it's kind of dark inside in the evening.
