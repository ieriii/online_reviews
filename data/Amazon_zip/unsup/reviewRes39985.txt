I have a wrinkle in my nose at the term "gastropub." The definition seems a bit elastic and is becoming all too common. A cozy spot with great food and grog needs no moniker in my humble opinion. That aside, I was pleased with L&E. While it sits in the epicenter of hipster Logan Square, I showed up on four wheels and clean shaven and was not turned away at the door. This place is crowded and does not take reservations so we went on a Monday night and got a table in 20 minutes. The apps were excellent and so were the entrees. I admit that I have had better marrow bones at the Bristol and Purple Pig but I did enjoy. The red onion jam was a nice compliment. Offal-galore as can be expected from any number of places these days. We will be back but reservations would be nice.
