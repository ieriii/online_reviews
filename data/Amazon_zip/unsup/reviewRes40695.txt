Yay for good Pho!!! Came here yesterday with a friend and man what a meal. First of all it was a rainy day in Chicago and all you want and need is a hot bowl of delicious soup. Thanks to Tank Noodle that's exactly what we got. We started out with the fresh spring rolls which were delicious. The peanut dipping sauce definitely added to the flavors in the spring roll. We then got the friend shrimp egg rolls which were http://bomb.com. Yes I just said http://bomb.com. As for the main course I got a hot bowl of pho with sliced beef, well done flank and skirts flank. The meat was delicious and well done. My friend got the rice noodles chicken soup with mixed vegetables and loved it. Overall a great pho spot.
