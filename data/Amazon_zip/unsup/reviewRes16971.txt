the food here is amazing! i've been twice already. cons: -expensive -cheapest entree is greater than $20, then add in appetizer, drink, dessert.. -not a too large menu (if you're picky) -not great service (i've only been on dates so i had good company and didn't mind like i normally would, but maybe if you go in a large group they'll like you more) pros: -deliciousssssss -interior (i remembered the WOW-factor when i first went!!) -both times, we never had trouble with street parking...it's possible we just got lucky. haha i suggest it a lot if you are willing to spend the money!
