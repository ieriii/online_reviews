I have been here twice; once for brunch and once for dinner. Needless to say, I can't wait to go back. It is always buzzing in there. Seating consists of two option: long communal tables of booths reminiscent of a pig pen. I sat both ways and the booth is great for privacy but I really like the communal tables.  Brunch:  I love eggs benedict as much as the next person but these were a whole new level. The eggs are poached in red wine so they have this devilish purple hue. Instead of ham or bacon, a heaping pile of prosciutto accompanies this re-imagining of a brunch staple. The weisswurst and the pastrami are also delicious.  I would also suggest ordering the frites with egg for the table to whet your appetite. Dinner is an entirely new level of pork consumption. It's the Publican, so what did I expect? Prior to dining here, I was a pork rind virgin. I was missing out! The spicy pork rinds here are fresh, amazing, and worth a try. Our server highly recommended the Pig's Head but the kitchen had already run out. It was only 6:30pm so I assume this is a popular choice and will give it a shot next time.  She also recommended the suckling pig, the bolito misto, and a watermelon based salad. I had no clue what to expect but the flavors were complex and everything was cooked perfectly. (It may have helped that exec. chef Paul Kahan was in the house that night!)  We topped it off with a waffle and hazelnut tart. Why doesn't everyone serve waffles for dessert? It is not cheap and not the best place if you are trying to impress a vegetarian but I love it and I can't wait to go back. Side Note: The bathroom is a spacious unisex room with private toilets and a large communal sink reminiscent of The Chamber of Secrets (HP). Random but I like it
