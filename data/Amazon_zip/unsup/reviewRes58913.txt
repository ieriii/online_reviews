Had a family dinner at Sunda last night - 20 people in the back semi-private room. Everyone raved about the food. And the service was awesome as well. Thanks to Angie for making all the arrangements for our group. The cripsy rice with Kobe beef tartare, Tail of Two Tunas and the Black Cod were highlights.
