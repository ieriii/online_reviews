Delicious!I came here with an omnivore friend who wasn't sure if they had a lot of vegetarian choices, so I was a little skeptical to begin with, but I was blown away.We shared this appetizer which was a portobella mushroom topped with literally the best soy beef I've ever had and some cheese. If that was the entire meal, I could have left very, very pleased, but there was even more goodness involved... A Tofu sandwich with incredibly flavorful and non-slimy tofu, beans, and other veggies (very filling and delicious) and these long, crispy plantain chips with this garlic sauce spread over them that I have yet to stop craving. If you haven't eaten here yet, you should.Not everything was perfect- It is a pretty small place (but cute, and they have a patio), and it took a while to get our food (there were a few people that were there waiting before we ordered), but the girls at the front were helpful and nice, and- as aforementioned- the food was incredible.
