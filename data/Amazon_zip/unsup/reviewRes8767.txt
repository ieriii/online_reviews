One of the best pizza places in Chicago! Reminded me of the pizzas I've had in Rome... the crust was crispy and chewy, not too thick or thin, and topped with very fresh ingredients. Not the traditional Chicago style deep dish pizza, but if you're looking for thin crust pizza you're not going to find much better in the area. We ordered one red and one white pizza. The red sauce had the right balance of sweetness and tang whereas the white pizza was not overly oily or heavy. Can't wait to go back and try a few more pizzas!
