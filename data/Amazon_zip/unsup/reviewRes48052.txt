Another trip to Chicago, another mind blowing meal. This place is cool and funky and I totally understand how they won a James Beard award for Graphics, although I think they also deserved the award for design. You feel like you're in a mead hall and Sir Gawain or Beowulf will pop in at any moment and be confused about how pretty and well-decorated it is. Six of us shared a delicious spread with great suggestions from our server. The highlights for me would be the half-chicken--sublime, the oysters--best I have ever had, duck hearts--so amazing, I don't even have the right words for them, the potted rillete--again, so mindbogglingly delicious I don't know where to find the words. It tasted like the best BBQ ever, but that description does it no justice and the asparagus-- best I have ever had. No questions asked. Just get it, no matter what. They did an amazing job staggering the dishes so we weren't overwhelmed by several dishes at one time. Service was helpful, attentive and fun. The beer list was endless and impressive and the desserts sounded good, although we were too full to partake. I would suggest coming here if you are an adventurous eater. Some of the better dishes aren't run of the mill restaurant offerings, which is why it's such a fun place.
