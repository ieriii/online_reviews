You may ask yourself, "5 stars for a churrascaria?" And my answer, "Hell yes brudda!" That's because TdB is and endless exploration of delicious decadence!  I can now compare it to the other churrascarias of similar acclaim in the greater Chicagoland area (you heard me Fogo, Sal, Brazzaz, amongst others).  The "salad bar" is almost worth the visit alone -- there's salad, of course. BUT, sushi? My latest visit yielded lobster bisque, WITH CHUNKS OF LOBSTER IN IT! And, at the end of the bar, on a stand by itself, feijoada....'nuff said. Then, there's the meat. Yes, meat on swords. Served by gauchos (just wanted to type the word gaucho). Endless meat. Copious amounts of meat. All for your protein-feasting satisfaction. Top sirloin. Bottom sirloin. Filet - good. Filet wrapped with BACON - yes please, I'll take two. OH, speaking of bacon, on the salad bar, there is bacon to top your salad. No, not "baco-bits" or dregs of bacon -- a tureen filled with WHOLE PIECES OF BACON! A TUREEN OF BACON PEOPLE! Right, back to the meat. Beef rib - almost took away a star for this, as it was grisly, dry, and well, dry. Spicy sausage. And, the star, picanha, which gains that lost star right back.  Service is impeccable. I mean impeccable. Napkin behind the glass as water is refilled. Efficient and not cloying, over-your-back-until-you-finish-that-last-piece-of-chicken. And, as it was my birthday (last week that is), the server brought out a dessert with "Happy Birthday Last Tuesday" which brought a laugh to the table (BTW, if you get Jordan - she's the one with the Buddy Holly's - she is a fantastic server and should get your best tip). Again, we're talking about a churrascaria. But eating at this TdB was like having dinner at a fine dining establishment. I look forward to eating here again....soon...but, after I get rid of this meat baby.
