I have been to the most expensive restaurants in the city, as well as in many other cities.....HOWEVER The Pasta Bowl is hands down my favorite go-to place in the city. I moved south of North Ave. and I was SOOOO sad when I found out that they don't deliver to me anymore! I have been going here for years and I will ALWAYS go here. Farfalle Pollo is TO DIE FOR!!!
