Clearly, I won't be writing a review that will replace the one they have on a postcard, extolling the crappy aspects of the place. I love Longman! Things I particularly enjoyed on my recent (of MANY) visits:*Kentucky Fried Quail*Wild Boar Sloppy Joe*Zabuton*Pea Agnolotti (friend from SF said it was the best thing he'd eaten during his week in Chicago)*La Fin du Monde (anyplace that serves this is tops with me)The fact that they're Michelin-starred means the Michelin people know what they're doing.
