I've been going to this place for over a year now, probably a little since it opened. I have enjoyed the food and the variety of different flavors they've added to their menu, but I can't believe the service I last received.  My family was cautious to explain exactly how they wanted their food. The server seemed confused when they were giving specific instructions, as if they just didn't exist. I could tell it bugged the server. The food was served to our liking but I also noticed that the restaurant wasn't as full and we were not being attended to often. My glass of water was usually empty, we had to continue to ask for coffee refills, we would see bus boys and serves standing around.  When she called our serve over, she waived her hand to get his attention, he approached her and waved his hand in her face. Why such behavior?! I understand that some costumers may seem difficult at times, but doesn't the saying go "the customer is always right?!" After he did that I was convinced to never visit again, and what is sad, the server was the owners relative.
