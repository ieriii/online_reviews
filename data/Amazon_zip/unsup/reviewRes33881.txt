Sultan's Market is the BEE'S KNEES. Not only do they have awesome food you get in an extremely timely fashion, but the place is BYOB with a pretty great beer selection just across the street! Bring in some nice wine or a six-pack of a nice Belgian beer (or whatever beer you prefer) and get ready for a fast, delicious meal. I always get the Chicken Schwerma dinner when I go, but I've also had the Falafel sandwich and it is also very good. If you don't like the cucumber salad that comes with everything they will hook you up with extra hummus on the side (which is super solid.) Definitely worth a visit and it's just as good carry out as it is eating it right there. Can't go wrong!
