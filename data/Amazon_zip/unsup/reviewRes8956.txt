Spacca Napoli is by far my favorite place to eat in Chicago. The grilled veggie app. is a must. If you are lucky enough to have soup or mussels as a special, you must try that too. And the pizzas are too good to be true. All ingrediants are ultra fresh, the service is very good, even the desserts merit a positive mention. The best part of a meal at Spacca is how I feel when leaving. I am full, but satisfied. Food tastes good at a lot of restaurants, but how it sits separates the one and done places with the regulars. Every time I walk out of Spacca, I think to myself, that was great, and I feel even better. I do not live too close but make sure to get there one out of every 3 times I eat out.
