Everything positive already said about XOCO I agree with and won't repeat. However I do have some new compelling evidence for those of you who haven't dined here yet and that is when I was there after work on a Wednesday there was an Amish couple eating at XOCO. So if they have 1) heard about it 2) found their way to Clark and Grand 3) seemingly liked what they were eating then there is no more reason for you to not go. It was better than I was expecting and delicious and really great. One thing I would recommend is getting the vanilla soft serve ice cream over the chocolate sauce with the churros but that could be my own aversion to sweet things. I now want to make it my mission to go back once a week on a different day so I can try the special.
