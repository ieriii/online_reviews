I am a bar snob, hands down. I want good drinks, great atmosphere, but honestly, when my husband and I go out- we just want to have a fantastic time. And here, we always leave super happy, and super tipsy. (thankfully we live down the street) So what if our wallet is a tad lighter. Thats why you go out, duh!! And at the violet hour, I feel pampered. We always sit at the bar, its like witnessing magic the way they make the drinks- especially when they have to crack an egg. oh so fabo!!Last time we were there, I think Troy was our bartender and he braved through all of the questions that my hubby was throwing his way. Whats that? where's that whiskey from? How many Pisco's do you have? etc. Kinda embarrassing normally, but Troy was happy to educate my liquored up lover even when he was extremely busy. So happy we live in an area that this kind of establishment stays busy. Its worth not eating out as much to come have a few perfect cocktails now and then.
