It's kinda funny to me that so many people consider this to be Mexican food. Actually it's very watered-down compared to authentic Mexican food. That being said, I still enjoy eating here, but I just don't consider the to be truly 'Mexican'. I do like that it's very fast and it's very affordable, so yes, I don't mind recommending it, just don't be disappointed if you have your heart set on a Earth-shattering Mexican experience.
