This hotel is like the Waldorf Astoria of Chicago. Its oppulent, its grand, its a Hilton, but its a tad bit musty. The location is fantastic and the its huge. The lobby is gorgeous too. The housekeeping staff is friendly and efficient. The front desk was hit or miss for me (one agent was less than happy to check me in, the other was incredibly gracious). The rooms are nice. The decor is cool and modern, but in line with the existing style of the hotel...sort of Hollywood glam (but in Chicago). The beds are comfy...but my bathroom was tiny....I mean, extend your arms and you are touching the shower and the door with the sink in front of you and the toilet behind you...TINY. Elevators can be a bit slow, even though there are like 10 of them...perhaps a few were in repair?  Bottom line: If you can score a good deal. Stay here. I'm not sure I would splurge on this hotel though.
