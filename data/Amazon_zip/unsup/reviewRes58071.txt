I remember the menu being fairly lengthy but I was there for the spicy beef stew noodle soup .So I didn't spend much time perusing. My, what a bowl of noodle soup (my picture of it might make you drool) - nearly perfect (I wish it were spicier though).The beef is in big, tender chunks. And it's not just meat but the tendon (which Chinese people tend to love) - amazing amounts of tendon. The five spice broth is deep, clear, and beefy. The noodles are not hand-pulled but they're thick and soft. They add spinach and a bit of chopped, pickled mustard greens. Liberal amounts of white pepper round out the dish. It's served piping hot and is very filling.Awesome!
