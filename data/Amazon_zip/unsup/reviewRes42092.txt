We had a chance to visit Gilt Bar while in Chicago for business/mini vacation. Open Table showed no reservations until 11pm, but luckily we called because a 10pm opening came up. Got there a little early and had a quick drink in the basement bar, Curio. Very unique place and a little odd to have a hostess seat you. But given the small space, it actually worked for us. Once we finally got our table, the rest is history! Unbelievable food and our waitress was incredibly friendly. Recommendation: Get the bone marrow appetizer!
