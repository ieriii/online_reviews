Well I came to a brewing company and I didn't have the beer. That aside, everything else, including the atmosphere and wait staff was great.  I wasn't drinking last night, which is shocking in its own right, and the bartender wasn't sure how much to charge for a diet coke. This amused me more than it should have. Then, someone told me they had ordered bacon fat popcorn. I made a "wtf" face and was in disbelief that such a thing existed. I personally declared it a heart attack in a bowl, but I must admit, it was pretty delicious. It was infused with bacon and crispy bacon pieces. Everyone knows bacon makes everything better, just like Ranch dressing, so I'm sure you'll love it too if you happen to order some.
