Not-your-average...A first for Chicago, this is the only place I've found that does pizza as they do in Brazil (no, it's not all churrascarias).Really excellent pizza (I didn't try the chicken), cooked in a 650-degree oven. You can see the flames from the Brown line stairs!Top notch, fresh ingredients (great sauce, delicious italian sausage, tasty mushrooms), and--the key--a nice light crust that has both a good crisp on the outside while preserving some doughiness on the inside. If you dig on that style, you'll get a great rendition here, absolutely loaded with both traditional and unusual toppings. Try the "Portuguesa," a standard in Brazil but relatively unknown here. Still working out the operational side (they just opened, I'll cut them some slack), but very friendly and informative staff.  Definitely the best thing going in the immediate vicinity.
