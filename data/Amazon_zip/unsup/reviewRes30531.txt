Nana's is amazing not just because my family owns it but because I know good food and it doesn't get much better than this. Everything is organic, everything is home made including the chorizo. I make my own chorizo and my aunts recipe is pretty similar to mine that I learned from my Dad. You don't want to eat that at some unknown place because I've seen what people hid in that stuff. This is the real thing with real food and everything I have had hear is stellar. I don't have to eat hear when I come to Chicago to visit but believe me I do and I don't eat here for free there are too many of us and they would go broke. Try it when your in town and I guarantee you, you will love it..
