Wildfire makes a mean chopped salad ... it's sad when that is your first thought to a steak resturant. but that's my first thought. The desert was good too I suppose. This place is very crowded on the weekends so reservations are a good idea. The drinks have a tendency to be weak at most. And the steak is okay. It's really not worth the price by any means.
