If you're looking for regular generic pizza, don't come here. If you are looking for a pie with delicious crust, fresh toppings & gooey cheese, this is it. We love their delivery - it takes 45 min (the pie takes a bit to cook) but it always arrives steaming hot & on time. If you are looking for an app, their breaded mushrooms are delicious. It's hard to get a seat, that's why we opt for delivery.
