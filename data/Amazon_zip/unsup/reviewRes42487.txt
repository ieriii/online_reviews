It's hardly the best deep dish in town, but it's damn good and has TONS of toppings to try. I also highly recommend their thin crust....most people pass over it for the bellyful of deep dish, but it's amazing-- especially the wheat crust. I will say also that their delivery is super-prompt and always arrives hot!
