The dozen times I've been here over the past 2 years must count for something. They're a hike from my apartment but I make the trek for the delicious breakfast. If you're around on the weekend, order the Huevos Rancheros for an awesome treat, but really everything there is delicious. What they say about the layout and service are my one star deduction. Enjoy!
