The vibrant decor is a perfect match for the flavorful cuisine. I highly recommend it if you and your loop coworkers are looking for a unique lunchtime experience. It is worthy for celebrations, and the lunchtime prices are reasonable. The tortilla soup is phenomenal - do not miss it! It prompted my current obsession with tortilla soup, but I have yet to find another to live up to Carnivale's recipe. As for the ceviche sampler, while it was very tasty, the small amounts were not quite worth the high price.
