From the beer list alone, I was excited to try this place. And it mostly didn't disappoint. It's true the beer list is huge -- I think about 30 drafts and 50 bottles -- and all micro- or import brews. Some really interesting choices, too. Now if only they could get Ommegang beers on there... But I digress. As a bar, Bad Apple is great. We got there, got seated and had beers in our hands in 10 minutes. As a restaurant, Bad Apple has a loooooooong way to go. We were seated in the bar even though both rooms of the restaurant section were practically empty. Our burgers took forever to come. The waitress got one person's fries order wrong. And the other fries were ridiculously salty. I ordered the curry fries -- the fries that had curry on them were great; the others weren't. The mushroom burger that comes on an English muffin was great, except the English muffin needed to be toasted. One person in our party did get to taste a beer before ordering. And when we did see our waitress, she was friendly. But we also witnessed the table next to us being served the wrong food. So they have some kinks to work out. I'll be back certainly. But if they don't fix their food serving issues, it may only be for beer.
