In my years in Chicago, I often visited this place for lunch. They have a pretty large menu, covering many different types of cuisine. The portions are large, and make sure to save room for their made-for-you desserts. The dcor is pretty cool, and I really haven't had anything that I disliked. Their breakfast menu is great, too (I have tried making omelets like theirs, but have fallen short many times...).
