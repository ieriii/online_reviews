Came here one night in late November with a couple friends. We sat outside in the covered area with the heat lamps, though it was very windy outside. The lamps were doing an ok job keeping up... we made up for the difference by putting on our Prosecco and Wine jackets and continued ordering a smorgasbord of food to share.  The cheese plates were delicious, nice and creamy goat cheese, the olives were great, and so were the eggplant spread and chicken kebab. I liked the atmosphere, it wasn't too upscale and overall the service was pretty fast. We ordered our dinner items in a couple rounds, and everything came out pretty quickly.  It's a great place to go and have a casual get-together, and I liked how the seating allowed for some cross-conversation with your neighbors. Give it a go!
