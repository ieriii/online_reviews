Ab-so-lute-ly delish wings up in here! We got the 5 wings and fries platter along with the baby buddha with bulgogi. Both super yum, but I must admit I was more of a fan of the wings as it's more of a signature dish. Duuuuh me. So I was eyeing and munching off hub's wings. Hey now, what's mine is mine and what's yours is mine. :) i kiddd. i kiddd. Anyway...the baby buddha was great - but I mean, it's bi bim bop - nothing mind blowing, but still good. I was craving egg so it fit the bill. I wish I tried the burrito since it's another signature and we literally drove out of our way to get here. I guess I gotta go back. Those wings and shoe string fries make the trip worth it. The seoul sassy sauce is def a must to try for wings along with sriracha. Well, that is, if you like spicy. For any of the bowls, I would lightly add the sauce as you go. I started dumping away once I realized I liked the sassy, but by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, it was overwhelmingly sweet. Ugh. So beware. Oh, and they have the ice cream from those carts with bells that come around in the summer. Got me a milky coconut, which completed my meal nicely. wooot!
