In the wise words of Homer Simpson, "innie... slowly becoming...an outie!" That is exactly how I felt after eating at Brazzaz.  On a Thursday night, we were quickly seated at a table and immediately directed to the salad bar. If my boyfriend didn't warn me to save room for the meats, I could've easily filled up just from the food at the salad bar. The assortment of food was superb. You have your variety of meats and cheeses, raw vegetables, ceviche, pickled items, smoked salmon, ahi tuna, sushi rolls, bread, and of course, every type of salad possible. The Brazilian chicken salad was delish with its sweet pineapple pieces mixed with it. There was also a row of hot sides near the salad bar, consisting of white rice, black beans, and cheese tortellini, which we purposely avoided. When we made it back to the table, our drinks were ready for us along with a basket of warm cheesy buns, fried plantains, and mashed potatoes. The wait staff was always on top of things and constantly replenishing our starter dishes (especially the fried plantains!) The cheesy buns were my personal favorite. They are bite sized and extremely chewy/dough-like in the center.  The moment we flipped our coin to indicate we were ready, we were bombarded with servers...in a good way! There was a constant flow of various meats coming to our table. I can't recall any meat that left me unsatisfied. The only disappointment was that my stomach couldn't handle all the food Brazzaz had to offer. The two dishes that stood out to me was the grilled pineapple and the shrimp...or maybe those were the only two items I could identify after my plate was smothered with meats? One day I will come back, and try their desserts! Until then, my body is still in the process of digesting the meal
