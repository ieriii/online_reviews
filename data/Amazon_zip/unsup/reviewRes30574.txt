Another Rockit Ranch production! What can I say about this place that hasn't been already said???? Came here for dinner once and it was pretty decent, but recently came for brunch this past Sunday and its whats up! They have an East meets West thing going with their brunch which make for an interesting selection. SInce I am from the western hemisphere I went with something from the West...the melted brie & mushroom omelet. One of the best omelets I've had in awhile. The omelet comes with breakfast potatoes and a small salad. I partnered the meal with a few strawberry mimosas. My girl went with the East wing of the menu, the Thai Omelet which includes shrimp, pork, fish cake, watercress, chili & bean sprouts. I had a taste and it was pretty damn tasty/spicy.  Def a fan and will make this one of my main brunch spots!
