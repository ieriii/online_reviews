Just went to Caro Mio again last night...I have NEVER been disappointed...Their brushetta special with fresh mozzeralla was scrumptious!...I only can review one main dish though, because seriously it's all I ever get...It's just that good.. It's Caro Mio's homemade Gnocchi special...The one with the creamy tomato sauce and asiago stuffed...I can't wait to eat my leftovers for lunch. Caro Mio is the best...You will be thrilled you tried their wonderful dishes!
