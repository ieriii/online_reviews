I truly loved this place and I'm super excited to go back soon. The entire ambiance is amazing, however I stress the importance of reservations. Mercat a la Planxa is located in the Blackstone Hotel on Michigan Ave and is an upscale tapas restaurant and it gets busy. I was so happy I had reservations because it was a Friday night and it was crowded. I had dinner with my BF and we opted for the Chef's tasting menu for $55 a person. At first we were scared that it wouldn't be filling but they brought out so many dishes, we left happy and stuffed. I actually can't remember all the dishes but the best ones do stand out still. The tiger shrimps (wow, they were huge), papas bravas, pulpo con papas (octopus and potatoes), the skirt steak with three different sauces, and the flat bread with aged asiago cheese, just to name a few dishes. OH, don't forget the dessert croquettes, pure heaven (Chocolate and Carmel fried with ice cream) The staff was extremely nice, however our waiter was on some sort of controlled substance. He still was very attentive but his eyes were so far gone, it was actually funny. Drinks: Know that's the reason I didn't give the place 5 stars. We ordered a glass a wine each and wow were we shocked when we got the bill. $24/glass. The hostess recommended the wine but it was our mistake not asking the price. Ouch. For our second drink we order the house sangria and it was good but I've had much better. However, the food was excellent so that made us forget about our drinks. Price: The restaurant is very pricey, but its a nice treat once in awhile. I highly recommend it for a romantic date. wink wink...
