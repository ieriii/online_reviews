I am a vegetarian and so I ordered the veggie skillet. To my surprise, there were chunks of meat in my meal. There weren't enough chunks to make it the actual meat skillet so somehow chunks of meat got into my meal. I hate throwing food away so I had my husband eat it. We did mention it to the waitress so that she could let the cooks know in the back so that it wouldn't happen again. (I know if my sister, who is a vegetarian also, had gotten that plate she would have freaked out) I would have given this place 3 stars if it wasn't for the black hair we found in the meal I gave my husband once he was done eating it. I will go back to try this place one more time since I always see so many people waiting out there. I will definitely make sure to stress that I want it meatless.
