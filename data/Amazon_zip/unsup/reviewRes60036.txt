not the very best of southern cuisine, but really good for chicago.salads are huge, side salad for dinner could have fed another person easily. shrimp&grits: grits a little thick, but tasso ham gravy was spot on.comparing this place to restaurants in Columbia SC, Myrtle Beach, SC, Greenville NC and Hilton Head, it compares pretty well. server was attentive, but s-l-o-w-p-a-c-e-d. go with people who talk a lot or alone and read a book, you won't notice as much.
