I love this place - finally a bar that's great for non-drinkers. I always order mocktails here, and the bartenders consistently deliver imaginative and complex flavored drinks for $5 a pop. I usually get two drinks for every visit. One is almost always strawberry based and fruity. The other is where the bartenders really shine. Once I got a cinnamon flavored drink, not fruity at all. Delicious! Last time I was there, my non-strawberry drink was a lemon ginger mint concoction. The bite of the ginger was surprising, and yet, the sweetness of the lemon tamed it.  Get the spiced beer nuts while you're here too. It's a bowl of mixed nuts (no peanuts, yay!) that go great with the drinks.
