This is pretty much my favorite sushi place going on five years. Here's why: - affordable. It's BYOB so I can enjoy a yummy white wine and perhaps some Sapporos as I dine on my food. Signature rolls are in the $10-$15 range, all others are under $10 - tasty. Everything I've had, I liked. The things I MUST order each time: spicy miso, una avo roll, and per my husband, a seaweed salad. had their signature ceviche roll for the first time recently and drooled madly over it. oh baby. fish is always fresh. - service. consistently consistent. good service. - dessert. i'm not a desserty, but 3 times out of 5 i oder it here. it's perfectly proportioned, priced and pretty. Pitfalls of coast - it's usually PACKED on the weekends beginning 7-9. when they say 2 hour wait, they're not just saying it. expect it to be at least 2 hours - said packed crowd is often really douche-y - sometimes it gets a little steamy in there. they need a dehumidifier or something.
