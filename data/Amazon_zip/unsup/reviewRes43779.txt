Excellent food, excellent service, excellent prices -- what every business strives for!! The space is bright, well-designed & decorated, and has a relaxed feel. It is clearly a favorite with the locals. Don't let the lines turn you away either -- the service is efficient and you'll place your order sooner than you'd expect. A great place to grab brunch with a friend or two. I'll be back soon!
