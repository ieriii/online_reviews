I've never actually been to the restuarant but have gotten pizza delivered from here many times. This is a review strictly of the pizza and not the restuarant/service. This pizza ties with Lou Maltnati's as best pizza in Chicago! (IMHO at least). The crust is thick and soft, and carmelized with cheese around the outside. Peperoni has a nice flavor (peperoni and onion toppings are highly recommended). The pizza is very filling- I can eat 2 pieces if I'm absolulety starving. However, as far as re-heating the next day, this pizza tastes the best, hands down. Crust and cheese holds up well, and it just tastes great.
