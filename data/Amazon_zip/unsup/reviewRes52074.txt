I really loved Gino's. A lot of people were telling me that Gino's was the tourist deep dish pizza spot and that it REALLY wasn't that good, but once that sweet crust and gooey cheese touches your lips, you realize they are bozo's. Gino's East was on my list of places to eat in Chicago so when I got to my hotel, I asked about the location of the restaurant. They not only gave me directions, but also gave me a card that let me get into a different line for people staying in near-by hotels. Basically, my line was 5 groups deep while the other one wrapped around the building into a parking garage. I tell you now, ASK FOR THIS CARD FROM YOUR HOTEL!!! I waited maybe 20 minutes to get a table, others probably waited over an hour. Once we got inside, our waiter was awesome. He explained the whole concept of deep dish and told us we should get a small for my girlfriend and I. I told him he was an idiot and didn't realize how much I can eat, so I got a medium with peppers, mushrooms, and pepporoni. The downfall is that it takes about 45 minutes for the pizza to be ready, so get an appetizer. We unfortunately didn't, so the anticipation for the pizza grew. Once it arrived, it was hot. Our waiter cut a few slices, and slapped it on our plate. The cheese goo'd everywhere. I waited a couple minutes then attacked with my fork and knife (yes, you need them). I was able to finish off two slices of the pizza and still going after a third while it laid in the pan. It was delicious. We chose to take the remaining pizza home since our hotel had a small fridge. The bill came out to about $30 for the pizza with a few drinks which is quite a bargain for the amount of good food we ate. Plus, for the next two mornings, I had a delicious breakfast of leftover Gino's East pizza. It really didn't get much better. In conclusion. Get the card from your hotel front desk for the quicker line. Get a bigger pizza than they say. Eat leftovers for breakfast. Be happy.
