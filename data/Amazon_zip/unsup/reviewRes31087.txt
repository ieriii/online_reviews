Boom. I feel a little weird giving a review, since I used to work there, but the thing is... it WAS my favorite restaurant before I worked there it WAS my favorite WHILE I worked there and its STILL IS my favorite. so bam. Take it, and I know it's quality, cuz I watched it happen. I know, sometimes the servers can be a little distant, but no matter where you go, if it looks super-busy, it's probably b/c it is super busy and the server isn't going to coddle you. The food is awesome, it's a bummer to go in and expect something and the menu is different and your something isn't on the menu, I totally get that...but the new stuff is always so bangin, you'll get over it, promise. I just love it. Plus, i feel like the vegan chz everywhere else is totally lame, and i just wanna DRINK IT HERE. (gross, not really) My point is, Vegan comfort food? bring it on.
