I rarely eat breakfast. It's just not something that I do on a regular basis. I make an exception for Yolk every time I'm in the Chicago area. If you stuck their menu on a dart board and threw a dart blindfolded, you'd get an insanely good meal every time. The portions are HUGE! ....and would you like a side of chocolate chip pancakes and maybe some fresh fruit to go along with that skillet? Why YES! That sounds wonderful!! Fresh strawberry orange juice is great too!
