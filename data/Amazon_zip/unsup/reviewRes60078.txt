I wouldn't come here for pho if I was craving pho. Surprisingly it gets packed for such mediocre tasting food, tastes like it's been bleached out for attractive measure.. Cred here: I've had at least 12 things off the menu.Reason I went: Because friends were attractive to the look.. sometimes you gotta dismiss the look for good food!
