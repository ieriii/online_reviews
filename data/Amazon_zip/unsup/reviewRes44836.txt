The famous deep-dish, stuffed pizza of Chicago was one of the first things I had as soon as I got to the city. And I was impressed. It lived up to its reputation as a fine, filling, and delicious dish. The best thing I felt then, actually, was the fact that it wasn't very expensive either. Overall the meal was delectable. Being a tourist attraction, I expected a lot of people. However, there were a LOT of people. My friends and I were waited for about two hours before our beeper sounded, and this was a Thursday night (granted in July). The service, however, was really good for the amount of people there. My refills (I drink a lot, and I drink quickly) were frequent, and our pizza didn't take too long to come out. Overall, it was totally Chicago, and totally great. The only reason five stars aren't given is because there truly is a lot of people, not a lot of room, and longer waits. That's not in the control of the restaurant, I understand, but it still did slightly hinder my dining experience.
