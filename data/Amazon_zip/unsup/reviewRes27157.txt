This is a strong four with a couple of quibbles. We went for lunch - lined up outside at 11:15 and there were already 20 people in front of us. Service was excellent - our server was cheerful, helpful and competent. She recommended as a starter a small casserole of mixed fall vegetables (baked apple, parsnips, cauliflower) with a creamy sauce and just a bit of heat. My mouth is watering just remembering it. Then we tried a duck tamal -- fresh corn masa with duck carnitas and a chile sauce -- also very good. The sweet potato sopes with pork were ok. The pork had good flavor, although I didn't catch much orange. Frijoles charros were excellent. A cold salad of jicama, cucumber & pineapple was sort of meh. I was expecting more of a slaw. Instead there were large pieces cut like cold French fries. That would have been ok but there wasn't enough lime and the chile power sprinkled on top left the bottom pieces with no seasoning at all -- it was basically just raw jicama. For an entree I ordered the cobia en crema de calabaza. The cobia was grilled perfectly, tender, with a smoky glaze. Great flavor. However, I was looking forward to the spaghetti squash accompaniment listed on the menu and there wasn't any. Instead, there was a little pyramid of rice. Still good, but a little disappointing. Dessert was a small spice cake with white chocolate ice cream. Just fabulous and the perfect ending. Now for a quibble. Since I was taking out-of-town guests I checked http://rickbayless.com for reservation information. The site clearly says Frontera takes a limited number of reservations -- call the phone number. I called the phone number 3 times, and each time heard a recording telling me to "check the website" for all the information. Click. Really frustrating. If they don't want to talk to customers, then why provide a phone number in the first place? Go early and get in line -- it's your only hope.
