I've been to Demera oodles of times, and the food is always consistently scrumptious, provided that you actually like Ethiopian food. My only qualm with this place is that they're always out of something that I want to order. Sometimes it's a type of beer; other times it's one of the dishes. Also, their coffee is fantastic. Annnnnd, watch out for the bones if you order something with meat in it.
