food was delicious (had the bone marrow, meatball slider, chicken kebabs, and milk-braised pork), atmosphere was warm and welcoming (sat outside - recommend it), and service was amazing.  i must specifically mention the service - i accidentally left my backpack under the table and didn't notice until we got to the airport for our flight home to los angeles. we called immediately and they told us they had found it and put it somewhere safe. the manager (wylie) was even willing to work with us to research how to ship it back to us in LA. we ended up finding a friend in the area to pick it up and ship it to us, and everything (including some valuable items) was in the backpack safe and sound. thank you, purple pig!
