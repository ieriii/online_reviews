A-ok is how I feel about this place, but I am open to coming back and adding another star. I want to. I would actually like to give this place 3 1/2 stars. Nice atmosphere, really friendly staff, prompt service. Beer was really good, and the waitress let me sample one before ordering. BUT, I am so disappointed in the reuben. I was hoping for something as delicious or more delicious (is that possible) as the reuben at Chicago Diner, and this reuben is no where near that deliciousness. Marinate isn't that great, it doesn't even taste like a reuben, has way too much of a tempeh taste (maybe thiner strips would have been better?) and worse, it tastes like something I could make at home. I was looking forward to having 1/2 a reuben and bringing the rest for lunch tomororw. I will eat it, but I'm pretty unexciting about lunch tomorrow.
