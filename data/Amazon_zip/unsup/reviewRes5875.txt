I love going to tapas restaurants and Davanti is like Tapas meets Italian. Very nice atmosphere and really good food. You cannot make reservations, but the wait actually wasn't bad. (but I also went on a Tuesday) On of my favorite dishes was the Crispy Poker Belly with Apple Mostarda. This is a must order dish! Some other dishes that I Really liked were: - Riccio di Mare e Granchio - Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno Some dishes that were pretty good were: - Risotto Carbonara - Pizza con Prosciutto e Rucola I would recommend staying away from the swordfish. It was decent, but it had a very fishy taste which I'm not used to for a white fish like swordfish. All-in-all, I really liked Davanti Enoteca and their take on small dish Italian food.
