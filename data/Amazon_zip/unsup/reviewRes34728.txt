I love Sushi X. Have been probably been there dozens of times, and they never seem to disappoint. Went most recently a couple of weeks ago, and between my wife and I, we shared the Godzilla roll, the crab rangoon, a spicy scallop roll and a few pieces of nigiri. Fish was fresh, preparation was wonderful, and, as always, the atmosphere was a pleasure. And, of course, always love the BYO option. This remains my go-to weeknight sushi stop.
