I'm not Greek and I'm no expert in Greek cuisine. However, I did spend a summer in Greece and have eaten at most of the places in Greektown and hands down, Artopolis consistently delivers fresh, fulfilling food. My favorites are their pizzas--- I know, it's Greek food, why am I eating pizza? Because it's delicious. Thicker buttery crust, light on cheese, heavy on toppings. Also love the hummus/veggie platter, the house wines, the fried doughnut dessert, the almond cookies (melomakarona?) and the spanikopita. I live in the area so anyone who ever comes to visit me gets to come here--- great hours and atmosphere too.
