Really nice place, I tend to take people here alot. Even though they have my favorite caesar salad (it is realllllly amazing) I have to give it a 3 cause their tap beer was infected!!!! If you ever have tap beer that leaves a buttery or vinegar-y after taste, that means its bad - and also means that the place hasn't cleaned their taps. (and its not really bad, might just give you some bad digestion later). But i used to work with beer, so i know. I wont stop going here, i just wont ever order a tap beer again.
