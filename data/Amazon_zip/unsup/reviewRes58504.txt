Simply It simply is it. - or at least where it's at. Our food was everything we wanted it to be: fresh, flavorful, delicate for the palate yet substantial for the belly. We started with the Grilled Lemongrass Beef as an appetizer. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect - but we ended up essentially making our own spring rolls. They were delicious - especially the dipping sauce which was light and sweet (you could taste a little sugar and hint of fish sauce), and fun to assemble. Definitely plenty for two or three to share.I had Pho for dinner which wasn't the absolute best I'd ever had, but it was definitely good. My friend had the short ribs which were truly amazing. I mean - best short ribs I'd ever tasted. So juicy and light in flavor. You could tell they had been marinated for a while and cooked perfectly. And they were an incredible deal. It was a HUGE plate of short ribs for only $14 - two people could easily make a meal out of them. My other friend got the salmon which was also great. So yes - the food was lovely! And we didn't have to go all the way up north to get it.But what really set us over the edge gushing with enthusiasm about this place was the staff. They were full of smiles and positive energy. The owner even jumped up from where he was sitting to wish us well as we left (he seemed equally excited when we came in). It felt like everyone who worked there felt a sense of ownership for the place, and were each sincerely excited about working there and sharing their enthusiasm with their patrons. I can't wait for my next visit!
