My family, friends and I love this place! I'm going to start by saying there Peking Duck family style dish my favorite item on their menu. I've tried the Peking duck in China and Sun Wah is the closes to replicate it. The skin is crispy and flavored well. The meat is juicy and not dry. They utilize every piece of duck, even using meat that wasn't cut and the bones as fried rice and soup. Other dishes: 1. Wonton Soup with Egg Noodles: (we like to exchange it with lo mein noodles) 2. Shirmp app: good 3. BBQ Combination: Pretty solid The venue is very large and is capable of seating many guests. One of the cleaner Chinese restaurants I've been to as well. The service is average. Be aware there may be wait time on the weekends.
