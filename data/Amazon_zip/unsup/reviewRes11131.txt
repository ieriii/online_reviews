I loved the New Haven pizza. We eat too much pizza, and it was great having a variety that was really different. We ordered the plain New Haven with basil, sausage, mushrooms and artichoke hearts. It was awesome. The medium pizza was enough for 2 people with leftovers. Thanks to my friend Damon for the recommendation. Service was great. It's a sport bar and very noisy and crowded, and the presence of those qualities always detracts from my enjoyment of any food establishment. That's just my taste and should not be viewed as a criticism of the restaurant. If I could share one final cultural note, probably more a Wicker Park observation than one particular to Piece, but the patrons of the restaurant were all either white or Indo-Middle Eastern. I'm from the south side so it is shocking to me sometimes how monocultural the trendy Wicker Park scene can be. Oh well. Lots of kids and families, though.
