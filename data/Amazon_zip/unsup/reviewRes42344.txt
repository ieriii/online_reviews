3rd times the charm gilt bar! this time i went with co-workers, one was in town from nyc, and they loved gilt bar. we shared the ham n cheese fondue for an app, not what we were expecting as in traditional like 70s fondue, but it was some toasted sour dough bread, the hot yummy cheese and a fried egg on top. pretty good stuff. we had the pot roast, good as always, the roasted chicken, which was tender, delicious and garlicy and the pork belly with lentils, which were the most delicious lentils ever. we shared the smashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with pork belly and parmesan for sides and they were great. i love those brussel sprouts, the combo of the sweet and salty is perfect. had a few whisky sours as well, good as always, not too much lemon and just the right amount of egg white on top, so good. love the gilt bar, always amazing
