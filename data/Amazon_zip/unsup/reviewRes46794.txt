I love the UC off of Clark and hadn't been to the one off of Devon, and when I went in over Memorial Day, I was delightfully surprised. Sure, I had heard that it had one the "Green Restaurant" award for their rooftop garden and local produce menu, but I totally loved everything about this place. I loved the little gated entrance with the al fresco dining option as well as the atmosphere inside, which matched what I loved about the Clark location. The food is good, and I love their soy mochas and mimosas. Can't wait to get back there.
