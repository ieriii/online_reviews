I expected a lot from this place, as I love tapas AND Iron Chef, but was sadly disappointed.  First, the atmosphere: It was a suprisingly unimpressive restaurant. It was SO LOUD that at a table of six, we had to yell across the table to communicate. And only the two people closest to the waiter could hear him and would have to repeat everything, telephone style, so the rest of us knew what we were eating. The music was up too high for the acoustics the room bounces around - it was ridiculous. The staff: our waiter seemed to whisper a bunch, seriously. we could barely hear him. Tables were far too close together as staff kept knocking into my fiance - without apology - and he was sitting in a non-traffic lane. Our waiter also spilled my mom's sangria on her, as well as dumping another into the purse of a lady behind us, and blamed the glass, stating it had a "small bottom". The food: I cringe as I type it, but I've had better tapas from the tourist trap Ba-Ba-Ree-Ba. Or Iberico, or People or any number of tapas places I've been to. For an Iron Chef, the menu was singularly uninspired and boring. It all looked and sounded interesting, but the taste was often flat. The get 2 stars where they should have 1 because: we did the "chef's selection" and they made sure I had a substitute for every seafood dish they brought out, which was a really nice gesture on their part because I don't eat seafood.
