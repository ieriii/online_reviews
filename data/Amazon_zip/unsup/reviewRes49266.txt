Do yourself a favor. Just go for the cheese flights and wine flights. It's okay. I won't judge you. You don't NEED vegetables. Not every night! Sometime, you just need CHEESE!  EXPENSIVE FANCY STINKY CRUMBLY SHARP SALTY CREAMY MILKY NUTTY CHEEEEEESE!!!!!  That's it! I totally understand! It's God's best edible creation! Don't fill up on FOOD, just CHEESE. I've said my peace.
