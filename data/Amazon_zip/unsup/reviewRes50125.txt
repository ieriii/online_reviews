I dug this place. It was nice to sit down and watch a Cubs game in an atomosphere that wasn't over crowded or so loud that I had to yell at my boyfriend to tell him I am hittin' the jane.  The bartender was friendly as heck too.  This place caters the jock, the snob, and the thrifty gal in me.  I will def be back for some grub and game in the near future.
