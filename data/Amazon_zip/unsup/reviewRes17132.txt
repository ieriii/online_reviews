Took my fiance' here after I proposed. It was a home run. The latin flavors reminded him of Venezuelan cooking and the decor was something out of Cirque du Soleil. Food was excellent, service was fantastic, and basically it was a home run! Thanks for that. This review is about a year and a half too late, but better late than never! I look forward to coming back, hopefully it's everything I remembered.
