Mmmm, so glad we tried XOCO while in Chicago! The 30 minute wait at lunch was worth it. The staff made the wait and ordering process very easy.  My husband and I each had a different "caldo" (soup), Aztec hot chocolate and churros. The caldos were simple but very fresh, filling and flavorful. Great for cold Chicago weather! The Aztec hot chocolate was delicious, as were the churros. I also enjoyed the complimentary sparkling water with lime....a nice touch.  The freshness of the food would definitely bring me back!
