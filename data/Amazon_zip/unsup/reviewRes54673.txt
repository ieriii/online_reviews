food here is excellent, you cannot argue that.this is corporate owned lettuce entertain you but this place is super expensiveand most people know this going into itwhen you go somewhere to pay top dollaryou expect everything to be top notchand everything that i ordered was excellentthe only beef i have on this place was my scallopsthey tasted good but they were brokenthere were three of them and none of them were together, they were pieced togethernow, if this was a place where you get 3 scallops for like $7 then I would not mindbut that is not this place, they should not be piecing together scallops for the price you paythey should be whole pieces that present nicely to the eyes as well as the palletwhen i want to spend money and have excellent food, this is one of those places to go to
