Bin 36's wine and dine concept of suggesting the wines that would pair well with your meal is helpful and fun to oenophiles and amateurs alike. It gives the inexperienced a baseline to try and learn about new wines and the chance for seasoned veterans to try something they might not have originally tried. When you go to Bin 36 you have to try their wine flights and cheese appetizer plate, it is an amazing experience at a reasonable price. Service and food are excellent. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who enjoys wine and food!
