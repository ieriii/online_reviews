The bar itself has a nice atmosphere but is nothing spectacular. The real attraction are the great jazz shows that go on there Sometimes it gets a little crowded and if you're looking to sit down during your stay you need to come at least an hour before the show (1.5 - 2 hours for a table). So the lack of room is sometimes a discomfort, but otherwise, I love the place!
