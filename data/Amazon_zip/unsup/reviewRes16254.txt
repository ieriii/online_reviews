Calo was one of the first restaurants that I went to after moving to Chicago over 2 years ago, and honestly I remember it being very unimpressive. Due to that I kind of knocked it off of my list of restaurants even after I moved into the neighborhood. This past monday a few of us were going out to celebrate my friends birthday and he selected Calo. I am so glad that he did. This experience was truly delightful. First of all we got some of the best service that I have ever experienced. The waitress was so nice and attentive and kept the (to die for) warm foccacia coming per our requests. Initially I thought the prices seemed a little high but for the size of the portion and the quality it is totally worth it. I had the Caprese Chicken which was tender and extremely flavorful. I also tried everyone elses and loved them all. To top off the great service she brought out a tiramisu with a candle so we could sing. All in all it was a great experince and I will definitely return sooner than 2 years from now. I really wanna try the pizza it looked delish!
