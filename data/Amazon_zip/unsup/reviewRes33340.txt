I was just there today and my opinion has not changed. I wanted to get the specialty pancakes with my omelette but there really aren't very many options for those specialty pancakes. the food was good but the service was pretty bad again. the server came over one time to ask if everythings okay and before i could answer and ask if she could bring me something she was already by another table. she also did not seem to listen, when she asked my dad if he would like ketchup for the skillet he said no but she brough it out for him anyway. Whats the point in asking if you're going to do it either way?
