I came here for New Year's Eve a few years ago, and I really enjoyed it. The restaurant had a pre-fixe menu, featuring so much food that I was full for days! The restaurant is very romantic, and we were seated right next to some musicians, who were fabulous but not overpowering.  The food itself is very good - the cheese fondue is delicious, and the dipping sauces for our main course were fantastic (and there were a bunch to choose from). My favorite part of the meal was our dessert - I can't say no to chocolate fondue!  I would definitely go back, but probably only for special occasions. The menu is kind of pricey if you're looking to get a full meal, but definitely a good option if you're looking for appetizers or just dessert.
