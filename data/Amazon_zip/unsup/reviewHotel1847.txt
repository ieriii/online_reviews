I really liked this hotel. They definitely have consistent theme at the W. You have to trudge through the nightclubby lobby to check in. If you're checking in late after a long flight, that can be annoying. I literally thought I was hallucinating in the elevator, but once checked into my room I was pleasantly surprised. The space was, clean, minimal and comfortable. While l loved the bathroom, the sink was a design failure. I spilled a ton of water out of the basin, it was a mess!  The lobby is a great area to hang out and the architecture is stunning. Loved how they embraced it while keeping the decor funky in classic W fashion. I found the service to be very helpful and accommodating as well.
