The food here is excellent and reasonably priced. We like to dine in but find the restaurant a bit cramped, if they would just remove a table or two, its not a huge place, it would make a big difference. We also order take out at least once a month. If you find yourself up in Edgewater and are a fan of sushi you should try this place.
