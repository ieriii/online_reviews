Def not my 1st choice to stay here but it's 2 blks from my offices, ergo, no-brainer when walking in Chgo in the wintertime. Valet, bellmen, servers = very cool group of guys. Each night I came back, whether from office or via cab from dinner, they'd say "welcome back!", always calling me by name (love that). The sucky part of the hotel is the actual room (I've stayed here a number of times, it's consistent). Old A/C wall units will dry you out to a crisp, and a 1 degree change on the thermostat equates to a 10 degree swing. The bathroom is uncomfortably small, even for a boutique hotel. It's small, even if you were in Europe at a boutique hotel. Lilliputian. The basin is a joke, but at least the shower is made for adult-sized people. Carpet is old, walls are thin. Beds are decent though, and if you're an In-Touch member you do get $10 mini bar credit. Fitness center is serviceable so at least you got that going for you.
