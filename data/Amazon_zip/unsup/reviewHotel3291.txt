Stayed here for my 21st birthday weekend. Check in was fast, and the front desk people were so sweet (Levi was the best). To celebrate my birthday they sent up complimentary wine and strawberries. The beds were very comfortable, and the products in the shower were better then your average hotel, almost Aveda like. The hotel bar was also very fast. I only had one drink down there, and then went out. I had so much fun staying here, and would return in a heartbeat.
