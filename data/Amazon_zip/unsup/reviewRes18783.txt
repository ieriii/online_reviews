As the 1089th review of XOCO, I probably won't have anything revolutionary to say. However, if I had one tip for you, it would be this: don't go on a weekend afternoon unless you have a lot of time to kill. We went on a Saturday afternoon and although the food was pretty good, I'm not sure it's worth a 45+ minute wait. The whole "you wait in line but can't place your order until you have a table" thing is kind of annoying. I understand that is their process or whatever, but I'd prefer to just wait for a table like a normal restaurant instead of standing in what amounts to a cafeteria line. We got to the front of the line and didn't have a table, so we were stuck waiting for a few minutes, and some people CLEARLY didn't understand the situation and one lady even said to us "what the heck are you waiting for?" Lame. Food wise, I was happy with the torta, and moderately disappointed with the churros. And I never figured out if I was supposed to leave a tip on the table, or what. They DO bring your food out to you, but you pretty much do everything else yourself, including getting your own water. You also pay at the counter when placing your order, like a fast food place. Were we supposed to tip? Who knows...
