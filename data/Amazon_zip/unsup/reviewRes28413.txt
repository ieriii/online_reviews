this place is awesome and there's a reason why this place is always packed for dinner. it's definitely one of the best deep dish pizzas i've had in chicago. my friend was starting to complain that the mozzarella sticks were just the frozen type that you can make at home. but... i had to remind him that a) they're only $3.50, and b) it's really all about the pizza. you can't go into this place expecting or wanting it to be something that it's not, other than good food with good service, ambiance, etc.  make sure you get fresh basil as an ingredient and it will make everything A-OK.  p.s. on our way out, every single employee (and there are a lot on a friday night) said some variation of "goodbye and thank you for coming in." awesome.
