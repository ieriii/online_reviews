I have been here a few times and always enjoy it as a brunch spot. Most recently I had: Lemon ricotta/blueberry pancakes=AMAZING Thai Ginger Sausage=Different and very good Breakfast Burrito=Okay, a little bland for my taste. Service=Slow for for Friday morning. Wait was okay but food took forever. Overall would still highly recommend.
