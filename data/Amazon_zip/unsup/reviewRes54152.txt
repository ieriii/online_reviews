This is close to a 5 start. The sandwiches were fabulous! I had theMilanesa which is: Crispy chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. My husband ordered the Mole Poblano which is: braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy garnishes, and fresh cheese. If you go on an empty stomach, make sure to order a side salad or their chips as my husband was somewhat hungry he left. This is definitely a place I would crave on a regular basis. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu.
