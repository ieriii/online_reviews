This is a five star jazz club, if you really love jazz or are up for the experience. With a slightly higher cover and $8 beer and $10-15 mixed drinks, may seem pricy, but the management does everything they can to land absolutely the best jazz acts available- small club though, so that can be a challenge. I caught the Mike Jones Trio there recently. They were tight, and a $12 cover is insanely cheap for an act like that. The historic atmosphere, and the shrine to Al Capone is neat too, but what I really like is they're serious about their jazz. This is a one star club if you want to take flash pictures of yourself and the club in the middle of the set or want to talk over the music. You will garner dirty looks from both fellow patrons and the bouncer, and you will be shushed. This is a refuge for people who love jazz, it is not for those who consider jazz to be background music. Some people slam the Green Mill for this pretense, and give the staff and club a lot of undeserved grief, but it's part of the reason why I go. I like great music in a small venue.  That said, I have to travel a distance to go the Green Mill, so I only go there when they have acts I want to see. I couldn't comment intelligently on the quality of the musicians, if you drop in on any given night.
