I'm on a cross country road trip through the states right now and if there was one thing I was looking forward to in all my travels it was hitting up Chicago and the Violet Hour. A friend of mine from San Francisco told me about this place. It is a very secretive. It has no sign, and at first, I was not sure I actually found it. When I pushed the door on Damen Avenue and it opened, I felt like saying "Phew". Violet Hour reminds me of Bourbon and Branch in San Francisco. But unlike Bourbon and Branch, you do not need a reservation and the bar is very large with plenty of bar seats and tables. Basically, it has everything I like about the SF mixology bars with more space and intimacy. I'm all for it. The drinks are excellent. I particularly enjoyed their Juliet and Romeo cocktail, a cucumber, rose water, and mint gin cocktail. My mother and I sat at the bar and ran down the entire menu with the bartender before ordering. He was extremely patient and kind to us and guided us through the menu. He also went out of his way to make me a mezcal drink later on that was not on the menu.  All drinks were well balanced, and not the least bit too sweet. They echoed the simplicity of the beverages that characterized early mixology. My mom and I even learned how this industry had changed over the years, and how The Violet Hour was bringing back cocktails that were made with freshly squeezed ingredients. All and all, I've been to a lot of fancy cocktail bars, but I have never had such a positive experience, and learned so much as I did at Violet Hour.
