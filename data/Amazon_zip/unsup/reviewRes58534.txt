We have dined here at least 3 times already and each time I try something new and get blown away. The truffle egg toast, the ravioli are delicious. The cacio e pepe pasta and the rigatoni are a must, order a few things and share. I love the daily specials, we were there last monday and got a burger and beer for $9 . Also Im an oldie but goody, and remember sole mio very well. They have dedicated a chicken dish to that restaurant and its perfect. Best chicken ever. Last night the chef brought over a 24 hour risotto, UNBELIEVABLE DELICIOUS!!! Never had anything like this in Chicago. The room itself is really warm and friendly. Nice crowd all evening and great action/people watching.Every one is super friendly. By the time you walk in the door, from the hostess to wait staff. I had a rough day at work and they made it all go away! You can go check out the wines on the shelf, grab one off the wall,and get it for retail plus $7 corkage. Best deal around.I will keep on going back and will recommend it to all my friends. A most to try and so good you will try again!
