This place was my last meal in Chicago before leaving at the end of a weekend visit to my friend. So the two of us stopped in with fingers crossed, but low hopes of not having to wait for a table at 6:30PM on a Sunday night. I couldn't afford a wait because my flight back was at 9:30, and we were tight on time, but I still insisted that I wanted to check this place out. Luckily, we were seated right away, and the service was very quick and attentive as well. Very impressive. We weren't too hungry, so we decided to go with 3 dishes between us though we wanted to try an infinite number. We got the following: roasted beet, goat cheese, pistachio salad fried pig ear with deep fried kale and an egg bone marrow spread The roasted beets were great. My friend was quite surprised that we could be taught to appreciate such an unpopular item of food such as a beet. He gave mad kudos to purple pig for that. Then the pig ear...the egg was slightly overcooked because there was no "runny part" of the egg yolk to break, but it was fine. Still a good dish. The bone marrow...need I say more? I just love bone marrow, and they do it well. When I come back to Chicago, definitely stopping by here again, but properly next time for the full wine and dine experience.
