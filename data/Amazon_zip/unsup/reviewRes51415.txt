The portions are gigantic. $9 for a taco, tostada, 2 enchiladas, beans and rice-I could have eaten it over 2 meals. The Margaritas are great, they had an excellent tequila selection, we just had the house margaritas and paid the MOST reasonable price of $6. I liked the atmosphere, the location (off the beaten path and in walking distance to me), the service and again the food quality.  Great restaurant, highly recommended.
