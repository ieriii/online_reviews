I give 5 star reviews to places I would eat at on an everyday basis, and oh Meli, if I could I would. I can confidently say that anything on the menu is delicious. I had the Turkey sausage scrambler: excellent- but I would suggest specifying less Mozzarella (I'm not a huge cheese fan) But the REAL highlight of Meli though would be the JUICES!! The fresh squeezed fruits are the perfect healthy addition to an already amazing meal. My only complaint- the wait (but the food makes it worth it) and they give you complimentary coffee while you wait. Be sure to plan for an hour wait at the least especially on a busy Sunday brunch morning... This is the best Brunch place I've found in Chicago so far.
