I went on a Tuesday, 6:30 PM. Luckily (or unluckily) I was by myself, as I found a seat at the bar after only one lap and watched several couples stand behind me for the hour I was there.  I started with a flight of their 5 beers. Good stuff. I ended up ordering a full pint of the Wit. It's a wheat beer and I normally hate wheat beers.  At Yelp's recommendation, I next tried the bacon fat popcorn. It may be the best bar snack ever. I just wish I could have tossed it a bit as the cheese was in a heap on top and not spread throughout. Also, they were indeed busy, but it's hard to eat a treat like this with no napkin. It took me a while to get my server's attention for one. I then moved onto the burger. I wanted to try the Workingman's burger, as it's right up my alley (cheese, bacon, onions), but the guy next to me had ordered one and when I asked him how he liked it, he said it was overcooked. He then recommended the Smokehouse (with pepper jack and pulled pork) so that's what I ordered. I was immediately concerned that the pulled pork (Carolina style) would ruin the burger and I'd end up scraping it off, but it really works. Maybe it's the pepper jack, and it was cooked perfectly medium rare. What sets this burger apart is the bun. They stated in the menu that the buns were baked fresh on site; I didn't think it would add that much, but boy does it. The bun was a fresh soft brioche-style with poppy seeds. I expected the decor to be more industrial, but it's still a cool place. If you're debating, Two Brothers Tap House in Warrenville still beats this place. The food at revolution is Way better, and the decor at two brothers is just poster-sized beer labels in a converted warehouse. But, what you go to a brewery for is the beer. And while Revolution's is good, Two Brothers has them beat.
