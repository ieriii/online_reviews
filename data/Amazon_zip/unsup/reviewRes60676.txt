This place is like The Cheesecake Factory on Steroids! And the Cheesecake factory is like Friday's on Steroids. So if their was a street fight to the death between Gran Lux and Fridays, it would not be pretty. I had one of the pizzas and it was excellent. The crust was so unique. It was the thinnest crust I had ever had, which made it very taste. Anyway, it is a little over the top, but I really like this place a lot. Go here, and come hungry!
