The visually disjointed interior doesn't match the incredible food. I was told a friend of the chef who is a chiropractor wanted to be a designer and had done the space. The young staff were knowledgeable, pleasant, and attentive. I ordered three courses and all were amazing. I'll be back for the incredible food. A shame the overall aesthetic fails to meet the high bar set by the talented chef.
