I decided to dedicate my 200th review to this lil bad-a$$-gem. My love affair with Fogo 2 Go started off with me wandering off on Diversey after a hair-cut that makes me look oh-so-chick - and starving. Not in the mood for a muss & fuss, we entered Fogo. Thinking we're just gonna have a couple slices of pizzas and a quater of chicken to eat in the tiny place. (Well, what do you expect, they did say this is 2 Go.)  Service was friendly and efficient. Then came the food. And I was in for the tastiest, juiciest, well-seasonest chicken I've ever had! The pizza was awesome, too. Perfect thin crust that is not too thin that makes it crunchy. Perfect amount of toppings (it was their buffalo chicken). Uummph! I want a slice (or two?) and a chicken leg from them. Now!
