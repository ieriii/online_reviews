We chose Alliance for our wedding cake because we wanted a small bakery in our neighborhood. Alliance really delivered! Our cake was beautiful and incredibly delicious. Our guests raved about both flavors--chocolate cake with vanilla pastry creme and white cake with raspberry filling. Our tasting was a wonderful experience, professional and delicious. Lindsey was very helpful in working with us to choose design options that suited our tastes and budget. I'm not an easy person to work with when it comes to design, but Lindsey accommodated my desires with the utmost professionalism. My bachelorette party cake was also from Alliance and was, in a word, amazing. If you need a cake for anything get your buns to Alliance.
