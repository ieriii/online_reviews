What makes this place great is everything on the tasting menu can be order Ala carte. Had the experience but If I had to pick one thing from Cold/Hot/Sea/Land/Sweet it will be these Cold: Deconstructed Caesar - brioche twinkie. Yes I said twinkie Hot: Butternut Bisque Sea: Sea Scallop Land: venison chop. Sweet: pistachio pudding Service and food was excellent.
