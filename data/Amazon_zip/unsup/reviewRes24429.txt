This place was very intimate, dark, cozy and a great date place. I only gave it 3 stars beacsue everything about the place was almost great. The wine selections was great but not the drink selections. The seating was dark & cozy but the actual seats were hard. There was a hair on the table and only 1 bathroom. The food was good but to be honest, I prefer The Melting Pot. The dipping sauces were nice but there were no flavors for the meat to cook in, and even the presenation of the veggies/fruit and meat was not as nice as the Melting Pot.
