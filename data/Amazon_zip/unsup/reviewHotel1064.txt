Great view from our room. My in-laws had the spacious couple king size bed room which has a center view of the Buckingham Fountain. We were next to them and I only see a partial view of the Fountain but still a great view. Since there's so much to see in Chicago, we didn't even once turn on the television for our kids. I would ding this hotel for not restocking shower gel - we've stayed here for 4 nights and only do I get extra shower gel on the 3rd day when we ran out and bumped into our housekeeper that morning.  For a Fairmont, I was surprised they didn't replenish. I understand being "green" and good for the environment but we paid to stay and should have essentials restocked. Hotel is definitely in a nice location and close to the Navy Pier, Millenium Park, riverboat cruises, and Wildberry Pancake House (a great place to get breakfast). Overall the hotel looks and feels nice. Noise level minimal since we were on the 18th floor. Our car was brought up promptly so service was great there. With kids, a pool is necessary and this hotel does not offer it but we were able to get access through long corridors to the Swiss Hotel's indoor "in the sky" pool. Just speak to the Fairmont concierge. From this pool location, you could get a closer view of the Navy Pier.
