THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION!! - I just had the worst experience on the phone with Brazzaz. I bought a Groupon that I wanted to use during the summer but I could not use it because they were closed for two months. I called them a few weeks ago and they told me that they would honor the Groupon at any time. I called them today to make a reservation and they would not honor it!!! Apparently after they re-opened they set a new expiration date but they never notified the people who bought the Groupon. I spoke to two people today. Natalia, an employee, and Robert, the manager. They were both very disrespectful. The conversation with Robert was more like a monologue because he would interrupt me every time I spoke and he would not let me finish a sentence. I explained to Robert that I was previously told by an employee there that I could use the Groupon, but his only response was that I was not telling the truth and that he was not going to honor it. He kept repeating that they had set a new expiration date and that I should have known that. I told him that I was never notified of the new date and that I wanted to submit a complaint. At that point he interrupted me again, said that if I wanted to submit a complaint that it was up to me but that he would still not honor the Groupon, and he hung up on me!!! I am appalled by the rudeness, disrespect and terrible customer service of these individuals. Particularly from Robert. He is the face and voice of the restaurant, but he did everything a manager is NOT supposed to do. He interrupted me, he questioned everything I said, he said that I was not telling the truth, he placed all the blame on me, he did not offer anything to rectify the situation, he did not offer an apology, and he hung up on me. The way that Robert, the manager, approached my situation was not only unprofessional but also unfair. I have been a loyal customer of Brazzaz, but this experience has made me question their commitment to customer satisfaction.
