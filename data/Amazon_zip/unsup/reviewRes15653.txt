I could do without the long wait, but thoroughly enjoyed my experience once inside the door, except for the music choice. The Violet Hour has great service, atmosphere and hushed conversation tones. The night I visited they played quite a lot of Fugazi which isn't really conducive to intimate conversation. Ease up on the hardcore/loud music please!
