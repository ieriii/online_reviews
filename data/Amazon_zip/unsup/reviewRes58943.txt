The food is amazing. I've been to Sunda several times now, always trying something new. Definitely recommend the Rock Shrimp appetizer and any of their sushi. The last time we were there, we sat at the sushi bar. It was great to watch the artistry that goes into the rolls and the sushi chef even sent over a couple pieces for us to try! The Chilean Sea Bass is a 'can't miss' as well. Great service, too!
