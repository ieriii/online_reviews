I had my first experience in a Brazilian Steak House last night and this place was amazing. Quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. The environment is really amazing. We had our chance to order wines and go to the salad bar which is amazing. There are so many items available it's hard not to get full before the meat comes. I had a half bottle of an excellent Savignon Blanc from Napa Valley.  The service was immaculate. The server or other employees were always there to assist and switch out plates. The other cool thing about the environment was the wine retrievers. People who work there are sustained on cables to climb the wine wall. It's really cool to watch.  When it came to the meat, I have never had anything more amazing in my life. They offer excellent steaks, porks, chicken, and sausage. The house special is the best meat I have tasted in my life. It is totally worth paying $50 a plate to eat there.  I would recommend it.
