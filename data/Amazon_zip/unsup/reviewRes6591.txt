Yo side dishes, imma let you finish but this is some of the tastiest meat of all time. I came last night and enjoyed myself immensely. The pickles and chips were delicious. I tried the shrimp and grits (good) and fried green tomato (okay) appetizers, but got the pulled pork sandwich as my entree. I wish I'd just ordered a plate of the meat. It was smoky, juicy, tender and delicious. All four of the sauces were good -- the mustard was my favorite. To drink, I went for the small batch bourbon flight. This is a really cute restaurant, and I hope to return soon for seconds. Next time, I'm going straight for the ribs.
