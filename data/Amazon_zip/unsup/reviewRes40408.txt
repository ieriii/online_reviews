i havent been here in quite some time but man after this review, i just might head over there this weekend. my fave here are the tacos de carne asada and lengua. MMMMMmmmmmmm.... throw some salt, lime, and salsa in there and im good to go. open pretty late so that a plus if youre on your way home from a night out. i cant really say much that hasnt been already said about this place. its just friggin' great! go there and give it a shot. there are 3 different locations all on the same block, sort of. i like to frequent the one closest to the southwest corner of division. its not as small as the one across the street next to the car lot. and the 3rd one is the biggest one where they serve more than tacos. that one is more like a serious dine-in joint. they have dinner plates and all that. id rather just get my tacos, scarf em, and keep on truckin'.
