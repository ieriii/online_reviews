Mastro's is decadence at its best. From the service to the wine to the food to the decor to the live singer, everything is over-the-top in a great way. Some definite can't misses are the shrimp cocktail (these shrimp had eaten every other shrimp in the water), the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle gnocchi (rich but so tasty and well-balanced), and of course, the butter cake. I was skeptical at first as a chocolate fanatic; however, the butter cake was amazing - tasting reminiscently similar to childhood vanilla cupcakes with a lot more pizzazz. That being said, it is definitely not a place I could go every day as I still feel like I am made up of 40 pounds of butter. Three cheers Mastro's.
