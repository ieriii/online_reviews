Sunda's atmosphere was really amazing. The decor was very modern, very impressive. The food was tasty. My husband and I tried as many dishes as we could. We loved almost all of them (Some of the dishes were good, not fantastic. But, you will not receive any bad dishes here.). His favorite was the Devil's Pot. Mine was the dessert with the Thai iced tea flavored anglaise. I wanted to lick the plate. We also loved the sashimi dishes! There were so many other dishes we wanted to try, so we can't wait to go back.
