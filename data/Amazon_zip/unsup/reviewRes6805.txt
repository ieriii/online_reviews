I love good BBQ, and this place is actually gourmet bbq, the way it should be. Fresh, top notch meats, and an menu to satisfy anyone that knows anything about BBQ, and enjoys St Louis, KC, and Low Country cuisine. The bar is great, and sides are mouth watering good. Certainly the best Chicago has to offer, promise you that.
