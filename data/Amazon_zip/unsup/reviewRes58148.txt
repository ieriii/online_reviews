Great place..good atmosphere...really good food. It's not cheap but worth it.Try the chef's tasting menu. Really good, lot's of courses, it's about $50/person but you get so much high quality cuisine. If you order individual tapas it will cost more for less.Lunch is great there also and cheaper.One of my favorite Chicago restaurants
