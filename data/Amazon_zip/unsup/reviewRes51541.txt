Has to be done! My review must be bumped up a star. I have been going to Garcia's every now and then during the two and a half years I have been in the neighborhood and recently it finally hit me that I really like this place. It really is not your typical middle of the road Mexican place. The restaurant itself is very nice, yet comfortable and casual. They did a phenomenal job when they expanded and renovated a couple of years ago. For the atmosphere and location, you simply cannot beat the prices at Garcia's. They have the same pricing as your typical hole in the wall taqueria, while providing a much superior experience. Their Margaritas are strong, huge and very well prepared. Not something you can typically get at a taqueria. The service is always super friendly. Yes, perhaps it has a lot to do with the fact that I usually go there with my 18-month old son and all the waitresses just can't get enough of him, which leads me to the main reason I am bumping it up a star. My son absolutely loves this place! It is colorful, full of activity (but spacious and comfortable), he loves the food and gets tons of attention. The food can still be a bit hit or miss, but there are plenty of tasty things in the menu. Love the tortas and the al pastor or chorizo tacos. Their chicken with mole is also very nice. Great chips and salsa too (though the salsa is a little heavy on the onion). What can I say? I am now officially a Garcia's fan.
