Revolution Brewery is far away enough from downtown/Wicker Park/Lincoln Park to keep wanna-be foodies, hipsters, and ex-frat boys from ruining the spot. The beer menu is constantly rotating and is comparable to the other micro-breweries in Chicago. They offer tours on the weekend, which while I have not gone, seem interesting. Beyond the beer, the food at Revolution Brewing Co. is really good. I took a bunch of my friends here and we sampled a bunch of the burgers, fish/chips, appetizers, etc. and loved it. The pretzel appetizers (while simple and straight-forward) are nonetheless delicious with both the mustard and cheese sauce they prepare. Sometimes there can be a wait here but there is a huge central bar where you can drink away the time. Even when it is super packed, the wait is usually less than 45 minutes.
