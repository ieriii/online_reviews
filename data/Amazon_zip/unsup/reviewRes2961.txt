This is one of the most amazing places i've been. Words cannot describe my experience here. I had the choice to go here for my 8th grade graduation present or throw a party. I'm so glad I made the right choice. They only take reservations and i believe at the time our meal was around $300 a piece. completely worth it for a extravagant experience. It was a 6-8 course meal with the most beautiful presented dishes and china i've ever seen. They give you amazing deserts to take home beautifully wrapped along with specializing your evening if it is for a special event. I remember having the most amazing waiters/servers/valet men ever. I hope i'll be able to afford to come back since it is not a everyday event. At age 14 I could enjoy and admire this I'm sure at 20 will be even better. This pace is a A + with gold stars. Superb!
