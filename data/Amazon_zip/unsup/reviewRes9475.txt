I went to Le Colonial for a dinner date and I was reasonably pleased with the restaurant selection. This place has a very quaint touch to it, high ceilings with ceiling fans, huge fake windows and a tree right in the middle of the dining hall. The lights are very dim and does make this a romantic setting, however, the proximity of tables to each other is very close and often intrudes into your privacy. You do get used to it after a while though, just make sure not to talk very loud. I would give the service a 4/5 over all. Although its a French-Vietnamese restaurant, the menu is 90% Vietnamese, though not all of it seemed authentic. I went on a Sunday and they had a Sunday Sampler Menu with 5 of their popular entrees available in a sampler size (1/2 plate) for only $10 (compared to the usual $20-30). For the two of us, we ordered one appetizer (the Vietnamese Ravioli - I def. recommend it) and ordered two samplers (Basil Chicken in Lemongrass - again, really good and the diced Filet Mignon with Yams which was decent as well). The food was more than enough for the two of us, we didn't even end up finishing it. They have a fairly good wine list, the cheapest glass was about $8-10 and cheapest bottle was $60ish I think. My friend had a martini ($12) which she enjoyed.
