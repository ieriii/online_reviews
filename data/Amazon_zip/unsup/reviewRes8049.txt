I do think this place is spectacular. Even the salad bar, for the vegetarians, is great. However, they've got to lower the prices. I think it's $65/person now?  Drop it to $35 and I'll be there a lot more often.. P.S. Try the Mojitos, if you've got a chance.  Most people overlook them, and they're one of the best I've had, anywhere.
