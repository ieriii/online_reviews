Piece is fantastic! I'm with Check Please... I had the red pizza with spinach, roasted red peppers, and garlic - and the spinach was totally fresh! And yummy! And scrumptious! (Reviewer Anne W. and her finace must have gotten a little side tracked with all that canoodling and let their pizza sit out for too long...) Piece's staff is super hip and attentive. I always feel welcomed, and leave full and happy.
