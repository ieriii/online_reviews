One of my favorite restaurants when I am in Chicago. Oh how I miss it so. I haven't been to Chicago in a few years now but I can still recall the good meals and times at Wild Fire. Never had a bad meal nor bad time at Wildfire. Favorites: Bone-in Peppercorn or whatever you like crusted filet, medium rare with redskin mashed potatoes. Gotta have the bone-in for extra flavor and tenderness! Yum! The filet-mignon trio is also fantastic. Other notables: - Horseradish-Crusted Cherrystone Clams - Roasted Sea Scallop Skewers - Wildfire Wood Oven Roasted Mussels (Must have when in season) - Spinach and Artichoke Fondue A bit pricey but you ultimately do get what you paid for. Reservations are recommended. Parking is next door (from what I remember).
