My boyfriend and I went here with one of their dinner for two coupons which was a pretty good deal. The service was excellent and the food was definitely very good. I had the lobster ravioli which was phenomenal and my boyfriend had the lasagna which was in my opinion mediocre. The bruschetta was also pretty average, but the lobster ravioli will definitely keep me coming back for more! There are a few other menu items that sound great so I'll have to try a few more next time.
