Yum, quick, close to my office, and reasonable priced. I don't know how Indian buffets do it, but the food is always hot, fresh, and delicious on almost any buffet I've been to. Other restaurants with buffets or even salad bars end up with empty bins, cold meat, sticky gloppy rice and noodles, and food that you just know has been out for hours. The food at India House was fantastic, and they had a huge variety. Perhaps the reason Indian restaurants often have buffets for lunch is because everyone is like me, but when I eat Indian I almost always prefer a little bit of 5 or 6 dishes, rather than one single meal. Everything is so good, I can't just pick one thing. Plus some things are way too spicy for me to eat an entire plate full of. Two thumbs up! Or four stars....
