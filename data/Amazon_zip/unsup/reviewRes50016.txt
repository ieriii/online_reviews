I've never had Colombian food before so I don't really have anything else to compare it to, but I'm probably hooked to come back to this place if I ever want a ridiculous meat-fest again. We got the Picada Colombiana, which is a little bit of everything (steak, beef ribs, chicken, pork sausage, plantains, yucca). Absolutely no need for an appetizer if you are getting this, I believe my belly was pretty destroyed and we had lots of leftovers. It seems other Yelpers are in agreement as well. I loved the chimichurri and the churasca sauces, but again was my first time having it. We later went home and made it ourselves, LOL. Good stuff. Our waiter was Carlos, and he will tell you everything is the "best of the best", which was hilarious. Very attentive dude, and I recommend him if you ever get a chance to go.
