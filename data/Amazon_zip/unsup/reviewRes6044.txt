I went to Wildfire with some friends after a long week of work. We were looking for some strong drinks and a satisfying dinner and we were not disappointed. Here's what I liked about my experience at Wildfire: 1) Strong, delicious drinks. I had a few of the pomegranate martinis. I don't know if it was the painful day I'd had at work, or if the martinis were that good, but it was all I could do to behave like an adult and refrain from polishing off an entire drink in one swallow; 2) Attentive staff. My water glass was never even half empty before it was refilled by our waiter;  3) Relaxed atmosphere. It was very welcoming and comfortable. 4) The mashed potatoes - they were mashed with skins and not too buttery; and last, but certainly not least 5) The filet. I ordered the filet trio (to be prepared "rare") and chose for my three crusted toppings mushroom, Bearnaise, and horseradish. I'm telling you, rare is the way to go. I have no idea why anyone would bother to have meat prepared any other way. It was so good that I actually wanted to close my eyes for a second in an attempt to shut out other sensory input and fully enjoy / savor each bite.   The friends I was with ordered dessert to share - the chocolate lava cake and the chocolate chip cookie skillet (which is served with ice cream). I had a few bites of each, and they were good, but I'm not a dessert person, and so I really couldn't say how their desserts compare to desserts at other restaurants.  I will certainly go back to Wildfire, though when I do, I will be faced with a tough decision - should I try any of the other delicious-sounding items on the menu, or stick with the mouth-watering filet trio?!
