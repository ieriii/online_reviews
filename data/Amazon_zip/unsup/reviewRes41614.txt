I've heard about this place several times so after years i finally made it. Fortunately I got there a little after my friends so there was no waiting and my pho was already ordered and had just made its appearance on the table. The pho was pretty standard- rare beef, tripe, soft tendon and meatballs. The flavor was good and it was enough to fill me up. I think they could have been a little more generous with the meat. On the bright side I don't think they use quite as much MSG here as I don't feel super thirsty yet. An extra large pho runs about $8 and they calculated 18% tip for our table, but we had 6 people. The servers came to ask how everything was but no luck with water refills. On a side note, don't wear your favorite jacket (or anything you need to dry clean) there as it will inevitably smell like Vietnamese food by the time you leave... maybe that's why my dog was so happy to see me when I got home.
