Sun Wah completely reminds me of Sam Woo in Southern California. This place is excellent for Cantonese style food. Their peking duck is to die for. All the prices for their food are extremely reasonable. It is conveniently located around the corner from the Argyle Red Line stop. Also, if you wanted to drive here, you will have to pay for parking on the street. There is also a to-go section at this restaurant. Also, I noticed that there is a $14 minimum charge for credit cards so bring cash if you are coming here alone because you will probably spend less than the minimum amount.
