There are plenty of great pizza places in the city and until recently I thought Gino's was one of them. Dont bother going here, the staff, especially the management, was so rude and condescending that it left my mother in tears. In a town that is known for its pizza, choose a place that not only makes great pizza, but also makes you feel welcomed as their guest. STAY AWAY!!!
