This is what Chicago pizza is all about. On more than one occasion, I have found myself compelled to order takeout from this place, and I live an hour away from their nearest location. Yes, I have in fact, crossed the state line to get this pizza. Definitely not something I would want to eat every day - or even every month. No, I prefer my arteries unclogged, but man, whenever I'm in the mood for Chicago-style pizza, there really is no other choice. The biggest drawback is the wait. There have been several times where I have been in the area and thought "Hey! Let's get Giordano's to bring home" but unless you've got an hour to just sit around, that's really not an option because it takes that long to bake. So, after years of trial and error, usually what we do is get in the car, begin the drive to IL and call on the way. The pizza is done by the time we get there and we just warm it up a little when we get back home. The whole process takes some planning, but it's well worth it! This is a 2-3 times per year ordeal but we just don't have ANYTHING that comes close to this level of pizza-y goodness where I live.
