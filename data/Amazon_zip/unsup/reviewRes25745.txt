Simply It in Lincoln Park is just simply wonderful.  The place serves vietnamese cuisine and a wide range of items, at that! Went there with my boyfriend last night. Even though the place is quite loud (since its a BYOB a lot of people tend to have bday parties there) and my chair got bumped a number of times I still didn't mind because the food is really good. Get the Saigon Crepe with chicken and shrimp! I love this delicious thai starter. We also tried the sticky rice for the first time last night and we're not dissapointed. For our main course, we shared a small seafood hotpot. It's definitely enough for like 2-4 people. All in all, its a great dinner at a really good value. And the owner is SUPER NICE! You can really tell he cares about his customers, which goes a long way.
