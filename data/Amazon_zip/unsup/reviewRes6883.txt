I'm a vegetarian so I am starting out w/that so you know I did not try the meat at Chicago q (what they're obviously famous for). However, the other people in my party did and were very satisfied with the meat sandwiches they ordered. I however, ordered the fried green tomatoes which was an "off menu item" and it was just okay. Nothing amazing. The restaurant has a good vibe and great outdoor/front seating. Pickles and chips they give you at the table were great-best part about the meal for me.
