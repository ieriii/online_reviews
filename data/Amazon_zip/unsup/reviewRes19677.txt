Definitely a fan of the gage. Came here for lunch while visiting the Chi and this place definitely did not disappoint. I am intrigued by any place that (claims to) serve poutine (look it up- it's not what you think). While their interpretation of poutine was tasty- it wasn't the classic Canadian style poutine I was so desperately hoping for. The Gage actually served theirs with chunks of pot roast in it? Miss. I also had the Gage burger, which was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Healthy portion sizes and an overall great dining experience (although our server was a little...um....odd). I would definitely get back.
