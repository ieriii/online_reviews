Hard not to like this place. For being a New Haven style pizza place in Chicago it does outstandingly well and it's for 2 reasons: 1) consistent solid quality pizza 2) good beer. Nice large beer hall style restaurant can accommodate many but I've had to wait for large groups on multiple occasions. Nonetheless, the pizza always makes it worthwhile and putting down a few beers in the interim is never a chore. Also, it's surprisingly affordable and if you're going with a group its easily less than $15 each even when getting some pitchers for the table. In terms of dining as a social event this place easily beats out the other 'chicago style' joints that parade as more 'formal' establishments. Oh and you have to try the mashed potatoes as a topping - absolutely worth it.
