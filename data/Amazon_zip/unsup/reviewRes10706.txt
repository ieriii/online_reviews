Piece is one of the countless Bucktown/Wicker Park eateries with cutesy one-word names. But unlike a few of the other establishments in this hipster-cum-yuppie haven, their food's goooood. Their beer's goooood. And their karaoke night? Shit, who knew karaoke could be good? A pitcher of Top Heavy Hefeweizen and a pepperoni, red pepper and ricotta pizza was enough to make us burst, while the crowd of karaoke stars was enough to make us burst out laughing. For an 11 pm dinner on a Thursday, after a full day of airline travel and almost no sleep, I can't think of a better evening. Crispy, greasy oh-so-good crust, ice-cold beer and a perfect rendition of Don't Stop Believing? What's not to love?
