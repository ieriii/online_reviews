Mercat was a very enjoyable albeit somewhat predictable tapas experience. They offered a variety of dishes ranging from some very creative and delicious items to a few rather unimaginative bland dishes. The food overall is some of the best tapas around and a few items are absolutely amazing. The service seemed fair. The staff seemed less than enthusiastic.
