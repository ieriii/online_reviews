The Purple Pig is still excellent. We got 5 of us in on a Sunday with no wait. (Lucky!) Shared a TON of things--pig platter, beef marrow (not my thing, but the rest really liked it), lardo (good), cauliflower (GREAT), pork shoulder (still wonderful), pig tail (excellent), pig ears (Really good), peas and bacon (very good).  Got the pig theme here? Since we didn't drink much, we got out of there for about $25 per person. Service was so-so. We were seated and helped and watered just fine initially, but the waiter kind of disappeared after that. I had to ask for clean plates (never have to ask for clean plates at the Publican).
