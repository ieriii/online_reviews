I had been wanting to try this place for years and it was better than I imagined! The salad bar was to die for. There were so many different types of pastas, sushi, salad, meats and cheeses to make sandwiches, veggies, and basically anything you could dream of! Absolutely delicious. I would come back for the salad bar alone! The meat was so delicious, all different kinds, flavors. The staff was very fun and energetic when presenting the different sorts of meats to choose from. It really added to the experience.  There was a dish they brought out that was made of bannana that was extremely delicious. I'd reccomend ordering that. The resturaunt was very beautiful and fun to look at. A great atmosphere to dine in. Overall, an extremely enjoyable expereince and very delicious.
