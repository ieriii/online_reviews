Ah No, No and No. The atmosphere is very nice is the only really good thing I have to say about this place. Our server sliced my friends finger when serving up a slice of scrumptious lamb. Needless to say the meal was all downhill from this point. We had to request a band-aid more than once before she was given one. The Manager on duty that night was clueless and I had to ask him to comp her meal. One would assume that after experiencing the knife first hand by a staff member while dining would automatically make the meal free along with a round of drinks to ease your pain. Hello there,we are living in a recession, hello. People can dine in and slice their own flesh for free not for $60.00 a plate + tip & valet. Are you kidding me? "Her finger was in the way?" WTH? It's about customer service Chi-town! I can't believe how bad the service in my hometown it was non-existent; service in the cloud???
