The food is amazing but the people who work here are downright nasty (especially the older woman who is always there). She is so rude that I tell people not to go here- for example, when I called in to place and order and tell them the website was down she gave me so much attitude and told me I was lying!?!. The next time I went in to pick up my food and asked a question about one of their ingrediants and she was nasty about answering me. Most of my friends have had similar experiences!
