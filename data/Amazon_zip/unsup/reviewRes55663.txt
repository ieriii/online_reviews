I LOVE GLENN'S!It's as simple as that. I still haven't been there for dinner (which I keep saying I will do, one of these days). But it's great for a weekend brunch. I've tried several of their breakfast dishes and haven't had one bad meal yet. I'm not the kind of person that likes to wait to be seated but I would wait for an hour to eat here. But, you get seated right away with a reservation so it doesn't have to come to that. Sometimes I dream of their giant Bloody Mary that comes with a shrimp skewer and honeydew. Yes I said honeydew. Sounds kinda weird, but totally works. Also, they have a nice outdoor seating area on the sidewalk when the weather cooperates.Did I mention I love Glenn's. Can I give it 6 stars?(Oh lord, I have salivated all over my keyboard.)
