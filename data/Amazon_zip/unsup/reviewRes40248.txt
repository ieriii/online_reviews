Not even the appearance of a taco-crawler named "The Wizard" could have saved the sad taco I had here. I have been to the other La Pasadita down the street, but this location is more "sit down" than take out. I just had the one lone carne asada taco and an agua fresco--Tamarind. The meat was flavorless and chewy. The salsas on the table couldn't save it either. Although, the agua fresco was delicious and the complimentary chips were super crispy and addictive. The bathroom was gross (and it was the middle of the afternoon, so you can't blame the late night crowd). The only saving grace was the service--the gal was super friendly and sweet. This was stop #4 on a Taco Crawl and I thought maybe by now I'd be taco'ed out and be sick of tacos. Well, stop #5 was truly delicious so I'm sorry La Pasadita, I won't be back.
