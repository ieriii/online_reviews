I wander into Wicker Park to game every couple weeks. I miss the city. I love the city. I wish I could make it in more often. Coupled with my love of middle eastern food Sultan's Market is a shining oasis in the vast empty desert of no good middle eastern food out by me. It beacons to me across the distance and with its siren call lures me through its doors every two weeks. Its deliciousness has me hooked, its savory wonderful goods addicting. Personally I get a chicken shawarma sandwich and two spinach pies. It sets me back less than $10 and fills me up for the entire night. A little tahini on the sammich makes it a great bite. Then the spinach pies are an incredibly tasty combination of spinach, garlic and onions in the most chewy, tender bread ever. I really like this place, does it show? Parking is decent despite it being in Wicker Park and despite me going in the dead of rush hour. The prices are awesome and I've never had to wait. Sultan's Market is so goddamn good I want to cry and you need to go there immediately and eat. Goodbye.
