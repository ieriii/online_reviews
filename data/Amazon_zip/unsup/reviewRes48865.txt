It was good, and I was distracted, and if I went alone at an off time and focused on the food, I might give it a fourth star. But there were a few things that made it difficult for me to do so: 1. The noise. I was here with a group from work, including some of my staff from other offices. I can do loud, but it was just a bit disconcerting. 2. The service. Very leisurely, bordering on forgetful. 3. We thought the server was joking when he said that we should order three things per person. We ordered two per person. Three is more like it. But for the price of three items and some beverages, I want a quieter experience and better service.  Go to #1. I do promise that I'll try to go again. I think a late Saturday afternoon would be a great time to try it.
