Can you say too much salt? The chefs need to learn how to season things properly. 3 of the 8 courses were way over salted. The fish entree also was not properly cooked. That is one of my pet peeves at nice restaurants. Fish that is cooked on the outside and raw in the middle. Where is Gordon Ramsay when you need him?!?Also, they offered no beverages other than flat water. I know it was BYOB, but they could have offered something, anything else. On a positive note, the servers were great and friendly. The presentation was very nice, and I liked the decor. But I expect a lot better food preparation for my money.
