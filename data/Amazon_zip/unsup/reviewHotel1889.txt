This review is only for the lounge/bar. We randomly decided to come here on a Saturday night. We were hoping to find a nice quiet place where a group of 8 girls could catch up. This was the perfect place for that. The decor was gorgeous and the service was great. It was pretty much empty so we had no problem finding a place for all of us to sit. The drinks were overpriced, but that's expected for the W. I'll definitely keep this place in mind for a cozy night out.
