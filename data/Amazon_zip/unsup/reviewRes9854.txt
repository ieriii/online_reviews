My favorite northern Italian restaurant in Chicago, by far. The dishes aren't super fancy, just high quality, fresh, seasonal food. Again, like others have said, if you can sit outside. It's an very relaxing and green patio. I once had the likes of Rick Bayless dining next to my table. You know the place is good if other top chef's dine there. What I do for a dinner for 2: I typically like to start my meal with a Caprese Salad. It's not on the dinner menu (only the lunch) but don't be afraid to ask and they will serve it to you. Then I'll go with two fresh pasta dishes that strike my fancy (appetizer portion). Followed by splitting the mediterranean sea bass, it's not on the menu but it's their signature dish. They will show your actual fish seasoned in coarse sea salt table side, then it's served to you with capers and citrus. It's sooo good. I like to finish with gelato or sorbet. But they have other fine deserts as well.
