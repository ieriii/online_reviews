I'd been to other Ruth's Chris locations with my dad who's a big fan, but Monday was my first trip to this one. In the midst of a ton of snow and after a long day of thrifting, my pal and I were ready for some steaks. We, being young cheapskates, took advantage of the Restaurant Week menu. Even though we were doing the prix fixe, our server was extremely attentive. We both started with the steakhouse salad which was comprised of a variety of greens. Since I don't like salad dressing, I asked for lemon, and i received several lemons in the little nets to keep out seeds. Very nice touch. We both ordered the petite filet which was delicious and came sizzling with butter running down the sides like a waterfall. I ate every steaky bite. I was impressed that they had several entrees available for the prix fixe. We also both ordered the chocolate mousse cheesecake which I ate every bit of as well. I am only going to give four stars until I come back for a non Restaurant Week experience, which I'm pretty sure will happen the next time I have a special occasion.
