A friend of mine works here, so I had to come and try it out. There is a spacious waiting area, and I can see it would be equipped to handle a large number of people still looking to get seated. There is an elevator and escalator available to get to the dining area of the restaurant. I was surprised by how large the space was. We were seated at a booth next to windows that overlook Michigan Avenue. We started out with a few appetizers I really liked. We got the Crispy Thai Shrimp & Chicken Rolls, the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and the Asian Nachos as appetizers. Then we got the Lemon Chicken Picata and a pasta dish. We initially had the Sunday Night Pasta and substituted it, but ended up sending that back and getting the other one. I think that they were both okay, but I think I'll order pasta from an Italian restaurant from now on. We ended our meal with the New Orleans Beignets which were like super soft donuts. We also had the white sangria since it wasn't really red, which was strong but okay for me. It felt kind of pricey for dinner, but I might just come back for appetizers next time.
