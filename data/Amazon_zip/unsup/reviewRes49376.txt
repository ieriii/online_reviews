This place is cool. The wine and cheese flights are around $15 each. I ate dinner here once and had the swordfish.  It was good, but pretty pricy (and on my company's tab) - so that makes this a special occasion place but I will come back for wine and cheese!  The biggest positive is all the wine and cheese they serve, they also sell. I was really happy to find that most of the wines in my Riesling flight was around $10 a bottle. Mmm..fancy cheese. I really love cheese!
