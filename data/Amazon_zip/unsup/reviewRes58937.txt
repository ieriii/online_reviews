Amazing! Favorite New Spot! From the creatively sweet and delicious drinks to the innovative crispy seared rice nigiri, loved every minute! The service impecable, the management flawless, the decor breath taking. I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday! It was so good that I took out of town friends the next week for cocktails and appetizers in the lounge and had a marvelous night!
