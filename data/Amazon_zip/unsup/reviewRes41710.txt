This place is a tad bit over-rated in my opinion. Always way too-crowded. The service was eh, okay. Can't deny that the pho has a good homely taste to it, and you can't forget about the spring rolls. I'll go here every once in a while when I have a sudden urge for pho, but other than that... I don't know what else to say. Oh! I went here with my family one time and my mom ordered a rice dish and the meat was completely uncooked, which was extremely disturbing and gross; however, they made up for it. I'd say go here for pho only and for selective rice dishes, and this is coming from a Vietnamese person.
