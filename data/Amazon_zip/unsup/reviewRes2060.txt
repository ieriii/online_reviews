I wasn't terribly impressed with Hot Doug's, despite all the hype that I'd heard. I went on a Friday and got the famous "duck fat fries," and could not tell the difference between between regular fries and those, except for the fact they cost twice as much. My sausage was good, I think I got some kind of chicken, but it wasn't mind-blowing. Of course, I'm vegan now, and won't really need to visit again, unless I decide to try their veggie dog ... Doug is friendly, and waiting in line for a place is always kind of fun if the weather's nice -- builds anticipation. Too bad it was such a let down by the time we got to our table.
