This is a cute place in a nice location, and I always do love a BYOB. However, there was something lacking when I tried this place out. On a slow weeknight, our server kept disappearing into the kitchen, and wouldn't come and check on us except for the obligatory moments: to take our food order, to check that we received our food, to ask if we wanted dessert, and to bring the bill. We saw our busser quite often, and was very attentive - although didn't seem to speak much English. The person I was with had a delicious lobster ravioli in marscapone cream sauce, which was quite good, but I was disappointed by my braciole. Overall, it's a nice little weekday spot, but I can't see myself making a trip here without being in the neighborhood.
