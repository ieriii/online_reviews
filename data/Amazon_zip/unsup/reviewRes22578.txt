It is now time for my 5-star, 2010 review of Irazu. Still 5 stars. YES! And this time, for the delivery! And, let me tell you...the food (and famous oatmeal shakes!) taste just as good after traveling a few miles. The delivery was super quick, the phone answerer was very efficient and clear, and my food arrived with a friendly smile in about 20 minutes. 1 veggie burrito 1 steak burrito 1 oatmeal shake with milk DELIVERED ----------------------------------- $17 + tip Hooray for Irazu they still rock my oatmeal-lovin' socks off, and I will continue to write them a 5-star review each year that they continue to serve up some of the best (ONLY!) authentic Costa Rican food in Chicago. Get your oat on, they travel. No excuses now.
