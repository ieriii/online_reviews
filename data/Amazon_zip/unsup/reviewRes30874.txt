This place is cool! It's a great veggie place, first and foremost. Very indie-ish. The menu is good and quite creative, which is safe to say that a lot of things are a bit over the top in being explicitly meat-free. I did like the option of cowcheese (moo) vs vegan cheese for my food, as that's a nice option. So as noted by other reviews, the place is a little cramped, but it has a cool atmosphere. Also, the service is good, and you get served decently fast. We had the imitation hot wings, which were seitan with perfectly done buffalo wing sauce, so I was happy. All in all, this place is probably well worth making some more trips.
