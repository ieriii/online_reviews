I see that I'm not alone when I say that this place seems a bit SALT crazy. I can handle salty, but the Mushroom Torta reached an extremity in salty that left my tongue and the roof of my mouth in pain after three bites. Underneath all those layers of salt, it seemed as if the mushrooms might have had a decent flavor, so I wanted to give it a chance. But my appetite had vanished before I finished the first half. The side salad was really great, however. It had just the right proportions of arugula to romaine and a really light and subtle dressing that really catered to the flavors and textures of the lettuce, arugula, shaved cucumber and jicama. So that makes one good and one not-so-good. But sadly...I don't think I'm gonna wait 20-30 minutes in line for a side salad.
