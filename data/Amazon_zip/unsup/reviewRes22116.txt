It's the most iconic restaurant in Greek town, and in my opinion, it deserves its place at the top of the pile. For one, it's a huge place so it's great for going in big groups. Even when you go with a smaller group, though, the service is efficient and the food always comes out fresh. Greek Islands has a huge throughput advantage, and I think it capitalizes on that with consistent food that's reasonably priced and served quickly. Not everything is great, and some items can be lousy, but if you know what to order, you can do well every time. For me, the highlights are the grilled octopus and the fried zucchini with skordalia. The octopus is tender and nicely charred and doused in peppery olive oil and vinegar. It's one of the top renditions in the city, definitely taking advantage of the fact that they're serving way more octopus than probably anywhere in chicagoland. The zucchini is remarkably sweet and almost nutty. It's sliced thin, lightly breaded, and fried quickly so that it always comes out crisp and never greasy. The skordalia is a creamy potato garlic spread that really packs a garlic punch.  I also enjoy the gyros and the taramosalata. The gyros are standard issue Greek-American diner food, but the version at Greek Islands is consistently well-charred and served with lots of raw onions and a buttery pita. The taramosalata is made from fish eggs, and while it has a nice briney flavor, it doesn't quite remind you of the sea the way a great rendition would. But it's the best version I've found in Chicagoland. Also, I should mention that they have some nice stewed lamb preparations that are full flavored and fall-off-the-bone tender. Sure, not everything is as good as those dishes, but I don't go frequently enough to really crave new dishes to add to the repertoire. It has a bustling atmosphere, large portions at a good price, and consistent food that scratches the itch whenever it comes up.
