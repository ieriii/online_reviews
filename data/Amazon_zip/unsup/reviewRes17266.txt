I can be a bartender's nuisance. Why? Because I'm that person who never can make up their mind, asks questions, changes my mind at the last second on occasion, etc... I don't mean to be a bar-going a*hole, or an anything-going a*hole. I really don't. I'm just a scatterbrained lady sometimes... The bartender/"barman" last evening was completely empathetic and chill, cool as cucumber, actually. And, let's face it, he was fancy. So right there, the place has my vote on service. (I sat at the bar, there was no line, the door host was polite, not too crowded -- apparently it was a good night/time to go.) The drink list is pretty extensive, but the service staff makes it accessible. And let's talk about the bourbon, shall we? I actually ordered cocktails, which I don't always do, and they were delicious, but they also have a great bourbon selection. Surprised? I WAS. There is now one place I've ever been to that actually has Michter's Bourbon available for my consumption. Um, hello, amazing? The only place, ONLY place, I've ever seen it on the menu. Holla. Now, this is not a place to go if you're looking to save a buck. Clearly. The decor is pretty swanky, and I mean it's a clean kind of decadent. High-backed chairs and lots of fabric in the joint make for great acoustics in terms of having a conversation. Even with the music playing. Violet Hour is definitely a destination spot, but if you're feeling the love for a little glorious cocktail-age, high-end spirits, and swanky swank in Wicker Park, then check this joint out!  On a side note, don't expect any sort of hurried service. Cocktail concoctions on this list take careful crafting. And the craftsmanship shows, from the selection of ingredients to the type of ice they use in drinks...so sit back and enjoy the ambience. You're paying for it, too.
