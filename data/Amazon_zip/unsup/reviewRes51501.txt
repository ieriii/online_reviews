The awkwardness begins the moment you walk in the restaurant and waitresses whiz by you while you stand there, trying to figure out if you seat yourself or if you wait for someone to seat you. After another a few minutes and another busy waitress ignores you, you decided to sit down and once seated, you are again ignored for a few minutes, if you are lucky, or up to 15 if you are unlucky. Finally, so-so chips and salsa appear, along with water. If you are smart, you will either order a large lemondae which is a perfect combination of sweet and tart in a jumbo sized styrofoam cup or a creamy horachata, because it is highly unlikely that your water glass will be refilled again.  The food is reasonably priced, but as the quality is only adequate, its not really a bargain. The margaritas are also adequate. If you are in Lincoln Square and want a reasonably priced meal, then Garcia's is the place to go but it's not a destination restaurant.
