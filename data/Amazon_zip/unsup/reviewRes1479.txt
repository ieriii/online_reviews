The hours suck (only 10-4pm M-Sat). The location sucks. The perpetual long-ass-line on Saturdays sucks. Paying cash sucks. But there is nowhere else in this world where I can get a Cognac and Cranberry Smoked Chicken Sausage with Blackberry Butter and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey. or a Blue Cheese Pork Sausage with Green Apple Creme Fraiche & Smoked Almonds. They might be the most inventive, tastiest "encased meats" I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Thank you Doug.
