Really outstanding buffet - probably the best I've had in Chicago.  It's a little pricier than others, but it's worth it because there are so many options on it. They use quality chicken and lamb and the naan was really fresh. I've tried the buffet at Klay Oven and it doesn't even compare - India House is so much better. Service is decent, nothing outstanding and decor is typical of Indian restaurants.
