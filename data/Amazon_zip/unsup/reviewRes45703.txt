So beautiful, the details are amazing! Since there are so many reviews I will keep it short and sweet ... the service could have used some tweaking (very nice, but very slow during lunch). The food was fantastic: I had the reuben and it was the best I've ever had, ever. My husband had the meatloaf and my daughter had the children's chicken strips and both were equally as good. We ill be back!
