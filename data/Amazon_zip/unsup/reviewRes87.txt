What can I say that other reviews haven't? 1. Proposed to my GF of 12 years here (hopefully we'll be able to come here every year on our anniversary.......at least that's my plan). 2. Food exceeded my high expectations. 3. Service exceeded my high expectations. 4. If you must, pimp yourself out to highest bidder to pay for dinner.
