I'm a fan for sure, but I totally agree with some of the more negative reviews--I've had some nights of pure pizza bliss... and some that I've been ashamed to call "Chicago pizza". It's an institution but sometimes feels more like a tourist trap than a restaurant. I've been there enough to see the variation, but not enough to predict. The worst was when a good friend of ours and his family were visiting from out of town and it was pretty mediocre... including the service. So we were trying to explain why we love it so much... but other nights it's been devine... Anyways, a bit hit-or-miss but when it's a hit, it's so good that I'm giving 4 stars instead of 3!
