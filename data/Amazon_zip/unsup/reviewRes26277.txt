The fact that this place is ranked high leads me to believe a lot of people in chicago lack taste buds. We used to go for pho, and to their credit, the broth always has good flavor. The problem is the meat. It basically tastes terrible. No matter what kind of meat you get..chicken, brisket, tripe...it basically tastes like they cook it in a microwave and throw it in the broth. The chicken is always tough and chewy, and has that horrible fatty taste that only re-heating chicken in a microwave will produce. And I really wanted to like this place..i've actually gone about 4 times because once the meat was actually fresh, and therefore the pho was great...but that never happened again...and now I've decided no more torturing myself at this place. The owner is friendly and awesome....but dude c'mon...you're not fooling anyone with the tough, rubbery, bad tasting meat you put into the pho. I like you, you're a friendly guy, but please upgrade the meat quality and I will eat there everyday and change my review to 5 stars.
