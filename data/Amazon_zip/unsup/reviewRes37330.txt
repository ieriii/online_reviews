Proof that "Check Please!" has the power to ruin everything you've come to love about an establishment by over-flooding said establishment with total douchebags that otherwise have no clue what they're eating. I used to love coming to this place. 5, 6, 7 years ago? Believe it or not, there was a time when you could get a seat at a booth on a Friday or Saturday night. There was a time when the bartenders knew your name and your order or would take the time to recommend something. There was a time when the food wasn't hurried. There was a time when the Hopleaf was a quiet and quaint establishment like a local pub of the Belgian variety. Now it's the kind of place where Lincoln Park professionals will start throwing their coat on your booth (while you're sitting there) to mark their territory and then take up a whole booth just for 2 people when there are groups of 5 or 6 people who could squeeze into the booth. Yeah, battle of the fittest or some bullshit like that is much more valid than neighborhood friendly bar, I'm sure. Really depressingly is that they used actually use a garden behind their back end to grow the greens and herbs used in their food organically and deliciously. Of course now that their patronage has grown so much, they quit that practice. It's no coincidence that their food was better years ago. I guess it's a fun place to take someone for fancy beers and to impress them with garlic mayo and fries.
