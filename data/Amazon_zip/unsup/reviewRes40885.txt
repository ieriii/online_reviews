After trying Blackbird (a supposed renowned restaurant) and didn't much care for it, I went to Bonsoiree for my husband's and my anniversary. From the start, the crowd, wait staff and ambiance was comfortable and inviting. Nothing about this place was stuffy or pretentious. We ate on the back porch and had the pre-fixed 5-course meal. No s#!t, every course was amazing and memorable! We stayed for probably two and a half hours just enjoy ourselves and the food. We finally told our waiter to give our compliments to the chef and that we felt their dinner far exceeded Blackbird. As we were leaving, the chef stepped out of the kitchen to give his personal thanks for the compliment. Definitely one of the highlights of the evening and truly shows how modest and appreciative he was. I can see that people can be put off by the exterior of the place, being in an 'up and coming' side of town, but rest assured it's a jewel amongst the culinary world in Chi-town.
