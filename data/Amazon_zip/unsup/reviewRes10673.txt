Definitely my favorite brunch spot. Waiting there is kind of uncomfortable, since they don't have much room for standing, but it's definitely worth a 10-15 minute wait. Not sure about waiting longer than that though... I am always torn between their savory and their sweet breakfast items. They have a pretty extensive menu, and I'm never unhappy with what I get. The main dishes are good of course, but it's the side items that really stand out for me. The house potatoes are a must get. I crave these regularly. The sour cream that comes with the breakfast burrito is awesome (for sour cream), and the brown sugar butter they put on some of their pancakes is pure magic. They also have Intelligentsia coffee, which would enhance any meal. It is kind of expensive, but the portions are giant and the quality is excellent. Service is always fair to good. Sit by the window and people watch.
