I went with 5 stars because although the service can sometimes be slow the food has NEVER disappointed.  I do admit that I miss the location across the street, I loved the small feeling and of course the BYOB. However, their new location is nice too with high ceilings and from what my husband tells me, amazing bathrooms. I also love the big wood tables. The food is so amazing. The empanadas are perfect (I suggest chicken over beef). I always get the churrasquito which comes with a yummy plantain, yuca and a baked potato. I am a little confused as to why they would serve both yuca and potato since they are both very similar to one another. Subbing out for rice is a good option. Last but not least I must say how DELICIOUS the aji sauce is that is always on the table. I think it is commonly confused for chimchurri but I got to the bottom of that when I was there last as well.  One of my favorite places in Chicago and I will be back often!
