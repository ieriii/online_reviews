THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO, PERIOD! It's actually New Haven (east coast) style, but it beats anything local.They have an awesome white pizza (garlic and olive oil instead of tomato sauce). I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on that.We have taken over a dozen friends at different times, and they have all raved about it.
