Great meal !!! If you like chicken wing you have to check this place out. I had lunch here with my brother and ordered the spicy BBQ sauce and the Seoul sassy. They both were very very good and tasty. They were nice crunch to skin. The meat inside was juicy. The batter was light and crispy. Also the price is reasonable.But small space.Definitely plan on being regular here !!!
