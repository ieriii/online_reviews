I have eaten here several times and all times have been average.This time I expected no different when we went to the GLC for lunch. The service was terrible. Took 30 minutes to take our order and the food took over an hour to come, and only to have issues with every item we ordered.The omelet was cold, frozen cold. Pre made and they just nuke it. BAD BAD and more BAD. The Grilled Chicken salad sent you search for the chicken and plain salad ordered with no dressing came smothered in it. They made no accommodations to repair the damage quickly. We were told the kitchen was backed up. Sorry but this is your primary business to cook and serve guest.The topper was when we paid the bill and asked for change, when we went to count the change the server stated "I think I owe you a few more dollars" he was going to short change us. Really after the bad experience we just had.I would head somewhere else.
