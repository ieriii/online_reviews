You could go on and on about Zed. Everyone's tired of those all-you-can handle meathouses at this point, but they do it a little differently here. First, you may not even have to lay your rock out in front of your plate once you've been up to the salad bar. I'm telling you, you could go up ther e5 or 6 times and still not be satisfied. They have 4 or 5 stations of goodies you can throw on your plate. Ok, so if you decide to go the meat route, it's important you pace yourself. There are going to be times where there are 4 or 5 different meats being passed around and there's no reason to think you have to eat one before trying another. Just relax. Moreso than anything else, I recommend their rib eye, their bottom sirloin, and the seared ahi tuna. I mean, everything there is good, so it's all a matter of taste, but I thought those three were the best. They have things like BBQ chicken too, but I wasn't a huge fan. If God ever decides to bless us with consistently good weather again, they have a sweet rooftop bar that gets crowded beyond belief. So be sure to check it out next June when that happens. if you're going after work, get there soon and save a spot because the line will stretch down the block before you know it. You're welcome.
