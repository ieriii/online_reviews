We've only ordered the thin crust and it is delicious (my friends insist on ordering it during gatherings ie. Bears/Sox games). We've always had fast delivery with no problems and great product quality. I've rarely had better pizza, however, it is somewhat expensive for the quantity. The cost doesn't merit a star deduction though - it's that good.
