Having worked in Uptown for a while, I always suggest that visitors stop by Demera for lunch or dinner. The staff is always very attentive, the service is quick and the food is excellent. The spice combinations in Ethiopian food are unlike I've ever experienced before- but delicious! Best of all, the waitresses are really patient and totally willing to walk you through the ultra-unfamiliar menu. Great for lunch or dinner and plenty of room for large groups!
