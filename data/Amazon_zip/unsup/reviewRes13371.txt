I'm sorry, Revolution, but I'm quitting you for a bit. I want to love you. Mostly because you're right down the street and I enjoy your beers and the vibe. But my last visit was a huge disappointment. My friend and I went in for brunch. We decided to sit at the bar for what we figured might be slightly faster service. After being handed our menus, we were never looked at again. In fact, I feel like we were being outright ignored. Look, I get it. You're busy. It's packed. It's brunch and there's going to be a wait. A simple "hey, I see you and I'm going to get to you as soon as I can" would have kept us waiting a bit longer. Instead, we walked down the street to Logan, where we were greeted with good service and hot food. I'd also like to throw in that I think the food here is only so-so. I've been enough times that I can honestly say the menu sounds more interesting than what actually arrives on your plate. I hope when I finally come around again I'll have an experience that will erase this most recent one.
