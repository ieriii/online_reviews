The W spoils you. Favorite part is the room itself and that is what counts. Well designed, plasma screen, understated colors, a nice place to relax after some tough business days in Chicgo. The downsides, not enough elevators! On Saturday night becuase of the club on 33rd floor we could not get back to room for 15 minutes. Service while good just feels false, almost too good. Did not appreciate being charged to have packages delivered to the room, seemed cheap for a hotel in this price range. I know that I am not the target age group for their marketing, but plenty of people my age visit this hotel and I would love them to first turn down the elevator music and then have someone ease off on the bass and drum beats early in the morning. Nice gym and great place to stay.
