I was in town for one Sunday night and stopped by for dinner. Food was excellent and service was wonderful. I had a nice outdoor seat, indoor also seemed nice. I tasted three dishes - one chicken, one shrimp, and one beef. All were excellent and the chicken was very tender. I'm used to top NYC restaurants, so I'm a pretty tough critic. . .
