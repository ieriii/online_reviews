Am I ashamed to admit I've been here two times and I've lived in this area for less than a week? Kind of, but it's so yummy! I got the veggie burrito with plantains. Heavenly. The bf got the veggie burrito with chorizo added and loved it. Seriously packed with flavor. Please do yourself a favor and get the oatmeal shake with soy. Too good...you haven't seen the last of me Irazu.
