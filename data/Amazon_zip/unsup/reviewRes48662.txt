I have found my new favorite restaurant. I cannot recall going to a restaurant that was so tasty and so cheap. I really cannot say enough nice things about this place.  Their beer list is pretty impressive. I was drinking a Russian style porter, that was ~10% and it was $5 a beer. $5 for a microbrew is cheap anywhere in the city, and it is really an extra bonus for the Publican. If you go to the Publican, get the sweetbreads. They are far and away the best sweetbreads I have ever had. Also, the pork rinds are very good and only $5.  My only complaint is the old fashion booths that they shut you up in. Being a broad shouldered person, I am not a fan.
