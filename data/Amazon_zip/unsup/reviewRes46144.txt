We arrived early and the wait was about 10 minutes. They wanted to sit us at a regular table. We wanted to sit at a booth table by the window. They graciously accommodated us! We needed to wait for two more people. We waited for about 30 minutes and they did not kick us out or rush us out! Strangely they kept coming to us to serve us food that we did not order. We had to keep telling them that we did not order all this stuff! Other than that, service was top notch. Very attentive and timely. I ordered the baby back ribs. I cant remember what everyone else ordered but they enjoyed their food. For dessert we ordered the beignets. Not like Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, but still very good! YUM!
