This is my special place. Whenever I feel like going all out, having a great time, spending money the way I want to (on fancy beers and fancy food), I come to hopleaf. Not only is it one of the only bars in chicago without a TV (truly a sign of good taste), it plays its old music softly (allowing the millions of people in the front bar to create their own racous noise). If you were 3 9.5%-alcohol beers deep, you wouldn't mind shouting about existentialism either. Food: Get the CB&J and the white beer mussels! have you ever craved a grilled cheese and a pb&j at the same time? Well this is that, but gourmet! the stilton mac&cheese is supreme! Also, don't miss the fries with aioli garlic dipping sauce!! If you are a belgian beer fan (which i am), you'll love it here. The bartenders are nice and helpful at suggesting a similar beer if your favorite one is out. watch out once you pass the 4-beer mark...you'll be wasted on these thick, strong brews! ps: avoid the mead. blech.
