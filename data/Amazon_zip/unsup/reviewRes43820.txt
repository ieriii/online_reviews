To my friend's amazement (and since it was the day after Christmas) we were able to walk right in and snag a table with no issues. My friend, who is a Chicago native, highly recommended this place for breakfast. I'm really glad I had the chance to eat here. I ordered strictly off of what my friend recommended, and didn't even look at the menu. He suggested I try the Huevos Rancheros - EXCELLENT! This was THE best version of this dish I have ever had. It was also the most interesting one in presentation. I've never had Huevos Rancheros casserole style, and I won't have them any other way now! Yea, it was that good. I also love the fact that pretty much everything is self-service as far as coffee and water. It's very pleasant to not be waited on sometimes.
