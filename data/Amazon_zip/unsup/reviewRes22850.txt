Well, what can I say, the bar server treated me like a piece of sh*t and that naturally flavored my experience. I'm in Chicago, my hometown, visiting my family. I'm with my parents, my brother, my girlfriend, and my daughter. We get to the restaurant, it's crowded, that's fine. We can wait. We go into the bar to get a drink. I try to order a Greek beer and the dumbass server tries to card me. I'm 41 freaking years old. I have grey hair in my beard and sideburns and receding hair. I'm with my parents, who are in their late 60s. I show her my daughter, who is 9 years old, and she says 'it doesn't matter'. What the heck were you thinking? I was 12 years old when I had a kid? WTF is the matter with you? I walked away, I'm not showing my id to an idiot. According to the server, I looked like I might be 30. Guess what, do the math. Last time I checked 30 is 9 years older than 21. I'm at your restaurant to spend money on a dining experience, and you treat me poorly. You insult me and my entire family. What do you think, does the state liquor control board hire entire families to try to trick your servers? Really? I understand that the motto of the Illinois liquor control board is 'Card Hard' (I kid not), I'm not sure if that's a porno or a party reference, but the attitude of this particular Chicago server seems to be broad shouldered but small minded. We did eventually get a table and eat, and I even drank some wine at the table. Holy not breaking the law!! But based on this experience I don't see any reason to ever return. It's a sad state the Americans have this insane fear of alcohol and liquor boards pressure servers to card like crazy, and we are supposed to accept it like sheeples. Screw that noise.  How about treating a customer with some respect?
