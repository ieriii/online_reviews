Pho sure! This place is lots of fun. The pho is great, but be ready to take half of it home... there is a lot! The jack-fruit bubble tea is awesome as well as the spring rolls you roll yourself. One of the things I really like about the place is sitting at the large round tables with other people from the neighborhood creating an almost a family style dining experience. No delivery, but if you're taking the red-line you can order ahead, get off at Argyle and stop in to it pick-up.
