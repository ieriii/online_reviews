I walked into Piece on a chilly Saturday night around 8:30 to meet my date; the distant sounds of laughter that the comforts of warmth can furnish was impetus enough to enter before she arrived. When I was finally situated- in what I originally thought to be more of a restaurant than bar- a tension arose that that six dollar Jameson could not fix. After I wove through the conglomerate display of fashionable patrons and staff, I set my drink atop a the trite circular wooden bar table which lay a comfortable distance from the emerald couch I sat on. I should mention the place I was sitting at was similar to Calypso's island in the midst of the hustle that the upper level boasted. Already, one can see the tension arising between this description. I, as much as the next guy, love a vivacious ambiance that is conducive for spurious encounters with the opposite sex. Yet, I was supposed to take my date here, this was our second date. Recognizing we were in that ubiquitous stage of getting to know one another, I finished my drink and walked out the door; I think I spent 15 minutes inside. That said, this place definitely struck me as a suitable place for my friends and I to drink heavily while watching any given Chicago sports team. I suppose I need to coordinate my means to ends relationships better. Others who have this problem take heed.
