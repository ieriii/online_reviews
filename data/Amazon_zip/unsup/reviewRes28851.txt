I went there with the Windy City Pizza Club. The crust delivered its well known taste but I thought the medium pan was a little heavy on the sauce compared to what I remember the last time I went there. Prices were very reasonable. The service was very friendly and I found my drink continually refilled up until the time the check came and then the waitress vanished.  I would recommend trying it at least once because it is very unique and good but don't plan to go back there for a while.
