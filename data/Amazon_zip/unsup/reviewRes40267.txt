I am a San Franciscan and I like mission style burritos. I like rice and beans, meat, sour cream, cheese and salsa in my burritos. I love the flavor combination. THESE are the polar opposite of a mission style burrito. Basically these are giant street tacos in a bigger tortilla. Basically, big logs of meat. Not my thing. However, if I had chosen to get tacos here I think I would have been a bigger fan. The meat was delicious and had great flavor.  I think I just ordered the wrong thing.  Chicago isn't California and I'll remember that when ordering again. Tacos all the way. Street tacos seem to be consistent everywhere I go.
