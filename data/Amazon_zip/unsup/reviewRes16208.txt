Oh man this place is GOOD. Cute, fun atmosphere, great service, amazing menu, etc. etc. Seriously, I want to try everything on the menu. It was so difficult to choose and especially since the waiter seemed like he recommended everything during his speil about the menu. I ended up going with the Churrasco which was an excellent cut of meat, perfectly cooked (medium), with a great balance of flavors and spices. Watch out though, the portions here are large, so if you want to save some money you will have no problem sharing an entree with a friend. Sangria was great, and the selection of South American beers was fun to try. Could have done with a bigger wine list, though. Kind of surprised given the number of good up-and-coming South American wines. I would recommend this to anyone who has something to celebrate... or just to eat good latin food.
