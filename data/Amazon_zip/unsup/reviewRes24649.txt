What? I've never reviewed Artopolis? Seriously? This is one of my favorite places in Chicago.  Awesome atmosphere, fabulous cafe items and desserts, great coffees, open late. Service is often hit or miss if you're trying to get out of here in a hurry, but I never am.  They have the best frickin' cannoli you will ever have. Seriously, I've been chasing a cannoli as good as theirs for a VERY long time. Their almond cookies are incredible and pretty much everything else in their bakery case is too.  I crave their Mediterranean salad pretty much daily and they have the best avgolemono in Greektown. Over the 10 years I lived in Chicago I've tried pretty much everything on their cafe menu. There isn't a sandwich I don't like. Sure, I have favorites, but they're all good. Their bread... oh good God, their bread.  Give me a loaf and a handful of butter cups and I'm good for a while.  I like, but don't love, their artopitas. Sometimes they're a touch greasy. Pizza is pretty good. Some entrees are better than others. I miss this place all of the time. So glad to have made a point to swing in during my recent visit back to Chicago.
