From the rock shrimp to the shrimp with egg sauce, to filets, this place is fricken amazing! Bring extra $$$$ for the absolutely to die for martinis. This place is for any steak, seafood, or sushi, or Chinese type food. Across the board amazing. And beautiful decor. Just dobt get seated along the wall if your with a party of 2...can't talk with out table hearing and not romantic nor even fun. Get a table.
