The food has always been amazing, and with the addition of brunch, I almost feel like I'm cheating on Longman if I go anywhere else. Oh, and did you know they serve alcohol? The bartenders are all phenomenal, and Longman offers the best BEST best Dark and Stormy. With coathooks under the bar (a necessity) and the coolest bathroom, the interior is not only sexy, it's functional. The wooden sculptures are my favorites! What, you need more to convince you to go here?
