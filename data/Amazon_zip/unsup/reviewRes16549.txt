Holy Herradura, Batman! If you come to Chicago and don't treat yourself to these cocktails, you've missed a life-changing, or at least palate-changing, experience. Our bartender was an artist, and incredibly friendly and generous with her expertise. The Zarzamora and the potable bitters rocked, but the Negroni with Cynar was Beethoven's 9th. Get there early (before 6), or be prepared to wait, and plan to stay for at least three drinks. And while the chickpea popcorn is a great snack, if you're hungry, grab dinner elsewhere. Violet Hour is for drinkin'!
