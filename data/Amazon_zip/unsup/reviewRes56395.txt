Simply It is a fantastic restaurant! I loved the liveliness and the food was exceptional. It's BYOB which is the main reason we went there and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the atmosphere. It's loud, but I love that. I had the bean sprouts and tofu, which was the favorite dish of my table, and the other people with me enjoyed their food a lot too! The food really was great (and inexpensive). I highly recommend having a meal at Simply It if you are in the area!
