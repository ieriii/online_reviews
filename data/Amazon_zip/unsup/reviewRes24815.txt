As the only Costa Rican restaurant in the city limits, I had to try it at least once. I must say the sweet plantains were better than what I had when I was in Montego Bay, Jamaica. The avocado, onion, and cilantro salsa is not spicy. If you want spicy, go to any Mexican restaurant. I like the friendly casual atmosphere and how the servers and owners address you by your first name.
