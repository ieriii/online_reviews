+1 for the tequila flights.. delicioso!! +1 for the guacamole and excellent service +1 for the mole sauce DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ELSE off the menu. I came with a big group of friends and waited 2 hours for a table. Luckily, there's a bar area so we ordered some beers and a couple of tequila tastings which were excellent!! The waitress also generously comped us fresh guacamole which was mm mm yummy goodness. All of us ordered an appetizer and entree to share. Somebody ordered the Enchiladas en Mole which Rick Bayless is known for.. and that was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Definitely worth a trip to Frontera just to try that mole sauce. But don't order anything else. The ceviche was okay. Everything else was either way too salty, bland, or dry. BOTTOM LINE: - Come to Frontera when they open at 5PM, or be prepared to wait for several hours - Order a guacamole - Order the Enchiladas en Mole - Dip the chips in the remaining mole sauce (or bottle it up and take it home.. that stuff is like liquid crack) - Cross Frontera off of the "To Do" list of restaurants
