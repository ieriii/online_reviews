loved this place! limited seating..but definitely worth the wait, luckily got a table which we switched to a booth when it became available. enjoyed many imorted tap beers, which they have an excellent selection, and the food was pretty good. had the duck rueben and tried my friends sausage plate, all in all pretty tasty! favorite beer I tried was Kwak, from Belgium, amber in color, full bodied taste, and at 9% alcohol worth the $8 or $9 I paid for it=) bartender was attentive, had no problem getting a beer, at least from the guy who we got our first beer! definitely will go back next time I am in that part of Chicago!!
