As far as Korean hybrid chicken goes, this place is tops. It's a bummer that the staff is pretty unprofessional. While I was ordering, two delivery guys bragged about how 'high' they were; then after ordering the cashier just walked outside to smoke. He didn't say a word, just entered my order and walked outside. Another cashier had to finish the order, and was dumbfounded on the first guys disrespect. The entire experience made me feel really uncomfortable. The food is awesome, but I can't recommended eating there. Take out only.
