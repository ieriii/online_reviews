The food I ate last night was tremendulous! A group of us dined on the steaks and seafood, and shared the wonderful sides. What more to say about the food that is not already reviewed. Come here to eat and not count calories. Share a bottle of wine. Talk about how much you need a dog to take home the leftover bone to. Need more specifics? Okay the seared ahi tuna was very good. The calamari was served with a spice that is new to me, and very tasty. The caprese salad and bufalo mozzarella was melt in my mouth yummy. I wanted to try the turtle soup, but I ordered salad and the lobster bisque I tried felt too heavy, but good. I ordered the shrimp and lobster served with ponzieu (?sp) sauce. It needed something to soak up the sauce like rice. Ate it with the mashed potatoes. My husband's Ribeye served med rare was perfectly wonderful. And all the other sides complimented the meal. The wine that was recommended also complimented the dinner, Syrah Montes something. Great!
