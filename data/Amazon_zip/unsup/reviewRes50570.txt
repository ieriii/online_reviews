This place is solid. I was not over whelmed by the food her in any way but it was pretty darn tasty and a pretty darn good experience. I really like the size of this place. It is one of the bigger neighborhood restaurants that I know. We went there on a quite a snowy day and the place was only about 2/3 of the way full. Even if it was full, I think that I would not get that cramped feeling. I ordered the Savannah Shrimp Omelet with grits and a corn muffin. It was decent. I was expecting my meal to be a little more flavorful though. It was a good meal though. They coffee they serve here is excellent, it is a dark, full-flavored roast and it was very satisfying. Our server was very good, he was very patient with us when it took us a while to decide and he was very friendly and helpful. There are a few ore things that I would like to try on the menu and due to it's convenient location from us, we will be back.
