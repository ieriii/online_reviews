I love how this gem is hidden. I felt like Alice in Wonderland upon entering. It has a 1920's speakeasy feel. Small groupings of high-backed chairs make it the perfect place for a cocktail and quiet conversation. I do recommend finding a cozy stool at the bar and observe the art of crafting a cocktail. I was curious to what was in all of the apothecary looking bottles and found myself sipping chartreuse and other potions compliments of the bartender. From twice filtered ice to house made bitters and ginger syrup, everything is meant to be sipped slow and savored. My personal favorite is the Moscow mule. The music is eclectic and definitely has a presence but not so much to overpower a conversation. Love this place! Just wish we had one in Detroit this cool.
