Yum, yum, yum! I didn't know what to expect when I heard the name, but a friend recommended this place to me -- and I'm so glad I went! Everything we ordered was de-lish and the perfect serving size! The only real complaint I have is the wait and the lack of arm-space. We waited at least an hour on a weekday only to get two seats at the bar, and we had to bump our way through the crowd to get to them. Our bartenders/servers made it up to us though with their outstanding service and friendliness! Also, the fact that it's crowded shows just how good this place really is, right? It is pricey for food and drinks, but I can't wait to go back!
