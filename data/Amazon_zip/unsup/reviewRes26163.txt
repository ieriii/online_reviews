I really enjoy this restaurant. I'm on a budget so to take it easy on price my husband and I usually just get the cheese fondue (it comes with a salad) and the sangria. The cheese is so good, I crave it. The only problem is the prices are high (way higher than Melting Pot). For the cheese, salad, sangria and tip our total bill was around $63. Be careful walking away from your table - it's so dark you may trip :o)
