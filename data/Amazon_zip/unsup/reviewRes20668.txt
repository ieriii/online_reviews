The Gage has become one of my favorite restaurants and bars in the city. With a host of seasonal menu items, a high caliber of service, and a beautifully polished space I am always happy with my dining experience here. I love coming here for both lunch and dinner and after hearing the rave reviews my Mother gave the Belgian waffle I can't wait to come back for brunch (served Saturday & Sunday).
