As always Marriott came correct with the Courtyard Marriott in downtown Chicago! We are relocating there and used points for the weekend and were treated well and there was great service. I had some nice conversations with the good people of Starbucks and the valet guys were a huge help. Strangely enough my parking pass from Indianapolis was working in the garage attached to the hotel so it was free! Otherwise, I think it's a pretty hefty charge and the valets don't accept call ahead requests from the rooms. We were house hunting and so by the evening on Saturday we were dead tired. It was a room service night and the hot wings and cheesecake from Viand totally hit the spot. We're becoming more and more impressed by the Courtyard hotels and this one really was great!
