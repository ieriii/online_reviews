Tip if you are staying in a hotel in this area and want to come here. There were like 3 conferences in town when we went to try this place out the other night. So instead of waiting the 1-2 hour wait for a table at 8pm, we took a cab to the next closest location on 135 E. Lake Street instead. We just walked right in and were seated. I think it's where the locals eat.
