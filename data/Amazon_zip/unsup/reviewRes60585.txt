I'm not sure I get this place. I eat here every time we go to see our lawyers or accountants at the office, which is pretty often, because it seems like "Michigan Avenue"-grade eating for better than Michigan Ave prices.The offering is very Michigan Avenue and so is the look of the restaurant and clientele (and the service is pretty good) which is refreshing if you're like me and generally spend most of your time (by choice) in dives and student clubs. The food, though, is pretty mediocre. It's not bad, but it's not great, and because that's the focus of the whole experience, it hurts the rating. My advice: the simpler and more common the food you order, the better it'll be.I guess the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for, contextual to where you pay for it. Not bad, not great -- three stars. I'll be back, but with reasonable expectations.
