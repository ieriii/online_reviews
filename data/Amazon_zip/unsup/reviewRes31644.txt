During my recent trip to Chicago, I stopped by Sunda for cocktails and appetizers. I love the rock shrimp tempura, and brussel sprout salad. Their cocktails were very tasty and creative - loved the ginger snap. The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Thank you Jess! Looking forward to my next visit.
