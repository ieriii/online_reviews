*This post is based purely on the Churros* Growing up in SoCal, I grew up on Disneyland churros. Now you may think that I am therefore ignorant on churros, but Disneyland makes some damn good churros. I have never found a churro that was as enjoyable as a Disneyland churro. That is until now. 3 churros for $3?!?! We ended up getting 9...because I could just tell they'd be amazing. Upon first bite, I was in cinnamon sugar heaven. I love churros and have made them a few times myself when I couldn't get to Disneyland. I've tried them at various other places and never enjoyed them at all and walked away disappointed. Now I wish I lived in Chicago because I would be getting churros at least once a week...probably more like once a day if I had it my way. I'm sure that everything else at this place is good (I also had the Aztec chocolate, and that was fabulous, albeit a bit more bitter than I expected), but I will give this place 5 stars and toot the amazingness of it to anyone and everyone just because of its fabulous churros. The fact that they made perfect, crispy, and non-greasy churros with just the perfect balance of sweetness and cinnamon makes this place a winner! Disneyland, eat your heart out.
