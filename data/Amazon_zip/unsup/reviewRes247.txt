First of all, it's plain from the outside. We thought the taxi driver dropped us off somewhere else, but there was someone there to open it. It opens to a hallway that ends. I felt like that scene in Alice in Wonderland when the room ends and it gets smaller. All of a sudden, an automatic slide door opened. We jumped, but I must say that was really cool. Such a great culinary experience, for reals. My friends and I got lucky with the reservation since we were going for Lollapalooza. We're obviously not from Chicago area and were definitely excited a table opened up. I can't believe how Grant Achatz relearned taste and then created these amazing dishes. We had a tube that had 3 different flavors, hibiscus, then pomegranate, then bubble game... HOW THE HECK DOES HE DO IT? Also, Grant, please adopt me. The short course is 16 dishes. We were all stuffed and carrying our stomachs to Second City. The Sommelier was very entertaining and I loved his wine choices. I'm a light weight, so I could only take a few sips from my wine pairings. Thank goodness I was there with male friends, who helped me drink it. However, I did finish one that stood out which was the K Syrah with my wagyu kobe beef steak and dried A1 sauce. OOooh.... then they came out with a pillow filled with lavender scents and I felt like I had fallen into a very happy dream. It was just amazing... also thanked it wasn't allergy season. My boyfriend got me the 50lb Alinea book. Hopefully, one day I will be able to make 1/4 of a dish.
