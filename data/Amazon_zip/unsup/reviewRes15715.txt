Mehhhhhhhh. Ehhhhhhhhh. I've heard lots about Violet Hour and was excited at the idea of finally getting to try it out on my most recent trip to Chicago. I understand the speakeasy concept, wanting to seem swank and keeping an air of mystery and "too cool"-ness, I really do. A 2 hour wait seemed a little ridiculous, sure, but I thought we might as well make the most out of it and get ready for the experience that would surely blow our minds. Right? After waiting out at Big Star and Blue Line (a personal favorite Chicago bar of mine), we were summoned on a friend's cell to finally come to the promised land. BUT WE ONLY HAD A FEW MINUTES TO GET THERE SO HURRY THE FUCK UP.  The decor and feel was...boring. No real decorations. Blank walls. Our party of 7 was seated rightnextto another big group. We were so on top of each other that at first glance, you'd think we were all together. And not to sound like an arugula-eating elitist dick, but after being told to follow several rules and to make sure I was dressed nice enough for this place, I was a little miffed at being piled onto another party that was ordering shots with a girl wearing a zippered sweatshirt and a scrunchie. /end snobbery. The drinks? Absolutely fantastic. My Moscow Mule was perfect and all the other cocktails my friends ordered were tasty. My friend ordered the Negroni and the server acted like she made a mistake. "That's not fruity or citrusy, you know that right?" said our server. Um. Yes, yes she did. We're 26, not 19 year old idiots. Anyway. It was good to try Violet Hour out. I had fun because I was with some of my best friends and my drink was delicious. The $12 price tag was fine with me for a very potent, well-made drink. But everything else...peh.
