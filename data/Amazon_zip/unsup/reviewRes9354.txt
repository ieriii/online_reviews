Highly recommend the prefix tasting menu! The food was great, and super unique. I took my fianc here for her birthday, and they made it a special occasion for us. If I were to go again, I would not do the wine pairing on the prefix. They charge $60/head, and only give you about 2 ounces of wine per plate. Only enough for a couple sips. Not asking for a 10 oz pour, but 4-5 oz would have been nice. Otherwise, I would suggest the BTG options. Staff was very friendly, and knowledgable.
