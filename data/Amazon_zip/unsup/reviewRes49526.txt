My BF and I have been here at least a dozen times over the past few years. I've read other reviews, and yes - the comments about slow service can be accurate on the weekends. We only tend to go on weeknights - Saturdays are VERY busy, with lots of parties. On nights where it's less busy, let's talk about the FOOD. We must have tried just about everything on the menu. Now we just go for the best stuff - the appetizers are almost all really great. For entrees, the BF gets the Bandeja Paisa (and eats the whole thing). I get the Entrana, or the combinacion, with baby octopus and the steak (same steak as the Entrana), which comes with potato, yuca and fried sweet plaintain. Oh, add a margarita to that - their bartender shakes the HELL out of them and it somehow makes it even more tasty.  Delicious! We keep wondering to ourselves how the place stays open with so much food at such cheap prices. Whatever it is they need to keep doing it - we haven't been in a couple of months so it's time to go back again!
