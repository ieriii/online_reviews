This was probably one of my favorite deep dish spots in chicago that i visited. Their sauce is amazing and their crust and toppings were above average. this pie does sorely need more cheese and slightly crispier crust. my perfect piece of deep dish pizza would be to combine lou malnati's crust and cheese to go with pequods toppings and sauce.
