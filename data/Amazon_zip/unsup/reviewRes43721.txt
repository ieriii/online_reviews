I came here with a buddy of mine last fall on a recommendation from the hotel concierge. We got there a bit early so we decided to hit up the bar for a ore cocktail. I am not a Scotch guy but we ordered a couple of macallan 17 years and bellied up to the bar. The decor was very classy with a modern feel to it. We sat down at our table and look over the menu. They have the standard items that you would expect at a fancy chop house. We both orders fillets and were both happy with the way they came out. I like mine medium with a good amount of pink color and they nailed it right on the money. I think my favorite part of Kinzies is the decor. Don't get me wrong, I think the food is excellent but you can get a better steak at The Chop House.
