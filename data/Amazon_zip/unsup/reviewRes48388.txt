I am a fan! Great bourbon - check! Fantastic beer list - check! Amazing menu with adventurous options - check! Great service - check! Awesome, hip atmosphere - check! Parking - no prob! I realize this is an uber hip joint and it's in an uber hip part of town, but I really wish it didn't have to be so darn expensive. But it is what it is. This isn't a place I'd go to a bunch, but I would go more if I had that kinda cash...it's a place I will continue to go for special occasions and when visitors come into town. Check it out - it's worth treating yourself...I went last night and can't stop dreaming of the beets with ricotta and those country ribs.....mmmm....
