i'm not a huge pizza fan. but as a friend pointed out, something has to be said about a place that can change the way i think about the food group. i had deep dish pizza on my last trip to chicago and still just wasn't too excited about the whole thing but after my most recent giordano's stuffed pizza experience i think i've finally been converted. for starters, it made me realize that i definitely, definitely prefer chicago stuffed to ANY new york style pizza i've ever tried (sorry anthony bourdain). i loved the tomato sauce to cheese ratio, and the cheese and crust on that thing was just great. the service here was eh and the beer was kinda flat but overall i had a great time discovering a new found appreciation for this bread/cheese/sauce combo. next time i'm in town i'll definitely be willing to venture out to check out some more famous pizza places.
