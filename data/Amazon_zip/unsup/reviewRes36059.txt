The meal was tasty; we had beef chow fun, and a sampling of their bbq: pei-par duck, roast pork, and chicken. Good place for Hong Kong eats. I also like the new decor a lot. However, after the meal, we came down with what we suspect as a MSG headache and drowsiness that lasted throughout the afternoon. I would like to try this place again to see if there is the same effect afterwards.
