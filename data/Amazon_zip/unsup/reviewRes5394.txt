Ate here in late March on what started out as a mild evening. Upon arriving we were expecting a wait based on reviews. We checked in and were told we would have a 30 minute wait. They asked us to wait outside and told us a server would be by to take our drink order. We did and he did in about 10 minutes, and then we were pleasantly surprised to be seated just inside an outdoor tented structure with a heater. So we only waited about 15 minutes. Then it got better when we looked at the menu, there are so many interesting things to order I wish I could eat there every day just to try them all. But, we had to pick, so we went with Fried Brussel Sprouts, Fried Pig Ears with Kale, Striped Bass and Skate with Beets & Blood Orange. Our wine was an Italian red from the Abruzzo region and at $8 a glass it was both delicious and a bargain. About midway through our meal the wind picked up and it became obvious rain was on the way so I flagged our waitress over and asked her to move us ASAP, she found us a place inside at a hightop with some other folks. No sooner were we inside when the heavens opened up so it was just in the nick of time. The food was delicious and so interesting - every bite. Looking around at what everyone else was eating, they were all oohing and ahhing over their food and enjoying and sharing with their friends. I just wished I lived in Chicago so I could eat there often. Oh - and the prices were really reasonable for the caliber of food.
