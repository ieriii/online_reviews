My boyfriend took me here on a date this past Friday and it was a wonderful dining experience. The only trifle of a complaint is they pretend to take reservations but you are still made to wait although they do let you know that you may have to wait a bit on the phone. The food was delectable. We started with the saganaki and gyro app platter. the meat for the gyro platter was perfectly cooked and we got a heaping portion. Soo good just as we were finishing our app and I was thinking, oh no if the food dosen't come soon I'm going to realize how full i probably am,dinner came out. Any thoughts of being filled went out the window and I enjoyed the best lamb I've ever had stuffed with feta and spinach in a great red wine sauce. Oh Yum! It's a Friday night special and I highly recommend it. My water never got low and plates never cluttered us. Immpeccible service and so delish.
