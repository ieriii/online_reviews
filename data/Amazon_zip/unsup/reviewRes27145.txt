Go to Pequod's. Today, this weekend, this month - no excuses. Don't wait any longer. Their deep dish pizza is to die for. It might be the best in the city. The sides of the crust are crunchy goodness. The bottom crust is firm and can hold the mound of toppings. We had a large deep dish with green olives, pepperoni, and giardiniera. Oh my goodness. Go here soon!!! And their wings - so tasty. They aren't buffalo style, but are spicy and have a unique flavor. If you do not devour them, my guess is that you are feeling sick, and therefore your hunger is impaired. You know how it goes if you have the flu or another similar illness. And it is open late too!
