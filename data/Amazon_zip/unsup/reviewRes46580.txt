I got introduced to RJ Grunts when I fell into a bunch of LEYE gift cards, and now I happily spend my own cash there.  It is a perfect place to take a crowd (although be sure to place a reservation in advance), as they have everything one could ask for, including their well known salad bar. The Cajun Chicken Sandwich and Hickory Bacon Cheeseburger are my favorites (in conjunction with the salad bar of course, need to at least pretend to be healthy).  They also offer some delicious booze-infused milkshakes, either off the menu or of your own creation. One server made her "speciality shake" for a friend of mine once, it was so good that I ask for it every time I return....problem being I have no idea what's in it and resort to pointing out the specific server and hoping she continues to remember it). My only complaint is the menu, it is a real world example of how fonts should NOT be used.
