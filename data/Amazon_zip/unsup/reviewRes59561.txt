I have been coming here for well, I won't tell you the years but the Kalbi price on the menu was 10.95 per order when I started coming here. To me this is the best and most authentic Korean food in Chicago, barnone! I know because I used to live there. I've been to solga, cho sun ok, hae woon dae due to others recommendations and its no comparison. Those other places are watered down Korean. The flavor is not the authentic flavor I've had. Love the fact that they burn the wooden charcoal in lieu of gas grill as there is distinct flavor difference. However, the novelty of grilling has worn off, I no longer cook here. I tell my dining companions ahead of time, listen this ain't my first tango so you cook EVERYTHING if you wanna use the grill, otherwise, I am perferctly happy letting the chef in the kitchen cook my MEAT! Anyways, I've had almost everything off the menu here but these days I get the same thing over and over. kalbi, kimchee zigae, yook gae jang, hae mul pajun, bibim naeng myun. All Excellent. Never had a bad meal here and I won't go into service because believe it or not, they've been very good to me but you can read the reviews yourself. In order to understand their service, you must/have to understand the Korean culture. If you understand the culture, you will understand the service and its not a bad thing. No matter how many caucasians you see here, remember that this is a Korean restaurant. I still love this place. One thing is that since they will not let you bring red wine, I really really really really wish they'd at least have some red wine on the menu available for sale. I also see that they're opening a new location in Glenview near Golf and Washington....I have my fingers crossed that they'll either allow its patrons to bring red wine or sell red wine.
