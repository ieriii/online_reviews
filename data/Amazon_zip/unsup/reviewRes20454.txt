This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago. I have to admit that I don't eat in quite as much as I used to, as it is so much easier (and faster) to order carry out. I love their White Dragon Roll. Their Yaki Soba is great as well. Rated it a 4 star as for the value, I think they are a little over-priced.
