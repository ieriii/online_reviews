Lockdown's Border Patrol is better than Kuma's Pantera. Need I say more? Well, yes! Fries are better, prices are better, wait time is better and a free Sapporo when you check in. AND Half price burgers on Tuesdays! Although there are still burgers I would like to taste at Kuma's, I think I found my burger heaven right here at Lockdown. If you are going to complain about the noise, you don't deserve the burger. Barkeep, turn it up to 11!
