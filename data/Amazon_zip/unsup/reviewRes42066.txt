EXCELLENT!! that is all I can say. After visiting Maude's and Au Cheval (sister restaurants), I was hoping for the same type of experience...and was very pleased! Food choices were great, happy to see the foie gras and steak tartare on the menu as well...also, the amazing rib eye!! Waiter was Johnny, what an asset to this place...he too was excellent! Had a table outside, enjoyed one of the best nights in Chicago at an outstanding Chicago restaurant. Happy to hear they are opening a steak joint a few doors down Kinzie, and I will definitely visit it when open!!
