I love tacky eateries (Chili's, TGIFriday's, Olive Garden, Red Robin, etc). The Grand Lux is like a fancy tacky eatery so I love it extra! Back when I lived in Chicago (sob) I used to ALWAYS bring any and every visitor to the Grand Lux. There is something for everyone here! Delicious salads, sandwiches, pizzas and pastas. And delicious appetizers: see spinach and artichoke dip or spring rolls. Everyone loves it and repeat visitors always requested to go back (which I gladly did). Their coctail list is breath-taking and (as they're owned by the cheesecake factory) they have tasty tasty desserts.
