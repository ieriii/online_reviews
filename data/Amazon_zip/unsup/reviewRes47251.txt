Officially my new favorite gourmet burger joint since it opened! I've tried about 3 of the burgers here and have never been disappointed. One of the major reasons I like Lockdown better than that other place is because you don't walk out of there smelling like you just worked your backyard barbecue grill. Servers are very friendly. Parking might be a little difficult to find even at later hours. I tend to avoid Tuesday nights if I can since it's half-priced burger day and you'll end up waiting forever to get a table, or end up being seated to a group of loud blondes that have been there drinking for an hour after they finished their meals.
