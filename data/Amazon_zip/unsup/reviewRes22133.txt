I have been trying to get out to this place for a while now. It is way the heck away from the city near Niles and I live in Lakeview which makes it difficult to get out there for me. This place is definetly something that I will take my friends to and recommend to out of towners. I first pulled into the drive in and to my surprise, this place is still a working drive in where girls come up to you and bring the food to your car. Too bad I did not notice this and got out of my car to order at the counter. Every drive in I have been to up to this point was just an old out of commission drive in. The only drive in I know of so if you want to get the drive in experience check this out. They also have a eat in area and picnic tables for those that do not want to eat at their car. I walked up to the window and went with the Superdawg in order to try the signature treat. It runs for about $4.50 and comes in a little box wedged in with french fries which is their signature. Also everything on the menu will come wedged in tiny box with fries and start with the word super. Superchicken, superburger, supergrilled cheese, etc. The dog was very good and filling, it was a good size hot dog so one should do. I normally get two hot dogs and most hot dog places. The fries were actually kind of burnt and brown. Given the quality of the fries I am giving this place 4 stars, for the great dog and great non-replicable environment.
