A lunch for three including tip was $80. Aside from the price, it was a great experience. I came at around 11 AM. It was lightly raining and there weren't any people. Perfect lunch. Great waiter, was very attentive and friendly despite serving  multiple tables at the same time. Nice view, stellar food, and great service. Experience was perfect. Will be back soon.
