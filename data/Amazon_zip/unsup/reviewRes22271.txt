My favorite restaurant in Greek town. This is where all of my Greek friends choose to eat, so I'm guessing it's authentic. I always try something different and I've never been disappointed. Starvos and George are entertaining as well! It's a great place to meet for an easy dinner in the middle of the week (free valet). I love bringing out of town guests here as well.
