Fabulous! Got seated right away and the menu had plenty of items to choose from. We started with the bacon fat popcorn...amazing. I ordered the pork belly with fried egg sandwich. I had never had pork belly, but it was pretty good. Fries are good too. My bf had the barbecued pork sandwich. Very spicy, but delicious. The garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes are fabulous. The bloody mary with a hunk of cheddar was great..also spicy. And my fb had the Bottom Up Wit. He was looking for something similar to a Blue Moon and that was the waiters suggestion. It was pretty good. Was lighter than a BM, but still had the orangy taste.
