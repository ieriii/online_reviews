This restaurant is awesome because it is so fancy! It looks great on the outside and is huge on the inside.. the food definitely matches the decor in that its delicious! The price can't be beat... for such a fancy, good place, its very reasonably priced! And right in the heart of Greektown so you can't beat the sightseeing!
