Looking hear for some other people's experiences because, my two breakfast experiences here have left me way less than satisfied.I want to love the place but, the items I have ordered were overpriced for for breakfast considering the dishes were very uneventful. French toast needed tons of butter and syrup just to get to be worth even eating and, the homemade biscuits were dry and cold.The eggs have been great but, it's hard to mess up eggs. I'd like to try it for the seafood, maybe that's their talent. I say the breakfast isn't. I'll give em credit for good and friendly service.
