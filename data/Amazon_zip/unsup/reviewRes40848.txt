Bonsoiree would have been one of my "wish list" restaurants if it wasn't for the fact a friend gave me a groupon for it. I haven't really had the penchant to spend loads of money for fancy food. Yeah I'm a foodie but within certain means. But before I digress, Bonsoiree was an awesome experience for me to try and it was certainly enjoyable. As other reviewers have mentioned, the place does look unassuming from the outside whilst simple and quaint on the inside. However, the focus on detail during the dinner service was top class all the way. We got the 7 course deal and only scoffed on one of the courses ... mushrooms. Regardless, the other courses were superb and quite the treat. Unfortunately, I just can't seem to give this place a full five stars. We ate around 7ish and was starving by 9 or so. I need a place to be great and have a little sense of getting your money's worth which I just didn't get enough of with Bonsoiree but if you compare it with other outfits of the same ilk, you find that this place becomes a great choice.
