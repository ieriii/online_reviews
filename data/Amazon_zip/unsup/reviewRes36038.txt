My go-to place for Peking Duck. This isn't a fancy place, by any means, but it's authentic and yummy. Going here and not getting Peking duck would be like ordering the fish at Gibson's or the diet plate at Maggianos; Why bother? Kelly is consistently cheerful and nice, the sauce on the table is fantastic. Be sure to ask if there are soft-shell crabs available and request extra buns for the Peking duck.
