we were so excited about going here, we've been long time fans of Mr. Rick Bayless and we love XOCO to death, and frontera did not disappoint our food and margaritas were outstanding. it was hands down on of the best dinning experiences of my life! get the mezcal margarita and mole, it's a match made in heaven.
