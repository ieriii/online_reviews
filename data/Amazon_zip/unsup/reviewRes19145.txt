Picture this: my two besties and I had just completed the Gorilla Challenge (aka epic fail, gorilla challenge organizers...) but the ending location/party didn't have nearly the capacity for the 2,000 people who competed. Friend 1: Well, this sucks. Wanna bail? Me: There's a Chipotle across the street, wanna grab some food? Friend 1: No, no I do not want to go to Chipotle. I want to go to Xoco. Me: Ooooh I haven't been there before! Friend 2: It's so good, let's go there NOW! So we walked like 1.5 miles out of our way just to hit up some sweet hot Xoco action.  Once we arrived, the line was very nearly out the door. Friend 1 and Friend 2 were both all, "wow, the line isn't even that bad! It's a good thing we're having such a late lunch!" (it was 3:30pm approx) We def waited in this supposedly "not that bad" of a line for at least 45 minutes. Thank the lord baby jesus that they had the little water/lime station halfway down the line so we could stay hydrated, for Pete's sake! Personally, I was jonesin' for a margarita (see my review of Topolobampo for an explanation) and figured they MUST have margaritas at this establishment. No dice, my friends. Only beer (in terms of libations). Oh well, that works too. Sammy was delish, beer selection was good, ambiance was lovely. Not sure if I could have handled it at true lunch time, but maybe if I'm in the area some random weekday, I'll hit 'er up again.
