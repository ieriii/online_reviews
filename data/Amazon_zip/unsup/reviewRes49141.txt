5 stars for wine and cheese, 3 stars for the food and service equal a 4 star joint. I've been to Bin36 so many times throughout the years, usually upon my recommendation with friends, but I always end up leaving a bit disappointed. The service is usually just ok (typically slow ), but on the last visit we had a bloomspot deal for wine and cheese. We also ordered apps, entrees, and tons more wine, I just feel that because of the coupon, they treated us as an after-thought. And that is not cool, not when 2 people just spent $120 (not even counting the 32 we paid for the coupon). So here's my recommendation; make this either a pre-dinner or pre-event place. With the proximity to House of Blues or the Chicago Theater, go for some wine and cheese, and then you can save cash on the mediocre dinner you would have had. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with a meal of wine and cheese! Just drink a lot so the sloooow service doesn't bother you.
