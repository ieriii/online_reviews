Another one of my favorites. THe oliviah (something like that) salad is addicting. Its a potato salad with chicken and I cant get enough of it. Especially with that flat bread they give you, and the cheese, love it! The staff is really nice and I really enjoy my experience there. Everything i've tried i've loved. I love kabab's so I cant get enough of them. Plus its a cute neighborhood and I like driving or walking by. If you dont drive, the brown line kedzie stop is ..I think one block away. So its very convenient.
