I love this place and the food. The price is higher compare to other hot dog places, but it's worth it. I take my out-of-town family there to experience the drive through. I love the whole retro look to the place and the dog is quality meat. The pickeled tomato is so good. I like the effervescence with pineapple. It comes with a wafer cookie too. I have to watch myself to not over eat when I go there.
