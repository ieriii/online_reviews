I love everything about this place - the decor, the atmosphere, the service and the food! My favorite appetizer is the Goi Cuon summer rolls that are made with shrimp, bean sprouts, mint, vermicelli noodles, with a peanut plum sauce. They are the best! The other dish that Le Colonial does excellently is the bouillabaisse (sup do bien) with a coconut, saffron, lemongrass broth filled with lobster, mussels, shrimp, scallops, & whitefish. This has the best all around flavor of any seafood soup I have ever eaten. It is my very favorite!
