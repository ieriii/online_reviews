I must say that I have been wanting to eat at Graham for quite awhile but have not wanted to commit to the dinner and spend the cash. Now that I finally have I will say it was worth every penny.  I made my reservation via open table so that was painless and easy. We arrived at 7pm on a Friday and were delighted to see that the place was busy but not crazy, seats open at the bar to wait for our 3rd and we were seated immediately upon her arrival.  Our server was nice, well informed and I love that they all wear jeans with the cute blazers, no snobby servers to be found. If you ask where the bathroom is they will walk you all the way there and there is also a family bathroom for those dining with little ones. We had the 5 course tasting menu after finding out that no only could we add a course or more to it but also that I could swap the Jidori chicken for the Halibut for only $5! (this is free if you have a dietary restriction) The ceaser was delicious, bisque awesome(I love the little marshmallow), Jidori chicken absolutely perfect, we added the Carolina shrimp, bison was good and ended with the flour less chocolate cake and french press coffee.  Overall with drinks our bill was around $115 per person which I thought was more than reasonable, the food was delicious and we were quite full afterward despite the small portions that come with fine dining.
