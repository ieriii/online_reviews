I would give The Gage four stars, but when I brought my parents here while they were visiting, my father got TERRIBLE food poisoning from the mussel dish. (Nothing says, "Look at the trendy and gourmet, yet oh-so-approachable cuisine of my city!" quite like the dry heaves.) Apart from that, The Gage is a great place -- good beers on tap, and unique gastropub fare. I had a open-faced short rib sandwich with artisanal cheese and green apple, and YUM. The atmosphere was refined yet casual, and if I hadn't moved, I would be interested in going back to try more from the eclectic menu despite my dad's bad experience.
