I've been here twice and both times very happy with the burgers. I decided not to stray from the burger on my second visit because it was so good. The fries that come My only complaint about this place is the difficulty in having a conversation. Its too loud and I had trouble hearing the waiter and hostess. All in all, still loving the food, plus I can talk when I leave. Plus who has time to talk when your mouth is full.
