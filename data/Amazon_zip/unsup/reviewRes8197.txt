I've been to Spacca Napoli once and I had a decent experience. I am not going to rant and rave because the 388 people behind me have done an excellent job at doing so. And I won't pretend that I know what half the menu actually meant. The restaurant itself it was very classy on the inside and we were seated promptly. I believe it was on a Sunday afternoon and it was moderately busy. We sat at a table for two and waited about 10 minutes without anyone noticing us. We got the attention of a busser which escalated up to head chef (maybe the owner) who was walking around the dining area. Our server was definitely busy, not lazy, and came to our attention shortly there after. The service was fine after this fact. It was not a deal breaker either as we were in no hurry. And the upper echelon offered us a glass of wine for the wait. Pleased to see they cared about our overall experience. As for the food... We started with the prosciutto and arugula topped with olive oil. It was a light and fresh starter. And for the entree we had the Funghi pizza which was a very traditional pizza native to Italy (or so I was informed). Mozzarella, basil and mushrooms - simple yet delicious. It definitely shied away from the Chicago style pizza which was a nice change of pace.  Sad to say they only had Italian beer. I was looking for something besides the following: Peroni, Moretti, Moretti La Rossa and Menabrea. I understand trying to keep the authenticity up but I think they might want to cater to the crowd. Overall this place had great food. A bit pricey for my liking but then again I would consider this fine dining. If you are looking for a true Italian night out look no further than this joint on the North side.
