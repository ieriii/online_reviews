Decided to come here on the recommendation from the cuz. Said the dry spice chicken was to die for. It was tough walking around Chinatown Chicago trying to decide--I'd wanted to try another seafood place. In the middle of winter. As someone from LA. Honestly, I had low expectations -- not cause i"m a snob but because a LOT of people kept telling me not to expect much from the chinatown here.  I walked in for a brief moment, I was transported back to HK as the waft of the offering hit me... it's the smell of authenticity. I think? Okay, maybe I am a snob.  I ordered the combination chowmein and the spicy chicken. Both were pretty good. Lots of ginger, garlic, dry chilies in the fried, then sauteed chicken. The chowmein were the deep fried thick ones I'm used to from childhood. The combination meats, seafood and vegetable with sauce that came with it was both great in flavor, consistency, and freshness.
