I have never seen such Small 5 star rooms and we paid a junior suite with no view. Upgraded to another suite in West side of building, this one was much nicer and more spacious with a wonderful view.  The hotel has 5 star service, but the rooms are average and don't offer that luxury or classy feeling for the price (beds are super comfy). Room service food was good, we especially loved our breakfast. Our room was quiet and felt like we were in a different hotel, until ppl checked in next door, we heard their entire conversation (luckily it didn't last long, unfortunately their snoozing of the alarm at 3am did). I would book again if I was a business traveler, visiting or having family in, but not a romantic (it was my partners bday) stay. Also avoid Nataly at the check-in desk. Shes a bit grumpy, rude and needs some sleep...but i guess we all have our off days
