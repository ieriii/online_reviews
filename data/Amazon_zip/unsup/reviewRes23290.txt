I totally agree with Caitlin's review. I just moved here from Houston, and looking for a fix comparable to the excellent Niko Niko, I trusted Yelpers to not lead me astray. BAD YELPERS! I'm a bit of an eater so I had a few dishes. The gyros meat was almost flavorless. I was SO disappointed. Had been drooling all day, dreaming of savory gyros meat. The potatoes were alright but not up to the flavor punch of buttery lemony goodness delivered by Niko Niko's. The moussaka was thankfully quite good but not great enough to rescue the rest of my dinner. Greek salad was passable but not among the top 50% of those I've had before. I must note that perhaps I wasn't swayed by the ambience as I got the food for takeout and didn't eat in. That said, I was there as they brought it out and literally live two minutes away so it's not as though the food was cold. The atmosphere of the place did look fun and festive, but I can't be swayed by this. The flavor must be there! I also witnessed a bit of a verbal altercation between the cashier and a couple waiting nearby to be seated. I can't say what started it but the couple seemed unwilling to engage, and the cashier seemed a bit snide. She was very prompt in checking me out, if a bit brusque. All told, I probably would hit up one of the other Greek places in the area next time. Ahhh, Niko Niko, I miss you!!
