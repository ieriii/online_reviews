Complaint #1 - Why does serving offal in Chicago correlate to prices that are at least 33% higher than they should be? I'd accept this as a tax for exceptional food, but none of us were wowed. Complaint #2 - Sharing plates are great, but get frustrating when the portions are this small. Exception seems to be the trough of chicken. On the plus side, I sat a few chairs down at a shared table from the guitarist for Anthrax last night... so I got that going for me.
