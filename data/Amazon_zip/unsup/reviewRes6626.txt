Let me first say, I don't like BBQ, so going to q on a Saturday night was not my choice and I had rather low expectations of my meal (and high expectations of leaving hungry). But guess what? I find myself giving the place five stars because it was a wonderful surprise of delicious food and savory sauces that opened my eyes to a new BBQ world. I ordered the smoked half chicken and would highly recommend it with the mustard sauce (although you can't go wrong with any of the four sauces they bring to the table.) My friend, being the manly dude that he is, proudly ordered the full stack of ribs and within minutes, there wasn't a crumb left on his plate, except for the cornbread....it was a huge, thick piece of fresh spongy cornbread and even he couldn't finish it. The atmosphere varies. There's rather romantic lighting and high tops in the front by the bar, which is good for a date or a small group of friends. The back of the restaurant is more casual with traditional tables suited for larger, boisterous groups. Bottom line...get to q and enjoy the way BBQ should be done.
