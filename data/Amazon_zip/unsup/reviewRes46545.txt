I had eaten here once before a couple years ago and remembered liking it. When I found a LEYE gift card in my desk drawer with some money still left on it, I suggested to Jessica R that we come here for our long overdue lunch date. We were seated pretty much right away in a booth across from the bar. Our server was fine (just fine - I remember having awesome service the last time I was here), the drinks were pretty good, but the food... was just eh. We both ordered burgers, and the server mentioned they came with cottage fries. I didn't know what those were, but I remembered liking the shoestring-like fries the last time, so I went with it. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time for the lunch rush, and we both dug in. The burger was pretty good, but the "cottage fries" were more like homemade potato chips. I did not love them. Some of them were soft and tasted like fries, while most of them were a tad overcooked and were just... gross. While our server was just fine, we were seated across from the "soda jerk" and the bar well, so other servers were constantly back and forth. When a couple of them started discussing the details of a TV show I watch that had aired the previous night but I hadn't yet watched, I covered my ears and started saying "LA LA LA LA LA LA LA!!!" One of them found this amusing and started telling me made up things about the show. It was good fun, and it reminded me that their servers are generally pretty awesome. This experience + my previous experience = 3 stars. I wish it could have been more... Maybe some day, but honestly I'm not going out of my way to rush back here anytime soon.
