Pizza was average at best. Dry and doughy. Also if you want to order something other than "by the slice" it's a 45 minute wait. No ambiance at all...... Basically a strip mall joint with cheap tables and zero decor. If this is the "best" pizza in Chicago I'll go to Jets Pizza instead and know that the pizza will be fresh!
