This is what all Gastropubs should aspire to be. Yah the wait was long, quoted 2 hours?!? But we ended up waiting about an hour and fifteen and it was worth it. Ordered a shit load of food because I eat a lot and was real hungry. Started with: Pork Belly Confit- Real amazing. One of the best pork belly preparations I have ever had, if not the best. Just perfect. Pastrami sweetbreads- came with saurkraut and russian dressing. So fatty, tender and decadent. Again, one of the best preparations of sweetbreads I have had. Just an explosion of flavors! Skirt steak with short rib raviolo- The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare and had a great smokey flavor. Very tender and a delicious piece of meat. The raviolo was also delicious, just wish there were ten of them! Between my brother and I we ordered three desserts. Warm Gruyere Donuts- Damn good donuts with the goat cheese. Get it! Rice Pudding- Rice pudding was kind of funky. Definitely different. Probably wouldn't get it again, but if you like rice pudding, by all means...... Banana and toffee english pudding- tasted like the best banana bread ever. Black pepper panna cotta was unique and went perfectly with the cake and bananas. Loved it Overall Longman and Eagle blew my mind. The food was almost shockingly good and the service and drink list are unmatched. The wait may be long, but I can confidently say that it is totally worth it. Its a Gastropub and they have a fucking michelin star. Badass
