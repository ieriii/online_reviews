We had dinner there friday for my bday, and was pleased with the services but im sorry to say that today we found out the restaurant charged our account 2 times, one on friday and then again on monday. my BF called about 10am and there no answer, i called and was told that a manager would call me back at noon. when we received no call back by 1pm, my BF called again and was told that the manager was too busy to talk to him and all they could give us was a transaction number that we already knew from the receipt. we were a party of 4 and our bill was over $300. VERY DISAPPOINTED in the management and will not ne recommending this place to anyone.
