Had a great stay at the Fairmont! Hotel was spotless. Reservations desk was friendly and very prompt. Room was clean, airy and bright with great views of a park and the lake. Towels were fresh, bed and pillows were plush. Bathroom had a wonderful rain shower. Walking distance to Millennium Park, Macys and all the other downtown spots.
