What a view! Stayed here last night and it was less expensive than my stay @ Hyatt Place in the 'burbs. Very attentive service starting from the bellman waiting for the cabs to help you check in to the breakfast crew servers. I also got a $10 credit to the spa or restaurant when I checked in, not sure if this came with every room or reservation. The BEST part is the breathtaking views from the balcony. Request a room with a balcony! As many times as I've been to Chicago, I still paused just getting out of the elevator and admired the views. It reminded me of the Signature Room on the 95th floor. Besides the floor to ceiling windows, the room includes free wi-fi, a 24 hour fitness center with a cool TRX-ish weight pulley system, ipod dock with good speakers, and Keurig machine.  If they could do something about the noise level, it would be 5 stars. Yes, the hotel is in the city so you expect to hear trains, sirens, etc., but the noise I heard was the ice machine and people walking in the hallway. It was loud enough to wake you up at night but not constant enough to keep you up. I met my co-worker for breakfast (their 3 ingredient omelet and potatoes are very tasty) and he mentioned how loud the hotel was too. It's still an awesome hotel. I usually stay at the Public hotel and will pick Dana hotel next time.
