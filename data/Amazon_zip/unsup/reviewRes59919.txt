Alliance created the most wonderful 40 cupcakes for my baby shower. My favorite was the red velvet, but the vanilla, chocolate and carrot cake were also amazing. This is a great place to cater your dessert bar or to stop in for a quick bite. They have great teas for enjoying in their too-cool sidewalk area.
