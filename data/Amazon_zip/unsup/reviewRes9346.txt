Went here for a special occassion double birthday and they couldn't have been nicer. We made reservations for a Saturday night and were seated right away. The room was packed but not annoying. Cocktails are amazing and you can totally spend WAY too much money on them. But seriously, they were homemade, creative, and tasty. The four of us had a prix fixe dinner. One diner was a vegetarian but wanted some of the fish options that were on the meat/prix fixe dinners. Sprout's answer to this? NO PROBLEM! How amazing to find a restaurant willing to accomodate diners. Each course was amazing. I do not like paying top dollar for sup-par food, and I assure you, everything was beautiful, creative and blew us away. One course after another surprized us. We had tons of courses and then were rewarded with many 'birthday' desserts afterwards. The desserts were, in my opinion, just OK. The focus was definitely on the entrees. The room is lovely, the waitstaff attentive and professional, and the flavors cannot be beat. i wish we could go more often, but the price just isn't doable for us more than once a year. Prix Fixe is the way to go, as I can see it getting super pricey otherwise. Stupendous.
