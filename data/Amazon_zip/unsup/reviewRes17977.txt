I love this place! Gorgeous decor, great ambiance, funky old music, amazing bartenders and the best cocktail this town has to offer. I love that they don't allow the place to get filled up. Everyone has a seat so there is often a line to get in. Drink-making is an art at this establishment and only the best bartenders are hired. A round of drinks for you and 3 friends might take them 10 minutes but it's fun to watch them take fresh ingredients, drops of secret ingredients from little eyedropper bottles, even egg whites, to come up with a drink that is utterly delicious. They organize their drink menu by the type of alcohol and what I have found fun is to pick a drink from a category that you normally don't like: say Brandy or Gin. Order it up and it will literally be the best drink you have ever had in your life. Really! I swear. Go check it out. You'll feel like you have slipped back in time.
