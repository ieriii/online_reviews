saw graham elliot on top chef masters. liked his creativity & style, and the fact he was tatted up. i CLASSIFY as: upscale casual. the FOOD: was good. everything tasted great, and the combinations of ingredients were really interesting & surprising; traditionally "junk food," items paired with/ accentuating traditionally finer dining items. The portions were a good size too, tapas style to share. the ATMOSPHERE: was nicely decorated, but felt a little too busy in the loud music & louder conversations, though I think that's the mood they strive for...a casual chummy eatery. the SERVICE: was just ok. good enough not to piss me off, but nothing to write home about. the PRICE: around what you would expect for something of this caliber All in all, it was a great meal, I would recommend others to try, perfect for a dressier casual date.
