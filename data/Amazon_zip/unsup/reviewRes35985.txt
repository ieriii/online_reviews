We were starving when we arrived in Chicago, fresh off of the train. We found this place and were excited to try both a breakfast and lunch option to split. It sounded perfect for a 10:45 a.m. meal. Unfortunately this never happened. We were met at the door by the incredibly rude hostess who's first words were, "You're going to need to leave your bags at the door." Not a 'hi' or "hello," no greeting. **On a side note, being so close to do many transportation hubs, it should be expected that people will have luggage of some sort. It's a breakfast joint, and we had two shoulder bags with us. It's not like we tried to drag huge rolling luggage into a fine dining establishment, but that is beyond the point. Once we gave up our bags, I asked to be seated in within an eye shot of my bags because we were forced to store them under a lobby bench. She reluctantly sat us close to them. We were never greeted. A busser finally brought us waters. Another server pointed us out to what I assumed to be our flustered server, but she just looked at us and let put a huge sigh, then proceeded to grab a large tray of condiments to take to her 6 top and explain in detail what each was. She then proceeded to take their order, still without acknowledging us. I thought for sure she would say "hello" as she walked by to put their order in the computer, but she didn't. The order must have been extensive because she was at the computer for quite sometime. She then disappeared into the kitchen at which point my boyfriend and I got up to leave. We walked passed the horrible hostess and crawled on the floor to grab our belongings. No one offered to help. The hostess turned up her nose and didn't mutter a word as we walked out. The hostess was pretentious and this place attempts to be something more than it is.... There were kids in torn sweatshirts there and yet we were shunned for our shoulder bags.
