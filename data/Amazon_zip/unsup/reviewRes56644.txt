6 words - TRUFFLE EGG TOAST, TO DIE FOR!!! I have been here twice and can't wait to go again. It's all about a memorable dish that brings me back. I have dreams about their truffle egg toast!!!! I love going out to eat!!!! The truth is that we have so many places to try in Chicago. It's nice to go to places that know what they are doing with food, service and overall ambiance. You can taste the love and passion in their food. It's amazing! And dying to try the Sea Urchin Pasta. The last time I went they were out. You must go. Once you do, you will be planning your return. Not kidding.
