What a fun, interesting place. It's not haute cuisine, but it is a fun, adventurous take on the gastropub with upward mobility. The funny thing is, I saw people go in there with shorts and t-shirts I wouldn't clean my bathtub with. Without trying to come off as a snob, I asked the waitress what the code was, and she said Chef Elliot wanted everyone to experience his restaurant. I thought that was nicely put, though it made me wish I had worn my jeans instead of my other, fancier duds. As for the food, there were playful adaptations of a buffalo wing (thigh meat with a zesty buffalo sauce and slaw made of celery root, plus Budweiser foam) and a good risotto made with, of all things, Cheez-Its. Fun and not forced -- I like that kind of imagination. The entrees we had were all good, starting with my lamb and lentil dish that was herby, tender and pretty memorable. Before your meal, the chef served flavored popcorn; on our night, it was "malt vinegar," which only added to the British pub-meets-fine dining feel. Both desserts were tasty, too. Overall, it was a very good experience with excellent service. Think of it as gourmet casual.
