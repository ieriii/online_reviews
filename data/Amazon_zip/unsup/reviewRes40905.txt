When I was in high school and college and would flip through Architectural Digest or Bon Appetite, I would see pictures of happy, healthy, well-dressed, interesting, and apparently affluent people eating dishes with amazingly long names that were comprised of insanely-paired herbs and flavors. I thought, one day, I'll be like those people. I'll have figured everything out and will be able to spend my days and nights looking good and sharing wonderful stories about my amazingly interesting life and listening to my adorable, intelligent friends tell me about their lives. Since then I've figured out that no one ever quite has it all figured out. But, whenever I want to pretend to be as accomplished and beautiful as my teenaged self aspired to be, I can go to Bon Soiree with a group of friends, and have a BYO-Mimosa with the truffle and mushroom omelette. Slightly pretentious, but ultimately worth it for the change of pace and the aforementioned truffle omelette.
