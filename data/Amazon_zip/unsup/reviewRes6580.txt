I live in the neighborhood and have walked by q for over a year now. I've been dying to go and last night I did! It was a great atmosphere, love how they give you pickles and bbq chips when you sit down, but our waiter... was WASTED!!! It took about 45 minutes to get a bud light and then the beer brought out wasn't even the right one but we just took it because we'd already waited a while for a beer.... the most disturbing part about it was her co-workers and management continued to let her work in her drunken state. I work in hospitality and was referred by our concierge and I'm going to have a hard time referring future guests here if this is how they allow business to run. Aside from that the food wasn't bad. It was cold... probably because our waiter was so drunk and forgot about it... but not bad overall. Not sure if I'll be back. So disappointing because I've been waiting a year to visit :/
