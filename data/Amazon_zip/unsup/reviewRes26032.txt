It seems like a lot of people who went here really enjoyed their experience. While I think the food here was definitely adequate, Simply It disappointed me in what has become my one single measuring stick for all vietnamese restaurants: pho. The $6.50 bowl of pho here was not quite what I was hoping for. The broth just straight up didn't feel like it had been simmering for hours with lots of fresh and interesting spices. It felt thrown together from some swanson's with a heavy dose of garlic powder. I can't help but compare any bowl of pho I ever have to that of my local standard, Hai Yen. The bowl of pho at Simply It was significantly smaller, with less broth, less chicken, and significantly fewer rice noodles, and it just plain didn't taste as good. Don't get me wrong... it was still pho. But it was not all the pho that it could be. Additionally the plastic chopsticks made the rice noodles significantly harder to eat than with nice wooden 'sticks. I guess I'd come back and try some of the other items people on here have recommended. Also the summer roll we had for an appetizer was quite tasty. But if you're a vietnamese place and you can't do pho right...
