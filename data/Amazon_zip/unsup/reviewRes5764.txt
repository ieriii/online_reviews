I had made a reservation to celebrate a graduation with friends. We arrived 30 minutes early. We were seated after giving our information to the host....awesome. The Chicago location was packed on a Friday night. They had five martinis for $5....all three of us opted for the Lite Long Islands-very good and they went well with the appetizers and dinners we ordered. Quick recap of the dinner....My prime rib was extra fatty...meh...I iike a little fat, but my friend ordered the same thing and mine looked very different in the fat department. The red mashed - awesome, broccoli -nasty the seasoned butter that accompanied it had separated and almost tasted watered down, au-graten potatoes were just bad, the lamb was cooked correct but extremely salty. Calamari with sauces - very good. Caesar salad was delicious. The other salad (garden) was gross and sent back. The key lime pie - i've had better, too much whipped cream, but the cream was a thick consistency. A complimentary flourless cake for the guest of honor was super and a nice surprise. Dirty dishes left behind by previous diners....not cool and really gross since they were hidden under clean plates. Not a good way to start out the meal. Drinks (cocktails) remained empty for a long time before being asked if we would like more. I understand you were busy on a Friday, but this should be automatic especially when serves are just congregating in corners. Only half-price appetizers if you sit at the bar. I am giving this place a 4 because setting up the reservation and questions asked via email were promptly addressed and answered. I have been here before and it has been a fantastic experience. For groups of 6 or more you can set up a kind of price fixed meal and have menus printed up for the guest of honor with the menu listed....it is a nice touch...I wish this evening in particular had been as special as the times I had celebrated here before.
