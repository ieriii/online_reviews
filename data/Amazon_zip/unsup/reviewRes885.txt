Hot diggity, dog ziggity, boooooooom. I heard about Hot Doug's long before my arrival in Chicago. I was also warned about the ridiculously long wait to enter into an eatery where people were shuffling in and out like cattle. The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage's reputation precedes itself. This frankfurter is so rich that after one bite you will think you're Bill Gates. After waiting 1.5 hours, many in my group decided to get a second sausage just so the wait would be "worth it." For my second entree I got the Norm Crosby, a brat made of beef, pork and garlic. This was just humdrum. The duck fat fries are good but I've had better elsewhere. You get a basketful, so share it with a couple of buddies. Would I wait that long again? I would wait about 60 minutes for the Hot Doug's wieners. If one second ticks pass that, you'll hear me complaining like a little school boy.
