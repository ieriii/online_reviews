I've been here a couple of times, and the pizza really is delicious. (Connecticut-style?) They offer a wonderful variety of specialty toppings, on a crust that isn't greasy nor dry (a virtual anomaly in Chicago). That said, Piece really isn't a place to eat alone, otherwise you'll end up having to pay around $18 for 3-4 meals. A small is pretty large:). They also offer moderately-priced Microbrews, some with a seasonal flair.
