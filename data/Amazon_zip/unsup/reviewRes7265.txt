Aww man yelp. So here's the background story. My hotel was in the area, and I wanted to eat somewhere AMAZING. And with all the 300+ yelp reviews and 4.5 star average, I thought, this was definitely a winner. I think its definitely a hit or miss.  FOOD: Lobster Ravioli - it tasted great, but I didn't think that it was worth the overall price. I wasn't 4.5 starred by it. It was good, but I guess I was hoping for something amazing that would make me want to eat there for breakfast lunch and dinner.  PRICE: Its $$ which I know is between $11-30 but I would put this place more on $$ and a half range, because once you add drink and everything it comes out to more than 30 per person. I just felt that it was a lot of cash for not the experience I was hoping. AMBIENCE: Was great! I love the intimate setting, yet they had a tv at the bar with some espn (?) on. Great place to have a conversation, and for small parties. In summary, I'm sorry to rock the boat and say this was "A-OK", maybe I'll have a different experience if I ever make it back there.
