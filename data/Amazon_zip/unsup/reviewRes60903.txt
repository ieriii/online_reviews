I can honestly say this is one of the worst restaurants and most frustrating places that I have ever been to in Chicago. The food wasn't bad however good luck trying to get any and not too many choices. Understaffed but some of waiters were nice an apologetic cause they probably see the problems first hand, yet there are a number of bad attitudes in there which makes it hard to enjoy the atmosphere be it that it is nice. I'll give them the nice roof deck. If you plan on going, plan on waiting, waiting and waiting for bad service and food that is okay but not very much selection and at times cold. No good cuts of meat really either. Don't waste your time or money. My first and probably last review, not my style really but thought it was appropriate here.
