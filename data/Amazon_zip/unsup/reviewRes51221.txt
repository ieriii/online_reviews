A few months ago I gaveWishbone a 1 star review because of the nasty little hostess that was completely rude on my first visit to the restaurant. I vowed never to return, but last weekend, finding myself up and about at 9 AM, I decided to give brunch a second shot. The scene was completely opposite from last time I came in. We were seated right away. Instead of the hearing "whoooo" from frat boys at every corner of the restaurant, we heard babies. Seriously, every woman in there had a baby dangling beside her. I guess I'll take babies over drunk frat boys that early in the morning. As far as food went, I had salmon cakes which were dry. Cheese grits I had for the first time ever and it reminded me of something grandma used to force me to eat. The corn muffin was good. The Mississippi Mud drink I didn't even come close to finishing. So, food not so great, and I still can't get over my first experience trying to get a table there... 2 stars because I actually got to eat this time!
