I made a reservation for May 24 a month in advance. When I made the reservation, I made a special request to be seated in the main dining room (not on the patio). On Monday May 23, I called to confirm my reservation and reminded them that I requested seating in the main dining room. They confirmed they have noted my request. When I arrived there was no seating in the main dining room. They stuck me in a small crowded room that was SO LOUD, my in town guests and I were unable to have a conversation. I am done with Piccolo Sogno.
