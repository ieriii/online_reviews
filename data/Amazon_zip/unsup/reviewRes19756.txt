This place is really really good! They have all your favorite traditional rolls and then some really creative additions! It's really fresh sushi. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. Perfect spot for a date or dinner out with the girls. By the decor, I was super surprised that it is BYOB (as most BYOBs are a little dumpier). I am excited to go back to this place with more wine and an empty belly! PS The Coast in South Loop is equally as good - same menu - but not BYOB :(
