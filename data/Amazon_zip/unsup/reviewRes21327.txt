Love the vintage feel to Superdawg's as well as the cute packaging to the hot diggity dawgs. My bf picked up couple superdawgs to go, but it was just as tasty in its cute blue box. Way I ordered my superdawg: green relish, onions, pickle, and hot peppers. Love the pickled green tomato... for a sec, I thought it was a chopped up version of a pickle. Any food that is pickled, my taste buds can't get enough. Maybe it's the asian in me. Hello... fermented cabbage, pickled radish. :) The dawg is great, great crunch and size within that delicious toasted bun. I reiterate, I love the bun! Never tasted anything like it before. Buttery and toasted, onion goodness. So good that I had another superdawg. heheh get in my belly u plump dawg. As for the fries, it was hella addictive, but then again, I have a slight obsession with french fries and potatoes. Crimpy, medium sized morsels of fried starch. Yes please! I am a little upset at myself for being so lazy & not driving up to the joint. BUt next time, I will get my lazy arse out of the couch to experience the true, authenticity of this drive-in joint. HI----YA!!!
