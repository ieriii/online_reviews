I have been here twice. The first was a good experience but the second time I went, ugh! My girlfriend and I are not big meat eaters, typically indulging on seafood or vegetarian dishes. At first we thought this place would be great for us... We ordered the vegetarian moussaka and the garides. The moussaka was good and I could come here again for that. We could tell it was premade and just warmed up for us since there were pockets of extreme hot and then slightly warm. Just like when you eat a hotpocket straight out of the microwave. The garides is a shrimp dish in a tomato and feta sauce served over rice. The sauce they make seriously tasted like something out of a high school cafeteria. There were no herbs or spices, just tomato sauce and feta over rice. The dishes are a la carte, no sides, no starters, no soup, no salad. Hmmm, 15 dollars for tomato sauce and rice and I can't even get a cup of soup!? I would understand if I ordered a gyro, but a 'authentic shrimp dish' should come with at least one side like every other greek restaurant I have been to. The first time I was here with my mom and she raved about the lamb, so that's why it has 2 stars and not just 1. The atmosphere is really nice and the service is good. If only the kitchen could get their dishes up to the quality of a 15 dollar dish.
