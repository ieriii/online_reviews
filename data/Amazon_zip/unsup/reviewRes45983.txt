I love this restaurant. The first time I ate here was actually in Las Vegas!!! I immediately fell in love with the Joe's Omelet which was loaded with spinach, ground beef, mushrooms (no mushrooms for me) and cheese. The French toast is also one of a kind, light, buttery and completely wonderful. They said that the batter is actually a creme brule!! But lately, I've been going there during the week days where they do NOT offer breakfast but I do partake in the lunch special. I have Lunch Pasta & Salad which is a lunch portion of Pasta and a Small House Salad. Your Choice of Pasta Pomodoro, Pasta Fresca or Pasta Telephono. To wash it all down I have the strawberry lemonade as my beverage. yum yum!
