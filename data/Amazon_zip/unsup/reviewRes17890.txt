There has been a cocktail revival in the past 10 years, and places like Pegu Club in NYC, and Violet Hour, set the standard for well-made cocktails. The cocktails at Violet Hour are made with fresh ingredients, mixed to the proper proportions, and served elegantly.  The service at Violet Hour is friendly, cheerful, while also very professional.  The setting of Violet Hour is exquisite inside, and a real treat for a special date. We had a wonderful evening last night, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit. A magicial evening.
