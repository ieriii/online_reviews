I think Carnival is a very nice venue for special events, and the food is great, as long as you understand that is a fusion of different Latin dishes, so its really not authentic to any Latin specific culture. I would suggest that they remove of the American actresses pictures on the front, and replace them with some celebrities of Hispanic heritage so that it makes more sense, I mean try to stick to an specific region at least! Great mojitos, and good music at all times, the only thing is that is a little big for my taste, but I would certainly recommend it since there are not many great options in Chicago for Latin (non mexican) restaurants in Chicago.
