The wife and I squeezed in a stop here for lunch when we were in town for her business trip / our pizza extravaganza. She couldn't quite get away long enough to wait for the pizza to come out (which takes 45 minutes to cook--longer if they're busy), but we shared a good garlic bread appetizer and a good Goose Island beer. We ordered a small supreme (sausage, onions, green peppers, mushrooms), but I'm pretty sure we were served a cheese and sausage on accident. At least I hope we were--if there were any veggies in there, I sure couldn't find them. Still, great pizza and not a big deal--the sausage is the main attraction anyway. When you get sausage, you can choose sausage crumbles (like you typically see on pizza) or one sausage patty covering the whole pizza. We went for the patty, which I definitely recommend. The sausage itself is great, which is good, because the patty makes it the star of the show, even overshadowing the crust. Speaking of, the cornmeal crust is very good. I love cornbread, so I was probably predisposed to liking it, but I thought it was great--crunchy and really tasty. Sauce is good as well, but the crust and sausage are the stars of the show. Even after an hour in a to-go box, my wife's half was great--it helps of course that the sausage holds up really well. The small is a great size for two people--not as overwhelmingly huge as Giordano's, but more than you can comfortably finish for lunch if you get any sort of appetizer while you wait.
