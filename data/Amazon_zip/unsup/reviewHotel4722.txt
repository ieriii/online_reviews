My girlfriend and I stayed here in a Queen room. We give high marks to the excellent Desk, Bell, and Spa staff. The hotel was also very clean, but overall we can't give it more than 2.5 stars and will seek other accommodations next time. We were underwhelmed. This hotel looks good, but it does have some questionable design issues that are worth mentioning...1) There are too many rooms built on each floor resulting in tiny, awkward spaces. Charming for some maybe, but not very comfortable for the price. Our tiny room was crammed into a corner with several other small rooms. They might have been better off building two larger rooms there and doubling the price. 2) There was no closet, just a small rack open to the room. 3) The bathroom and shower had very little space on which to set things, and the sink faucet was too short. You could barely even wash your hands under it. 4) We had to ask for normal sized pillows instead of the small, square ones that were on the bed. 5) The thermostat and temperature were difficult to keep regulated, and the system was fairly noisy.In short, if you're looking for amenities that go beyond the minimum, keep looking. But if the price is right, and you need a decent place to stay with professional and friendly staff, go for it.
