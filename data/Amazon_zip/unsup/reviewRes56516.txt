As an avid traveler, I am a huge fan of trying new foods. Living near Chicago, it is never hard to make it to some of the top restaurants the city has to offer. Frontera Grill is hands-down my favorite Mexican restaurant and one of my favorite restaurants of all of the countries I've eaten food in. Aside from the Rick Bayless factor, the restaurant does not disappoint except for one factor. Reservations. This highly reputable restaurant does not take reservations and the lunch rush during the workweek wraps around the block at times. Now that I'm done complaining about that, I can go on to describing this insanely delicious experience. There is nothing I love more than chips, salsa, and guacamole. At Frontera, you are greeted with the freshest made guacamole with seasonings straight from Mexico and I'm not kidding either. Mr. Bayless takes his staff once a year to Mexico to explore new fusions of seasonings and vegetables to create new dishes. For my entre, I ordered the Flautas de Carnitas and outstanding does not do it justice. These crispy, homemade tacos were filled with pork, roasted poblano peppers, a tomato sauce with green chile, and its key ingredient: pineapple. Finally it was topped with fresh arugula, a perfect addition to the mix of flavors. The sweet and spicy contrast hit all points on the taste spectrum. I left the restaurant feeling fully content, and fully full.
