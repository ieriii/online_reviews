wakamano is pretty good, but it still left me wanting more. Granted, I got takeout from here so I didn't have the chance to order up some more stuff, but that's just how it was. I needed to itch a sushi scratch and so I called them up for takeout soon after they opened. They said 15 minutes, well, it was faster than that (and fine by me). I wasn't in as big of a roll mood and I wanted to focus more on pieces of fish. I got some hamachi and king crab. The hamachi was very good and they did a good job of giving me two nice pieces of crab. The cut of hamachi wasn't as big as I was expecting though. It was a bit of a bummer and there wasn't that much rice with it too. Still, it's hamachi and that is always a good thing for me. While I did say that I wasn't in as big of a roll mood, that doesn't mean that I didn't order up some maki rolls. I got some spicy tuna and the sauce that was with it was really good. It had enough heat for me to notice it but not be overbearing. The tuna was pretty good, but it wasn't the best that I've had. The rolls were also on the smaller side as well. Wakamono is pretty good. While I enjoyed what I had, I was wanting for more from the portions. Hard to complain as the prices were pretty good for the fish, but all I kept thinking is that I should've ordered more or that I should be more filled.
