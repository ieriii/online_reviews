I stayed here during the summer of '11! It was a fantastic hotel. The restaurants included were also delicious. Although, the breakfast staff were a little rude. However, the staff at the front desk were amazing and so helpful! This hotel was right in the heart of Chicago. Lots to do and lots to eat in walking distance. Very clean!!!
