Mmmmmm truffle parmesan popcorn. Mmmmmm foie gras lollipop. Huhhhhhh never-ending creamsicle smoothie-shot amuse bouche thing...? Tasting menu + pairings = tasty, with some off-the-menu surprises thrown in. Perhaps for a Michelin-rated restaurant I should write a *slightly* more eloquent review, but ...nah. It's worth mentioning that I actually brought my DSLR to take pictures (not because I'm an Asian tourist, but because food photography with a nice lens is just so much fun!) and really just forgot to take any during the course of the dinner. This may not be exclusively a function of the food being awesome, but I'll grant it some credit. Music selection was also pretty good (take your average hip 20-something's iPod, put it on shuffle, bam), though it was kind of hard to hear people over it.
