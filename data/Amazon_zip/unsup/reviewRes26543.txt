Great experience. We arrived 45 minutes early to enjoy a wine flight. Whoever is doing the wines should be given a 5 star. The wine flights were exceptional. We had the white wine flight at the bar. Our waiter was fantastic. He knew his wines. We had a great discussion on the varietals. Not only that, he gave us a taste of a unique wine from the Basque region. A great start to an exciting evening. Our table was ready at exactly the time we made our reservation. The hostess could not have been more accomodating. The upstairs dining room was right out of an Almadovor movie--it felt modern Spain. I like being able to choose my tapas. You must have the lima and fava bean with Serrano ham and cheese--fresh herbs and a tasty vinagrette. The bread with tomato topping (much like a bruschetta) was tasty and fresh. The barramundi fish tapa was sparkingly fresh. Its creamy texture and crisp skin was perfect. The pulpus (octopus) and potatoes was very tasty spiced with smoked paprika. We finished up with the short ribs and diver scallops--very rich and delicious. The staff could not be more attentive. It is difficult on timing in a large restaurant. Some dishes came too soon. The staff had no problem in returning them and bringing a new plate later in the meal. I am looking forward to coming back and having more of their exceptional tapas and interesting and exciting wines.
