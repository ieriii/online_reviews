*shudder* For a moment I thought I was in Lincoln Park. But nope. I am deep in the 30s in Bridgeport. Who's going here? It wasn't super busy for a Friday night. We started out with drinks (natch) and I got them to make me a caipirinha, which was very good. Their selection of special drinks were rather inventive. Then onto the good. I had the burger. A $9 burger. And it was good, but at $9 I needed a whole lot more than good. Oh, I am sure the cows were bread for this restaurant and went had Sterns and Foster-lined stalls, but damn. The other item of note was the homemade potato chips and cheese sauce. It was scrumptious. So this is definitely good eats but seems very out of place. Worth checking out in the summer after a gallery walk down Halsted. It seems to be positioned perfectly for it.
