I'll admit. I'm a bad little Greek girl. I've never had gyros. Well, that's mostly because I'm vegetarian (have been since high school), but also my mom, the cook in the family, isn't Greek, so her recipes lean more toward the German/Irish-meat-and-potatoes persuasion. Anyway, now I have. Thank you Chicago Diner, for the Super-Gyros. Could've used some hummus, though.
