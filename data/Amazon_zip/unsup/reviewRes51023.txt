This place is great if you're looking for something a little different then you typical American grill. I randomly stopped in this place on a Friday night around 7:30pm. We were seated right away, which was a nice surprise given the night and time. The menu isn't huge and if you're a burger and fries type of person, you might be hard-pressed to find something that really speaks to you (they do have a burger on the menu, but it's topped with all sorts of "fussy" toppings). I have to admit, I was a little intimidated by some of my choices. After looking the menu over several times, we decided to forgo entrees altogether and order several appetizers instead (I'm so glad we did). The server, who was very friendly and completely open to talk us through our choices, suggested we try the crab cakes. She also made several other recommendations based on their popularity. As a result we also ordered the fritters and the frog legs to go with the crab cakes. All the dishes arrived hot and every last one of them was delicious (even the frog legs...which I still can't believe I ate). This place is slightly on the pricier side of the fence but the food is delicious, the ambiance is nice and it's something a little different then all the rest.
