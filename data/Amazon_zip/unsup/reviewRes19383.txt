I've tried alot of sushi places around this town, and I keep coming back to Coast as my favorite. I think I'm going to stop going elsewhere, and just make the drive to Wicker Park and enjoy all the remaining sushi meals I will have while on this planet. This place is by far the most reasonably priced for the quality, variety, and friendly attentive waitstaff. I LOVE the white dragon roll, the white tuna carpaccio with jalapeno and cilantro, and their soft shell crab. You stand out Coast, in a sea of sushi places, you are the shark!!
