Hot Doug's is the one and only sausage emporium in Chicago! Outstanding every time. I don't fault the johnny-come-lately (which we won't mention here) in Humboldt Park for joining the sausage-themed herd, but they have a lot to learn from the likes of Hot Doug. This place is so good I'm surprised there aren't a whole lot more sausage emporiums in Chicago, being such a food town, other than your typical beef shack. Thanks, Hot Dougie. We love you.
