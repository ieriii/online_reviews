The "Great" Graham Elliot... the only person who will tell you he's great is himself. The restaurant was fair. The cesear was good. The Crab Cake good. The entree so small that you felt like you needed a Dr. there to tell you to bend over and cough. The service was horrible. The staff, well, very pretentious. Overall, I would never go back there. And I do mean never. This just reaffirmed me that Graham Elliot and his restaurants suck. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere good like David Burke or Crofton on Wells.
