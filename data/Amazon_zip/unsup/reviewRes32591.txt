I went to Demera three days ago with my sister, brother - in - law and my boyfriend. I had purchased a groupon and did not know what to expect going in. We all were pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything was. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends. Another note, since eating without utensils is the norm there the restrooms are all "hands free" including the doors. We had a great experience and will be returning.
