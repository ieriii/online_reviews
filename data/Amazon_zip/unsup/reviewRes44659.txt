It's hard to check off your must-do's in a city like Chi-town when you've only got 2 days to do it ... we had to be efficient with our time. As it happened, Giordano's was only a few blocks away from The Hard Rock Hotel where we were staying. "Try Deep Dish Chicago-style pizza" - CHECK!!! I was astounded at how packed this place was when we got there. Luckily, shortly after putting our name down on the wait list (and subsequently ordering our pie - which they recommend to people who are on the wait list), two seats opened up a the bar. My first recommendation is to NOT go to Giordano's if you're starving ... we waited approximately 40 minutes for our pizza, and it was a small pie. Don't let the size fool you, though. As a NYer, I'm used to thin crust pizza. This pizza's deep dish is comprised almost entirely of melty cheese and a very very thin layer of tomato sauce on top. It was definitely worth tasting, but I still prefer my NY style, 'cause you know how we do.
