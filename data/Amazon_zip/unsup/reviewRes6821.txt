Classy bbq in a 'southern plantation' style atmosphere. Fried green tomatoes in chipotle aioli. Meat sampler was our other appitizer. Don't miss out on the pulled pork in the vinegar based sauce. The hot BBQ sauce is also great. The brisket was also very good, but the chicken I could leave. the 'Competition Ribs' were outstanding! I haven't had the regular ribs yet though to see if the extra $$ for the competition is worth it. Way too full for dessert, but I hear it's also great. Next time. Definitely the best BBQ I've had since Smoke Daddy, not sure I can pick between these two. Chicago Q - Wine Smoke Daddy - Beer That's about it. Awesome place.
