I was absolutely not happy with this place. Even though we made it perfectly clear to the waiter that we don't eat pork and we asked him for recommendations for the appetizer, we still received appetizers with pork inside. As a person who recently moved to the USA, I had no idea that chorizo was a type of pork sausage. And since we had told the waiter that we don't eat pork, we pretty much trusted him with his recommendations. Thank god the appetizers arrived after our Russian friend came, because she was the one to tell us that it was pork!! When we told this to the waiter, he confirmed that we had told him that we don't eat pork and he also confirmed that chorizo had pork in it! Honestly, after having a start like that, happy that my friend arrived early, I just lost my whole appetite!
