It is ALL about the chachos: Freshly fried chips, perfectly crispy crunchy. Topped with beany sludge, cheese, like a pound of carne asada steak, guacamole, sour cream and more cheese.I don't know what they don't just call them nachos and I don't care, I just want to eat them - all. Their guacamole and all of their salsas are so fresh and delicious tasting. Their horchata is perfectly sweet and creamy - and their large is pretty damn big. They also have a dish of little quesadillas topped with onions and drenched in this mild orange-y sauce - scrumptiously messy. Only minus - the beef is sometimes too...chewy, kinda grizzly even... The workers here are some of the nicest ladies period. And my one real criticism of this place is that they regularly get jobbed, because even though you can pay for your food with a credit card, you can't leave a tip on the card. So you're supposed to have both on hand? I'm pretty sure that means they go without tips all the time, which is really fucked up. And the ATM there is always out of order. Bottom line, they should fix that. Other bottom line - if you can, tip very generously - they graciously deal with a lot of drunk assholes and they deserve to be tipped well. I don't know about the other two La Pasaditas. I tried this one first and loved it and now I'm afraid to try the other ones, because I know what I get here will be good.
