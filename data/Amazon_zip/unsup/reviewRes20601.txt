Great Sushi - Bad Service Love the sushi - it's delicious.  BUT delivery is BAD. They've messed up my order a number of times and most recently refused to bring out the food they left out (1/2 my order) saying they were too busy. The person on the phone could not have cared less that we were one person's dinner short. Overall, frustrating experience and I will avoid ordering from there again for awhile.
