5 stars for the food... Please remember that the Gage is not a fine dining place. Its a noisy gastropub that serves yum food. Prompt and quick service. Loved every single item on the restaurant week menu. The bitter lettuce frisee salad, the risotto and the best part of the meal, the pecan fritters with vanilla ice cream on charred sugar, all tasted exquisite. The cocktails were refreshing and delicious. Definitely a place worth coming back to...
