Waiting in line to get my room. Got a top floor room. King bed with the desk behind the bed so I could work on my laptop and see the TV at the same time. Nice room and comfy bed. The only thing that freaked me out was upon settling in, I opened my 34th floor window to see my view only to find no less than 3 HUGE spiders hanging out outside and many, many egg sacks in the creases. Who knew bugs made it up that far a building. I wonder if they have ever been down the building or if they just live their whole lives up there swaying in the breeze.
