Went out of our way to go here...as we knew it was Dale's restaurant...and had heard many good things about it! I can definitely say that it wasnt a disappointment! Very creative menu...set in a really lovely dining setting...and a super knowledgeable and polite staff! The prix fixe dinner is the way to go...gives you a chance to try a little bit of everything! Make sure to get the gnocci though...one of the best gnocci I can say that I have ever had!! DELICIOUS!
