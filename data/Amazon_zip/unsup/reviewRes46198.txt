The 2 stars might sound harsh but there was really nothing special about Grand Lux. Our server was taking forever with refilling our water and coming to us, even though he was nice. The bathroom smelled like total shit. The floors are very slippery and I kept thinking there was water spilled everywhere because of it. The food was mediocre (onion soup was good, but the tempura veggies were so-so).
