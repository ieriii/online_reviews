Thsi was my first time at PIccolo, but I loved the atmosphere and the food. I like La Scarola down the street, but Piccolo is way classier and better for a date. We started with the proscuitto and mozarella, which was great (but hard to mess up). I loved the cheese ravioli, which had more of a kick than any other ravioli I've had. I will say that if you're not a foodie, the menu can be kind of overwhelming. My fiance ordered the whole fish of the day (seabass), which melted in our mouths. I was intimidated by the thought of a fish staring at me, but they just bring it out to show you and then take it back to cut and de-bone it. We had after dinner drinks and dessert and lingered at our table for a bit without at all feeling rushed. Service was not amazing, but very pleasant. I would have given it 5 stars if the menu was a little varied; I'm not sure what else I would have ordered.
