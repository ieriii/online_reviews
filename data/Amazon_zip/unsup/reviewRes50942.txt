To start, I've only been to Wishbone for breakfast/brunch. That's not to say they don't have a good dinner - I've just never been (which makes me wonder when I will - standby for update to review).  Wishbone is a great place to go, if you're not from an urban environment, but moved here at some point in your life. It's the city version of Cracker Barrel - YUMMO!  Their food staples like Biscuits'n'Gravy, Cheese Grits and Ham, Shrimp'n'Grits, and country pancakes - take me back to a childhood growing up in Arkansas. And I have to say - this is REAL southern food - not fake southern food like "Big Jones" (which I also like - just not like mama's home cookin').  The service is always prompt and friendly, and every meal I have had, has been consistently good. The one thing I would advise, is that is a place with lots of kids, so be prepared for the occassional outbreak of crying, tantrums, or other joys in life brought by those not old enough to understand when you act like that.... I recommend 1/2 order of buscuits'n'gravy, side of cheese grits.
