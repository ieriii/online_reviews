Yummo!!!! My BFF and I went there for brunch yesterday and it was truly deelish! I had the shrimp poboy and she had the lobster roll. Both were tasty and well seasoned with out being overwhelming. We also had the Montrose Mimosa which was fab! This place is not huge on space but our server a guy behind the counter was EXCELLENT! I am sorry I did not get his name. We will definitely be back to take advantage of the weekly specials! Oh wait how could I possibly forget about the potato pancake?? A must have!! :-)
