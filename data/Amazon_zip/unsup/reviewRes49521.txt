Over priced and over rated! It is a fairly upscale place for the after work downtown crowd. But to have a wine flight and a plate of cheese for $100 is really not my cup of tea. That hundred is much better used at Monk's or some other burger joint and drink specials. intended for frou frou audiences I can see why this appeals to the late twenties and early thirties single female crowd. It is where they can find their sugar daddy under the guise of having a girls night out. Service and scenery is top notch, but as a value driven experience... Bin 36 is not. Go there if you feel compelled to flash some cash for morsels of cheese and some slightly above average wine.
