I've visited Chicago 4 times in the past 4 years, and the best meal I've had in all my visits was at Longman & Eagle this past August. My friend and I shared a couple of small plates- the grilled octopus was okay but not cooked evenly, so some pieces were too tough. We also got scallops, and I usually don't even like scallops all that much, but these were absolutely delightful. For my entree, I had beer-battered soft shell crabs, and they were, by far, the best soft shell crabs I have ever tasted. I also couldn't stop stealing the beef-fat fries that came with my friend's sloppy joe. All in all, loved the food, the atmosphere, the beer selection... I wish I had room for dessert, maybe next time I'm in town!
