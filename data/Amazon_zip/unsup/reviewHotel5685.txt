We had our ups and downs here. I booked a 3 night Fri-Sun night stay at an incredible rate ($400 including all taxes), and the location was great. Valet'd the car, checked in, room was small but nice. Here's where the problems begin... The room was hot, 79 degrees. No worries, we were going to hit the town anyways. So we cranked it down to the minimum temperature allowed, 65, and went out. Returned several hours later, still hot. Maybe it didn't click on? Tried to re-set it but we ultimately ended up suffering through a sticky, sweaty night. This is when we noticed the unbelievably shitty quality of the bedding. Stiff, sandpaper-y, cheap. First thing in the morning, I notified the front desk that our AC might be broken. We went out and came back maybe 4-6 hours later to find that nothing had been done. When the maintenance guy finally came, he confirmed that it was broken and he called downstairs to get our room changed. Waited at least a 1/2 hour for a bellhop to come move our bags, never did. Called again and asked, still waiting...finally went down to the lobby and started to pitch a fit. Bellhop never came, so my boyfriend and the maintenance man dragged all of our bags down 2 floors. Room #2 smelled god awful as soon as we walked in. Some kind of chemical or moth ball smell. Had to argue with the hotel staff for a good 15 minutes about the smell before I finally went ballistic down in the lobby. NOW a manager intervenes... We got upgraded to a much bigger, nicer room on another floor. They also comp'd our valet parking, breakfast, and gave us a complimentary one night stay for a location closer to home on the East coast. Another manager saw us the next day and personally apologized, he did seem truly embarrassed. River Hotel hmmm wouldn't stay there again but I did appreciate all the free sh*t we got in their attempt to pacify us.
