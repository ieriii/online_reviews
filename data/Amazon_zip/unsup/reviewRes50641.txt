If you've never had good soul food, or live in the neighborhood of Big Jones, try this place and you will probably like it. If you have had any good soul food, you will be disappointed. There were 6 of us. Two people got the fried catfish sandwiches with fried okra. They loved it. The rest of us got "fried catfish" with homestyle mashed potatos. Gross. Undercooked and chewy (yes, chewy) fish and the dryest mashed potatos I have ever had. The appetizers were ok but nothing special and we were disappointed in the main entrees so we did not even try for desert. Not good. Try Table 52 instead. Service was good and the place was warm and welcoming but this did not make up for the average at best food.
