After months of anticipation and two lunch dates later I am finally ready to write up my review. Upon first walking in I was impressed by the layout and ambiance. Everything is just perfect, from the bar in the center of the restaurant, to the huge dining room with view of the brewery and kitchen, and the fireplace by the door. Overall just a great use of space. The painted tin ceiling is a nice touch. I also appreciate the care that went into incorporating the restaurant facade with the original building. It just 'fits' along this stretch of Milwaukee. OK- enough about architecture!! The food is outstanding. My favorite dish thus far is the pulled pork sandwich. The herb chicken sandwich is a close second. Probably the best chicken I've had in a long time. Unfortunately, the Margarita pizza I ordered on my first visit had no flavor, way too much sauce, and not enough mozzarella. Skip it! The second time around I had the Fish N' Chips. Three huge pieces of atlantic scrod (heh) on a bed of fries served up with roasted red pepper remoulade and slaw. Delicious! For dessert go for the cherry bourbon cake. Yum yum. If only I could say the same about the beer. I only had one, the Workingman Mild, but it was a let down. Something not quite right about this brew. Slightly bitter for a 'mild' yet watery. I'll have to come back sometime later when the crowds die down to sample more. I really hope that I find a decent brew, otherwise... Revolution, we have a problem. Finally, it gets really loud in here. I know it shouldn't matter, especially at a bar/restaurant, but it's one of my peeves. It also doesn't help the decibel levels when parents decide to bring their little ones. All six of them. Sigh. All in all I really like Revolution, and I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood. If I find a beer that I like I'll bump this review up to five stars.
