4 stars for the food, 5 for the patio, 5 for the service, 1 for the dessert. Um, a tiny scoop of pistachio gelato? Come on now, we are in America- give me at least two- especially when I am sharing or tell me its the size of a cotton ball. I digress. The patio is really something, as said in ALL the other reviews. It will be interesting to see how Piccolo stays open through the winter, with half their space blanketed under Chicago snow. They should get a retractable roof. Our waitress was extremely accommodating, knowledgeable, and friendly. She came around when we needed her and kept my wine glass full so that by the end of dinner I was in a haze (but my memory is 100% for this review). My decision was easy when our waitress let me know they were out of the "special pasta," a fabulous-sounding squash ravioli. Instead, I had the penne arrabiata, which was good but not fantastic. I love that they have whole wheat pasta, but I was left feeling that I could have made my meal at home. The salad was delicious and something I probably could not craft myself. We split the ensalada mista and caprese. As I said before, the dessert really left something to be desired, such as 3 more scoops of gelato. I usually judge an Italian restaurant based on if they serve pistachio gelato- if they do, they have already gotten at least a nod of approval. They don't, I want to leave immediately. To be teased with one scoop is just mean. I'm sure I will be back for the patio but I'll have to personally request my idea of what a serving of delicious Italian ice cream is.
