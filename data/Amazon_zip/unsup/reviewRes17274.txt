(really like a 3.75) I've been wanting to finally make it to Violet Hour for well over a year now after hearing about it, and of course I finally get around to it after I've moved to another city. Were it not pouring buckets, the wait to get in the door and then to actually get in, may not have been as discontenting. However, I'll say that I think the wait was mostly worth it. I really dig the ambiance of the place. It most certainly is a perfect date place. The lighting is right, the seating and level of intimacy in its setup is also just right. It's very conducive to you getting caught up in your own world, like it's just you and your companion(s), whether one other person or a group of people. The drink selection is pretty interesting (egg whites? really?). I ordered the El Diablo because it had ginger in it, and while I wasn't head over heels about it, it was good. The large block (not cubes) of ice in the drink was an interesting touch also. The bartender was really courteous and attentive also. $12 a drink is more in line with prices I'm used to (and hate) in NYC, but it's not the drink-a-lot-get-sloppy-and-sloshed kind of place anyway. Not to mention, that one drink did me in pretty well, so i certainly didn't need another. I'd come back again, for sure. It could definitely come off at first like a bit of pretension, but there's definitely substance here. You've earned two new fans, Violet Hour. Good job.
