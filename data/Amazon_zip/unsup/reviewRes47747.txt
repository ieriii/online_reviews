My boyfriend took me here for my Birthday and I wasn't disappointed. It was a beautiful place to spend a romantic dinner - large and spacious, but not tacky and cold like Texas de Brazil. The food was delicious, the duck and pork were my favorite. The service was great, our waitress made sure we had tried each of the meats on rotation and sent out any we hadn't tried. I was not a huge fan of their seafood dishes, but you don't go to Zed for seafood. The harvest table had several stellar dishes, and then a bunch of mediocre dishes which were repeated. The truffle butter was fabulous and so were the meats and cheeses. I hope they improve on the variety of their harvest table and the quality of some of their salads, but it really is not a deal breaker. Give Zed451 a try! Also, make sure you go there hungry.
