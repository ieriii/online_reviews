EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Got violent food poisoning at this place and figured I would call to warn them about the beef in question. I was courteous (despite being sick as a dog) and the manager refused to investigate or even hear my claim. I was not asking for anything in return but to warn them about the bad beef the night before so that others would not get sick. I had been to Calo before and previously enjoyed the place but after getting sick for 2 days with violent diarrhea and also being treated like a criminal for making a call to the place to warn them, I of course would never return.
