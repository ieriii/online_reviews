My husband and I were in last weekend and, as usual, we were pleased with our meals. The Mac & Chreeze was creamy and delicious and our Bloody Marys were well-constructed and highly effective. What stood out about this visit was the fantastic service we received from our server Aaron. Like every weekend, the place was packed. Servers were scurrying around everywhere, weaving in and out of folks on the waitlist, avoiding diners on their way to the restroom. Though the conditions seemed high-stress, Aaron never faltered for a moment. He was friendly, calm, and thorough; attentive without being intrusive. In a situation where any server deserved a pass, Aaron delivered completely. His attitude added to our experience. The Chicago Diner has solidified it's position on our Must-visit-when-in-Chicago list.
