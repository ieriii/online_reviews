I got there before the lunch rush and was amazed at how great the sausage was! I had the Jamiacan carribean jerk with a small fries and drink. The sausage had an amazing sauce with friend bananas on it. It was just too good I had to get 2nds and 3rds to go. I picked up the blue cheese pork sausage with sir william pear cream sauce and smoked almonds and a regular everything sausage and both were too delicious. Before I migrate to Ohio, I will definitely make my way here again!
