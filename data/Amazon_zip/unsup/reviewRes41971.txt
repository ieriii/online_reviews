This place is a diamond in the rough...pho-sho pho-sho! (ok, cheezy pun intended). This is probably the healthiest meal you can have...no grease, fresh basil and sprouts to top the pho...soooo yummy. I have to admit, it's a hole in a wall and looks a bit like a turkish bazaar in there, but the lines speak for itself. The place is always packed.  The bubble tea avocado smoothie will be worth the wait though.
