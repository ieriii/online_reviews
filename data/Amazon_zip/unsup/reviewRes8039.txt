We came in here tonight in an attempt to use as many of the 2009 A La Card card deck before the year is over. The snowflakes were huge but parking was easy in this area and the place was pretty much empty at about 5:15. 2 diet cokes + Insalata di Mare + 2 pizzas = 47 dollars (37 with our coupon, which we actually got back - what a nice server) The seafood salad was so fresh, so light. Cold poached shrimp, squid and baby octopus tossed with olives, garlic, oil and vinegar, served with a lemon wedge. A good to size split between 2, or to eat all for yourself if your date isn't into sea critters (nom nom nom, more for me!) We ordered 2 pizzas: the bufalina and the mushroom/sausage. I would definitely recommend the bufalina (red sauce, a lovely mozzarella, basil) or pizzas with toppings that won't weigh down the thin crust. The fewer ingredients the better. You'll be able to taste the different components of the pizza better. I am a little obsessed with the crust on this pizza. The center part with the toppings is delightfully thin but the edges are heavenly puffed up pieces of dough with beautiful charred specks... allowing you to have the best of both worlds: thin crust middle; carbo-loading edges. Diet Cokes come in cute little glass bottles - no free refills here. They also have some fun Italian sodas in their drink case. My only complaint is that their appetizer menu is in Italian. Yes, I know what rucola and insalata are, but would really appreciate an English translation thrown in for some of the other items. The same goes for the appetizers on their specials board.
