Mayan Palace is a great place to come, chill out and have a nice dinner. Sure, it's not the most awesomest Mexican restaurant that you'll find in Chicago, but c'mon, it's so good! Came here on a Thursday night with a friend, and took advantage of their 1/2 price margaritas---mmmmm so good! Also, took the advice of fellow Yelpers and got the $3 coupon worth $10 on http://restaurants.com. Be sure to take advantage of this! I ordered the chicken flautas, rice only. Flautas were good, and rice was ok. My friend ordered the chorizo potato enchiladas--which I should have stolen a bite of, but totally forgot to. There were definitely no complaints on that end! I'll be back for sure, because the staff was amazingly nice, welcoming and worked together as a team! Wow, great service!! :-)
