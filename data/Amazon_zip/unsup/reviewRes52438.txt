We had a great time at Brazzaz. We went during the week and there was a special going on, all you can eat for $34.99. Not bad! The salad bar was amazing. It had a variety of cold and hot items, including sushi, cheese and meat samplers, meatballs, etc.... At our table we were served a sampling of mashed potatoes, black beans and spinach artichoke medley. Then came the main course, all you can eat meat! All of it was very tasty. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the garlic steak, it had a funny taste for some reason. Everything else was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Definitely go hungry when you visit Brazzaz, there is not a shortage on food.
