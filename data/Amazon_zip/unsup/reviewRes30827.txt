What a gem! Four of us went for dinner on a Thursday and although we had a reservation, we did not need one. The restaurant was not full and even had patio seating available. I'm glad to know that since it is a little bit off the beaten path, I will always be able to get a seat! The space itself is warm and welcoming. One of our friends said it reminded her of Charleston - casual, bright, comfortable. I loved that there is local art decorating the walls (interestingly enough, including jewelry) and available for purchase. We sat near the open kitchen where the cooks were as friendly as our server and we felt right at home. We all had different specialty drinks which were fresh and delicious (sangria, margarita, mojito). We shared two appetizers (veggies with green garlic fondue and queso fundido), both of which were very tasty, but the fresh veggies and fondue (with a side of zesty guacamole) stole the show. Our entrees included the soft shell crab (YUM), pork shoulder, torta and quesadillas. All were unique, large and hearty, though not overly-rich. The quality of the ingredients was exceptional. Nana is a wonderful, warm, family-run restaurant with local sourcing from the food to the art on the walls. I couldn't feel better about eating anywhere if I tried. This place is delightful and I can't wait to return for brunch!
