The food was wonderful! It's pricey but worth it! My husband had the regular dinner and said the meat was as good as it gets...every single type. I just did the salad bar since I am a vegetarian, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. There were tons of things for me to it, and each item was fantastic. As good as the food is here, the customer service is even better. From the hostess to the server to the gauchos to management. They should write business textbooks about this place. If you are debating where to go eat in Chicago, you have found your answer.
