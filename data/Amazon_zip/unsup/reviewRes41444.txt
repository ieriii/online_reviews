Awesome dinner overall, great service as well. Our server was excellent. His personality was wonderful and his recommendations were top notch. I'm so disappointing in myself for not remembering his name because he truly was a gem. Onto the food. A friend had recommended that I try the lobster bisque. I am so glad I listened to her advice, the soup was wonderful. Thicker, rich broth with large chunks of meat throughout made this soup delightful. Onto the steak (my favorite part). I ordered their bone-in ribeye, my favorite cut of steak. The first ribeye that hit the table wasn't the best cut I've seen, it was actually one of the worst. I cut into it and it was fairly overcooked as well. I can get over my steaks being overcooked, it happens, but I was disappointed at the quality of the steak itself. I sent it back and my second ribeye was absolutely perfect. The meat was just as appealing to the eye as it was to the mouth. Mmm, a perfect medium rare. For a side, I took my server's recommendation of the sweet potato casserole. This side was one of the best I've ever had in my life, it was practically dessert. GET THIS IF YOU COME! For Dessert I split my friend's cheesecake. It was VERY, VERY good, but not the best I've ever had. Our bottle of the Orin Swift Prisoner made the meal totally complete. Again, another recommendation from our server (and one of my previous favorites regardless) Thanks again Ruth's Chris for the positive dining experience.
