I'm re-writing my review on Calo. Originally, I had panned them for canvassing the neighborhood with unwanted paper menus (which just ended up blowing around as trash). One year later, they've stopped the wasteful paper campaign and so we decided to try them out for dinner. Great place. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. We had a 10 minute wait for a table that ended up taking only 5 minutes. While the bartender was a bit flustered, the service was generally outstanding. The food is typical Italian with overwhelming quantities, so bring a doggy bag. They were easily able to accommodate an off-the-menu request and everything was presented at a relaxing pace.  Summary ratings (out of 5 stars): Overall (4) **** Food (3) *** Service (4) **** Atmosphere (4) ****
