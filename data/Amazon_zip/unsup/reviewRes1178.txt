So good but the lines suck. Avoid it like the plague in the summer as it turns into a "I saw this shit on Food Network," tourist trap. Get the duck fat fries on Friday and Saturday and definitely get the duck and sauternes sausage with fois gras, sel gris and black truffle dijon. Doug please make your establishment larger. Stop torturing your regulars in the winter you sadist bastard! (I kid but seriously... do something about the fucking lines.)
