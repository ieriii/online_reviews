Yolk was ok. But that's it....   just ok. I like the french toast options (cinnamon roll, banana bread), they were tasty. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict once and said it was kind of blah. The breakfast sandwich I had once was nothing special. An ok spot to eat breakfast but I'm not sure if it's worth the wait on weekends.
