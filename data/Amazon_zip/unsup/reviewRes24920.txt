A friend once confided in me that she and her pals would make frequent visits to Artopolis to admire the young Greek waiters. No offense to the wait staff but what has me salivating at this cafe is the food. The Briammi Kefte, with oven-baked ground lamb and beef seasoned with an assortment of spices, sports a rich flavor. The chicken Tequila Pollo with avocado and the roasted lamb Mediterraneo also make savory lunch treats. Artopolis also boasts a large selection of desserts. If your choice is between the Chocolate Raspberry, a dark chocolate mousse layered cake with raspberry preserve, and the Chocolate Mousse Cup; pick the chocolate raspberry. I can't believe that I, a confessed chocoholic, am saying this, but the chocolate mousse cup was a little too chocolaty. Oh, and as for the waiters at Artopolis, I'll let you make your own judgments.
