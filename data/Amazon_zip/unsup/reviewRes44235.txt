The $2 jalapeno miso soup is reason to come here alone. I'm usually indifferent to miso, but this was hearty and full of interesting extras. So much so, that I've slotted it in to my 39 course final meal which I've spent much of my life obsessing over. Their take on the Godzilla is perfection. The rest of the rolls we had were respectable, with a couple dangerously veering to the mushy side. But all in all, this is one of the best sushi and BYOB spots that you'll find North of Fullerton.
