I will never, ever in a million billion years take a date here. I'm already a messy eater as is, and why give them ammunition to end it because of my unkempt eating habits? Remind me to tell you the story of me at Ribfest. In a white shirt. It's the stuff of legends, or so you would think among my friends - it's been 5 years and they're STILL talking about that. And Crisp chicken is messy beyond belief. At least the finger food chicken I got. Which was evident by the pile of napkins and greasy bones on my tray. But I would take my crush. Or I'll just buy it here. In strawberry. In a can.YUM. I went during the lunch rush crowd, and got the 3 wing and frites special for 6 bucks with a pop - sweet deal! I ordered the plain Jane (because we all know that's what I am), but the guy at the register talked me into getting it with the most popular sauce: Seoul Sassy, which was a sweet sauce with undertones of ginger. It came out sprinkled with green onions. The chicken was crispy, the sauce tasted great, and I will order it again, but I'll ask for extra sauce. My friend had far more sauce on her order - she got the BBQ, which was very spicy. And customer service is king here - the manager who convinced me that I was more of a Seoul Sassy than a Plain Jane offered to remake me the dish if I didn't like it and he even came up to my table halfway through the meal to make sure that it was up to par. SWEET! Even though the eats are wonderful here, I still won't take a date here. Only after he marries me - because marriage is for better or worse, no?
