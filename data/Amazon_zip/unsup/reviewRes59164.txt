This is the best sushi for delivery. I have never been to the restaurant, but always get the sushi delivered to my house and business. They can also do hand rolls if requested..YUM! I find the sushi fresh and the rolls are fabulous. I tried the Honey roll recently and it was awesome..nice crunch and sweetness.
