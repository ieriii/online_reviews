Brunch is probably my favorite meal of the week, and I do love getting friends together to try out new brunch spots around town. But Bongo Room is an all around favorite that we keep coming back to. Mostly because they are constantly changing their menu every season.. LOVE LOVE LOVE their banana walnut pancakes.. too bad they don't serve it all year round. But regardless of what we've tried, we all love them. Their seasonal pancakes are always a hit, so try a stack of whatever's on the menu when you're there. The eggs are really great too.. the portions are huge , so you could probably order a couple different things and pass it around a table of 3 so you can try everything. The orange juice is probably way too overpriced considering the size of it and that it tastes like it was poured out of a box.. but the food is great-so bon apetite!
