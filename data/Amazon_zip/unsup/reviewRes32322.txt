As far as Ethiopian goes, this place is pretty good. There are better places a little farther North, but I'd eat here if I was at Lawrence.  Of particular note is the lunch menu. For a reasonable price you can get a bunch of food.  Worth checking out if eating Ethiopian food isn't a new experience to be cherished.
