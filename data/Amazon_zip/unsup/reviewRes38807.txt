My boyfriend, his family, and I got pizza (to-go) since a lot of reviews on Yelp rave about it. His family thought the pizza was excellent, I thought I've had better, I definitely want to try and eat here one time because the decor of the place was very cute and looked traditional Italian. The staff also seemed nice, we had at least five people come up to us and ask if we were being helped even though we were sitting and waiting for the pizza. Just from that I can tell that they're attentive. Their uniforms also seemed to be well kept, and since the place, in my opinion, doesn't quite qualify as a fancy restaurant I appreciate the effort those employees put in the way they look. I recommend it.
