I've been to Hopleaf twice now. After my first visit I would've given it a 5+, but my second experience wasn't as great, so the net is four stars. Still good and I will definitely go back, but I'm just being honest. Here's the breakdown: Visit #1: Went with two friends as part of a night celebrating the fact I got a new job...finally. It was a Monday night, so not super crowded, but there was a wait of 20 minutes or so. We sat out in the back beer garden, which is just a great spot. I had several delicious, strong beers (yesssss) and tried mussels for the first time ever in my life. The mussels had me hooked. The service was attentive and I was in love. Visit #2: My BFF from Michigan was in town and I wanted to impress her, so my friend and I took her to Hopleaf. I was espousing the wonders of the mussels, and she informed me she doesn't eat mussels. I had faith the rest of the food was awesome. I got the mussels, as planned, and they didn't taste AS good as before. Something was a bit off. Less seasoning or something. Still good, but hm... My BFF got a ham sandwich that she did NOT like. She said it tasted funny. I didn't try it, so I can't vouch for that. My guy friend got the trout and had no complaints. The rub with the second visit, beyond the food being "off" was the service. I know it was a Sunday night over Labor Day weekend and they were packed. But it was still a bit annoying when two tables, with as many or more people, were seated after us, ordered after us, but got their food before us. Mussels and all. Our dinner, not including the wait time in the bar, took almost three hours. Luckily my company was awesome, and the beer filled my belly, but if I was hungry I would've been pretty ticked off. All that being said, I'm 99.9% sure I will go back in the future.
