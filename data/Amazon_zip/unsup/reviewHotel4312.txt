Random fact: the Aflac duck & the three Budweiser penguins stayed at the Palmer House. My company's annual meeting was being held in Chicago this year at the Palmer House. Unfortunately, our staff would be split between two hotels. I was one of the lucky ones who got to stay at the Palmer House...or so I thought... Being a Hilton hotel, I expected so much more from the Palmer House. I looked at their beautiful rooms on the internet and upon checking in noticed that they received a plaque for being a historic hotel. Apparently, it being a "historic" hotel only meant it was old and creepy. LOBBY: Absolutely beautiful! The walls and ceiling has such amazing and elegant detail. However, note that the lobby is located on the second floor. ROOMS: My room did NOT look like the rooms on their website and felt quite cold and creepy. I walked into an outdated room the size of a large closet or tiny bedroom with a double size bed. Who still has double beds?!  The edge of the bed was extremely close to a door that opened to a tiny closet that had a safe, iron, and ironing board. My coworkers and I compared the bathrooms to something you might see out of a horror movie like The Shining. There was also a TUBE tv. Free internet? Nope, they charge...and there isn't wireless internet, you need to use an Ethernet cable. LOCATION: A block or so from Millennium Park (home of the bean) Close to the Blue (Monroe Street exit) and Red (Adams Street exit) train lines A block from State Street shopping area Do yourself a favor, spend the extra money for one of the hotels located across the river. You'll probably be a lot happier.
