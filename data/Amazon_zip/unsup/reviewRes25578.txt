i've been hearing about this place for decades and had never been. though i think i may have had a slice or two of thin crust back in the 90s at a party. went there and had pan/deep dish sausage and green pepper. i thought it was decent but it was not amazing. for example, the crust was a bit overcooked and really had to push hard with my knife to cut it through. it was a big effort i tell you. i like supporting mom and pop joints, but for deep dish, I think Lou Malnati's and Due's does it better. everyone i went with felt that the pizza was a bit to bready, and it needed more cheese and more sauce. also, my wife and her friend wanted me to say: the house red wines they ordered were a surprisingly high $8.95. i mean shit, this ain't no wine bar! how about something close to $6?
