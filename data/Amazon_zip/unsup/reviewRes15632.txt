I thought everyone knew of Calo as a great option for a fine Italian option, especially with as many reviews as it has. Yet I brought left-overs to work today and people were grinding their teeth to get a bite of my Fall off the bone, phenomenal BBQ ribs! Check out Calo on Wednesday evenings: $9.95 full slab of ribs versus paying the normal $18.95 price! And that includes not just the ribs but a salad or soup and side (I recommend the creamy garlic mashed potatoes). If you're more in the pasta mood, you can't go wrong with any choice. A friend had the Gnocchi stuffed with cheese. Exactly like Italian-style Gushers but on the savory side. Can't go wrong here!
