When I read here that this place was "romantic" I didn't think much of it. No big deal, I thought, I can still come here with my roommate for a nice dinner. So we took our Groupon and walked across the street to Geja's to indulge in some cheese and chocolate. Boy, was I wrong. This place is SERIOUSLY romantic and I'll probably never come back here unless I'm on a date. However, my poor judgment in dinner companion aside (I still love you girl, but next time I'm coming here with a man), Geja's is absolutely to die for and I can't wait to make a return visit. I can't say much past what has already been stated here. The cheese is absolutely the most divine thing I've ever put in my mouth and when we ran out of "dippers" for the chocolate, we simply asked for spoons so we could eat the rest of the fondue straight out of the bowl. That's how good it was. My only complaints are that this place is definitely a type of 'catacomb' so it's incredibly difficult to maneuver through between the tables and it's super dim and hard to read the menu. That's part of the mystery and "romance" of Geja's though and you should know that going into it. Also, my roommate and I sat at our table for 10 minutes without being greeted by a server although two walked by and made eye contact with us. When we brought this to the attention of the manager (we're both former waitresses) he quickly got someone to bring us water and take our order. It happens, no big deal, and I'm glad it was taken care of immediately.
