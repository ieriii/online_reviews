Kinda OK, but nothing to write home about. Take this advice from a Mexican. The machacado (eggs and dried beef) is OK and the homemade flour tortillas are good, but the place has lost it's lustre as tourists, transplants, and newcomers have started coming here. Seems that not only has the quality of the food gone down, but so has the service. Trust me, I have been coming here since I was a baby 37 years ago! Being a native and life long resident of Pilsen, I can tell you that there is better just steps away.
