I've been to Sapori three or four times and the food, service, and drinks have been consistently great. I will say that I have failed to order anything besides the pesto gnocchi because I have grown attached to it. BUT, I have tried other things such as the ribs and both soups and they were all prepared perfectly. Drink-wise, their wine selection is great and has a diverse price-range so poor winos like myself aren't deterred. I've also had their French martini and was pleasantly surprised. I haven't been back in a while but will be saving up and taking my best platonic friend there for Valentine's Day.
