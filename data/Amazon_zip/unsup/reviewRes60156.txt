If you've heard of Pho but haven't experienced it...this is THE place to loose your "Pho virginity"...There is something about the entire experience of Pho Xe Tang (better known as Tank Noodle). First, there is the extensive menu. It's in Vietnamese with bad English translation and is pages long. You have to have one of the Pho's when you're here but don't skip the appetizers. I recommend the Shrimp Spring Rolls. Some of the ingredients in the traditional Beef Pho's sound scary (Tendon, Tripe, etc.) but it makes the experience that much better.Second, the table arrangment. Most of the tables are communal, you sit with other people at long tables. The flatware, chopsticks & noodle spoons are in holders in the middle. Everybody is very friendly and if you're lucky you will be sitting next to a Vietnamese person who can explain some of the menu items and lend a recommendation. Third, the fresh ingredients. I don't know how they do it but EVERYTHING looks and tastes so fresh. They give you a plate of fresh herb garnishes for your Pho and the herbs are as if they hand picked them from a garden out back (virtually impossible given it's location). There is one herb, a long green leaf that I don't even know what it is, never seen it at the market but it tastes similar to cilantro.They also do a great job with take-out....Pho is not an easy thing to package...You have to check this place out! Well worth the trip to Uptown...
