I had ribs they were tuff, fatty, and did not fall off the bone. The menu has lots of options so I asked the waiter for suggestion and went with the ribs. What an awful suggestion would never order again. The quality of food was poor this night. The Greek suburburb restaurant has better ribs. I would give one star for food. I am going with 2 stars for location and decor.
