Was treated to an awesome dinner here. Had a lamb dish IIRC. The dessert was great. The cheese cart was full of baller cheeses I ain't even ever heard of before. Toured the kitchen like a boss. The room itself was kind of plain and felt like it was a sectioned off portion of a hotel ballroom, but it was still nice. Service was precise and almost military-like. A great place to eat, though I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for something intimate. The room just doesn't have that vibe.
