Flat out fantastic. Ambiance was great, even if we sat at the bar; I felt that we were in our own little world. Cocktails were excellent. Highly recommend Pimm's Cup (I think that's what it was called- nice and light). We did the prix fixe for $29 a person, it was an amazing deal for a starter, entree and dessert. I had the grilled octopus as many have recommended and couldn't have enough of it, really amazing. I also had the scallops for the entree and it was the perfect size. Delicious! Dessert was also great and the bar tender gave us a complimentary glass of moscato to go along with our desserts. Fabulous service and will definitely go again!
