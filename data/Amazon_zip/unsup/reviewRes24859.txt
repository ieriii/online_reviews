"It was too dark!"-yes, its calleda romantic ambiance. I'm sure you can find your mouth without being able to see much. Plus, the darkness is probably beneficial for a person that has to look at you. "There was too much food!"-no one asks you to or makes you stuff yourself til your long instestine is hangin out of your pant leg. "I smelled like oil!"-until they create oil that doesnt smell like oil, you should probably go to McDonalds. Oh, they use oil as well. Damn, stl then. "$50 per person"-they have dinners for $25. Plus the coupons, or the sharing option. Hubby and I discovered Gejas 7 years ago, and the rest is history. This place puts you from cold hard streets of Chicago into a little Spanish cafe of perhaps 18th century. With handmade dim tin lamps, solid aged dark wood shelvings made of wine racks, little candles on each table, and booths with their own private curtains, and sometimes a guitar player,this place is unbefrigginlievable. It is always possible to make a reservation, so you dont have to wait long. The staff is always amazing and helpful. You can get a basic dinner for $25, which fills you up to no end. The awesome part? You can fill out a bday card thingy, and get a $25 discount on a dinner. So technically, you can eat there for $25 for two people. Couple of times we went there, and the manager gave us free dessert, just for the hell of it. This place is a treaure in the city.
