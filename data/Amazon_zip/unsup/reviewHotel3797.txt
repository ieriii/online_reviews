I really enjoyed staying at this swank hotel. Minus 1 star b/c the bathroom/ shower is a bit awkward if you're staying with somebody you're not dating/married to. Basically a shower with a window into the room but to close it the curtain is on the outside of the shower in the bedroom... Everybody working there was great and the rooftop bar/lounge was nice. Security was quick to tell a rowdy room to be quiet when we called to complain at 3:30 in the morning.
