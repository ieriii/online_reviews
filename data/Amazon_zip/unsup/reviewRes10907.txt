I honestly do not understand anyone that complains about this place. Yes, it's crowded and you have to wait on the weekends -- for good reason, the food is RIDICULOUS. Shut up -- seriously, it's the weekend in Chicago -- name ONE place that you don't have to wait at for brunch besides McDonalds. OMG stop complaining, there are people in the world that have NO FOOD and you're whining and crying about a 30 minute wait - seriously? Grow up. Bongo Room is beyond words. The french toast I had there this weekend was literally the BEST THING I have EVER eaten in my 30 years. EVER. Hands down. No question about it. EVER. Holy shit it was good. It was the one with the dried cherries and vanilla sauce. Wow -- it's indescribably amazing. There are no words in the English language that will allow me to convey to you how amazing that dish is. Go there -- try it -- you will die of sheer joy.
