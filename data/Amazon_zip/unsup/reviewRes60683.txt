I met a friend here for brunch on a rainy Sunday. We got there right at 10a.m., so there wasn't much of a wait. We got a seat by the window where you could see all of Michigan Ave while you dined. The service was decent and the food was a derivative of an upscale Cheesecake Factory, but still good. Generous portions and lots of flavor. All in all, a good experience and pretty affordable. I do think their drinks were a little too pricey, but then against most places down on Michigan Ave are. I had the Spanish Rose (champagne and Sangria) and it was wonderful!
