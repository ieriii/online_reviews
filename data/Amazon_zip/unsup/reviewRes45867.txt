The wait at this place is ridiculous. We waited for 1hr, before we got a table. This was my third or fourth time here and I really was not looking forward to the food. HOWEVER, I was presently suprised..I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken with veggies and mash potatoes .MMUUUMMMMY..the chicken moist and full of favor and the mash potatoes were creamy, buttery and savory..and The drinks were amazing The Strawberry martini will put you on your ass and taste like a sugared strawberry. I also had the blood orange moijo which isn't as strong but taste like heaven. The beignets are a must they come with 3 or 4different sauces *BEST Dessert hands down*
