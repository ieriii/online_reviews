i am giving it 4 stars because normally this is 5 star pizza but the last time I was in, admittedly it was the most packed it has ever been while i was there, was average at best. I have had many good experiences there before, with their perfect crust, great sauce and generous tasty toppings. Not sure what happened when i was there last but I guess even the best have an off night.
