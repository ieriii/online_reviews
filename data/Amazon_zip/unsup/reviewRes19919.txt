I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunch: I came here yesterday with my mother and grandmother. My mom and I each had the cheeseburger, which was juicy and deeeelicious. My grandmother had the special, which was a lamb and steak sandwich. I couldn't tell if she liked it or not because she was complaining about everything that day. Service was pretty good, but not great. The price was reasonable for such a nice lunch. Dinner: I didn't really have a full dinner. Instead, my friend and I split a plethora of snacks and appetizers. All of the food was very tasty. I had the mussels, tuna tartare, and the fries with curry. All are highly recommended. This place also has an impressive selection of beer, as well as plenty of interesting martinis to choose from. Unfortunately, the prices for drinks were not exactly reasonable. There were lots of handsome professionals here for both lunch and dinner. Too bad they all had wedding rings on and/or are probably assholes. But that won't keep me from adding this to my list of regular happy hour places!
