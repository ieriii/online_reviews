Heard great things about this place so we took a friend from out of town here for brunch on a Saturday. We got here around noon-ish and had to wait for a little over an hour. It wasn't too bad since there are many shops nearby.  Between the three of us, we ordered ALL of the following: Tomatillo Salsa Scramble - My FAV, tons of avocado BLT Benedict - Good Some special omelet with pesto sauce -Very tasty but too filling for me Pumpkin Spice Flapjacks (2 slices) - Ok to me Very Good to others, (I am not a fan of pumpkin spice) Chocolate Tower French Toast (2 slices) - Ok Red Velvet Pancakes (1 slice) - To die for. Our server was super patient with us even tho we were indecisive and had lots of questions. He also let us know that it is not required to get the full order! (This option is Not written anywhere on the menu) So we were able to try different pancakes after being so torn about all the delicious options. The kitchen is very efficient, it is so small in the back but food comes out super fast. Those guys are like energized bunnies. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food. I will come back to the Bongo Room for sure, but only to this location.
