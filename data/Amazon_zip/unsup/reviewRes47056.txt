The food is still fantastic, but the service, especially in the bar, is not the least bit warm or welcoming. Three times in the last two months we have stopped in about 11 - 11:30pm. The bartender inevitably looks at a server then looks at us without saying a word. (and, we are not arriving looking like bums - my husband is usually in a business suit after coaching a basketball game and this will be our first drink of the night) When I asked last time if they were closing, I was told "you have 20 minutes". When my husband mentioned we had others coming to meet us, we got a shrug. So - we just found our new favorite neighborhood after-game hangout - Cuneens - right across the street from UG.  BTW - A friend and neighbor recently had a similar experience after arriving at 9:30pm on a week night.
