I have been eager to go to Sunda for quite some time and they did not disappoint! Everything about my experience was perfect. I loved the decor, they really thought out each detail. The service was amazing and unpretentious. The food was cleverly named and the flavor delivered. I would recommend everything we ate. We started with the angry soft shell crab dish which is seasonal and lemongrass beef lolipops. My Husband had short ribs for his entree and I had seabass both were fabulous! The dessert we ordered was called Ridiculous and it was:) You must save room for that. I signed up for their online newsletter on their website and they gave me a $15 off for lunch or brunch. I am so excited and can't wait to go back and try Sunday brunch with their Asian flair. I am a fan!
