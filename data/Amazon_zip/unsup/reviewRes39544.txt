San Soo Gab San has fantastic Korean food. I love the charcoal grill for Korean BBQ. That makes a huge difference on the flavor of the food. We ordered the kalbi and the chicken. The kalbi was delicious, and the chicken was ok (though most people don't order chicken at Korean BBQ anyway... not sure why we did). The jap chae (vermicelli noodles) was outstanding. I think it's hard to make jap chae above average, but San Soo Gab San's ability to provide a great chewiness and texture to the noodles combined with a great flavor convinced me to give this restaurant 4 stars.
