Im a fan of Giordano's even though i gave it 3 stars I tried the Deep Dish Cheese Pizza. The pizza was excellent. My only issue is that the i didnt enjoy the crust. I really like the crust on pizzas. The cheese was really abundant in this pizza pie! Almost too much for my taste. My issue is that i couldnt eat this pizza everyday. If i cant eat you pizza everyday i cant give you 5 stars. If you choose to go i would reccomend the stuffed crust pizza. My biggest issue was that i took about a hour for my pizza to be cooked. I understand there is a process....blah blah blah .....no one wants to wait an hour for a pizza! Besides that the waitstaff were nice, the location was excellent and prices were beyond reasonable. Take the fam out for a nice pizza dinner, just make sure you havent had a lot to eat before coming here because you will need eating room for the pounds of cheese in the stuffed crust. Giordano's Well done!
