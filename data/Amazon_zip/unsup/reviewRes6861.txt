I don't want to hate, but I really wasn't into this place. The service was rushed and impersonal. It seemed clear to me that our server was more interested in turning over the table than in trying to enhance my experience. But beyond that I didn't love the food. I'm generally a little picky about Italian food and maybe I was expecting too much based on the reviews, but the food just wasn't that good. I got a black gnocchi seafood special and my gnocchi was undercooked, the sauce just tasted like salt and the seafood bits were few and far between. The girlfriend ordered penne with sundried tomatoes, chicken and artichokes in a white sauce. it was better than mine but still had salt as its main flavor. Considering the portion size, the prices were reasonable, but just piling on a ton of pasta doesn't really make something a good value in my mind and after having a glass of wine and dessert I wouldn't say that the bill was cheap. Everything was fine, and the girlfriend and I had a lovely evening, but there was nothing special to me that recommends this place over any other mediocre Italian place in the city, so I don't think I'll be going back but other people seem to love it so it's worth deciding for yourself.
