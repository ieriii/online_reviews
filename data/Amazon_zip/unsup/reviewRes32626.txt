I've really wanted to like this place because it's hard to find restaurants serving vegetarian comfort food, but I'm done. The first time I came here last year it was awesome, but every time since it's been "hit or miss" and has soon become just a consistent "miss." I came here the other night with my 5 year old niece, brother, and my fiance. We were told it was a 25 minute wait and my guests agreed to stick it out. We ended up waiting twice as long as told and outside in the cold and rain no less. To make matters worse, we were put out back on the patio to eat where the heat was pretty much nonexistent. Not good when it's in the 40's. We had to keep our gloves, coats and hats on from start to finish. It seemed there was only one server that night, so it took forever for our order to be taken. When we finally got our food, my fiance's order was wrong. And because it was so cold in their little gazebo deal on the patio, our food was cold within minutes of arrival. This place is overpriced, the food's meh compared to the veggie cuisine I've been making at home, you don't get much either (btw, if your menu says "gyros", you're implying there will be at least two gyros... not one), and the wait is absurd. Oh, and I would also like to add that a reuben should NOT have green bell peppers on it. I'd ordered the reuben several times over the past year and enjoyed it. The new green pepper addition left me having a difficult time choking the sandwich down even after removing the peppers from the sandwich because their flavor was thoroughly cooked into the thing. C.D. is quickly becoming that weird mother that wants to add some flair to a classic entre that can't be perfected on.
