The thing that sets this place apart from their competitors is the exceptional service. The staff is very friendly and will walk you through any menu questions. With that said even though they will visually taunt you with their pizza, be sure to go with the Brazillian chicken. It is the most flavorful chicken that I have found in the city. Their sides range from corn to black beans to mashed potatoes. Even though the sides seem standard, they put their own twist into each side. They have huge portions and the prices are reasonable. If you must go with the pizza there are a plethora of toppings, but remember that their chicken is where it's at.
