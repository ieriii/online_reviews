I and a group of seven friends just returned from a wonderful dining experience at Brazzaz. The service was exceptionally good. The waiters were considerate, came by our table at just the right frequency, and were friendly and respectful. The salad bar was terrific, indeed the best of the churrascarias at which we have dined. The mushroom risotto was great! The peppers and other vegetables were tasty and prepared well. The salmon, oysters, and shrimp were very good. The meat was, of course, great. Some others have complained about dry meat. We did not have that experience, but we ask for medium rare to rare portions. The red wines that we chose were very good, good nose and complex. The caiparinhas were were quite delicious. Always have a caiparinha before a churrascaria meal! I had the papaya ice cream dessert--scrumptious! Our group has been to Sal & Carvao, Fogo de Chao, and Brazzaz. With drinks and two bottles of wine, the salad bar and meat, and dessert, we paid about $80.00 per person. A bit expensive, but worth it! In our opinion, for an overall excellent churrascaria dining experience, Brazzaz is the best in Chicago.
