All 9 of us LOVED Little Bucharest!! For apps we ordered eggplant spread bruschetta and saganaki - All EXCELLENT. We each chose a different entree and they were presented perfectly and in a timely manner. Baically, Great food, great service, fun atmosphere. Sunday - Thursday 3 course dinner is $25. We were there on a Friday and it wasn't much more per person. If BranKo is there, you may want to look into the FREE LIMOSERVICE that is available to and from the restaurant because you WILL be drinking!!! He even bought our table a bottle of wine and gave our two birthday friends free dessert! CHECK OUT THIS RESTAURANT - DELICIOUS!!
