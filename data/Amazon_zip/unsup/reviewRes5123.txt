I got it, I got it: this is stoopid cuisine. You know, like, if a bunch of frat boys, in the drunken splendor of an epiphany, decided to open up a haute-peasant restaurant? Yeah, that. It's all smoke and mirrors here, kids: just dump butter and olive oil on a bunch of fried shit and you're golden, right? Which is to say: this place must be AMAZING when one is intoxicated. Oh, sobriety! Next time I'm kicked out of Excalibur, I'm so there.
