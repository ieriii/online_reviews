The veggie food was great. Our lamb had some bone in it (not big, but small bits we had to spit out) and there was a whole egg and a chicken leg on the platter as well. I think I would go all vegetarian next time. It was really the best stuff on the plate. I wish we had tried the coffee. It seemed like a fun thing. I could have dumped the extra honey wine in mine!
