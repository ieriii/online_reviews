You know you're dating a musician when he: 1. Listens to Tom Waits, Nick Cave, David Bowie and not much else. Snob! 2. Starts his night at 2am, 'cause that's when he gets paid. 3. Whisks you away to the Green Mill... over and over and over again. No, I'm not dating a musician anymore, but spending late nights at the Green Mill is a habit I can't break. The drinks aren't fancy but they're stiff, the music is phenomenal and the history is goosebumpin'. Straight legendary, you hear? Whether you just love good music or you're an-out-of-town visitor, the Green Mill is a must x 12 million... it simply IS Chicago.
