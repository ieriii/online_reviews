This is the place I would go to get my last meal if I could:) Absolutely great service, delicious steaks, great sides(the best plantains in the city), huge salad bar, awesome wine list, great great desserts...oh yeah I Love It!!! I ate there so much one night that I seriously couldn't move. Got in a cab and went home straight to sleep.... Really good experience...I think everybody should go there at least once in their lifetime, if you love steak like I do. Don't even bother trying any other Brazilian style steakhouse...it's not worth the time...Go To Fogo!!!
