I was really impressed by this little quaint spot. I can honestly say that everything was fresh. My mimosa, my turkey avocado sandwich and the nommy potato chips (freshly pulled from the fryer), superb. I left with a homemade, au natural Granola bar that was my filler meal for breakfast and lunch the following day. I am a fan of Milk & Honey and recommend that you stop in and grab a bite! Phenom!
