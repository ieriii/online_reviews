Only been here for brunch and we came because the wait at Cafe Selmarie was a bit ridiculous that weekend. We were all pleasantly surprised by the menu and specials. Since the bf's parents were paying, I had the crab cakes benedict and was astounded at the amount of good, quality crab there was. No fillers here! Just enough to keep them stuck togther on your plate. They're known for their seafood, but they've got all the diner and breakfast standards as well. The ambiance is also fun with the cereal boxes lining one wall and the question of the day. I can't believe I haven't been back, actually. The blueberry pancakes were fresh and delicious, though I might have to try the red hot pancakes soon!
