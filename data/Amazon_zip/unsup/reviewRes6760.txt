Like Adele and the movie The Artist, Chicago q is very good but not as great as you've probably heard - 1) Beef ribs are a rare find in general but to advertise them as kobe ribs and to charge $35 for 3 bones? I couldn't taste it but still very good. 2) The "Competition slab of ribs" we got were good but not worthy of a blue ribbon or the $9 premium over a slab of their regular ribs. Needs more char for crispy bark. But flavor was excellent and appreciate that sauces are served on the side.     4) The complimentary pickles were the tastiest and best bread & butter pickle chips I ever ate in my life.
