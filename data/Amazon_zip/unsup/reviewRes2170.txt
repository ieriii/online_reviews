I made my second trip to Hot Doug's on a Saturday morning. Little did I know that there was a long line at 11:30am. Despite the long drive to get to this place, we decided to stand in line and wait....and we waited for 1.5 hours.  Finally after a little past 1pm, we were able to order our 3 special dogs: Uber Garlic, Today's special (which I can't remember), and the celebrity sausage that just melted in our mouth. Plus, we finally got the duck fat fries!! All I have to say, despite the long wait, it was worthwhile! You can't find any place like Hot Doug's!!!
