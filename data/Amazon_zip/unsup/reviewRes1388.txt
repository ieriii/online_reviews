It's the experience & the flavor that keeps you coming back for more! Doug is always calm & friendly when taking your order despite the seemingly endless line of hungry diners! (If you're impatient don't bother b/c you won't like the wait!) If you can work out the perfect strategy to line-up time you're all set, somewhere between your 1st hunger-pang & ravenous is the perfect time to saunter up! By the time you hit the counter, VIOLA! Today I tried the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage w/ truffle aioli, foie gras mousse & sel gris. If I had been paying attention I'd have asked them to nix the "sel gris" (white salt)- it was a bit too much for me! I dig their interesting take on the sausage! I'll be back.... PS: Mr. Doug Sir, ORDER MORE T-SHIRTS.... PLEASE!
