Had dinner here on date night and it was a good choice. We were there a little early and the place was empty, but by the time we left around 8, it was full- on a week night.  The food is unquestionably the reason my rating is so high. I ordered pad se ewe and my date ordered red curry (both with chicken). We each ate some of both and we both thoroughly enjoyed both dishes. Wish I has seen so many positive reviews of the crab rangoon, we might have tried it. Service was fine. I did feel a little like we were being pushed to leave after we paid, but we were in a discussion that wasn't finished and the server seemed annoyed. Tables were a little close for my comfort, but otherwise I liked the decor. Go for the food!
