BEST DEEP-DISH in Chicago. I have had it everywhere, and actually quite enjoyed it everywhere, so if you like deep dish you can't go wrong. I don't recommend eating at the restaurant, it's small, it's just not a nice space, however, for delivery this is THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO. I have been taste-testing for years (and running marathons just to off set the damage) but Art of Pizza is the only deep dish I crave anymore. Just eat it.
