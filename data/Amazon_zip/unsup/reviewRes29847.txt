I FINALLY got to eat at a Rick Bayless restaurant, yes! Was it all I had hoped for? Pretty much. But I can't quite give it 5 stars. I have serious respect for Rick for being somewhat of a pioneer of Mexican fine dining, but I feel like a lot of what you are paying for is just that, the name. The food was very good, but not out of this world. The guacamole and salsas are delicious, as are the side plantains with sour cream and queso... creamy and amazing. My flank steak and corn tamales entree was good, but the sweet corn tamales were a little too sweet for my tastes, though still good. I felt the grilled knob onions were undercooked... they were still a little too crunchy, it wasn't enjoyable to eat them so I only ate one. The steak was perfectly cooked, but not really served warm, and a little underwhelming. Again, I felt like $30 for a small serving of steak just wasn't worth it. I left feeling very full, but something was missing... Next time I'll have to try the specials, as they are probably just that...... special! Service was good enough (though a little slow), and we were seated right away since we decided to sit outside. All in all, I'm glad I finally went. I really respect the use of fresh ingredients and authentic cooking styles.  I would go back for a special occasion, but until then my local taqueria will have to do!
