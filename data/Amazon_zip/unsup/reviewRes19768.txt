This might not have been the right place to go after day 1 of Lollapalooza, but it's where my group chose to go. We ordered a selection of appetizers and two entrees to split among the tables. The Good - the scallops were melt in your mouth delicious. Also good - the fish and chips. However, the cheese plate and oysters were just average.  The basement is cool and has a private room which would probably be good for a private party.
