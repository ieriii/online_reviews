Bartenders are outstanding, decor and staff are outstanding, valet service is outstanding and fairly well priced at 12$. Steak... specifically the rib eye is redonkulous. Creamed spinish is rich and an outstanding shade of bitter in a good way, very earthy.I will go here a few times a year until the butter covered steaks kill me.
