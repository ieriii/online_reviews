Although I live in the neighborhood, I rarely go down Clyborn and luckily for me I discovered this gem driving around seeking food on Christmas day. I had the pork sandwich, and it was one of the best I have had in the city. Relatively lean for pork, the meat was tender and delicately seasoned. The green plantain chips were fresh and crisp. My Cuban tamale appetizer was overpriced at $3 and less tasty than its Mexican brethren but good enough for me to finish. Cafe con leche was well done too. I wish there were tables instead of just bar stools to sit on. Although the menu is extremely limited, I will definitely be back for my Cuban sandwich fix.
