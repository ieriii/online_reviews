I'm not a huge hot dog fan, but Hot Doug's is pretty amazing. I would recommend not going on a weekend unless you are in line when they open the doors. Our first attempt was foiled after waiting for an hour and only moving maybe 5 people deep in the line. We went back on a Monday morning before noon. I couldn't believe a line was already forming on a week day. After eating here, I can see why. Doug is really great about explaining what extras should put on your hot dog selection to guarantee an explosion in your mouth. While the Chicago style hot dog is an easy choice, don't neglect the specials board. Everything our table ordered was delicious. For a hot dog joint, I was really impressed. I give four stars only because the wait was so insane the first time we went. And did I mention how cheap the food is? Three of us ate for less than $15. It was ridiculous.
