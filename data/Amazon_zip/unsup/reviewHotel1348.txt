We had a great stay here and the price was very reasonable. We stayed for 4 days/3 nights on the weekend. The room was always clean and the bed was so comfortable. The shower with the waterfall and detachable spray-head were great! Our concierge Sheryl W. was an absolute pleasure! She got us reservations and wonderful restaurants that we all enjoyed. All 6 of us guys and gals really enjoyed ourselves! The two bartenders are a kick! Be sure and call "Floyd" by his psuedo name "RICO!" (As in Rico Suave)! This place was located in a great part of Chicago. We practically walked everywhere! Even to the Shedd's Sea Aquarium! I highly recommend staying here on your next visit.
