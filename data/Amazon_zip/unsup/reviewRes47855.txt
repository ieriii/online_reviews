Perfect for a girls night out, their wine room is ultra swanky and the food smells so good, even if you had no plans to eat here and were just in for drinks you will be wooed into dining just by the sensory overload as you smell and see the delicious food going past you. Once you dine, you will want more and more and more. There are so many options here even for the pickiest of eaters. There is a fun roofdeck lounge and inside, the various rooms and lounges have the coolest accents - including fire!
