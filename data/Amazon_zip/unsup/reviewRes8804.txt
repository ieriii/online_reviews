Best Middle Eastern food I've had ever! Luckily I live close by :) I recommend the POMEGRANATE WINGS as your appetizer and if you're on a budget like me, I also recommend sharing the Noon O Three because it's huge. If you have room for dessert, they're chocolate hazelnut bastani (Persian Gelato) is yummy! I also suggest if you can take public transportaion (i.e. Brown Line) do it because parking is just bad.
