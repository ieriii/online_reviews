I didn't try the Pho and I should have. I had a rice, shrimp, and sausage dish that was good at the time, but the after taste was not so good. I wish I would have known that it was BYOB too... They were packed the night we went and we waited for about 15/20 minutes but we got our own table. Everyone seems to really like it, I just think I had the wrong dinner choice. I should have tried the Pho. UGH! It's pretty small, service is good and fast. I'd try it again
