It's fun. You're paying for fun. No, it's not the cheapest hot dog in the city... far from it. Is it the best hot dog in the city? No... not the best (actually they are the slightly fatter Vienna Beef dogs... I prefer the thinner ones...). But it is good... except the fried vegetables... yikes!... but again, you aren't there just to eat. It's a fun place to go to sit it in your car and people watch.... though you may come to the conclusion I did that everyone who eats there is fat; myself included... They have fun old time graphics, the food comes in great retro cardboard boxes, people often drive classic cars there to show them off... then you have the bizarre dancing/blinking hot dog people on top of the restaurant... It's a fun place to take the kids for ice cream. It is also obviously a mom and pop owned place and you get that feel... much different from a Sonic or A&W or other chain drive-ins... You get the feeling it is an old Chicago tradition. It's officially summer if we are eating at Superdawg. It is worth the fun. REMINDER: It's CASH only... but they do have an ATM inside.
