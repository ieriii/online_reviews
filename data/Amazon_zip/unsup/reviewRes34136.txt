My roommate and I were in Chicago this past weekend and Yolk was recommended to us buy our concierge. She offered her card and told us to give that to our host at Yolk in order to receive priority seating. The Sunday crowd was in full swing when we arrived. We walked in, gave our names, and flashed the business card. I suppose it worked...we were seated within 15 minutes, and at a booth no less. The food was good...not amazing, but good. They have several types of bread that they use for french toast. I ordered a french toasted cinnamon roll...it was delicious actually. Coffee was decent, and the service was friendly and efficient.
