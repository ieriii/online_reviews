It's not very often that you can go to a diner for a good meal and not want to kill yourself afterward from the lump of grease that you now have sitting in your stomach. The Chicago Diner combines a diner-y atmosphere with delicious, wholesome, and VEGAN food! They have all the diner favorites: milkshakes, burgers, Ruben sandwiches...you name it, but everything is made vegan (though you can choose real cheese and milk if you wish) and 1000000 times more delicious! I went during a busy dinner time and was nervous because it looked packed, but they are very good at monitoring time for seating (very friendly about it as well) and we were actually seated in about 10 minutes! I can't wait to go back and try more!
