Everyone in Chicago loves Hot Doug's. The food is always stellar. Always. I have been there countless times. If you are a Hot Dougs novice, you may drive up and see that incredibly long line out front and think, "Oh I can wait, it must be worth it". Look. The hot dogs are worth the wait. They really are. But seriously, don't wait. If you are smart you can drive by every now and then and sometimes there won't be a line. Go then. Because then you can sit down and enjoy your gourmet hot dog. When there's a line halfway down the block, and you finally get in there, there won't be anywhere to sit. So you end up standing around in an incredibly packed room like a jack-a**, staring at people sitting and eating, hoping someone will get up. But they won't. And your food will get cold. And then it won't really be an awesome, memorable, truly great Hot Doug's experience. Take my advice. You don't know me, but believe me. I wouldn't lie to you. Don't wait in that crazy line. Drive by every few weeks and eventually you will time it right and get lucky and you'll thank me.
