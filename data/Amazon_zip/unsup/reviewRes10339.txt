The food was in average good, not great. The service needs some serious help. Wine selection is ample, but again, the server either needs training, or he needs to know when to call a sommelier. The "Sapore" di Mare was excellent in taste. Definitely generous on the saffron, which made up for the thick, stew-like consistency.  The Salmone was good. The mille-fleur is excellent. The overall experience was ok, however definitely expected more from the service. The restaurant is very well lit, decorated and presented. Makes you want to expect more.
