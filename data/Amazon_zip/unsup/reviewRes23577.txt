Went on a Friday. I showed up a bit early, about 5:55 and the place seemed pretty empty. By the time my date arrived, 15 minutes later, it was almost full. Popular place. My stuff loin of lamb was delicious. I could only finish two of the three pieces. Blast my lack of self-restraint and free bread with olive oil sauce (which they seem to be proud of). Most of the wine was decently priced ($6 for a glass, $27 for a bottle) and tasted good. I can walk here from work, so I'll probably be back.
