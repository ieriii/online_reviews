I stayed here for 2 nights last weekend and it was great!Staff was super friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was honestly the most comfortable bed I have slept in in a long time. I slept like a baby. The design of the hotel itself is beautiful and full of history. Loved my stay here!
