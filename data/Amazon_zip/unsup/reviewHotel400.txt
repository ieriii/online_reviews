I have only stayed here once, but will return for sure. The price was reasonable and the accomedations were fantastic. Every employee was polite and greeted us in the hallways. Check in was quick and we were given a corner room with no traffic in the hallway. The room was clean and comfortable and had a tremendous view. I really can not wait to go back!
