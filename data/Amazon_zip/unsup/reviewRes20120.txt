With so many reviews I doubt I can write anything new and insightful. The only thing I can say is JUST GO! I considered this place the best dinner location in Chicago when I was there. Things I recommend..... Antelope tar-tare, Fish & Chips, and the burger. I only went once but wish I could have spend more evenings and meals there. The only disclaimer to add...the place is not cheap so bring your money!
