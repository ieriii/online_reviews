Best gourmet hot dog/sausage dog place in the entire world. I'm from California and have probably eaten here more than most Chicagoans. I am 5ft tall and weigh 100 pounds...and when I come here I will be sure to order at least three dogs off the special menu. The Foie Gras is my favorite and a must try!! BTW - Ate at Hot Doug's rival Frank N Dawgs and that place was absolutely disgusting. Hot Doug's all the way baby!!!!
