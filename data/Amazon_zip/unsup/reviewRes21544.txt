Haha... I irritated my dad when I asked him to drive from downtown Chicago to this place. None of us expected the journey to be so far! That night, we didn't end up going! Needless to say my dad got frustrated and said: "I'll get you all the Costco hot dogs you want later!!!" Hahaha... Didn't matter, I was set on trying this place. So the next day when the family went shopping I hopped on the train, sat for nearly 45 minutes, transferred to the bus and walked 4 blocks to try these acclaimed dogs. It was worth the trek! I ordered the superdawg on the poppy seed bun with all the trimmings and crinkle-cut fries and well, sorry Weinerschnitzel you've got nothing on these dogs! I was satisfied. Now for all you going on a trip, I wouldn't recommend taking the 1.5 hour journey I did but if you're in the neighborhood definitely come by for a taste!
