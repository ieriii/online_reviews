Greek Islands is one of the better restaurants in Greektown, and its giant name-emblazoned water tower advertises this fact as far away as the Loop. The saganaki is pretty good, and definitely theatrical. I'm not sold on the atmosphere though. The restaurant is divided into several rooms, and depending on capacity, only some of the rooms may be opened. Each individual room may be relatively occupied, but when you see four rooms completely empty, it takes away from that. I had a lamb leg once that was so good. The meat just fell off the bone. The seafood kabobs are also pretty good, but make sure to squeeze the lemon on it liberally as the fish can be a bit dry.
