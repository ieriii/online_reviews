Summation: Excellent food, location & ambiance, great for a date or small dinner group. However....expensive, slow service. "The Bad"? Price. If its Friday night and you just got paid, well, then this may be the spot if you're looking to drop some cash. Why so much? Because if you're coming with a serious appetite, you'll have to get a fairly large amount of plates to split amongst your group. (And heck, with the awesome menu you'll be hard pressed to NOT want to get a lot.) Another downer was the PACE of the service. Our server was actually extremely knowledgeable about both wine and food choices, but we were there for lunch with a business group that obviously couldn't lounge around all afternoon. We actually cancelled our dessert order because it was taking too dang long. So...enough Negative Nancy....what about "The Good"?? The creativity and care that goes into each delicate dish is quite obvious. Their entire menu really plays well on combining sweet and savory into one dish, and using slightly unusual ingredients to bump up the otherwise norm (i.e. using duck egg instead of a chicken egg...simple things like that). The breadth of offerings is pretty generous and their wine selection is FAB! Here were my favorites: -Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette ("Beets? Really?" YES. REALLY.) -Prosciutto Bread Balls -Jamon Serrano with Duck Egg, Asparagus & Grilled Bread -Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese Oolala! Yum!
