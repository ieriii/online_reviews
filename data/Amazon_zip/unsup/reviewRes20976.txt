Stopped in on a weekday evening to experience the place everyone's raving about but I was not impressed. There were a couple of issues with the experience. I don't like the set up of having to wait until a table opens up before you're able to place an order. The food was really not that great. I had the Gunthrop Chicken torta and I have to say that I expected more. I can't believe people would give this place such great reviews simply because of the name of the owner. The only thing I can give them credit for is the beverages. They had some delicious cucumber and lime drink and the hot chocolate was also yummm.
