i went here with a couple of friends during my last trip to Chicago and i have to say that this was so far the best place i have been to in the windy city. i will admit that this is partly due to the group we had. but i really liked the place. the waiters were nice and fun, the decor was different, and the food, well the food was a-ok, not fantastic or great, but good -- and i should add that i rarely find asian restaurants that blow me away, there is usually just too much going on in terms of flavors and ingredients. that said this place has a good wine list, and a good cross section of different asian styles with a focus on vietnamese. if i had to find a place to go to with a group for a fun dinner and i would certainly go back.
