I am so glad we picked this place for dinner last night! We are always in search of really great pizza, this place with it's brick oven Neapolitan style pizza, I feel in love. We arrive and it's slammed, line out the door style, and we put our name in and wait, review the menu and chat about the breathtaking brick oven with exquisite glass tiles. By far the pretties oven I have ever seen. The fresh baked dough smell is so warm and inviting! The owner is passing out herb and oil dough and pieces of cheese to everyone who waits which was unexpected and very very thoughtful. A good business knows free stuff goes a long way! The table turned quickly, I am sure I could spend hours just drinking the sweet Italian beers and eating and talking. I also am very impressed with the simple menu, it had a hand full of pizzas a couple specials and a hand full of antipasto, which usually means what they do they do right! I had the Bianco Nero: Pecorino with black truffle, fior di latte mozzarella, porcini mushrooms, white truffle oil, and olive oil Which was a mushroom kick, very flavorful and earth. Mr had the Funghi e Salsiccia Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Basil, Mushrooms, Italian Sausage We didn't even peek at the desert menu, we were happy with our parting gift of a free cannoli and can not wait to go back.
