My colleague called in the afternoon to get the low down on what things were like. They told us to be there by 4:45 because people stand and line up - "for a restaurant", I thought. Well, they were right. We arrived at 5:30-5:45 and there was an hour wait for the dining room. We decided to sit in the bar area (full service and everything) and had a great time. I started with a mojito with sangrita - I'm a huge fan of spice/heat and this hit the spot. If you're the experimental type, I'd say to go for it. Imagine a mojito with a light drop of tomato juice, tabasco, and lime juice - a piece of hot heaven in a glass! We shared some homemade guac that was chunky and fresh. Along with that came these two tiny bowls of salsa (green and red) but the guy next to us got a big bowl. Not sure why the variance but whatever - maybe he knew someone! My entree was amazing. Puerco en Mole de Calabaza - pork with pumpkin mole along with roasted butternut squash - an elegant pairing. I had some heat which was great in my boat. The (what felt like) handmade tortilla's were nice too - helped clean up the little bits on my plate! Dessert was from the Topolobampo menu (yes - you can do that too, just ask). Chocolate Mole cake with peanut butter ice cream - rich but elegant - can share this one nicely. My suggestion - give it a try - you'll like it! Arrive early because it gets crowded very quickly!
