Really loved having brunch here. The food is good without being served in overwhelming quantities. I had the Marrakech crepe and it was like brunch-heaven in my mouth and not to mention the liquor store right across the street, so that if you want to celebrate at this BYOB, you aren't even charged a corkage fee!! Will definitely visit this again :)
