Tapas are tricky as although I love the idea, I rarely find dished that jump out at me. This place was great. Nice ambiance....hidden because its upstairs. Amazing food and service. Nothing we tried was bad. Butternut squash ravioli and the lamb that doesn't come in sauce was amazing. The desserts are not your typical Latin flare with flan or fried ice cream. I had the hazelnut sliver, which was YUM. Im not too familiar with Spanish wines, so of course I stuck the syrah's and they were great.
