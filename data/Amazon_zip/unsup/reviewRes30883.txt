Sunda is AMAZING. The food is excellent - At first when I saw the menu I thought I'd never find anything I liked b/c I'm a little picky, but when you really start reading and talking to the server you will find tons of delicious sounding items. Everything tastes really fresh and actually HAS taste and flavor - you can just tell it's high quality food. The sushi was outstanding and original without being over the top crazy.  Also, for such a new, busy "hot spot," our service was excellent - we had a party of seven people and were a bit needy, but our waiter was patient, had great recommendations for food and drinks, and was really friendly...except that he wouldn't tell us Adrian Grenier was there while we were! Can't wait to go back!!
