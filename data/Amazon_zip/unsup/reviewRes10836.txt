Fell in LOVE with Piece when I first moved to Wicker Park a few years ago, and have been going back ever since. The pizza is absolutely delicious- the ingredients are perfectly proportioned and every bite is a good as the last. Plus the crust in nice and light so you won't walk out feeling like you have a dumbbell in your stomach is you overindulge. The beers are all fabulous; I have yet to taste one I didn't enjoy. If the beer list intimidates you, don't be afraid to ask your server for a recommendation or a taste of a draft you're curious about. The only reason Piece doesn't get all 5 stars is this place is constantly operating at max decibels. I am over the college-bar, screaming-at-the person-next-to-me-just-to-be-heard scene. (Though the pro to this is you get to pick up on some always-interesting conversations that are being yelled across the neighboring table...makes the night a little more interesting!) So, if you're looking for a chill place to chat and grab a few beers and a za, this isn't it. But definitely give this place a try. Even if you're a crochety old lady like me - buy a pair of earplugs and suck it up. You won't regret it!
