Oh man, this place is delicious. I always bring people here because brunch is not your standard omelettes and toast. Southern flair and good for both meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The black beans cakes with roasted red pepper sauce is AMAZING (They have a vegan option mango salsa as well) and that coffee milkshakey drink is probably one of the most ridiculously delicious treats and will jack you up for the rest of the day. They always let me trade out my homefries for sauteed spinach and the decor cracks my shit up. Fun for groups if you don't mind the wait. I have never brought anyone here and heard a bad thing about their breaskfast. Just a whole lot of full and happy people leaving that place. De-licious.
