This place rocked pretty hard. The food was great, the atmosphere was creative and interesting, and the prices were reasonable. If it weren't for the surprisingly lackluster service they'd get 5 stars from me. I went to Gino's East a few days after my experience with Giordano's and I can say with full confidence that Gino's won hands down. The sauce tasted fresher, the crust had a better texture, the toppings were better, it really bested giordano's in every way.  And the atmosphere was pretty sweet. Over the years they've been letting people write whatever they want on the walls and booths so everything is covered with graffiti. It looks better than you'd think and gives a modern look to a restaurant that's probably been around for a while. But our server was just plain bad. She refilled our drinks maybe once over the course of the meal and was never around when we needed her. She brought out the wrong dressings with our salad and when we flagged her down and notified her of this she said, "Oh yeah I forgot your dressings so I just gave you all italian". What? And you didn't mention that when you dropped the salad off? So, weird service, but the food was great and truly worthy of the chicago deep-dish reputation. I'll definitely go there again when I'm in Chicago.
