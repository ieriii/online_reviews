Once again I think the hype is the Publican's greatest downfall. The spicy pork rinds were cut too big so it wasn't as crispy as should be. The food network let me down on this one. I did not enjoy the egg w/ fries at all. The fries were bland and pretty boring. The crispy headcheese was my absolute favorite dish and I'm pretty (secretly) happy my friend had no idea that headcheese contained no cheese and then refused to eat any of it after I told her what it actually was! SCORE :) The ribs are NOT ribs...they're more like pork chops and were actually very good with the ramps from the headcheese plate. The beer selection was fantastic and I could drink gallons of the Hairy Eyeball. GALLONS.
