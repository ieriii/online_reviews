Tried Mercat a la Planxa during restaurant week for lunch and was pleasantly surprised! Lunch is a great value, the catalan express (2 courses and soda for $18 or $22) is pretty filling even though it's a tapas restaurant. Go with a group of people and share the courses so you can try everything! My favorite so far, the mushroom soup!
