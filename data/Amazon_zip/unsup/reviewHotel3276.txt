It was just OK. I booked my stay at the Hard Rock through http://Hotwire.com and scored the room for $129 a night..I stayed for four nights and for the price it was OK. Their lobby is very small and the bar is nothing special.  Really, I expected so much more. The location though is perfect. It's close to Millenium park and at the south end of the Magnificent Mile. Service was also just fine. Overall, I probably wouldn't stay here cause it really was nothing special.
