The food is delicious and authentic. I had the pot stickers and dried chili chicken. This was enough food to feed two people and it was affordable. They serve you free hot tea. Sodas come in cans, and they charge you $1 for a small bowl of rice that they bring to you without asking. The service is rather poor. They really ought to hire more people. If I wasn't trying to kill some time in the first place I would've been upset at how long it took to get in and out.
