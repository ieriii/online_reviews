Awesome dinners but I most recently went for brunch so I'll just talk about that.  I got there at 2:30 and had some drinks first so by the time we actually ate it was late -- and they are forgiven for running out of the whole left side of the menu.  So I got lunch instead. Reluctantly got a Pork Belly BLT (really wanted crab benedict!) -- It was very impressive. "Swan Creek Pork Belly Blt, Arugula, Tomato Fennel Jam, Pickled Red Onion, Secret Sauce" The name's a little misleading (there is not bacon just a fat slice of delicious pork belly). The pork belly is absolutely perfectly cooked and the toppings are a great match, the tomato fennel jam & pickled red onions cutting through that fatty pork belly just enough.
