The menu here is very difficult: you'll have a hard time deciding between what you'll order and what you hope will still be on the menu for your next visit. Of the cocktails I had the Julep De Chambly was my favorite. For my starter I had the tete du cochon. This dish was very rich and I thought it was very nice. For my main I had the roasted leg of venison. It was cooked to perfection: rare so that it was tender despite the leanness. There was only a hint of gaminess. It was served atop a very savory bacon risotto, and a sauce with a very nice nutty flavor. My dinner companion and I shared our desserts: the fernet pave, and the terrine. Both were amazing, but I'd have to tip my hat to the fernet pave: great combination of flavors and textures.
