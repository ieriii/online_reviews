We came here with a Opentable coupon before it expired. I've never heard of it before but I was thoroughly impressed. It's a very small space and no name on the front so definitely hard to find. We were asked many times for any dietary restrictions as they only offer prix fixe. I couldn't eat any raw or undercooked food as I'm pregnant. It was a bit odd when we sat down, there was no menu, no drink menu nothing. We realize it's BYOB, but they don't serve any drinks (soda, juice) other than water and coffee. So we asked the waiter what's on the menu so he gave us a rundown. The waiter didn't mention the duck 3 ways but my husband saw it on the website so he ordered that too. Each dish was tasty and beautiful to look at. For me, they replaced the first item - a yellowtail sashimi dish for a celery soup (yum!) and a rabbit dish for artichoke hearts (which I didn't think was a good substitute), and a tobacco ice cream for espresso ice cream. My favorite was the duck 3 ways and the wagyu beef which actually tasted like real wagyu because of how it just melted in your mouth. The desserts had inventive unique flavors that was still tasty. For example, there was tobacco flavored ice cream, which seemed to go well with the sweet beet sauce. Highly recommend as a place to try. You'll be surprised.
