I came here for a department dinner a few weeks ago since some of our staff was in from the UK and Singapore. There was about 11 or so of us and if its one thing I hate is eating with a big group. However, we had two servers attending to our table and they were phenomenal! Suggestions for drinks - pomegranate martini. I ordered the petite fillet which was delicious. Our table ordered several sides to share (which I suggest you do the same! They're huge sides), all of which were good; asparagus, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and creamed spinach are the good ones I can recall. Do yourself a favor and order the butter cake for dessert. I can't even hardly explain how delicious this cake was. Everyone in my department is still raving about it. I should probably also mention we had the seafood tower for an appetizer which included oysters, lobster, crab legs and shrimp. I can't gage a price for anything nor do I want to since my employer picked up the tab.
