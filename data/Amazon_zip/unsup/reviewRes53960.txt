Loved it!!! Went to 90 Miles on Clybourn with me foodie partner & son Steve & was very impressed. We shared 1 cuban & 1 bistec sandwich & ordered the mariquitas (plantain chips) and headed outside to eat...what a nice surprise we got with every bite. We have never been to Miami for a cuban but we know what we like & we liked it all. I remember the nasty hotdog stand that used to be in that location so my expectations were not all that high but I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience, the service was a 10, the food was a 10 & the outside cafe was a 10 as well. I would suggest you get the garlic sauce that they serve with the plantain chips on the side because it is a bit much when put directly on the chips but other then that a perfect 10!!
