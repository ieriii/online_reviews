When in a major city for a work obligation...make it count! That is just what I did in going to TRU. I enjoyed the Grand Collection, which was superb! My favorites were the farm ricotta and corn agnolotti with burgundy truffle consomme and the glazed veal ribeye with spring garlic, asparagus and wild mushrooms. I allowed the sommelier to pair my courses. The Knoll Riesling was incredible. I am very pleased that I added the cheese course, which was perfect.I enjoyed watching the impeccable simultaneous service for parties larger than just one...which I was...just one. As a lone diner it would have been lovely if the staff had of broken character a bit and been more personable, but they were efficient and friendly...to a point. I felt comfortable enough to have enjoyed myself immensely. It was a fantastic indulgence and I feel grateful that this is not my usual dining experience....I appreciated it all the more for that.One last thought...as a lone diner in a large city...seeing a familiar wine on the list is like seeing an old friend and suddenly one doesn't feel so alone after all...
