Very good authentic Mexican in a family atmosphere. From the pictures on the wall to the story on the menu, you can certainly feel the influence of family at Nuevo Leon. This love permeates into the various dishes offered.d I had the Machacado con Huevo a la Mexican, and it was very tasty. The seasoned shredded steak scrambled with egg made for a perfect breakfast. I also tried the Queso Panela appetizer which was excellent. Fresh salsa, delicious tortilla chips, and homemade corn tortillas rounded out a great meal. Nuevo Leon does get very busy on the weekends, so get there before 9:30 - 10:00 or be prepared to wait. The line was out the door when we left at 11:30.
