This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE only: I live across the street from this place and eat here often. Usually, i just get the pizza for carry out. I HATE the fact that they want to charge you for gardinaire peppers when their counterparts in the suburbs are so friendly about it. This place specifically really needs to work on its customer service. When you're charging 22 dollars for a large stuffed spinach, a small cup of gardinaire isn't going to kill you, and you can't count it as a topping since my g/f only wants it for her slices (2).  Secondly, I ate there last night on a dine in basis, and the service was also horrible. I left a note at the end that said "Why your tip stinks" and I listed the following reasons: They never refilled my water.  I asked for gardinaire peppers, they said sure, and never once returned. Not once during my meal did she come around and ask "How's everything going?" You MUST have some service like any restaurant! And for those of you who are wondering, yes, their pizza is really good. i get the stuffed spinach and it always rocks. The lesson from all of this is try to do carry out or delivery. You get the good pizza, and not the sucky service.
