Let me just say that join to The Bongo Room is an experience that I will never forget. My friend and I make join for pancakes an event, a girls night out. Honestly I may never be able to go to iHop again.   Anyway we got to The Bongo Room in Wicker Park around 10 and had to wait about ten minutes. By the time we left, the line was out the door. Word to the wise, get there early. One look at the menu and you know The Bongo Room is far from normal. We ended up ordering bacon and banana pancakes & pumpkin and chocolate cheesecake pancakes. They were both delicious. strange, but delicious. Also the coffee and service were excellent.Why only 4 stars?? because I am a college student and one breakfast of only pancakes (albeit large orders of pancakes) and coffee was close to 30 dollars. This place is nice for a special occasion but is impractical for any student or family on a budget. That said I would definitely make a plan and go back. also I will tell everyone about my amazing banana and bacon pancakes. If only to see their faces.
