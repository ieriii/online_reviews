One of my most favorite places in the city to dine. I have never eaten in the main dining room. We always enjoy sitting at the bar. I have probably eaten there at least 10 times and have never had one bad experience. The bartenders are always very attentive and make really good recommendations on what to get if you are unsure. The oysters are always fresh as well as all the other seafood. They make a mean martini. I forget what days, but they have live music in the evenings.
