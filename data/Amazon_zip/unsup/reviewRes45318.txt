Alright, Wilde is good, but I retract my 5-star review, it ain't that good.  I know they have changed he menu a bit over the years, and in my opinion they got rid of some of the inspired dishes, and kept the boring ones. It is still a solid place to eat a little too much food for a pretty decent price.
