It's true. Alinea is truly spectacular. My friend and I partook in their longer tour menu which lasted 4 hours and there was never a dull moment. I won't go in depth with each course because other reviews have done so, but also because I believe that anticipation of each course adds to the experience. I didn't want to like Alinea because I thought it was overrated, but it was without a doubt worth every single penny and one of the best dining experiences of my life. There are theatrics to each course and requiring active participation makes you enjoy the meal that much more. I will also say that Chef Achatz is a genius who has put much thought and deliberation into every aspect of his restaurant from the menu to the restaurant name, the font, everything. He has created a new standard for what it really means to be a chef. Please go try Alinea because it's unlike anything you've ever had before and will create a new viewpoint on what culinary is.
