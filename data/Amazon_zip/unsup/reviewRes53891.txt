This is a review of the management. I went in for an interview and soon realized that it was basically a cattle call. The manager was rude, condescending, and if this is the way he treats prospective employees, I can only imagine how he treats everyone else. I would never eat here and would recommend everyone else not to since this guy was such a jerk.
