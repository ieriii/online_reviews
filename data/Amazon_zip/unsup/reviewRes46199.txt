The problem here is I totally didn't realize that this place was run by Cheesecake Factory. Til I got there. It seemed "familiar" and then when they brought the bread out and the ridiculously long menu with entirely too many choices it dawned on me... this is the same as Cheesecake Factory. I don't know why the branding change, because it is literally the same food. It was good, but I still don't quite understand why they just don't keep the Cheesecake name... is this supposed to somehow be up-market or something? Now that I come to think of it, I can't remember how much I paid versus the Cheesecake Factory. Hmm. I should check that out.
