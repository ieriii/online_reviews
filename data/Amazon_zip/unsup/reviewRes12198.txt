The first time I stepped into Cafe 28 was on a late Sunday morning in June. I woke up craving something savory, and felt bored with the crowded brunch spots I usually frequent. The entrance was small, warmly lit by the sun and casual.The bartender greeted my guest and I right away, and offered me a glass of water before running off to grab a hostess. There a few Mexican ladies quietly chatting in the parlor, someone playing the Spanish guitar in a second room and a buzzing sound from plug-in fans. I loved the ambiance. Overall the indoor dining areas are dim, decorated with exposed brick, wood, and colorful, slightly peeled paint. I remember loving how hushed it all felt. Especially for brunch or breakfast. It's so nice to be able to hear your guest's conversation, the kitchen, even the tinkling of the ice in your glass. I've been twice now, and I've ordered the Serrano and Asparagus Eggs Benedict and the Chilaquiles. I also ordered the Taste of Cuba, Cuban cafe con leche and the Caipirinha, which was pleasant. The Chilaquiles really hit the spot. They weren't too spicy--which I like. The chicken was a bit dry and didn't come shredded, but it was still pretty good dipped in sour cream. I was in a forgiving mood. The croquetas in the Taste of Cuba were the stars of the show. They seemed homemade, were perfectly fried and served up with a spicy-lemony dip. They also came with mariquitas. Yum. The Serrano Eggs Benedict was also a pleasant departure from the classic. Nothing really Cuban or Mexican about it, but I applaud the presence of variety. The hollandaise was memorable. I love this place, and I recommend it for Brunch. Just know that it's more homestyle, comfort food than...a real exercise in gastronomical hoop-lah. B- for Cubanity factor. A+ for mood.
