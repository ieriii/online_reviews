I was excited to come here - pretentious comments or not. We went on a Friday night, waited a short time in line, and the gentleman at the door was exceptionally kind and respectful to our group of ladies. Once we entered through the velvet curtains and were seated, it was downhill from there. The indy music they were playing was LOUD. As in, we couldn't hear one another speaking across the teeny table, and it wasn't even that much better sitting next to one another. So unnecessary and took away from the very cool space w/ its low lighting, chandeliers, etc.  Above is why I gave it 2 stars....the other 3 got lost below: Our waitress was incredibly rude and MIA most of the time. I asked for vodka recommendations other than the 3 on the menu (our fabulous waiter at Patterson House, a very similar concept locale in Nashville had a bunch for us) - this girl had only one...and made it obvious she wasn't thrilled at having to actually think about anything. I asked for a menu, which came promptly from another person and I waited more than 15 minutes for the waitress to come back and take my order. I ordered the tomato tart. It was smaller than your average piece of pita bread, had about 5 tomatoes, hardly any ricotta and was priced far too high for something that definitely could not be shared. Glad I went, but unfortunately I will not be back anytime soon.
