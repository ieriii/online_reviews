Definitely the best sushi/Asian restaurant I have ever been to. The prices are incredibly reasonable and everything we tried was just amazing!! I highly recommend the crab-crusted ahi tuna as well as the white tuna. For dessert we had the banana dessert and this huge dessert with different candy bars/caramel, etc. The waitstaff is incredible. You have about 5 people waiting on you at a time and everyone is extremely friendly. Super trendy, great location, and the decor is awesome. I ate their last week and met the chef who is a sweetheart :)  highly recommend!!!
