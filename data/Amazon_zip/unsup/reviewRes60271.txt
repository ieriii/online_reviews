So, you know how awkward it is to go to an old fashioned record store, walking in and looking around and awkwardly thumbing through the first shelf you come to in an effort to fervently divert your eyes from the scornful gazes of a half dozen snotty and ticked off for no reason hipster clerks? And then you discover that you're in front of a bunch of metal albums and you don't really listen to metal, you really want to find this old folk album from the 1990's and you don't know where the folk section is, and you get really nervous because those surly hipsters are still casting frown rays onto you and you suddenly feel like the stupidest, lamest person on the planet, and so you either leave without buying anything or grab the first thing that you see and take it home and never open it?This place is just like that record store, except it's a restaurant. The food's definitely decent, but the angry eye rolling hipster staff really take away from the overall experience.I usually order to go, in advance.
