Quite naturally one of the best restaurants in the downtown area. Sunda continues to amaze me with every visit; very delightful in its Asian-style decor, great menu, and genuine first class service. I had dinner reservations here with a friend a few night ago and from the moment we walked in, the hostesses were very warm and welcoming; And oddly enough, as we were about to be seated, I ran into US Congressman, Bill Foster, as he and his wife were departing. I met him roughly a year ago when I was a soldier in the military and he was visiting our armory in Elgin, IL. Nevertheless, surprisingly he remembered me as we chatted for a moment; fun times. Makes sense that Sunda was recently named the #6 celebrity hot-spot. :-) Okay, enough with my tangent... A few moments after being seated, the assistant GM - Kevin - came over and introduced himself and asked how our evening was going, among other things; very personable and accommodating; definitely a effort that should be modeled in other downtown restaurants. In terms of dinner, I can sometimes be indecisive when ordering appetizers and an entre, but our server - Ben - was very patient, knowledgable, and helpful with making great suggestions from their menu; which helps. Our food arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was very well prepared; not to mention very appetizing. Oh, and BTW, the presentation was an absolute plus. To conclude, we had a really great time while dining at Sunda and will definitely return in the near near future with other friends. This was my third visit and each time it gets better and better; so naturally I recommend dining here as soon as you can! You won't be disappointed! And if you're industry, as I am, they take extra care of you!! :-)
