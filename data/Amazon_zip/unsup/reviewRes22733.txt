OPA~!! I have a couple of Greek friends who say that this is the best Greek restaurant in Chicago. Done. When I am too busy to make moussaka from scratch and have a craving for Greek food, I head to Greek Islands. For large groups, they do family style servings which is great too. The kokkinisto, lamb in red sauce is great. As is the moussaka and dolmades. Before you come here, make sure you're REAL HUNGRY.
