Don't let Pequod's fly under your deep dish pizza radar!  I love pizza. I love deep dish pizza, and Pequod's is exceptional. The crust- the edges are super crispy and kind of carmelized but the bottom is thick and doughy. The sauce- Pequod's does not skimp on the sauce which I love, and the cheese is gooey and perfectly portioned to the amount of sauce on the pie.  I've eaten in and also had pizzas delivered. Either way, it is great! The service is wonderful, and the pizza is truly fantastic.
