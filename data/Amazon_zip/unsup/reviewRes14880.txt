I apologize if anyone made this assertion already but, "VIVA LA REVOLUTION (brewing co)!" I'm not into beer, but microbreweries tickle my fancy (in full disclosure: I did once interview for Anheiser-Busch, and tried my best to get that goat curse transferred to St. Louis when I didn't get the job). The beer here is delicious, as was the food! My Belgian Wit had the right amount of spice undertones, plus I scarfed down the mustard herb chicken and garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes despite it being my third meal in four hours! I even made an attempt at eating a lion's share of the cherry bourbon cake my table was splitting, but had to retreat when spoon-fighting began and my stomach threatened to leave me permanently if I had another bite. Patronize this place like Chicagoans patronize the voting booth: early and often.
