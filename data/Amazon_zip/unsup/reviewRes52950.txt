Went with a couple of my girlfriends and we sat outside on the back patio. It was beautiful weather outside and it had a very casual, friendly environment. Everyone was chatting and laughing. Although we didn't bring any wine with us, it IS BYOB so I'll be sure to bring some next time. I got the lechon (roast pork) dinner which came with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains. It was delicious and I had enough food to take home and eat as lunch the next day.
