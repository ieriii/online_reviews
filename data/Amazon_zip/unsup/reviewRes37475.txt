Hopleaf has great food. Fantastic beer selection. But I hate waiting for good food and good beer. I've been to Hopleaf several times. Each time, I've had to wait insanely long for a table-- even if we go during non-peak times. There's a tip for you-- there is no such thing as a non-peak time at Hopleaf. I've also gone upstairs and stood for a few hours in a shoulder -to-shoulder crowd while I attempted to enjoy my beer. A few years ago, I wouldn't mind driving out here and waiting for a long time for a table, because this place was so unique in Chicago. But now, there are so many great options for gastro-pubs in Chicago with extensive beer lists and great food, that I'll only venture to come out to Hopleaf once or twice a year.
