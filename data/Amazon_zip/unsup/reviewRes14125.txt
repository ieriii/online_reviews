Que paso, 90 Miles? This used to be a great spot for me to grab a hot cafe con leche and sandwich with impeccable service. Today we waited 30 minutes (seriously, 30 minutes) for food that ranged from totally fine to inedible. I'm chalking it up to a bad day in the kitchen, but I won't be going back for a long time. Sorry to say it.
