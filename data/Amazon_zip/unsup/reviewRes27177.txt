The atmosphere is a little bit loud and crowded, but that is a minor detail. The food was very good - if you are a fan of seafood, definitely order the oysters and ceviche. They were the highlight of my meal. I also had the drink, Jueves, which was delicious, and the enchiladas de mole for dinner, which were good.  I give it 4 stars because I prefer a little bit more of a sophisticated atmosphere, and I thought the mole could have been just a little bit tastier. Also, my enchiladas came with just a side of black beans - I guess I was just expecting something a bit more interesting for the entree. Very good value, and I would definitely go again (especially for the oysters and ceviche).
