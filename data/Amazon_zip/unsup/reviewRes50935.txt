Came here with my parents and brother and sister-in-law. Good space, and great location super close to the Paulina stop.  I went there when I still drank, and the micro brew selection was good and plentiful. I got the crawfish cakes, which were tasty, a little on the dry side. I tasted some of my mom's salmon cakes...eh, not so great, a lot on the dry side. price-wise, its fair, they're not going to gouge like some places do. Portions were good, and the service was also good, the food simply had no 'wow' factor. I've had better at many other places, but Wishbone is still a charming, mostly tasty, piece of Chicago. I guess I would recommend checking it out if you are by the Paulina stop on the Brown Line.
