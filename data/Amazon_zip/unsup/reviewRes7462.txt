Great BBq. Tied for first on the north side (not the best in the world). Go here if you don't feel like hiking up to Smoque. Definitely try the award winning ribs and the shoulder. Sauces were good and the bar atmosphere where I ate was cool. Can't attest to the main dining room. The prices were reasonable for the area which will be one of the reasons I return and feel comfortable giving it 4 stars. Although, having to pay a large premium for the award winning ribs seems rediculous.
