I was craving pizza last night after the museum so decided on Giordano's. There was a line out the door...I forgot it was Friday night. We decided to wait the 40 minutes and pre-ordered our pizza. They give you a cute pager to page you when your table is ready. We ordered a thin crust, half veggie half pepperoni. As soon as we sat down we were served water and asked if wanted anything else to drink. 6 minutes later our pizza arrived. Very good, very good indeed. There was a good amount of veggies on my half and they were fresh. Definately my favorite place for pizza. Worth the wait. While you wait for you table take a stroll outside and admire the fountain. LOL.
