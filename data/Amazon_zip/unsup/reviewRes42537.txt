Melty, greasy, thin or thick, this pizza makes the grade. I haven't been disappointed yet. Just so you know, their "thin" pizza isn't like crispy thin-crust as you may expect. It's more like regular pan pizza, maybe a tad thinner. I tend to pat the top of the slices with a napkin to catch the extra, unnecessary grease, but it's so yummy. Free liter of your choice of beverage (Pepsi products only) with the purchase of a pizza. I haven't tried any of their sandwiches yet, but the pizza rocks! There is a large seating area with TVs -- nothing special, just places to sit. I only get carry-out, and while it can get crowded at the pick-up counter any night of the week, it goes quickly and the staff is cool. Free parking in the small lot out front.
