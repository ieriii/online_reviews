I like Greek islands for what it is: conventional Greek food for a swarm of people. I have great memories of eating their oven baked lamb on my first trip to Chicago, so I'm sorta fond of the place. My last time here I tried a bunch of great appetizers--fried cheese and an eggplant dip being the standouts--but my keftedes(meatballs) were just plain. A plus: they remove the crumbs from your table fairly often which is unusual in this price category. Minus: the wait can be a drag.
