The bar is interesting obnoxious people watching. Thought the brussel sprout salad, sashimi and rolls were decent. I think I've had better sushi in Lincoln Park and Edgewater though and at the price point, you really can't justify coming here unless someone else is buying. For a catch-up dinner with a friend, I would have rather stuck with Kamahachi or even Japonais.
