This place kind of makes me sad for all of the other Argyle restaurants that seem to grovel at the feet of Tank while begging for leftover customers. It has pretty good pho (I don't really like their noodles) and a massive menu of tasty dishes. What I admire most about the place is it works like clockwork; it almost seems like an assembly line of sit-in food service. Step 1: Walk in restaurant and get seated immediately Step 2: Order your pho even before you sit down Step 3: Get your food before you even give back the menu to the waitress Step 4: Eat (if there's time) Step 5: Pay bill and leave Don't get me wrong, the place is fun and has good food. But I think I like it for other reasons, similar to the reason why I liked watching old footage of Ford production lines.
