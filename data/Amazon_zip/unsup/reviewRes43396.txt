This IS Chicago's best pizza hands-down. Noone else in the entire city can top their sauce which makes it so addicting. My husband and I have to fight the urge to have it more than once a week. Try the thin crust. Most people like deep dish (s) but the thin is really good and a nice change. I would be so happy to hear of more locations to open but for some reason the competition is actually STILL in business. Shame on you non-art of pizza customers. Their larger space makes for a nice pizza-out night.
