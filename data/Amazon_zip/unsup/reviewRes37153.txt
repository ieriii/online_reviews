Dropped into Hopleaf last Saturday after hearing great things about their beer selection. We lucked out and got a couple seats at the bar. Service was great and the beer was excellent. The bartender happily answered any questions we had about beer and even pre-ordered us more bread for our appetizer when he saw we were running out. All in all it was a great time. I'll definitely go back to have an actual meal soon.
