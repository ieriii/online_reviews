THE best spot that offers Chicago Style deep dish...no joke! And what's so special about this place is their caramelized butter crust. There are hundreds of pizzarias around Chicago and their burbs but none offer the caramelized butter crust that Pequod's does. Fresh toppings, AWESOME lunch menu ($5 for a personalized pizza?!), great selection of drinks (mainly beer), and great customer service. All of the times I have gone there has always been a wait so come early if you're impatient and starving. (= MUST TRY!!!!!! Even if you're not a big pizza fan.
