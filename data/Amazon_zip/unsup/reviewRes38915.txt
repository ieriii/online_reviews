I guess it didn't help that we came here with very high expectations through word-of-mouth and Yelp reviews. L&E has a cute and rustic ambiance, but hardly deserving of four stars. Drinks first: My husband and I have been on a gastropub binge. The day before we stopped by Giltbar for a few drinks and appetizers (that was very impressive). When we arrived at L&E on a Sunday morning, I got the obligatory bloody mary and my husband ordered a Tom Collins. The bloody mary is complex - no arguments there. A great mix of spices with a spear of gherkin and cheddar. However, I have had better. The Tom Collins is so-so. The hubby appreciated the use of Old Tom gin but the cocktail lacked fizz and lemon - making it far from refreshing. The food on the other hand, was very mediocre. We went with the sloppy joe to share. The grilled jalapeno escabeche was the best part of the sandwich. The pretzel buns that the chef chose was both thick and dry, which may have been passable if there was enough boar in the middle. However, there was perhaps a half-cup of sloppy joe, if that. That leaves us with a few morsels of flavor sandwiched between two gigantic slices of starch - bleh.
