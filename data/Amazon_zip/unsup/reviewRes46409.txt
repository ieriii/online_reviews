Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know Grand Lux Cafe is affiliated with Cheesecake Factory. They have similar menus and quirky artsy decors. But unlike CF with its sububan locations there is only one GLC in Chicago. We always come here because it's a little bit less crowded than CF. Plus, I love riding the escalator to the second floor. And I don't feel obligated to order a slice of cheesecake at the end of my meal. The last time we came to GLC, there was no wait downstairs, but a little bit of a traffic jam at the end of the hallway upstairs. There was some confusion about our table so they made us wait for another five minutes. Good things come to those who wait. We were seated in one of the coveted window booths. These seats offer a view of Michigan Ave as if we were sitting on top of the world looking down at all pedestrians below unlike CF a few blocks away with its subterranean feel. Our server was not only courteous and helpful, but also very entertaining. We ordered from the minis, bites ,and tapas section: fried calamari and mini pork carnitas and crispy mahi mahi tacos. And to complete our custom made combo platter, we added duck potstickers and a mini rustic margherita pizza. Everything was fresh and delicious. To end our meal, we ordered the strawberry shortcake which was probably the best I've ever had. Creamy vanilla ice cream was sandwiched between golden tender shortcake. A cascade of strawberry sauce chock full of fresh fruit finished the dessert. And we finished the dessert. A perfect ending to our meal. If you want something very special for dessert choose the made to order desserts which require 30 minutes. They include molten chocolate cake, New Orleans beignets, and apple pie just to name a few. No matter what you eat at GLC, you are sure to go out with a full stomach, a smile on your face and maybe leftovers.
