A must-stop on your Magnificent Mile shopping if you gotta-go-gotta-go-gotta-go-right-now. The perfect blend of clean hotel bathroom, busy lobby so-you-won't-get-noticed-by-anyone environmental distraction, and not-quite-attentive-enough doormen/bellstaff who won't bother you about using their facilities. Highly recommended.
