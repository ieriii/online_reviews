Delicious!!! Mahi mahi dish was suburb. The owner was awesome as well. Gave us hot tea and appetizers on the house when waiting to be seated. slice of orange was amazing at the end that I asked him where he got the from and not only did he come give more out...gave me a bag full of 10 oranges to take home and enjoy!
