I can get a beer almost anywhere. Would I go to Hopleaf just for beer? nope. Combine beer with the best dang mussels in a lobster wine sauce with a loaf of crusty bread and that makes me drive from the burbs to partake. The wife usually gets the venison (when they have it) with roasted root veggies and a current/demi-glase reduction over spuds. Well worth the money... Serious quality beer list and great food... These guys get it!
