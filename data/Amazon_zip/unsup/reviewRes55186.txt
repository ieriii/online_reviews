I know I'm in the minority here but this place was gross!!! Servers hounding you from all corners, helping you with chairs and putting napkins in your lap I couldn't even have a conversation, then there's the meat. These guys dressed like Zoro (a lot of bells and whistles with this place) they come over with these bloody, bloody meat husks. The place smelled like meat, I came home smelling like meat. So if you like cow blood you'll love this place.
