I really enjoyed this place. The food, service, and atmosphere really ties together well. This is what I pictured a Chicago hot dog joint to be like and it lived up to my expectations. I would say that the hot dog itself is not the best I have ever had, but the whole experience makes up for it. Something about eating a Chicago hot dog (with mustard and no ketchup!!) and fries out of a box in my rental car made me rate this with 5 stars. If you are a visitor to Chicago as I was, I recommend making this one of your stops, if anything you can gain a fun story to tell.
