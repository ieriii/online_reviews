from all the reviews i expected this place to be stellar unfortunately this is where it missed some stars- my bf ordered the steak...i expected a nice piece of ribeye grilled and nicely marbled, what arrived was a flat piece of meat (similar to steak taco meat) that really didn't have much seasoning and a bit dry. I ordered the shrimp and vegetables which is pretty much what it sounds like with adobo seaoning sprinkled on top. Empanadas were pretty dry, the highlight of the evening was the shrimp and mango ceviche which was outstanding. Service is very attentive, yea for BYOB as after a few drinks we stopped noticing that we were being rained on even though we were sitting in the covered patio. Prob be back in the summer for appetizers, pass on the entrees.
