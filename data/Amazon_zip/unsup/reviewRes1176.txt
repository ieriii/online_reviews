CASH ONLY. This would have been good for me to know, as I had about 11 cents in my wallet and had planned on using a debit card. I waited in line for 20 minutes (!!) before I even saw the sign that says "cash only." My heart and tummy dropped to the floor! Oh no...another attempt at eating at this godforsaken place I can never seem to get off my list...Dooomed! Luckily, I had the good fortune of meeting 2 couples, vacationing in Chicago. They were a bit older, but spry and witty...my favorite kind of people. Tom R.: Oh no! What are you going to do?? (as I frantically look around for an ATM) Colleen: SIGHHHHHHH. I don't know. (FROWN, pout) Tom R: Well, I have some cash... Colleen: Oh no no no, I couldn't. Tom R.: Well, you could exchange me for a check, right? Colleen: (brightens) You are from out of town, aren't you!??? City dwellers would never even offer that option! Tom R: Yes. Out of towners, but I figure $10...not gonna break the bank. Even if your check is bad! Colleen: (getting out check book) It will clear, I promise! You've saved my hot dog mission! Tom R: Laughs, (gives me 2 fives and a second chance on Hot Doug's Life) SO anyway, I just stuck to the basics after my 30 minutes in line. Chicago Dog and french fries. LARGE diet coke. MMMMMM. Nothing like hitting the spot for $4.50 and 45 minutes total waiting...devoured in 2. :)
