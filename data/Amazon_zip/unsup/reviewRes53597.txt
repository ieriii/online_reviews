Unbelievably, this restaurant called at 4pm today to cancel the reservation that we have had for six weeks. We had confirmed yesterday for a special occasion dinner. I understand that sometimes problems arise--but other reviews warned us this may happen. And calling within 2.5 hours of the scheduled reservation to cancel on a Saturday night??? We don't have a prayer of getting another reservation at this point... so disappointing. Needless to say, the offer to reschedule for another night is not one I will be taking up.
