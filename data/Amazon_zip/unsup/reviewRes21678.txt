I have been wanting to try Superdawgs on Milwaukee avenue for quite some time now. Since I have been to Weiner Circle and Hot Dougs. I wanted to see who has the best dawgs in Chicago. Sorry to say Superdawgs, but Hot Doug's is still by far the best! Even though your dawgs were definitely better than Weiner Circle!! We ordered three superdawgs with everything. They were really good! We also ordered one Whoopskidawg. This is a combination polish and russian sausage of some sort. It was also really good! I also ordered a super cheese burger. This item was not very good, I'm sorry to say. This is the one item where I enjoyed the burger at Weiner Circle more. Every item came with fries. The fries were good but we did not truly need that many fries! Our total bill came to around $29 dollars. The wait was long, I guess it takes a while to cook a burger. Otherwise the wait is fast. The service was friendly. Would we go back? If we are up north and it is after 4:30 pm (when Hot Doug's closes), then yes. I don't think we would go out of our way though (we would rather head to Hot Doug's), sorry Superdawg!
