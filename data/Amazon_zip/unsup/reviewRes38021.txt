More Tripel Karmeliet on tap, please! The beer gods must've been smiling on us, since on a recent weeknight we managed to score a table in the bar area without having to wait. As usual, Hopleaf was packed with a crowd as eclectic as its extensive beer list, but we did our best to limit ourselves to a few beers and an order of frites. The frites are served with a healthy portion of garlic aioli. In addition to all the Belgians, Hopleaf also offers many craft beers including local brews from Half Acre, Metropolitan, and Goose Island. Plan to linger for a while in order to sample a variety...just go early if you ever want a table.
