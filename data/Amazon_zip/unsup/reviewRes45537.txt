I've been to Wilde many times and never leave disappointed. The service is usually pretty fast. I love their buffalo chicken sandwich.. it's the perfect amount of spicy and the fries are always great. You should also try the tater tots for grown ups, I forget exactly what they're called but you'll see them on the appetizer menu. My friends have gotten the burgers and one even got a special pasta one night with shrimp and scallops - all were good. The interior decor is cool, going along with the whole Oscar Wilde theme. I finally was able to sit in the "library" tonight which was cool. The only complaint I'd have is that if you sit in the library, you are right up against tables surrounding it so you're almost sitting with another table. If you can get past that, you're good.
