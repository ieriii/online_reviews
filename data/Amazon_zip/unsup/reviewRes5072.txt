On my trip to chicago, I found out about this restaurant near my hotel. I tried to go there 4 times but every time it's a long wait and they don't take reservation. I advice that you called in advance to know how long you will be waiting before going there. So on my last day, I finally was able to sit myself down on a lunch day. The waitress was really friendly to us and introduced the menu. We ordered the roasted bone marrow with herbs, milk braised pork shoulder, and the pigs tailed braised in balsamic. We basically wanted to try a little of everything as this was just lunch and we don't want to eat too heavy. The food came quick. The tail and the shoulder was very flavorful because of the juicy fat. The bone marrow was something I never tastes before and it was awesome. You pick the fat part inside the marrow and you eat it with the garlic bread. I wish they had more of the bone instead of the bread. Anyway, if you stop by chicago I recommend this place. :)
