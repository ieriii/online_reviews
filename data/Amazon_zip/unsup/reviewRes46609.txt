We stopped by this place after a visit to Lincoln Park Zoo. Felt transported to another era. Ordered a strawberry milkshake and turkey club sandwich. Milkshake was incredible, and the sandwich was delicious. Dining companion had a Oreo cookie milkshake and a BBQ pulled pork sandwich, and was satisfied with both. Was a little pricey but the ambiance and food quality made it worth it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
