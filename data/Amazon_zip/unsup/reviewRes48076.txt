Last night was my 2nd trip to the Publican. We went a few years ago, right after it opened, and LOVED it. Last night's experience was disappointing. A few things were really great: our drinks, the country ribs, the summer squash, the pork belly, the mussels, and the oysters. Food-wise, we were underwhelmed by the pork rinds (the coating was reminded me of bad cheetos), the soft shell crab (way too hard/crispy), and the blood sausage (just didn't like it). Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, but there were a few missteps. We never received 2 orders that we placed, although they were still on our bill. We didn't say anything to the waiter, because we were sort of waiting for the dishes to arrive. By the time we realized, "Okay, these probably aren't coming," it was the end of the meal. He also didn't bring one of the drinks my husband ordered, but must have just totally forgotten about that because it wasn't on the bill. He gladly removed the missing food items but didn't really apologize - it was a little strange. I'm not sure if I'll be back. There are too many other great restaurants in the city to try and I don't really want to risk another disappointing experience.
