The experience is overwhelming the first time. Basically, you get these coasters that is green on one side and red on the other. Now, you go get a salad. Because it is your first time there, you are a fool and load up on the most awesome salad bar ever. You are especially impressed with the fresh mozzarella. Before you are done with the salad, the waitstaff puts down the delicious and evil warm cheese bread, the fried polentas, garlic mashed potatoes. Again, because it is your first time, you are an idiot and taste the evil bread and potatoes. And then you eat more. Then your flip your coaster from the red side to the green side and let the madness begin. Suddenly, like 15 dudes come out of nowhere with these amazing skewers of various meats. Some folks load up on the fillet Mignon, others like the prime rib. I like to try each of the 11 options. Then I curse myself for having eaten so much salad and evil bread earlier. Now, the experience is already worth the dinner price. But it is almost half off during lunch so you can't really go wrong there.
