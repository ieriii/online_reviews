This place rules. Every time I've been I've had a great experience, and that includes one packed Saturday evening. Maybe it's because I'm an old and cantankerous late-twentysomething, but I recommend going earlier in the evening or mid-week, to enjoy more attentive service and non existent lines than is possible during the busier weekends. And while the chairs & tables are fabulous, I prefer the bar; that way you get the full view of the bartenders working their magic, and can get explanations from them on the techniques used on various drinks.
