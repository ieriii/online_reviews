I like the restaurant setting. It's large but kind of cozy at the same time. The lunch crowd wasn't that bad for a Friday, either. The food portions are pretty darned good, but the quality was barely above average only. Their sauces aren't really anything to write home about. The spicy sauce was no different than the original, except the spicy had a few red chili flakes in it. My brisket was a little dry, but the mustard sauce made up for that. Service is excellent, btw. If you're in the mood for 'q' and you happen to be in the area, this place will suffice. Unfortunately, the prices will drive away most folks who can't (or choose not to) afford a $13 dry-ish brisket sandwich.
