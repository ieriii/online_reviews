Huge lines so leave lots of time. The big complaint from our groups was that there were too many options. The owner works the counter and I was told to know what I wanted and order quick but he was more interested in how I was doing today. Nice dude. Vege dogs were excellent. Worth a stop in you're in the area with an hour to kill.
