Went here on a recommendation from Check Please.  Decor is super nice as they said. Food was mediocre at best.  Crispy Pata- Was bone dry and lacked flavor. I hit it several times with my knife and I can hear a thud sound. I've had authentic Pata before and it was never dry like this. The sauces they served with it Pata wasn't good either. Tastes like watered down Hoisen sauce. Beef Lollipops-Flavor was ok. But the serving of sliced beef was way smaller than I imagined. It's very deceiving when it comes out. I would say at max about 3 oz if not 2 oz of beef for about $20. Bleh. Dragon Roll-Very uninspired. They tried to serve it nice but the rice was mushy and overdone. Not much seasoning on the rice. Figures all the sushi chefs are of Hispanic descent. Would've expected some Asian folks behind a sushi counter at a restaurant of this caliber. Miso soup-Organic really doesn't make a difference in taste. Adobo Rice (suggestion from server)-It was good but wayy too much burnt/charred rice mixed in that made it unpleasant to eat. Server-MIA for most of the meal had to flag him down on several occasions. We had tons of food leftover and usually the server will ask you if something is wrong with that much food left over but I guess the dont give a hoot.  I asked my friend before I went and he told me it was overrated and overpriced...I should've listened to him. :( I'm really not picky I'm really not! :) FAIL
