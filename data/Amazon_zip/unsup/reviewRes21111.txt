The food and plating were really just fair for the prices. The best things we ate were the soup special and the fish & chips. The Poached Shrimp and Caramelized Lobster both came in deep bowls without a spoon, making it virtually impossible to eat the quinoa underneath the lobster with a big dinner fork, and completely impossible to enjoy the herb broth under the shrimp. I had to request a spoon for the first course and would have for the second course had our server returned. I had to send back the Wagyu Sirloin which was way overcooked for a medium-rare order. I was annoyed that the chef tried to pass it off as though it being Wagyu beef should be enough to keep a diner happy. This was my second visit and the first was similarly uneven. The noise level was awful at times. There's a whole tribe of people who scream across the table when they're in close proximity to a bar. I don't know whether it's the alcohol or the sight of a bar that brings out the screaming in them, but depending on where you are seated in this restaurant you may have to endure extreme noise over what attempts to be fine dining. Choose your table carefully - if you want a quieter experience go for the back of the restaurant.
