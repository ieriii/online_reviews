I got to say - I just don't get it. This is Chicago. There are so many restaurants that are so much better. There food is simply mediocre. I guess they hand make their pasta. My grandma did too and there's doesn't taste anything like hers! If I wasn't told it was homemade I would never believe it. There service is incredible. They send you these postcard for $20 off around your birthday so that is a nice touch. there food is just mediocre and the atmosphere is pretty pedestrian as well.
