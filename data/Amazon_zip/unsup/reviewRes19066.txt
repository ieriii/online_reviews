YUM! Went here when there was a two hour wait for Frontera and didnt want the high class of Topo. I didnt really understand what was going on when we walked in. So you order at the counter and then they take you to your table and bring your food out whenever its ready. Its definitely a no frills Mexican joint....but SOOOO freaking good. So I had the special ceviche of the night. It was like shrimp, scallops, and other seafood. So fresh and yummy. It was topped with avocado and tomatoes....perfecto. We also had guac and chips (hit the spot). I also tried the vegetables and black bean meal in a bowl caldo...delicious and the Cubana torta....by far the best thing. It was this amazing sandwich you could dip...heaven! The one thing is everything just comes out randomly so dont expect amazing service because there is none. They also have a decent selection of beers that you can get at the counter.
