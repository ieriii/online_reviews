I came here with my wife last Sunday to celebrate my birthday. Needless to say, the restaurant itself was good enough to make my birthday one to remember (but don't tell my wife I said that!).Everything was extraordinary. The food was perfect; much better than anything I've tried in Argyle. Argyle has always been my go-to place to get quick pho or just about any Vietnamese dish since it's a bit closer to my place, but my wife decided to treat ourselves to something different, especially since it had such great reviews. I just never knew what we were missing out on!We started our meal with the Bon Vivant Platter, which has an assortment of their 'rolls' for a variety. We both thoroughly got through that quickly due to our appetites. I love their spring rolls! Then, for appetizers, I decided on the catfish in a claypot. The sauce it came in was not too sweet, but adequate enough to leave a good taste in my mouth. My wife opted with the beef and asparagus. She's really picky with her meat, but apparently, the meat was cooked just right for her. Amazing.We had a nice waitress who checked up on us on a few times, but did leave enough time in between so we can spend our dinner quietly and peacefully. We weren't surprised when it wasn't busy, but apparently, this isn't a good sign for restaurant owners...The owner of this restaurant is especially endearing. He's super nice and sent over a complimentary fried banana dessert because he heard it was my birthday. Help out this man and come to his restaurant! You won't be disappointed. I'm definitely coming out here more often, regardless if it's my birthday or not!
