My girlfriend and I often go to this restaurant and it is by far our FAVORITE! The ambiance is amazing, especially if you can sit upstairs. I don't know the names of the dishes we get, but try the salmon with noodles (#39) and the steak with the tomato rice (#38). Also they have some chicken-stuffed shrimp (yeah I said it, it's not a typo) with some orange ginger sauce! I can't do this place any justice, and talking about it, just makes me want to go back! Shout out to the owner: Joe
