We had a nice Groupon, so we were excited to try another place that we haven't been to. Unfortunately we were ultimately disappointed by the whole experience. Atmosphere: Kind of drab if you ask me. I like that they have some very large tables for groups. Otherwise, I'm not a fan. It's also annoying that you have to go on a 5 mile hike through an underground maze to get to the restrooms. Service: Fine, no issues here. Appetizer: We had one beef empanada and one chicken empanada. I thought that for $2.50 each, they could have been a little bigger. Seriously, I could have eaten each in one bite if I wanted to. They tasted ok, but were nothing to write home about. Main course: We shared the $38 Picada Colombiana, which is basically a big heaping plate of meats for two. Skirt steak, rib-eye steak, pork loin, chicken breast, chorizo, potatoes, yuca, and plantains. Honestly, we were both very disappointed in the meats. The skirt steak was by far the best, but honestly I've had much much better skirt steak elsewhere.The chorizo was also ok, but everything else was very bland and not tasty at all. I normally like yuca, but here the yuca and potatoes were so dry and they were barely edible. I guess we have been spoiled by places like Nacional 27 and Carnivale, where the skirt steak is simply a-maz-ing. One thing I will say is, it's a LOT of meat. Unfortunately it's not a lot of AWESOME meat. Would we go back? Probably not any time soon. The Groupon made it okay price wise, but if we had paid full price I would have been even more disappointed. I really wanted to love Las Tablas, but I just can't.
