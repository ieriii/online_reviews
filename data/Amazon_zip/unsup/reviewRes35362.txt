While driving cross-country(AZ to NJ), my fiance and I decided to spend a couple of nights in his hometown of Chicago... the second night, after having spent the day at the Shedd Aquarium, I was craving lobster bisque(being around live seafood tends to make me hungry haha)...so, dressed casually, we walked and taxied all around the city, trying to find a place that was reasonably priced, had food he enjoyed as well, and had *lobster bisque*... well, after passing up several pricey or eccentric restaurants, waiting forever to hail a cab, and receiving all sorts of dirty looks from well-dressed restaurant patrons getting out of their valeted cars, we were exhausted...when I spotted Shaw's, I didn't even bother to look at the menu, I just said, "Let's eat here, okay?"... we went inside, where the hostess pasted the fakest smile on her face while looking us over. what a relief when she asked, "Formal or Casual?"...there was a casual section?! yes, please!... the oyster bar was terrific!...even there, we got some dirty looks from businessmen and their wives, but it was easy to ignore it with our table so close to the blues band that was playing(what amazing ambience!)... for my appetizer I was overjoyed to find lobster bisque on the menu...and what a bisque! slightly smoky, and nice and hot on that cold Chicago night! my fiance ordered the seafood salad(under my duress haha)...and that was also perfect, kind of tangy, with lots of shredded crab and lobster... as for entrees, he ordered the fish tacos(which were pretty tasteless...luckily they came with a green chile sauce that added a good bit of flavor)...I ordered the tuna sashimi...perfectly charred and delicious with ginger and soy sauce...it came with a seaweed salad that was so sweet and refreshing... for dessert, I ordered a black tea, perfectly steeped and wonderfully fortifying for the blustery walk back to our car, parked down at Navy Pier...
