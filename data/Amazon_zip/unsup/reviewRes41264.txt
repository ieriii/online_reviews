Ruth's Chris in Chicago offered a GREAT value for restaurant week. The entrees they served were some of the best from the menu, the service was excellent, and they even offered a restaurant week wine special. Appetizers - To start, choose between the house salad and the seafood gumbo. I tried the seafood gumbo, and it was amazing. Not too salty, not too thick, just right. Plus, it came with a small mound of rice. Entrees - Choice of rib eye, filet mignon, salmon or chicken. We all went for the 12 oz. ribeye or 8 oz. filet mignon. Both were drenched in butter. The ribeye was cooked exactly to my specifications (medium rare) and was charred in just the right places. Not the best steak I ever had, but it was still good. Sides - The restaurant week menu came with a choice of 1 side: mushrooms, creamed spinach or mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were definitely something to write home about. Great consistency, good amount of butter. Creamed spinach was not too creamy, so left a little something to be desired. I didn't try the mushrooms, but my friends said they were delicious (being drenched in butter probably helped). In addition to the RW sides, we also tried the onion rings (which were ginormous) and the potato gratin (very good) Dessert - Choice of chocolate mousse cheesecake with a cookie crust or bread pudding. Well presented, both tasty Wine - The RW menu also gave a choice of 2 wines (priced at $32 per bottle) -- a Cabernet or a white (forgot which white). Service - Our waiter was coincidentally named Chris, and he was extremely attentive and friendly. Only downside to the service was that the busboy was a little too hasty in trying to clear up our table, even when my fork was on the left side of my plate (as opposed to grouped with my knife on the right side of the plate) Great service and definitely one of the best restaurant week experiences I've ever had!
