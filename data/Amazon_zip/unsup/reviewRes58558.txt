As the food goes I'll give Le Colonial a 3, as the service goes I'll give them a 3, and as the service goes for their valet parking company 0.This place seriously needs to contract a better valet company. We went to Le Colonial for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon (not a lot of lunch traffic), and after our meal, which was good, but a little over priced for authentic Vietnamese cuisine (I would take the location into account if the valet service wasn't horrible), we went to claim our car. After about 10 minutes of waiting beside an empty valet stand, another woman joined us in waiting from the restaurant; and not only did we stand there for an additional 5 minutes, but when the valet guy showed up he takes both our and the second woman's ticket and says to the woman behind us Well your car is not far, and instead of asking us if it was ok, or even notifying us of his plans he went and picked up the car for the woman behind us!I was appalled and the woman behind us was even more appalled, and stated they were ahead of me, she actually felt so bad about the situation that she apologized to us for the idiot valet.NO TIP FOR YOU!
