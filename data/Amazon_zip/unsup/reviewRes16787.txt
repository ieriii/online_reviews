THE BUFFET!! IT'S SOOOO GOOD!!! OK first let me say being from Detroit we pretty much have a little bit of everything in terms of food options but I have not been so impressed on my hunt for great Indian food. My BF used my handy Iphone yelp app and quickly found what was near us and BOOM! we were hoofing it for some top notch Indian cuisine for lunch while in Chi town! Upon walking in we are greeted by a oh so sweet hostess and lots of patrons chowing down on what looks like the cleanest buffet I have ever seen. I don't eat at buffet I have a thing about my food mingling and people well anyway I just don't like them. But this buffet was clean and everything looked so hot and fresh so I set my fears aside and dove in head first. YUMMMMM!!! OK wait this buffet was not only great but when we got back to our table a sizzling hot plate of tandoori chicken was waiting for us. FREE with the buffet!!! HELLOO AWESOME!! I tried a little of everything it was all so good. I will be heading back to Chicago for 4 days in June and will make sure this is on my list for an awesome lunch!! I'm dreaming of the palak paneer already!!
