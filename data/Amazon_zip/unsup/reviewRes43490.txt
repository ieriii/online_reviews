The joys of weekend breakfast...or should I say brunch, since I never get up early enough to call it breakfast. It's definitely one of our favorite activities to look forward on the weekend. Therefore, J. recommended going here, as she's been here before and knows I like trying new breakfast places.  The food was pretty good, but one thing I wish they would offer is more variety on their menu. I hear that they change up their menu from time to time, but I can see the selections getting tired after 2-3+ return trips. Another thing that I am not a fan of is the way you order food. You have to wait in a line inside the restaurant...before you can sit down. They don't take down or call out names like other restaurants do. If the place is crowded, which it usually is on a weekend, it's hard to relax with people bumping into you all the time. It's even worse if you are eating and happen to be one of the tables nearest to the line of hungry patrons. You can feel the tension as they stare down your food while looming overhead as you try to make the best of your meal. However, not all is bad. The main reason I like going back is the granola. The chocolate 'n banana is my favorite, and J. is a huge fan of the blueberry 'n pecan. You can't go wrong with a bag of this to take home! I almost makes the staring and waiting worth it.
