Hate to buck the trend, but I've never been happy with anything I've ordered at this place. The falafel has been cold and not well seasoned (where's the tahini?), and chicken shwarma meat really nasty. I give them props for serving middle eastern at good prices, but that's about it. I'll probably give them 1 more chance and edit this if it's good, but they're 0 for 3 at this point in my book.
