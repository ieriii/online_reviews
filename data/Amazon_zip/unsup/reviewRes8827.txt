DUCK FAT FRIES!!! Erm, no, they don't have them at Noon O Kabab. However, Keith C, my younger brother, had psyched me up to getting duck fat fries with lunch. But the line as too long at Hot Dougs, so Keith said "OK, want to get persian food instead?" "Sure." So he took me to Noon O Kabab, which is very highly regarded and for good reason. The service here is great - so friendly, and cheery, and helpful. We both had the chicken kabab sandwich - the chicken was cooked perfectly, tender, juicy, and well spiced. Their tandoori bread is also great. They also have very nice persian tea Really, the only downside (besides no duck fat fries) was middle of the road hummus. Not great, but not as outstanding as my sandwich.
