I had a very lovely birthday dinner here a couple weeks ago with my parents. That outdoor patio they have really makes you feel like you are somewhere else. Kind of like being in Europe or a fairytale. Perfect for a date or friends and family and is not too loud at all. Service: Very gracious and attentive the whole night. They even snuck in singing Happy Birthday to me at the end and were cute about it. Food: Had the squash blossoms, calamari, gnocchi and rabbit and my Mom LOVED her pasta dish with mushrooms. I really liked everything a lot but the rabbit dish could have used a little more flavor or seasonings in my opinion. But I compare it to my Mom's so I'm probably biased. The only little complaint I have is that they use kerosene in the candles that are on the table and for me, the fumes were overpowering so I had them remove it. I wish they would revamp that aspect and use wax candles instead. Other than that, it was a wonderful evening and a very happy birthday.
