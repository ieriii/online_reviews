So apparently Esquire magazine called this the 'best bar in America'. I'm pretty sure that means someone at Esquire knows an owner here. The beer list is great, to be sure. The food is beautifully plated, but seems to be overreaching. It's as if--in some effort to be innovative-- they lost touch with the original flavors of the dish. I'm not a whiskey drinker, but my friend is and she was cooing about the Whiskey flights. So, I suppose if you want to try several obscure bourbons, this place might be pretty cool. In general, I just thought it was incredibly overrated. It's fine as a neighborhood spot, but I wouldn't consider it a 'destination' for dinner.
