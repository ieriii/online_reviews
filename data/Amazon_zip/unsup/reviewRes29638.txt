This is a wonderful restaurant which we come back to again and again and again. The staff is lovely and always pleasant. The food is outstanding - amongst the best Thai food I've found in Chicago. My standards are high having travelled extensively throughout Thailand and eaten the real stuff. Most American Thai food is watered down versions of the real stuff. Not at Opart. I asked for one dish to be served "Thai Hot" in response to the waiter's obligatory question - "How spicy do you want it?" I got the usual eye roll indicating "you silly westerner, you can't handle it that way." When I pushed him, he finally relented and boy, was I happy (though no one else in my party was). The dish was served painfully spicy - in the way that I've only found in Thailand. It was wonderful. The room is nice, the staff attentive, and the food is absolutely fantastic. It's BYOB and the staff quickly bring a bottle opener and cork screw as soon as you sit down. All of these elements add up to a fun evening with wonderful food and a modest tab. We bring our friends here now and always have a great time and leave having made a couple new converts to Opart.
