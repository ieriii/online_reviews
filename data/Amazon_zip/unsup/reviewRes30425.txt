I recently came here again with my boyfriend and his mom, hoping it would be better than the last time. 6:30: We are told there's a 15-20 minute wait since there's 3 of us and most of the seating is 2-person tables. 7:00: Groups that came after us are getting seated. (Apparently dressing like a hipster gets you to the front of the line.) I go in to find out what the holdup is. Snotty server tells me "It'll be another ten minutes, you guys are next for a booth." fine. 7:15: Another 2 large groups that just arrived are getting seated. Boyfriend goes in to see what the hell is going on. We are told it will be ANOTHER ten minutes. 7:30: We finally get in, an hour after arriving. Now i know it's permanently busy here, but why tell me fifteen minutes if you know damn well its an hour? 7:40: The server that we had talked to about the wait decides to acknowledge us. Instead of an apology for the extra 45 minutes, and for the other people getting to go before us, we literally get "SORRY BROS, WE"RE BUSY, YA DIG?" Really, asshole? My boyfriend's mother is mortified and we just sit there in the embarrassed silence. 7:45: Another server comes over to bring us menus, since the first decided to walk off. We order before this guy disappears too. He seems nicer, but seems kind of confused, like its his first day. 8:05: We get our food, room temperature and bland. 8:30: We ate as fast as humanly possible, and get the hell out. NEVER. AGAIN. The food was mediocre and expensive and the service was terrible. Go a few blocks over to Pick Me Up. Better food, better atmosphere, and your mom wont get treated like a frat boy in Barleycorn.
