Tres chic! I feel like Alice in Wonderland every time I go into Violet Hour. The high-backed chairs remind me of a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. The area is kind of meh/blah and the outside of the place looks incredibly scary and junky but inside is soooo cool. The drinks here are delicious and so unique--I loved the honey and lavender one! This place is dimly lit and fairly quiet. It would be good for a third date.
