Hmm, I have to say I was kind of disappointed. I enjoy a tapas place for the fun it brings to the dining experience. For the prices I was expecting a little more. Maybe it has been a while since I have been to a tapas place but the selection was less than I wanted. We had a cheese selection and only got 4 small pieces. I had a beef on bread which was okay and my friend had the octopus paella which was rather small for the price and hardly sharable. Highlight, the staff. Willing to offer suggestions, accommodating, and very friendly.  Its okay if you are in the hood but not something I would go out of my way to visit again.
