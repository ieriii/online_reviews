It's called the Bad Apple, but everything about this place is absolutely Good. The beer list is impressive, and always changing. I've had limited-edition beers (like Left Hand's "Ambidextrous" series), been introduced to new beers I love (Stone's "Ruination" IPA), and enjoyed old favorites (like Great Lakes "Edmund Fitzgerald" porter, which is also featured in my favorite burger, the "Edmund Fig-Gerald"). There's also a good selection of ciders and a nice cocktail list. The burgers and sandwiches are above-average for a bar. On the must-try list: the Zen Belly (sandwich), the Edmund Fig-Gerald (burger), and El Chupacabra (burger). More importantly: the poutine here is INCREDIBLE. I don't even have words for how good that pile of fries and cheese curds and gravy is. I just know that I'm more likely to order two servings of poutine than I am to eat a proper dinner (even in spite of the fantastic sandwich and burger offerings!), and I'm okay with that.
