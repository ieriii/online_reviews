We all know how amazing the food at Hot Doug's is, so instead of a full review, I want to share a quick story about Doug Sohn. One day last summer, my girlfriend and I drove around looking for a place to eat until, after much deliberation, we decided that we were craving some Hot Doug's. Since the idea to go to Hot Doug's was a very last minute decision, I didn't have cash on me (cash only at Hot Doug's), and worst of all, I was wearing a Superdawg shirt. Instead of doing what most smart people would do (change my shirt and go to an ATM), I decided to venture into Hot Doug's anyways. As I anticipated, Doug really let me have it for wearing a Superdawg shirt. After a few well deserved jabs, I awkwardly laughed it off and ordered my food without a hitch. Then it was time for me to pay for our meal. When I realized that my girlfriend and I only had $9 in cash between us at the time, I told Doug to cancel our order so I could run to the ATM for some cash. Instead of hearing the response that I was expecting, Doug told me, "Don't worry about paying now. Eat your meal first and then run to the ATM for some cash." I've only been to Hot Doug's a few times before that trip, but I will forever be a loyal customer after that experience. Doug Sohn not only makes the best sausages in Chicago, but he is also a class-act guy!
