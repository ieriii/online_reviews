The first time I went here, I thought it was the greatest thing ever. Real deep dish pizza with a whole sausage patty layering the pie. It was delicious and definitely an experience. The appeal dies down a bit going again, but nevertheless, it still tastes good and it's not like any pizza I can get anywhere else outside of Chicago. The wait is usually pretty long from the experiences I've had and the pizza is only good when it's hot. I took some home and it was not nearly as good heated up later.
