A group of 5 girls came here for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. The house sushi roll were really great, the brussel sprout salad super good and the tuna sashimi was so flavorful. I'm not sure if it was worth the price to add to my regular rotation of great sushi places in Chicago, but a fun atmosphere for a special occasion. Although I was surprised when we were asked to quiet down when we were doing a shot and just having a good time at 10 pm on a Thursday? But I suppose we had been there for a while, drinking wine, so it's entirely possible we were too loud, it was just surprising.
