i had a pretty good experience here. the service was friendly, food was above average, wine was spectacular, and atmosphere was warm. Linguine con frutti del mare -- I tried this dish -- the portion size was so large that I couldn't even finish it. Mixture of mussels, clams, shrimp, fish. I would recommend this dish. Gnocchi - My friend ordered this and it was fantastic. I'm not a huge gnocchi fan, but it was absolutely delicious and enormous. Pizza -- the pizzas have an egg in the center, adding a little extra flavor and moisture Penne alla paesana - My friend got this and it was pretty average. I think she was disappointed by her choice. Coffee -- Not hot enough Overall, a good experience, and I would definitely come again
