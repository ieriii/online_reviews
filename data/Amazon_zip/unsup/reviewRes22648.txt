We had lunch with my boyfriend's father here on Father's Day because he loves Chinese food. This is quite possibly the best authentic Chinese restaurant in Chicago. Their menu is fucking huge, and if you're not afraid to try new things their menu will definitely get you cross-eyed. Service is fast and friendly, but the food is ON POINT. Make sure you get everything spicy because that is their specialty. :)
