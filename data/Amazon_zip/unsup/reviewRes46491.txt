This place used to be one of my favorite burger places, but I feel as if the burgers have gotten smaller throughout the years. Chicken is chicken, so I will always stick with the Peppercorn burger. Whenever I go the salad bar is a must, but for carry out the burger gets a little dry. I have been there about 8 times and feel like everytime is a little more disappointing. There are better burgers elsewhere in the city.
