The first time I ate at 90 Miles was on a whim. My boyfriend and I had just finished running errands, were hungry and happened to be in the area. We came in and were almost floored by the smells coming from the kitchen. Our waiter joked we were ready to walk right out, but instead we felt like two cartoon characters who literally float off their feet as they catch a whiff of delicious vapors. The main dining area is in the plainest terms, cool. Old doors are turned into tables, tasteful antiques dot a few tables and great art work adorns the walls. I've had empanadas both times and both times they didn't disappoint. It is BYOB, but they provide the mixers for mojitos and sangrias. Everything I've had there has been great (and greasy), but so worth the mess.
