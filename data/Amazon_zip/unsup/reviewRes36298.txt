Few places could master two types of cuisine at once, and not be called the Cheesecake Factory. I have to get the Indie Signature at least once or twice a year, and I've had most of the sushi rolls on the menu, most of which are priced quite cheaply. On a couple of the best nights, I felt like I had stolen when I got the bill, so I passed the difference on to the wait staff.  The atmosphere is perfect. You never really wait, even on a Saturday night, but there's always enough people and chatter to create the right level of ambience. The crab rangoon of all things is memorable. The tom yum I thought was outstanding, and I don't even like shrimp.  If you want to impress, go here. Bring leftovers to [address redacted by Yelp ed.]
