Superb stuff. The place is ginormous, but spaced out enough so you can have conversations with friends. The food was amazing and this is the type of restaurant to show off Kleiner's work. Great atmosphere with great food.  You'll also bump into people you know here as well on your way to the restroom. Remember to dry your hands before you leave the restroom since you'll end up shaking their hands on the way back.
