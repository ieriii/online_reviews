Decent sushi at the typical price. They have some creative rolls which were very good, but not too much out of the ordinary. It seems to be owned by Ping Pong across the street (one of my favorites) because several of the appetizers are the same. We went on a Sunday evening, so we were able to get seats right away, but the space is extremely small so if you tried to go on a busier night I can see someone running into problems. We liked that it was BYOB, it kept our bill down and let us spend a little more on food. Try the Kani Chung Roll and the Peter Parker Spider roll - both delicious ( but skip the salad roll).
