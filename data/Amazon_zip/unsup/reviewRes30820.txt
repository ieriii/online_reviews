Sunda, we've waited too long for an introduction and I'm glad I finally got to taste the glorious sushi treats! You're going to be really dangerous for my wallet and I'm ok with that. My friends and I ate at the sushi bar around 6:30 on Monday. The place was almost completely filled up by 7:30, so I was impressed. Sunda would be the perfect place for after-work drinks and dinner, or any occasion really. Sleek, sexy and proper are words that came to mind when walking around the space. Good looking people and friendly staff filled the room. The ambiance was fantastic. I believe our waiter was in training, and not only was he very professional and detailed, but was able to give us great suggestions on favorites. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno,under Sunda's Signature Sushi. The roll itself sat on a cucumber drizzled in zesty sauce with some jalapeno inside. Very fresh and light. The Ocean Garden Salad was also a nice start. The cocktail list was very fun and ample. I tried the Blushing Geisha and Peared Sake, both of which were strong and out of the box. The garnishes and rims were a cute touch. My friend and I also shared a bottle of Sake. What's sushi without Sake? For rolls, we rocked it out with the Rainbow, Firecracker, Lobster and Wagyu Roll. The Lobster roll was by far the best and most interesting roll I've had in awhile. It's filled with creamy lobster, scallions, jalapeo, waygyu sashimi, truffle-foie gras aioli. Order this!! Unreal. Of course I was stuffed, but I had to try this delightful Almond and Banana cake they were offering on special. I ate the whole piece alone and I don't feel one bit bad about it. YUM Sunda, I love you.
