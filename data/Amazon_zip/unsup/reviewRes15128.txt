A true gem! I'm a sucker for old-school Chicago and this place has it in spades! The hosts are true gentlemen, the waitstaff are career professionals if not charmingly rough around the edges. Strolling violinists, piano bar, a well-poured martini, need I say more? Oh yeah, the food is fantastic, very reasonably-priced and plentiful! Go here with a bunch of friends and order out of your comfort zone and you've got the makings for a nite to remember!
