Chicago Magazine made this out to be the Longman & Eagle for the Gold Coast crowd. I found it to be more like its less talented younger sister. The menu looked promising yet unoriginal, but you can let unoriginality slide if it tastes good. I'm not going to say the food was inedible because if I was stuck on a desert island, I definitely wouldn't mind having the roasted bone marrow or pork belly or even some truffle pasta. The problem is I would shortly die of dehydration because everything is too salty. Bottom line, I guess I had high hopes, but was unimpressed and couldn't carry a conversation without exerting my voice above 100 decibels; therefore, I may skip on returning any time soon.
