I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Great food. Great Beer. Great Staff. Great Atmosphere! What more could you want?!  I go here on a regular basis and just adore the staff. They are so knowledgeable and friendly. I'm always learning new beer facts and they have suggested some amazing beers that I have loved.  This is one of my go-to places when friends come to visit. And although it can be a little pricey, it's well worth it. Visit any night of the week and it can get busy and you can meet some amazing people. Plus, it can be a great "straight oasis" in a grown-up gay neighborhood.  The beer selection is AMAZING and they are always bringing in new beers that are soon to be added to my list of favorites. The bar tenders take their job seriously and really know their craft. And the whole staff is friendly and fast!  Among some of my favorites here: Mussels (amazing- made me realize you could get yummy food in a bar.) The Duck Reuben Sandwich (it haunts my dreams) and the Steak Au Frites (yum) Plus, their fries by themselves are delish. Also, a little know fact. If you prefer a lighter fare, they serve a delicious salad that can also be substituted for their fries (but why not just get both) I will be back here again and again.  (On a side note: I have just recently learned that there is an outdoor patio - this is on my to do list as the last time I was there it was storming)
