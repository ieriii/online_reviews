If you are feeling too much of the Chicago winter, I highly recommend Pho Xe Tang. We knew little about Pho or Vietnamese food in general, so we ordered a bowl of the Beef Pho and the regular Pho. Little did we know that one of the them would be more than enough for both of us. The beef, tripe and tendon were an interesting addition to the broth along with the basil, cilantro, sprouts, noodles, and lime. The ginger flavor of the broth was excellent and just what we needed. The portion size is ridiculously large and the prices are very low. Could be my favortie soup this side of Topolobompo's mushroom soup.
