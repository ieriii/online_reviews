High expectations aside, our experience at Publican was just plain awful. Our waitress was only sporadically present, forgot one of my beers, and put in our order in such a way that our dishes came out either on top of one another, with a 20 minute wait between them, or out of order; we received our vegetable dish well after finishing everything else.  The shortrib was full of fat and inconsistently done (parts were very well done, others rare). I do not exaggerate when I say that we had a very difficult time cutting through it with a knife. The belated braised greens were greasy, bitter, and tasted of burnt ham (though no actual ham made an appearance). The sweetbreads and the halibut crudo were very good, but did not make up for the poor service and quality of several dishes. Maybe our visit was a fluke, but nevertheless, I won't be back anytime soon.
