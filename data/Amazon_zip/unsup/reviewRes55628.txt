I am basing this review on the one lunch that I have eaten at Cafe 28. I had the steak sandwich, though I think it had a cooler name on the menu. It was on point! The meat was cooked properly, the seasoning was excellent and the bread was the right blend of moist on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. The chips on the side were, I think, fried plantains. They where a great change to the normal fries or potato chips. My lunch mate ordered a sandwich as well (forget what one) but it looked better than mine.I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch and am excited to try it for dinner.
