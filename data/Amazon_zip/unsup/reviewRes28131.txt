Graham Elliot is amazing. Definitely one of the best meals I've had. I went here with my mom a few nights ago to celebrate my birthday, and it was an incredible experience. Service: The service is spot on. They're there whenever you want them to be, but they aren't overly attentive. The host was very friendly and so were the rest of the waiters. At the end of the meal, our waiter offered us a tour of the kitchen because it was my birthday and he could tell I was very interested in the food and the restaurant. Food: INCREDIBLE. The menu is very strange and unusual, but Graham Elliot does an excellent job of combining flavors and leaving the rest up to his chefs. Instead of the usual bread and butter, they brought us popcorn with parmesan "fluff" (flakes), black truffle oil, and chives. My mom and I both had the ten course "experience" meal ($119), which was definitely the best choice. That way we got to try a little of everything, since we couldn't make up our minds. Everything was delicious. They also had some yummy cocktails and a selection of amazing gourmet sodas from Sprechers Brewery in Wisconsin. They change their menu every three months. Graham Elliot writes out the menu and leaves a lot of room for interpretation. He lists three things and his chefs figure out what to do with the flavors. It may not be the same from one day to the next, and we were told that usually after the menu is released, it is completely different a week later. It is very obvious that everyone there loves what they do. The manager even recommended a restaurant in San Francisco when we told him that's where we were visiting from. I'm very glad we decided to go to Graham Elliot. I will definitely be going back.
