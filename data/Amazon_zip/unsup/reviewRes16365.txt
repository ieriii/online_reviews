Loved this place! Such a fun, vibrant and young atmosphere, and the colorful decor made me so happy. We started the evening at the bar, which was very lively, waiting for our table to clear. I had a coconut mojito, which was fabulous! For dinner, I ordered the vegetarian dish. The dish was creative and tasty with lots of nice ingredients. I had never had a similar vegetarian dish before. My boyfriend got a steak. I think he enjoyed it, though it may have been a little salty. I almost forgot, we got an order of guacamole (one avocado, that is plenty for two people) and it was so tasty. But be warned, if you order the guac, you will be tasting garlic until the next morning. I would highly recommend for a fun date spot or group outing.
