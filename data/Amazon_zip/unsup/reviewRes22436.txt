Great place for fun with a group! Irazu rocks for the following reasons -Food tastes great! -Atmosphere is lively -Staff is really friendly -Prices are very reasonable Warning, do not come here if you are very health conscious. This is where you go to be happy and stuffed. Make sure to try the Pepito Sandwich... $4.95 and you get Rib eye steak, sauteed onions, cheese, pinto beans & Lizano sauce. Go give it a try!
