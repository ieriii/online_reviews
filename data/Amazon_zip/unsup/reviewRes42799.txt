We went here to break our second last Ramadan fast because I trusted my Yelp friends and they told me I absolutely have to try this place if I liked pizza...in general. And who does not like pizza? Great pizza by the slice, I wished we had ordered a whole big vegetarian deep dish but we did not due to time constraints. I will be coming back here again, definitely said good bye to Giordanos since I found this new deep dish place that ROOOOCKS!
