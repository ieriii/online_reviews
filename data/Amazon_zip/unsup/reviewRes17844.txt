If Alice from Wonderland grew up and opened a bar, it would have been the Violet Hour. You enter through a hidden door from the street and are greeted by a very well dressed and genteel doorman. While you wait for a table to be readied, you have the opportunity to read their "House Rules." No cell phones (lovely!), no Grey Goose, no Jager bombs. This establishment is above all of that. You're led through the door into a barely lit room decorated in blue and purple hues. Individual high-backed chairs accomodate parties of 4 or fewer in the first room. Passing through a heavy light blue velvet curtain into the next room, you may be seated at the high-backed boothes. Everything is calm and elegant. Their delicious cocktails made from an extensive list of alcohols. You won't find bottom shelf liquors here, but you will have the option of ordering drinks with violet or chartreuse flavors. The bartenders are professionals who take the time to make your drink. There is no assembly line here, so be prepared to wait a little longer than normal for your cocktail. You won't mind though, as there are many decorative details to dawdle over. A grown-up Alice would have felt right at home at the Violet Hour.
