This was my first time at Le Colonial and I have nothing but good things to say about the food and staff there. The Bo Bia was amazing! Such a rich and tangy sauce.. and our service was very prompt, especially considering the crowd that night. My only complaint was that the seating seemed a little bit cramped, like they tried to cram too many tables in too small of a space, but it wasn't too bad. I know know anything about "authentic" Vietnamese cuisine, but this is definitely an excllent restraunt with superb food.
