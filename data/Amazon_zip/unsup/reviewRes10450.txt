I just had a really fantastic experience here. Alfredo provided tremendous service, the food was fantastic, the feel was warm and inviting and not at all stuffy, and the price was affordable. My girlfriend and I spent as much here (without wine) as we would on a regular trip out to Handlebar (with beer). A new favorite!
