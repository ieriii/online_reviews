Davanti was delicious! We got the toast with honey and ricotta in a mason jar, the burger (mm bacon jam) and a pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The pizza was really nothing special--a little overly greasy and salty. But everything else was heaven on a plate! The space is cool and intimate. My only note is that our waitress was a little standoffish and it was hard to tell who worked there and who didn't--nobody wore anything to indicate that they did so.
