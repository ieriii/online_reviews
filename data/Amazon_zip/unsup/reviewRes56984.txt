Went with my fianc for dinner, we actually wanted to try it for lunch first but after waiting a few months for them to open for lunch we figured we would go after the holiday it turns out they are not open for lunch anymore, what was is a month they were open for lunch only??The salad bar was okay, the meats in my opinion are low quality, hardly any flavor, some what tough and some even had a liver after taste to them! Service was not very helpful even thought they were not busy on the night we went. We will definitely not return. I recently received a $25 Gift Card from another Brazilian place not sure if we want to try another one for a while!
