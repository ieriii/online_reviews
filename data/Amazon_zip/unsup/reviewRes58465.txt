4 stars for The Gage. We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch/brunch. I had the fish and chips it was fabulous. The service was great and the manager even stopped by our table to see how things were going and to thank us for stopping by. Seriously, when does that ever happen? Yes, I could probably find cheaper bar fare elsewhere, but this was decorated nicely and it was really clean which is worth the extra money to me! Next time, I will try it for dinner!
