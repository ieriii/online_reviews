Really enjoyed hitting this place up this weekend. We got there at about 9 oclock and there was about an hour wait but there was a real nice open patio area where you can have some BYOB and chill. They also will get you stuff to make Sangria if you have brought the right stuff to mix. We chilled in the patio for about 40 min before there was an open table. The outdoor seating was fun, it was a beautiful night to be outside ... and we had some great food. We had the croquets as an appetizer and they reminded me of Spain. They have a very nice menu with a lot of fun options. It reminded me of some of the food we had in Puerto Rico which I love .. habichuelas, arroz, tostones, etc. I ordered the Cuban ... probably more of a lunch item but I have been craving a Cuban ever since I had one in Puerto Rico and their rendition of a Cuban was both very good and huge! Probably could split it with someone else. Everyone else in our group loved their food and spending part of a Saturday night here ... I will be back for sure! Gracias!
