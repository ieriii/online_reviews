LOVE this place. Where else can you go and get a flight of whiskey?!?! The bartenders were very helpful, and provided great recommendations. On top of that, the burgers were delicious, and came with AMAZING BBQ sauce. I loved it. I ate there two months ago, and can still imagine those fries! My friends and I came on a late Monday night, and I thought it was a Saturday, jam packed until last call. The place is nosy, so don't come here for an intimidate dinner/conversation.
