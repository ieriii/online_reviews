The rattlesnake hot dog is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.It's worth the wait in line and don't be afraid to try something new. They do a good job of pairing the unusual meats with complimentary toppings. When I'm scared, I usually get my favorite hot dog plus an exotic one. Just in case.The duck fat fries changed my life. I dream about them.
