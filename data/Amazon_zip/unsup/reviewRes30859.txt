Came on a Monday night thinking we didn't need a reservation; apparently we were mistaken. The waitress looked at us and said, "Let me see if there's something we can do you for" in the snidest way possible. Like really girlfriend? It's a fricking Monday night. Despite her pretentious attitude towards us lay-folk who don't know what a reservation is, she was thankfully able to do something for us; meaning a table in the bar--not the dining room. The bar was crowded and so loud you pretty much had to yell across the table... We almost got up and left before ordering anything because of the b!tch of a hostess and the noise level, but we decided to stick it out. Thankfully, the food was absolutely amazing. My steak was cooked to perfection (a.k.a. still bleeding) and the lobster mashed potatoes were heavenly. It was one of those "I'm-so-full-but-can't-stop-eating-because-it's-too-good-not-to" meals. Super pricey, but the food is incredible.  Oooh, also got an after-dinner cocktail (Lemon Drop martini) and they had dry ice in the bottom so it bubbles and smokes the entire time you're drinking it... pretty nifty Mastro's. I'll make sure to bring the hostess a Midol next time we're here.
