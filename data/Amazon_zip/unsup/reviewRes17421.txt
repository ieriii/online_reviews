Waste of time. I've heard about this place since I moved here over two years ago. We waited inside only about 30 minutes but it wasn't worth it. We sat at the bar and ordered as soon as we decided what we wanted. The drinks were regular bar drinks with A LOT of ice. So they took their time and used eye droppers and home made syrups- who cares it tasted like a decent gin or tequila drink. The environment wasn't what I expected either. The crowd was um how do I say....think eclectic mess...pantera shirt with shorts and flip flops to greased up d-bags. Ok I didnt see a pantera shirt but still. The couple next to us at the bar was making out and her skirt literally was up around her belly button...you could see EVERYTHING! And the door guy and bartenders walked by 20 times and ignored it. Who wants to see that. I couldn't getout my phone ad take a pic because oh yeah THEY BITCH ABOUT CELL PHONES, but not showing your fat naked ass? This place might have been a cool retro bar in 92, but now it just sucks.
