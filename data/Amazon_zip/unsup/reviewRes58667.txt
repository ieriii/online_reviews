SHADY!!! (even if you're into goulash) Beware of schill reviews from employees.WOULD NOT HONOR RESTAURANT.COM GIFT CERTIFICATE-Told us to order more food, desserts, etc. to bring our bill above arbitrarily changing minimum purchase amounts (clearly more than what was printed on our certificate)Right off the bat, the hostess asked if we were Romanian. Since we were the only non-Romanians in the place (actually there were only two families present on a Thursday night at 7:30) they gave us weird menus with inflated prices. Weird because they were crinkly pieces of paper with pen underlining and spilled food on them.The GYPSY decor didn't quite reconcile the $17-25 entree prices. We didn't actually try any of the food (mainly variations of stew or goulash) because the server was completely dishonest and unethical. TRYING TO USE OUR GIFT CERTIFICATE BECAME SLEASIER THAN NEGOTIATING A USED CAR PURCHASE. When the haggling broke down and we said we would just leave, she had the gall to say, You're already here, let me just bring what you ordered and 'we can work it out' later.If you must go, I strongly suggest CASH ONLY and watching your cell-phones, purses, and pockets.
