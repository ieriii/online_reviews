We came here after a long night of searching for a restaurant. Korean food seems to be our default choice of food, since it's usually really tastey and satisfying. This place was definitely satisfying. We ordered 2 whole chickens- half seoul sassy and half bbq. The guys devoured the chicken!! We also had an order of jumbo wings, just as delish and huge. I'm not sure what kind of chickens they used, but the wings were big. Drinks were $1 and there were plenty of towels to wipe are sauce filled fingers.  Great place to hang out with friends too. I think I like this place more than BonChon-- just because there's more sauce variety. =)
