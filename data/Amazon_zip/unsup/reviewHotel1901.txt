We closed down the bar/lounge last night! Yes, yes we did. I love swanky. My friends had their wedding reception at the W City Center last night and they knew how to throw a parrrtay! We were provided with a full (open) bar, awesome service (the servers were constantly refilling our wine/champagne, swarming us with hors d'oeuvres, etc), luxe accommodations and an amazing setting. The lounge/ballrooms were tastefully trendy. They have complimentary baskets full of green apples. Bathrooms were labeled as "WC" and I got instant flashbacks of Italia. I heart Italia. Anyway, the food, service, ambience, EVERYTHING the W provided during, before and following the reception blew me away. Dub, you are fabulous!
