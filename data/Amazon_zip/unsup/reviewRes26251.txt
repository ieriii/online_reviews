After hearing that this restaurant had a pretty killer banh mi lunch special (under $7 for a banh mi sandwich, drink, salad, soup, mini veggie egg rolls, and fresh fruit) we had to check it out. It was a slightly confusing experience for me. On the one hand, the service is excellent, the vibe is friendly, the food is pretty good, and the location is convenient. The menu is fairly easy to navigate, and the employees are really nice. Our food came quickly, and everything about the experience was great on overall. Unfortunately, the banh mi just wasn't banh mi. It was a tasty sandwich, definitely. But there was something missing. A few things, actually. First of all, the veggies weren't pickled. I mean, like, they've never heard of vinegar. They were crisp and tasty, but there was none of that sweet tartness that they should be contributing to the sandwich. The bread was slightly off, and larger that I'm used to. There was no mayo, no sauce or condiment of any kind, on either of the banh mi we ordered. It was pretty dry. So, while the sandwiches were good, they were just mixed veggie sandwiches, and nothing like any of the banh mi anywhere else in Chicago. The honest truth is that the banh mi at Simply It will not have me returning for more of the same... but I would come back in to try other items, because the staff and atmosphere were so great.
