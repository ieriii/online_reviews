I came here tonight with my family for Easter. The waiter was really helpful and friendly. They had live music which i didn't expect. The singer took song requests which was awesome. I have never tried Romanian food before. The food was fantastic! The roasted lamb was delicious. I ordered a lemon drop martini the liquor in it was way too strong i could only taste the alcohol at least their not cheap with liquor. I would definitely come back to Little Bucharest! By the way I loved the salad with the beets in it and the yummy desert.
