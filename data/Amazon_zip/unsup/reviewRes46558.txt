Great location, Decent food, poor service. It was mid day and lots of empty tables. The waitress was short with us. Burgers, homemade chips, sweet potato fries and Sante Fe wrap had excellent flavor. Skip the quesadilla appetizer: Limp like the ones i make on the fly in microwave at home. Close walk from Lincoln Park Zoo.
