Holy crap! Best pizza ever! Too bad they're in the city and I'm in the 'burbs. We had a fantastic Living Social deal, so we decided to check it out while we were in the city to see a play. The place is tiny, only a handful of tables, but not too crowded. They are BYOB, so we brought along a bottle of red to sip while we waited for our order. We had 2 pizzas, the Fogo2go and the 6 cheese. Both were to die for. The 6 cheese is absolutely decadent , but everyone should try it at least once. I'd also never had brie on a pizza, but now I'm a total fan.  After the play, we were waiting in Union station for the train back home, and some homeless guy came up and stole my leftovers!! At least a whole pizza worth of food! I guess that means 2 things: 1) I'll have to go back to Fogo2go. 2) That homeless guy has good taste!!
