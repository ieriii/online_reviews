5-stars. i COMMEND them on their concept: family-owned, ONLY humanely raised animals, no hormones or antibodies, no genetically modified mutant garbage, not even added coloring. they define ALL-NATURAL. i trust eating there better than from my own fridge. first thing i tried i still lust over: FRESH-made-right-there apple juice. a tad apply froth at the top. effin great. i'd drink like 10 of those... they make any juice mix of the fresh fruits and veggie drinks at hand... ah a bonus if only they could get me drunk. soooooooo much i want to try yet! i had the mushroom panini w barley side salad... i cleaned my plate... and my friends and neighbors had just as alluring plates. i can't wait to go back and gnosh some more here. they are rumored to have an awesome breakfast menu... i'm itchin' to try for myself. it's only open from 8AM-3PM.... so get your arse outta bed and stroll over. parking is legit possible and when the weather is fair it should make for a lovely bike ride. i love this area in bridgeport. such a cute place, that is the decor is loveable: white wainscoating on the bottom portion of the wall with natural exposed brick on the upper half. copper industrial like pendant lighting. i dig it. i dig it all.
