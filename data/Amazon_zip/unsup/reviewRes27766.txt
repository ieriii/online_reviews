Any place that serves truffled popcorn is a sign of good things to come. I'll spare you from a description that will only repeat what the other 169 reviews have to say and go straight into the glorious food. I had the hamachi and the duck with forbidden rice. I still dream about that rice, and my stomach spites me for not eating anything as remotely as good. At some point there was a course served with a balsamic sorbet (It's been a month since I've been, so please forgive my amnesia.) Graham Elliot's was by far the best, most memorable meal I had in Chi-town. Grab your favorite foodie and enjoy a night of pure culinary enjoyment.
