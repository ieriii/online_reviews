We were trying to find the best deep dish pizza in chicago to compare to Giordano's which we had been to before - Everyone said Gino's East. We went early because we heard about the lines - but walked right in (No reservations taken) - staff was friendly as they seated us upstairs - quite entertaining to read the writing on the walls - which they encourage. we ordered beer as the rest of their beverage menu is obviously not attractive and of course had an appetizer while waiting for our pizza - which didn't seem that long of a wait- Since there was two of us - the waiter was very helpful to us for portion sizes. We had the famous cheese and sausage (patties instead of crumbles) and a small. The pizza had a good sauce but the crust came away from the ingredients - as you put it on your plate - which didn't send the message that it was fresh.....the crust was okay - and not chewy (if you like that kind of crust) - the sausage was good and there was mozarella underneath it all.....We each ate only one piece - didn't want to waste the calories on a second. My friend and I definitely thought we had better. Guess next time we will have to try Uno's....but right now, for deep dish, Giordano is at the top of the list. PS the calamari was good and crunchy - served with two sauces - marinara and cocktail - when we left at 7:30 - still no lines......hmmmm - sounds like people are going somewhere else?
