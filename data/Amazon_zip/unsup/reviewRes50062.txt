Went with a group of friends from college as a bit of a reunion. Luckily, this place was down the street from me so the walk wasn't that unbearable in the frigid Chicago winter.  Let's start with the decor.. I was initially turned off by the club music blasting outdoors thinking to myself.. "oh great.. here we go." As soon as we walked in, I was swept with a sigh of relief. The music died down a bit and we could actually hear ourselves talk. My buddy had mentioned this place had a great selection of toppings for the burgers but I figured I'd try something off their pre-made selection.  The Surf and Turf burger was amazing. It was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and the crabcake was still flaky and delicious. The sweet potato fries... were incredible. My other friend mentioned he wanted to bottle it up and take it with him.. I will definitely be making a return.
