I've really liked this place every time I go there. The service is great and the menu is extensive. I'm not a sushi fan, which they have lots of, but there are plenty of other options for me. I'm a big fan of their Thai options and was especially pleased when I went in last Sunday and found out that they had a lunch menu with some of my favorites.  They just expanded the restaurant, it used to be teeny. Hopefully this means that business is good and they'll be around for awhile. p.s. Every one of my sushi eating friends thinks that the sushi here is really good... :)
