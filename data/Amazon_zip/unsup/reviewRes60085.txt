I dont understand why some restaurants feel the need to play their music so loud that its hard to have a conversation. Really-- why? Its just not necessary.  The food was ok, service inconsistent (from door to wait staff to bar), decor is beautiful, but the chairs are a bit uncomfortable. I really want to give Big Jones another chance. I've heard very mixed things, and so many experiences better than my own-- but, please- Turn Down The Music!!!!!
