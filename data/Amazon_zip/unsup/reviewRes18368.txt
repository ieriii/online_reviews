Frontera Grill was just a tad too busy (2 hour wait), so onto the next door child of RIck Bayless's family--XOCO. Got the special of the day--Goat Barbacoa: Braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla-tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions & cilantro. Polished off the meal with tastings of two flavors of the soft serve ice cream - get the caramel one over the chocolate because the chocolate cake pieces tasted really stale, like you were the last customer at a Coldstone on a hot summer day and the high schoolers at the back of the counter were running on fumes and not singing kind-of-stale. Don't leave without a churro! They are xo amazing so co get some.
