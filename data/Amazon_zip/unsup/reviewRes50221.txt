It's in a nice little area of Ukranian Village with a lot of other outdoor seating restaurant/pubs. Street pay parking seems to be generally available. We called ahead for our large group for Sunday lunch. When we arrived, they had our seats upstairs waiting for us (they have 3 floors) and open windows on main and upstairs floors. Flat screen tv's everywhere with all of the different NFL games going, what more could you ask for? The menu is extensive, and most of us stuck to wings and burgers. Everyone loved their burgers, and I loved my "Sizzle Drizzle" burger which contained bacon, gravy, sweet pretzel bun, and a bunch of other good stuff I can't even remember (food coma) and a side of sweet potato fries with a special sweet fry dipping sauce... beer menu is good, and their bloody mary's have a couple of pieces of fried bacon sticking out of it... marvelous... also, the wings were a good size and tasty.  I'm definitely a fan, but once my doctor sees my cholesterol level, he may ban me from Fifty/50 forever!
