I heard much about Davanti Enoteca but just never set out to be in that neighborhood at the right time. Finally the stars aligned and I went there for dinner around 6pm on a Friday. We were originally told the wait would be 1.5 to 2 hours but it ended up being around 30-40 minutes which is very nice. If you get there later, expect to wait much longer. I did order a gin cocktail at the bar which was nothing to rave about so stick to the wine. On Fridays they have discounted cheese plates so we ordered one of those. I decided the rest of the menu should consist of the following (thanks to yelp!): grilled asparagus, truffle egg toast, linguine with sea urchin and crab, and the grilled hanger steak. The linguine is amazing. You can definitely see why it's the most mentioned item in the reviews. Just the right amount of flavor. The truffle egg toast was also very delicious. The portions are not huge by any means but what we ordered was just the right amount for two people. The service was fantastic and attentive. There are only a few very minor things I can complain about (and i do mean minor). The food cooled very quickly after it was brought. Perhaps they can serve it on very hot plates so the food stays warm longer. This could also be due to the fact that we were sitting right by the window underneath an AC vent (that was closed) but nevertheless there was cold air seeping from above. The only other issue I had was in the washroom with the soap dispenser. I had to pump it about 20 times or so to get a decent amount of soap on my hands. Overall this is a great restaurant/wine bar. I can't comment on the wine since I did not try it but I can say that their wine list by the bottle has retail pricing. So you don't have to break the bank to come here. Just make sure you get there kind of early.
