I love this pizza. It's exactly like the pizza you eat in parts of Italy. If you want thin crisp, do NOT go there. It's not as thick as a pan pizza but it's certainly thicker than thin crisp. I love the one with arrugula, prosciutto and cheese. I love the atmosphere and if you get there later on a Saturday (around 9) you will have better chances of sitting down right away instead of waiting in line.
