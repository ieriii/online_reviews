Thomas makes a mean bloody mary. After over hearing my friend and I (we were the only early birds in the place- as they just opened), talking about the one bloody mary we had just had elsewhere, he ever so politely boasted that they were better here at The Fifty/50. We agreed to his challenge and boy was he correct- uh- mundo. Loved the horseradish in the drink. Robust, spicy but not over the top- perfect.Thomas was a jovial cat and kept us drinking a little longer than planned. But, hey, isn't that how it usually happens? Bravo!!
