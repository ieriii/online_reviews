Got the chance to try out Graham Elliot a few weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised. Wasn't sure what to expect going in, and found that my fear of items being too gimicky was totally unfounded. The three dishes I was particularly nervous about, were the truffled popcorn, which was addictive and fantastic, the foielipop, which I could have done without, and the twinky ceasar, which was really yummy. The rest of the dishes on the 10 course each had a truly delicious component in them, but were sometimes surrounded by too many superfluous additions. Some worked, but many lacked a coherence between each of the ten layers (ok, I'm exaggerating) in the dish. But as I said, when it worked it worked. The desserts were outstanding. You can tell the Chef has a sweet tooth throughout his savory fare, and he really employs this passion perfectly in the desserts! The service was really great from the get go, starting with a cute bartender that made exceptional cocktails. Our server was pretty stunning in her own right, she had this sort of glamour reminiscent of a 1940's film actress with jet black finger waves, a poised stature, and charms, yet was hilarious and intelligent at the same time. She was incredibly helpful in describing the menu at the beginning, and was there to answer our many questions along the way. Overall, our experience was great.
