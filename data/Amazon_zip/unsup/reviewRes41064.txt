Food - good and CHEAP! i wasn't expecting anything fabulous beforehand, but by the end i ended up liking all the food that i got here (bun w/eggroll as well as the Vietnamese sandwiches)...so i'd definitely come back again for some cheap eating. :) Service - nice people, but horrible service! but that's OK considering everything is so gosh darn cheap! they are not attentive, and they don't make eye contact with you so you can't get them to come over... so basically when they walk by you gotta get creative to get them to come back to your table.
