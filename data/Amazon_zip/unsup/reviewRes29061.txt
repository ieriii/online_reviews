I read so much about the long waits involved with going to Frontera Grill, but I was in Chicago for one weekend, and so decided to risk it. We arrived at 6:30 on a Thursday, and were seated at a table in the bar area within 15 minutes, so the timing worked very well. Between everyone at the table, we tried about 10 specialty cocktails. All were delicious, and we were especially fans of the coffee/tequila drinks on the dessert menu. We ordered the Appetizer Sampler for the table, and that was a great way to try a little of everything. The items were delicious, except for some strips of some sort of root vegetable, which were cold and did not really mesh with the rest of the platter (taquitos, ceviche, guacamole). My meal was the chicken tacos al carbon. Nothing fancy to it, just excellent ingredients and cooking. I definitely recommend Frontera Grill, and get there a little early to avoid a long wait.
