Best Brazilian restaurant I've ever been to! My mom took me here for my birthday and it was absolutely delicious!  The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated with a lot of modern tones, furniture, and fully stocked bar. There's a buffet in the middle of the restaurant that serves the "family style" side portion of the meal: there's salad, rice, and other side dishes to compliment the meat portion of the meal. The kebab style meat is the star of any Brazilian restaurant, and this place has the best cuts of the meat cooked to perfection. The gauchos that serve the food are classically-dressed and always attentive. There is a small token that you have next to you on the table and you turn it to one side if you want some more food and turn it over when you're done. They pay close attention to the customers who are requesting more meat and they serve it to you fresh off the grill. There are great cuts of veal, filet mignon, lamb, etc. There was more than any person could ever eat! It was so delicious.  Martinis were delicious and highly recommended. Also, the dessert selection changes quite often, but everything we had was delicious, including the creme brulee.  Definitely recommended over any other Brazilian establishment I've ever been to; highly recommended.
