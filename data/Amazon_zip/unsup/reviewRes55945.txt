Overall a good experience. It's a quaint little spot - we've been there before and will go again. Get there early as no reservations for parties of fewer than six people. We gave them our name and cell phone number and he called when the table was ready - I Love that! The food is very good, although we couldn't quite put it in the great category. The very fresh bread and chopped garlic at the start of the meal was excellent. The waitstaff was very attentive. The BYOB is always a bonus so we can spend more on food. The tiramisu was a nice way to cap things off. Suggestion to Caro Mio: The lighting isn't nearly good enough to easily read the dessert menu - dark print on a dark background? Who thought that one up?
