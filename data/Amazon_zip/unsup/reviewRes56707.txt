Food poisoning. On my 30th birthday.I chose Sapori based on Yelp reviews for my birthday dinner. And yes, the food was good. The service was good, the servings were huge, and we had tons left over to take home. The butternut squash ravioli? Delicious. And that was not the culprit. These factors take my rating from one star to three.The problem was with the leftovers. Maybe the dressing on the salad interacted with the aluminum take-home container; maybe someone use a contaminated utensil when transferring the food to the container. I live near the restaurant, and the food went straight into the fridge when we got back--and none of it contained meat--so it wasn't my fault. The cannoli and salad were all I ate the next night, and before I finished the cannoli I started to feel sick, and I wasn't back up to speed for nearly 2 days afterward. Worst food poisoning I've had in many years.I haven't been able to eat homemade pasta since, and though I'm willing to eventually give Sapori another shot, it will be a while yet. My birthday was back in February, and another birthday may pass before I can give them another try.
