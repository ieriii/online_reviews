In fairness, I'm a New Yorker. I won't belabor this point, but in short, Pizzeria Uno's has better tasting crust. The pizza that is placed in front of you is beautiful. It is cheesy and crusty and you have great expectations, but if you like crust with taste, not like an extended cracker, you may not like this style pizza. The place was packed and came highly recommended, but I wasn't impressed.
