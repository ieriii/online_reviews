Meh. I've experienced better. Smoque, The Smoke Daddy, and Lillie's Q are all MUCH better options. Unless I was there on an off night, this was mediocre BBQ at best. I really, really cannot understand the four and five star ratings. I had the brisket, which lacked any sort of flavor. For a restaurant that bills itself as a BBQ joint, this is not acceptable. The brisket reminded me of meat my mother would prepare, and that is not a good thing.  While it appeared to be of good quality, it was tasteless and required heaps of sauce. And as for the four offered sauces - spicy, sweet mild, mustard-based, and vinegar based - they are not terrible, but they are definitely not memorable. Also, the macaroni and cheese was incredibly bland, as was the coleslaw.  I was soo disappointed. The best parts of my meal were the pickles and BBQ chips that are placed on the table as soon as you are seated.  The service, however, was great and the drink selection is varied, but service only takes you so far. The next time I am craving BBQ, I will likely head back over to Smoke Daddy or Lillie Q's.
