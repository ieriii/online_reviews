Rick Bayless is a genius! On a trip to Chicago, my boyfriend and I were extremely excited to try one of Rick Bayless' three restaurants. We are huge fans of his ever since he won Top Chef Masters. We took a cab to Frontera Gril and were surprised to realize that all three of his Chicago restaurants are on the same block. It was pretty early and we weren't quite sure if we wanted a full meal so we picked Xoco. It was the least formal of the three and seemed like the best choice for brunch.  The concept of Xoco is more of Mexican street food, tortas, soups, desserts . Yet another place popular place with a pretty long line, I was surprised that it moved pretty quick. You line up, order and then waitress finds you a seat in this pretty bustling restaurant. The menu was pretty large for a lunch place so we were overwhelmed with choices but decided on the following: Ahogada torta - rick bayless' take on a soup and sandwich...a pork carnitas sandwich cut in two nestled in a tomato broth soup..very spicy Jamon torta - one of the best sandwiches I have eaten, a panini style pressed sandwich with spicy prosciutto, sharp cheddar, avocado, black beans and a fried egg. fresh guacamole with homemade chips and for dessert: Freshly made churros - warm, crunchy and chewy dusted with cinnamon and sugar with chocolate dipping sauce and mexican vanilla frozen yogurt for dipping. we were also intrigued with his choices of mexican hot chocolates. there were about 5 or 6 to choose from but we decided on his Classic hot chocolate. It was perfectly warm, thick and creamy, rich and chocolately. Hands down, THE best hot chocolate we have ever had. If you are ever in Chicago, do yourself a favor and visit Xoco. You will not be disappointed!!
