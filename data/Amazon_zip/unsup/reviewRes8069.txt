Chicago's Authentic Neapolitan Pizza! Looking for the perfect lunch this past Sunday afternoon, I thought about how good everyone says this place is. I also wanted to prepare for my trip to Italy in a few weeks, by eating something that was "Authentic Italian" Very nice interior with nice music playing, I was quite impressed with the place before I even ordered my meal. Our very nice server Katie (who has never seen The Godfather, by the way) was all smiles as she came to take our order. I wasn't in the mood for wine so I went with Peroni (Italian Beer) and to eat I went with pizza of course...The Bufalina. Bufalina includes basil, Mozzarella di Bufala and Olive Oil. Very good pizza, but the red sauce was a little too runny. I was so hungry I ate the whole damn pizza. Katie came back and asked if we wanted dessert...I could not resist. I went with the Tiramisu which was very delightful. Along with the tiramisu, I decided to have some grappa..good stuff! Great place to get some pretty good pizza! The have an outside patio, but I did not take advantage of it because it was pretty windy out, but don't worry...I will return.
