Opart is hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in the city. The restaurant itself is easy to get to, and really cute inside. It's byob and there is a liquor store about 5 feet away. I often judge Thai places by two very basic staples: crab rangoon and chicken pad thai. Both are outstanding. Fresh and super hot, I have gone to other places closer to my apartment just to be disappointed. Their noodles are to die for, they have big chunks of chicken and.....oh jeez now I want some. Crap. Their iced coffee is delish too, even in the winter. Now if you will excuse me, I need to start calling friends to see who wants to go eat.
