We've been searching for a new Indian restaurant, and just discovered India House today. We went to the buffet. I've never had a buffet like this before- it was amazing. The selection and quality of the buffet was unlike any place I've ever been (at $15 it isn't cheap, but more than worth it). As a vegetarian, I had 5 different entree options, and all were distinct and absolutely delicious. Others have written that it is the best Indian food in Chicago, and based solely on the buffet, I would say that isn't far off. The only minus is that parking is a pain because of the location.
