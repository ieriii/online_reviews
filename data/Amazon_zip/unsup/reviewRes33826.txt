Really, really good eggs benedict. Very friendly service if a bit inattentive at times. Price is okay. Pecan roll is massive, but extremely sticky so it wasn't all that pleasing to eat since it kept getting stuck in my teeth. I also didn't like the fact that they gave me coffee right when I was seated, and so I thought it was free, but then it ended up being billed. :( Still, I'd come back again for the eggs benedict.
