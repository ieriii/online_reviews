Let's first start by saying Tank was one of my favorite places to eat. I'll never go back and dine there again. Allow me to explain. Tank was one of those places that we would rely on for good, inexpensive food. It was one of our go-to spots- the kind of place that everyone would finally agree upon when we couldn't get a consensus on where to go. Tonight's experience was enough to convince the whole family that it's no longer an option for us anytime in the future. Tonight, as we've done so many times in the past, decided as a group to go to Tank. And the night went how it usually goes when we dine there. That is, until we were about ready to leave. Several of us wanted to get a bubble tea, as we usually do, on our way out. And as the waiter was jotting down our orders, a lady (who I assume was his manager or something) runs and yells at him not to take our order as they're about to close. Soon after, all the employees began clearing tables, putting chairs on tables, and cleaning the restaurant. It mattered little if people were still eating. To add an extra level of grossness to the story, they set up a table where they condense all the half-empty Siratcha bottles to make them all look full. The bottom line: they may have good food, but they need to show their patrons more courtesy by continuing to serve until the last customer leaves the restaurant. The siratcha thing speaks for itself- that's just plain wrong. Sorry, Tank, but you lost several of your loyal return customers.
