The wine list is extensive and the servers are knowledgable. I thought the food was generally very average, and at times not good at all (the truffled hot cheese was WAY too heavy on the truffle). But the service was quite poor even though we were there at a low-traffic time. The server who was waiting a different set of tables had to come over to help us three or four times because our own server was nowhere to be found. In addition, the toast that came with the truffled cheese was burned, and then when we sent it back, the new toast came out burned too.
