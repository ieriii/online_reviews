Great prices, good food. Not somewhere you should make an occasion of, but a good stand-by if you live near enough to walk. The Italian panini is great, and the bruschetta was pretty good--if you like lots and lots of garlic. The bolognese pasta was very meaty, and seasoned well. There's probably not a bad thing on the menu.
