After our forgettable dinner at Pegasus, we came here for dessert. Strong Greek coffee as expected. We shared the rice pudding and the phyllo dough dessert and custard. The latter was warm, creamy and worth a trip back. No rush from the waiter to leave. Didn't have to wait for a table around 9:30pm on a Sat night.
