The Chicago Diner is a great place to eat if you have allergies or special dietary needs. They serve vegan food and baked goods. Personally I have only eaten their desserts. When I was younger I ordered a cake from them. It was good, however it did taste as if it was vegan. Since then I have eaten their muffins, cakes, and cookies. They have improved exponentially! Family and friends who have tried their desserts that eats dairy on a daily basis says it taste close to the real deal. You can purchase some of their items directly from the Dinner or at any local Whole Foods.
