The Lockdown is like Kuma's really obnoxious little brother or sister who wants to be jussssst like Kuma when he or she grows up - louder. cheaper. 1000x less busy. and the (what must have been expensive!) decor seems like a bad joke. Again, we used to live around the corner from this place and worked late hours. They serve food late and their beer is cheap, so I got suckered into coming more times that I would like to remember. I have a 14 year-old metalhead cousin; he would love this place. I have a middle-aged metalhead excoworker (from my adolescent Pizza Hut serving days) who would think he had died and gone to heaven in this place. I don't care if it's a sportsbar or a metal bar, I hate Hate HATE 1) not being able to speak to the person I'm sitting next to without yelling, and 2) when everyone at your table has to give up on conversing, becomes a zombie, and just zones out to watch one of the 3,495 televisions that are on everywhere, all around you. The food is exactly what you would expect from a Kuma's copycat. It's good when you are craving bar food. The two things I will give them is that 1) the owner is very very nice, and 2) he mentioned to me more than once that you can call ahead and request a certain band or kind of music, because they have "just about everything" rock-related. Were I ever to go back, I would take them up on this and request Depeche Mode, which they told me they have, even if they probably don't want to admit it ;) So why the three stars if I hate this place? Because my boyfriend loves it, and I think it's cruel to rate small businesses just one or two stars on Yelp unless something really really terrible happens :)
