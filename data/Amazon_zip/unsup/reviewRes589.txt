You've read the critics' reviews as well as Yelpers' comments. To sum it up in one sentence, this place is just as much about the sizzle as the steak. The food is very savory and delicious, and the presentation is beautiful and elegant. My boyfriend always says that dessert should never come in big portions so that you're left wanting more. Alinea gives you just that: small bites of rich flavor.  There were definitely some dishes that I didn't enjoy as much as others. But this is really a personal preference issue and in the end I was still intrigued by what I was eating. The one thing that made my experience less than perfect is that for the dessert portion, the chef did not come out to prepare it for us like he did at all the other tables around us. I was really looking forward to meeting him, so I was very bummed out about this (and felt left out). But I understand that he needs a break and cannot do it for every single table. I just wish he hadn't skipped our table!
