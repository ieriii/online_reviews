The decor is as everyone described it - colorful, artistic, just plain ole cool. I opted to sit at the bar have a drink and some tapas of sorts to kill some time. Yes, the food can be a bit pricey and the guacamole wasn't that gret but my flores camarones was quite tasty.  However, this review is about Luis. When I say attentive to every detail?! I am a special kind of drinker and like what I like and do not like what I do not like. He went out of his way to create me something special! He went so far as to taste it to make sure it was good before he served it to me. I mentioned that to him and he says "I won't serve you anything I will not drink." Talk about service? I'll be back for just him. He was fabulous and that is why this place got 4 stars.
