For it's location and it's price, the Hilton Garden Inn is not a bad place to stay. Located a few blocks from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, and also walking distance to other shops and dining options, where can you go wrong, right? Well, for one...because of all the above, I am sure lots of families like to stay there as was apparent by my neighbors and the sounds of their kids, the cartoons, and the occasional loud conversations either on the phone or just generally to each other. I am sure the hotel can't do anything about this, but I'm just saying. Also, I am usually an easy going traveler with no specific requests for my room other than a queen/king-size bed. But, I would appreciate that if I did not request for a handicapable room, you do not put me in a handicapable room. I am sure it could have been put to better use. And although I am aware that I could have asked for another room, I had already unpacked my items before I had realized this. And to be fair and honest (and NOT mean), I just was not very comfortable in the bathroom as it was made for the handicapable (the toilet seats where rather high....I am particularly short), and the shower just a shower (like gym showers) to make it more accomodating for wheelchairs and such. And one more odd thing....what hotel still has a "13th" floor? I know it's just superstition, but that still creeped me out a bit....cause that was my floor. Aside from that, the staff (front desk and bell men) were extremely friendly and helpful, and I loved how the moment you checked in you had an option to get 2 small bottles of water or 1 large one....complimentary. I always hated those $4 bottle of waters other hotels try to force on you cause they know you'll be thirsty by the time you get to your room.
