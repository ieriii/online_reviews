So incredibly good - it is definately a treat! On the heavy side so couldn't order weekly. People should know that the pizzas take a long time. I thought it said it on the menu or it used to. We walked in on a Sunday night around 6:30 - it was packed - but we still managed to get seated within 15 minutes. We put our order in right away but it was a good 45 minutes - which we expected. I watched 2 different tables get upset - one took their appetizers to go and cancelled the zaa and the other table just left. What a mistake because their pan pizza is the best!
