Quintuple YUMMY!! My gal pal and I enjoyed a girls' night last night and had a blast!! !/2 priced glasses/bottles of wine were highlighted, the tag teaming of the waiters was spot=on, and the live entertainment added a little somethin', somethin' to the fun! Now for the food: salad with a zesty vinaigrette / chunks of bread, apples, and grapes accompanied by fresh cheese fondue / tofu, zucchini, potatoes, onions, carrots, broccoli, etc...accompanied by a wide array of dipping sauces / marshmallows, strawberries, bananas, pound cake, crushed graham crackers accompanied by chocolate fondue....Do I need to say anymore!! The fact that the restaurant is slightly lower than the sidewalk on Armitage and the restaurant consists of several cubby holes (surrounded by empty wine bottles) added a feeling of an escape from every day life. So ready to have another "fat day/evening"!!
