My bf and I came here last week (sat) because we wanted to try real Greek food (and just the gyros you get everywhere). We couldn't decide which restaurant to go into (there are so many..) so we just went to the first place we saw, which was this place! The restaurant was huge, and we had to wait about 15 mins. The place vaguely reminded us of someplace we've been to before....then it hit us. This place was like the Greek version of Olive Garden. Totally, except the salad one would get at Olive Garden was sooo much better than this place, sadly :( I was looking forward to my greek salad because I loooove Greek salads, but it was just a pile of overly drenched wet ice berg lettuce, 3 olives, 1 tomato spear, and a chunk of feta cheese (which I love) Moving on, the rest of the food was good. We just went traditional I guess, just ordering foods that we've heard other people talk about in the past. Besides the Greek salad :( everything was good, and we got our money's worth---we had leftovers for the next day.
