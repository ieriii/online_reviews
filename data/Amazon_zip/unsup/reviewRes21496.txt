I love this place, one of my favorite places for Mexican. Pretty good (although sometimes a little too sweet) margaritas- which are half price on Tuesday and Thursday. Decent atmosphere, friendly enough staff. Great chips and salsa, and I almost always get the fish tacos, although the veggie enchiladas are good as well.
