The sushi at this place is good. Having recently returned to Chicago from California, I don't know if I was just expecting too much or what, but I thought it was pretty alright but not much better. The service was hyper-attentive to the point that I felt unduly pressured. The assistant/busboy was literally asking to clear the plates away from us before I even began chewing my last bite; I don't know about you, but I like to finish the food before table-clearing begins. The server was nice, but also hyper-attentive. She basically tried to order for us when it was apparent that we didn't speak Japanese (which I doubt she did, excepting her knowledge of Coast's menu). I'm quite familiar with sushi and sashimi, but I don't necessarily know the word for "eel sauce" in Japanese! When I'm out for dinner, I don't feel like trying to impress the servers with my culinary knowledge... Within one minute of having our plates cleared (see above) she appeared asking us if we wanted dessert or just the check. I don't know why she felt the need to push us out the door so quickly, as the place was only half-full. If there's one thing I can't stand, it's being pressured and bullied by the servers and I think the good intentions of this crew fall into that category. I thought it was expensive for what you get, especially when you're pushed out the door before you're ready to go.
