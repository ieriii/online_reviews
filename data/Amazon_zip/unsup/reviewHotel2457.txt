I was in town for Lollapalooza and stayed at another hotel down the street for Friday and Saturday. On Sunday night, I was just planning on crashing on a friend's couch. But I looking on the web and found out someone picked up the Hilton on Priceline for $70 for Sunday night. Sure enough, my $70 bid did it and now I had a place to cool off inbetween bands, as the Hilton is right across from the park. Couldn't ask for a better room... love the dual plugs in the lamb on each nightstand. Totally awesome hotel layout. Apparently the building was put up in 1929, and it looked like it was probably THE spot back in those days. My only gripe was the overpriced ($14.95/day!!!) wifi. Staff was excellent, though!
