I decided to give this place another chance and go to the store and place an order. I ordered a Four Cheese pizza. I am not an "all-cheese" pizza fan (except for this one pizzeria on Manhattan's Upper West Side ) but figured that was the best menu item to start with. I was pleasantly surprised.I think that the smell of food is just as important as the food itself. It was a good sign that the pizza smelled great and you can actually pick up some of the ingredients. The pizza had a great balance of crust to topping. The crust was light- not at all heavy and or "powdery". The spices were subtle, but clearly apparent and were not overpowered by the sauce or cheese. The sauce was excellent, lightly flavored and not acidic or too sweet. All the ingredients came together to make an excellent pizza.I thought it was impressive that after my pizza was done, the baker took it to the manager (owner?), opened the box, and had him look at it. He shook his head with approval and I was handed it. I have rarely seen that kind of attention paid to food.The establishment was nice, clean, and large enough to hang out in. The staff was friendly and seemed to like each other. Notwithstanding my previous experience, I will definitely be going back to Fogo 2 Go.
