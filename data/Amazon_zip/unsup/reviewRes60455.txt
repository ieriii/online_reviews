I've live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try this place out. When I went, there was a long line and people waiting outside. The hostess was so bubbly and assured us that there would be a short wait and it would not be long. After finally getting in, the wait was definitely worth it! The food was amazing (I had the rabbit) and the ambiance made me feel like I was in a bistro in Paris. Will definitely be back!
