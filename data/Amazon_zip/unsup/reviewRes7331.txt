Meh is right. It's early Friday night and I am going to take the mister out to dinner. We walk pass Chicago Q and there's no line outside. The valet guys are all standing around gawking at whatever female goes by. I'm thinking no problem. We walk in and the Host is very nice and asks how many? "I say 2, I hope we don't need a reservations." I can see several empty tables. Host says, 'i can seat you, but you have to be out in an hour and half?" Seriously? Or you have to wait 2 hours. Right then and there i should have turned around and walked out. Wow! I'm like, "OK, we'll take our chances." We wanted to see if there was better BBQ then having to drive all the way out to Smoque since we live in the 'hood. Starters were a nice touch. Bread and butter pickles, yummy, and the chips with the BBQ seasoning were great. The second bowl of chips were nasty. Probably what they serve when you ask for seconds. They were overcooked, bitter tasting and were much darker. We ordered the Onion Rings, Hush puppies and split a dinner item of the 1/2 slab baby back ribs and pulled pork with cole slaw. The onions rings were OK. To me they could have been cooked longer and most were missing batter. They serve them with a sour cream dill sauce. i didn't like the combo, but I dipped the rings in the chipotle sauce that came with the hush puppies that were good. Main course was meh, OK. Came with a plate of different sauce. The regular BBQ sauce was way to sweet, the mustard one tasted like honey mustard and the only one i liked was the spicy sauce, but it too was overly sweet. The meat was typical BBQ fair, nothing out of this world, but it was edible. I prefer a little more smoke in my pulled pork. Ribs were ok. I still like Smoque better.
