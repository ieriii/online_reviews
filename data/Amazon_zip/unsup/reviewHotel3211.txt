They wake you up, no matter what-- Yeah, the hotel is in a great location and has a fun vibe and does everything right except for one thing---The housekeepers literally go in and out of the doors about 20 times per room, allowing it to slam shut as they do.... So even though you have a do not disturb sign on the door, you will be woken up at 8... plus they talk to each other in the hallway (or on the phone), which is like them standing in your room talking..
