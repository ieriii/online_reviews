i really liked this place. a great place for a nice night out with friends or a date went with a group of friends for dinner. we ordered just about everything on the menu, but i wont list it all off. among the highlights were the short rib + scallop (flavor explosion), mushroom risotto, and octopus. but really i thought everything was great except for the cauliflower (psh vegetables...). and i'm usually not into cocktails, but after a strong recommendation from the server i got the cha cha, which was great as well. we ended up getting a few pitchers of sangria too the restaurant space itself is pretty cool; nice design and a lot of open space. the restaurant was full and had a nice, lively energy about it. made you really feel like you were out and part of the city, if that makes any sense the service was good; attentive, friendly and helpful. the only real issue i have is that it's a bit too expensive to go to on a regular basis. each dish is around $12 each. add in the drinks, which was half our tab; i paid about $100 for the night. worth it for a nicer night out with the buddies, but just a bit unsustainable. which is too bad because i'd love to come back often
