Ok, Piece has a great idea - Pizza and micro brews. But I suggest you skip the pizza and stick to the beer. I gave their pizza a few chances...but I just wasn't into it. Not the toppings, crust, sauce or cheese. I did learn one thing - ask for it well done...it will make the pizza slightly better. Also a large with 4 topping and tip is $32... Oh, when they tell you 20 minutes for a table, expect to wait 45.
