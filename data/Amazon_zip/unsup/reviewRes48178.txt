Poached eggs are my FAVORITE breakfast food. And I think the red wine poached eggs here are the best I've ever had in my life. This is honestly all I can say about it because every time I start thinking about them I start salivating and my mind glazes over... I knew a lot of my fellow Yelpers recommended the spicy pork rinds, but I was reluctant to order them since I'm not really a fan. However, my friend had never tried pork rinds before, so we decided to get them anyway. Wow, thank god we did. Best pork rinds I've ever had in my life. I think it's unfair to even call them pork rinds, they're some kind of magic-Publican-crack-chip. The flavoring is so full-bodied and amazing and had just the perfect amount of spice. We'd made a reservation beforehand so we didn't have to wait, which I would recommend. Service was a little slow, but all the waiters were super friendly and accommodating. We were on our way to the airport so we had all our bags with us, and they checked in our coats and all of our bags, which was completely complimentary. When we were on our way out, the hostess already had our bags waiting for us at the front desk as she said she had seen us getting up to leave! I also loved the layout of the place as well as the bathrooms. Barnyard chic! The environment seems really bustling and friendly yet you still have enough privacy to catch up with your friends. While my friend and I were taking pictures of our food, the people eating to us smiled, shook their heads and said to each other, "Yelpers." Yep.
