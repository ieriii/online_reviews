I am so happy I finally got to check this place out! Ever I've moved back to the states after living in Korea I've been in search for some "perfectly fried chicken" and I think I found it at crisp. My friend and I went and shared a bowl of bibimbap - or Original Bad Boy Buddha Bowl, as they call it, and the Seoul Sassy chicken. I have to admit, it was a little more dry than the traditional "yang-yum" or sauce that is used in greasy chicken joints in Seoul, but it still hit the spot for me! The prices are really great for what they give you and I think they offer some great variations on Korean food. I look forward to trying everything on the menu before the year is out!
