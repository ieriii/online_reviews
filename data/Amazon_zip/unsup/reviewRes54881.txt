The quality of food is surprisingly good. Definetely better than your average bar and grill. The quality and selection of beer is truly impressive. The feel and ambiance of the dining room is worth the trip. Our service wasn't great but to be fair, our server was in the weeds, we understood. Portions were good and left us feeling as if we got good value for our money. Will go again.
