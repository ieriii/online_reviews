For anyone who gave this place less than four stars -- how? I rarely think anything is perfect, but this place is "as good as it gets" in terms of quality of food and bang for your buck. I went with four others, and between us, we ordered Crab Rangoon, Hot and Sour Soup, Pork Dumplings, Spicy dried Beef, "Crack Chicken," Orange Chicken and Beef, Garlic Chicken. Everything was delicious, minus the spicy dried beef, which was kind of just like beef jerky with a spicy sauce drizzled over it. I still found it decent though. The crack chicken, AKA Tony's 3 Chili Chicken, was my favorite. It doesn't look like it's coated in anything, but it is with a sort of sweet, smoky and spicy glaze. The Orange dishes were superb and extremely flavorful, the soup was scrumtrulescent, and the rangoon was honest-to-God the best I've ever had. The only other "qualm" I have is that the hot pepper oil is EXTREMELY hot, and I wasn't really warned about it -- but I guess that's more my friends' fault because they knew prior to me ingesting it. And the price was very good as well. It's not extremely cheap, but it's about what you would expect dishes to cost in a sit-down place, and they give you A LOT of food. The service was kind of slow, but hey, they were extremely busy, and I'm willing to let that slide because the food was worth the wait. A DEFINITE MUST-EAT PLACE if you are even a casual fan of Chinese.
