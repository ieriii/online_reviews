Wow. What a great meal. Excellent, as always. The spicy mussels were perfect, the bucatini was a 7 on 10. The tagliatelli was great, and so was the cod. We tried the goat cheesecake - not so good. Returned it and went with the server's recommendation of the chocolate mousse, Excellent. Never a bad meal ,,, and in the heart of Andersonville. Highly recommended. Oh, and the cocktails before dinner were perfectly prepared. Great bartender.
