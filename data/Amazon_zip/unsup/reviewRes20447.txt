Oh yeah this place is good. I wish I had brought a beer with me cause everyone else around me was smart enough to remember that Coast is BYOB. Do yourself a favor and try the super white tuna sashimi. It was amazing! I actually sang a song about it and told my boyfriend I was dumping him for Super white tuna. It was that good. If you don't order it you are missing out, BIG TIME.
