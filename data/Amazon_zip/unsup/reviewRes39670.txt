One of the best Korean BBQ I have found in the city. The marinades they use are delicious, not overly salty and flavorful. We normally get a couple of the different marinated beef, chicken, and squid. The side dishes that are served with the meal take up all the space on the table and a variety of foods that I'm sure you'll find something you like. If you want seconds, they will fill you back up with whichever side dish you want. We also normally get the seafood pancake which is very tasty. It's got all these pieces of scallion, shrimp, and squid all mixed in. The dipping sauce on the side goes very well with the pancake. Even though their food is delicious, there are a couple of downsides, the service is quite slow and there a lot of pointing of menus and stuff like that since their English is not very good and we don't speak a lick of Korean. The parking lot is also very small and cramped. You'll be lucky to find a spot in the lot, but there are plenty of spots on the side streets. Also, don't plan on going anywhere afterward because you will walk out smelling like Korean BBQ (which is delicious, but I'm sure others at the bar will just stare and wonder why you are wearing food as perfume). Overall, this is an awesome place for a delicious meal and I highly recommend it if you've never had the pleasure of trying Korean BBQ.
