Went out to Bad Apple over the holidays and had a great time. The place was loud and we had to wait a while to get a seat, but we could have ordered a beer - had we been able to get the bartenders attention. Crowded was indicative of the place though. I wish they'd take reservations. Beer selection was great, nay, fantastic, but not cheap. The selections on tap changed twice while we there - which got a little confusing, but fortunately they had what we were looking for. Decent liquor selection too. Didn't get to try the fun froofy drinks, but there is always next time. Waiter was a pleasure, though it was clear he had a lot of tables. Still, quite attentive for the crowd. Food was great. I only got a salad but mooched off of my friends. Plenty of food with the plates, though the cheese curd appetizer was a little small for four people. Granted, it could have been cause we were so hungry since we had to wait so long. I'd go back and try it again. I'd give them 3 1/2 stars, so maybe a return trip will solidify the 3 or bump this review up to a four. I'd recommend it if you're in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way.
