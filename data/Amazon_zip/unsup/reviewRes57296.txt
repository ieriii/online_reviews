Coast makes sushi taste like no other sushi in my opinion.Most people do find sushi pretty gross and disgusting because it is raw fish. In my opinion I absolutely love it and am a huge fan. I have been to many sushi restaurants in not just Chicago but many other states and so far i have found that Coast as my favorite. Everyone does have there own opinion about Coast but in my opinion I absolutely loved it. Everyone knows that if a sushi restaurant is warm and gross looking it most likely will get you sick. Not in Coasts case, yes the restaurant is freezing but that is the best thing for the sushi which means its fresh. As many times as i have been there the sushi has not yet disappointed me yet and they do always present the sushi very elegant and nice. Another thing I noticed about going to Coast is that it is really a good idea to get there around 7 or 8 because by then it does get very crowded, so if you are planning on having a nice dinner or even a nice romantic date you will not be disturbed by many people the con about Coast is it is very Crowded and kind of tight spaced but that doesn't mean you always need to go with a big Group. One of my favorite rolls would have to be the Rainbow Roll because I absolutely love all the fish on top and the roll all together. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice get together with friends or even a date. Coast is Check plus for me ! :)
