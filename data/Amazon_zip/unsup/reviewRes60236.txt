Finally tried the Brazilian chicken..AMAZING!!!!!!I could eat the chicken every day, but then I would burn out on it, and would in up regretting that, and going to get some sandwhich and fries at a franchise..Yuk. My favorite sides are the Garlic Mash potatoes and the potato salad(a potato thing i guess)..My friend likes the corn and black beans..I get the 1/4 chicken most of the time for less than 5.50, and the half chicken meal/special when i haven't eaten all day for less than $7...  I don't know of any pizza & chicken places in the city, but this little place just makes good food, has a nice bunch of girls and guys working there,, and takes care of my take out needs. Too bad they don't serve steak like the Brazilian steak places downtown(an idea????). Check em out!!!
