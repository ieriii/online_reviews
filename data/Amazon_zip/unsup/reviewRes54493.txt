The Chicago Diner is great! The staff are incredibly friendly, and the food is great. I must admit I am hooked on their ceasar wrap, and crave it regularly.The only sad thing for me is that they have become very busy over the past year. The wait doesn't seem to be too terrible. The longest I have waited is 45 minutes. (and that was on pride... I'm surprised it wasn't longer)Oh... And they have the most amazing Chicago Soy Dairy milkshakes...!! To die for!!:)
