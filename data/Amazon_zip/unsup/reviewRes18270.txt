I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review for Caro Mio. Seriously!? It's no Spiaggia, but I love this place. First of all, it smells good. Really good. Second of all, it's BYOB. Third, if you have to wait (fairly common), you can just walk to the liquor store a few blocks up and grab said YOB in a snap. I have really enjoyed every pasta dish I have tried there, especially anything in their seemingly signature mascarpone cream sauce. Highlights on the menu include the polenta al sugo appetizer ( fresh polenta grilled on a flat grill then topped with a rich ragu sauce and finished with parmesan cheese), the lobster ravioli in cream sauce, osso buco and pappardelle con porcini (Italian porcini mushrooms sauteed with borolo red wine, parmesan cheese and cream). Caro Mio may not be for you if "cozy" (a.k.a. a fork's reach away from the table next to you on a busy night) isn't your thing. It can also get fairly loud and sometimes the waiters are a bit scatterbrained. But when your steaming, ginormo portion of homemade pasta comes out, none of it will matter because the foodgasm will drown everything else out.
