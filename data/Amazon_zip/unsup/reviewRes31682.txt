hm.....maybe i had too much expectation on this coz it got pretty good mouth of words from the media. I ordered a strawberry shake, blackened tofu sandwich, a potato skin and a buffalo wing. The strawberry shake is so tasty that you can't even feel it is not real "SHAKE". However, all the dishes that i ordered are quite terrible. Can't even discribe. As a semi-vegetarian myself, i would rather cook by myself than spending time on the crowded atmosphere.
