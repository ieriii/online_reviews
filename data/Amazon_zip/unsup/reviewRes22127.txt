Came with a party of 8 on Friday night and had to wait over 1 hr for our table. It sure is popular! We started off with saganaki (seems every table ordered at least 1), and the melted cheese was divine on bread. Also ordered the Mediterranean baby octopus, which was oh-so-tender and flavorful it disappeared within minutes. For entrees we shared white fish tail, seafood kabob, Athenian salad and roasted leg of lamb. The seafood dishes were superb: both the white fish and salmon were cooked to perfection. The salad was fresh and not over-dressed. My only complaint was the leg of lamb: rather than a big hunk of leg we got only a few meager pieces of lamb. It was flavorful but not enough! It was crazy crowded and pretty noisy, so maybe not a good date place. But the atmosphere was fun and the food was delicious. And the free valet parking is awesome considering street parking is $3.50/hr.
