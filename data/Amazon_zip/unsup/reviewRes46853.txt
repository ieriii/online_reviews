The brunch rundown, broken down into the five elements that compose the most bestest of brunches.... SEATING required: -------------A place to sit, preferably no wait. (check) found: ---------Free parking AND a seat on the patio, no wait on Saturday at noon. Bonus points for beautiful weather, a privacy fence to block out traffic noise on Devon, and sunshine. BEVERAGE required: ------------Coffee: Quick and plentiful refills, served on a cute tray. ------------H2O: Ice cold, with a straw. (served on request, they are eco) found: (all of the above...+) --------Alcoholic Cocktail of the breakfast nature: Uncommon Ground threw me a curveball. I'm most def a mimosa lovin', champagne swigging kind of girl...but the Black Eyed Dog is OUTSTANDING. Vodka, sweet (blackberry/cardamom syrup made in-house!?), garnished with an orange slice, and served chilled. An utterly fabulous cocktail all around, and most definitely worthy of a THIRD glass of liquid in front of me. Cute server did not judge: points scored. FOOD required: ------------Egg creations which earn the title "omelette." Potato sides. Meat. Fun stuff on pancakes and french toast. Ya know, the usual. found: -------- The Montana omelette with bacon, ham, sour cream, cheese and potatoes. Locally sourced? Can they get any more points? YES. Ding, ding. ding. Winner. I also tasted a bite of my gal pal's strawberry brioche french toast with pistachios. Insane. Good. SERVICE required: ------------Affable people that provide lots of caffeine and who generally enjoys life, smiles, and is happy to be working at brunch time. found: ---------Affable people that provided lots of caffeine and who seemed to generally enjoy life. Bonus: Also, an extremely (hot) friendly server with tattoos, beautiful eyes and....ok yeah, he was just very good looking. And nice. And, yes. Ok, I'll stop myself. He was also good at his job. PRICE required: ------------Main dishes under $12, coffee under $3, cocktails under $10. found: ---------Montana: $12, coffee: $2.50 (I drank a bucket), Black Eyed Dog: $8. We split the bill and each paid around $28 (with cocktail!) for an exceptionally lovely, sunny, and highly beautiful brunch with a slight buzz. That would equal a FIVE STAR brunchie, in my book. Uncommon Ground for brunch. I highly recommend. Obviously ;) Notes: -free parking. -water on request! -doggies allowed on patio!
