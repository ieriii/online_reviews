Some may not like the communal seating arrangements, but I found it to add a bit of intimacy as I was seated much closer to my date than I normally do at most restaurants. I'm a big fan of small shared plates and greatly enjoyed the fact I could easily share 4 dishes with one other person and still have plenty of room for dessert. They had a handy little glossary of for the ingredients hanging on the light fixtures above us that I found to be very useful. The Sicilian Iris (dessert) was the perfect way to end a wonderful meal. I'd come back just for that!
