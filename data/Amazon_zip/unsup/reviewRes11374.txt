While being a life long Chicago, my heart belongs to deep dish pizza. This place is famous for their multiple toppings and thin crust pizza. They also make their own beer, which is pretty good (even though I'm not a regular beer drinker) One thing is this place gets CROWDED! Prepare to wait if it's a weekend night or a sports game on, it's popular and the staff is great. I know why this place is successful. But when it comes down to it, I prefer Chicago style pizza, but when I'm in bucktown I will come here.
