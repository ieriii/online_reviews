Hooray to 24/7 Korean BBQ!! Anytime I'm up in the Lakeview/bordering Evanston area, I have to hit up this restaurant. Just thinking about their sushi makes my mouth water. Because I'm a frequent customer, the sushi chef knows me quite well. They make awesome sushi here on top of their wonderful Korean BBQ. Their rolls are unique, off the charts, and not at all Americanized (watered down Cali rolls or diced up spicy tuna rolls). They combine your entire order on one or two platters and depending on the chef that's there at night, there are certain variations in the same sushi roll, which I like.Their Korean bbq is awesome!! Def try their kalbi or their bulgogi. Their bibimbop (sp??) is to die for as well. They have this spicy seafood noodle dish that's awesome, although my stomach can't handle foods that are too spicey! The only complaint is that their chapchae and mong dook (fried dumplings) were a bit too oily and filling. Otherwise, great place, good family styled ambiance, awesome food, and friendly staff!!
