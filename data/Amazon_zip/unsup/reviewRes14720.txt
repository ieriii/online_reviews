Wow, I can't believe the press this place has gotten...and after eating there, I still don't get it. I would give this place 2.5 stars. The place is small...like hot dog stand small. I ordered a cuban sandwich and it was just okay, definitely not worth ordering again, I can get better ones elsewhere. And it wasn't my first Cuban Sandwich go around, I've had many a cuban in Miami. I may be willing to give this place another try, but then again, maybe not. Service was good, but it doesn't matter when the food is mediocre.
