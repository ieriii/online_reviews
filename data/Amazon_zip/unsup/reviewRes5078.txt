The wait could be long at times. It can get loud in here so if you are looking for conversation this place is not it. Wine selection is great!! Menu items are meant to share like tapas. Menu items we tried were: Bone Marrow -Yummy Pork Bellly Pig Ear with Kale and Fried Egg Pork Shoulder I would return again if we are able to make and reservations, not sure if I want to wait again without one!
