We went to q for a weekday lunch and so their were maybe 4 tables being served. They sat us in the back which is far less 'cute' than the front of this converted mansion. The food was good - no complaints.  I had the pulled chicken sandwich. Although there was really no way to eat it as a sandwich.  I did love that it came with 4 different sauces and the enormous pile of coleslaw was tasty. However, it certainly wasn't the most amazing BBQ meal I've ever had.
