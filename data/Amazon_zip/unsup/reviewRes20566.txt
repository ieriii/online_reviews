Obviously been hearing about this place for quite some time. The line is always out the door and I really don't like to wait. This line on Friday was finally down to about 30 mins, so I gave it a try. I had the Ahogada Torta (their signature dish) and it was pretty good. But for about $20 including tax tip and drink, and factoring in the wait, I'm not that impressed. The flavor was good and it was definitely spicy enough, but the pork loin was a little dry and the iced tea tasted like instant. Overall, it was pretty good, but I think it's just a little over-rated.
