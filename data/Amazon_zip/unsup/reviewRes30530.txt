A few weeks ago, this would have been a solid 4 stars but no more, and I'll tell you why. I've eaten here several times and was so excited to find a place with such amazing brunch food close to Hyde Park. Being an M Henry loyalist (which is having its own problems lately--no more veggie burger) I was thrilled. Every time I've eaten here, the service has been kind of off. Either it took forever for our server to come by, we got our drinks significantly after the table next to us that came later (and only after we asked), got a hibiscus tea instead of a regular, etc. But the food more than made up for it. Specifically the Signature Chilaquile Casserole and the Homemade English Muffin Sandwich. I don't know what inspires a kitchen to call something signature and then drop it from the menu, but these two gems are gone. I was so disappointed and the server strangely explained that they are making room for new items (but there didn't seem to be any newbies on the menu then). So I try the vegetable omelet and sorry, but it was gross. The egg was flat and overcooked and then thrown in the middle were sauteed peas and mushrooms. I'm just not into pea omelets. The menu says it's "seasonal vegetables" or the like so I guess my fault for not asking. I don't eat meat so eliminating the heaven that was the chilaquile casserole is a total bummer and given that I could get the sandwich without meat, even less veggie options here. Annoying. I won't be back anytime soon, especially because the prices are on the high side for just so-so service and a menu I now would have to search through for something good. BUMMER.
