This place is amazing. The service is top-notch with the staff waiting on your every move without being intrusive. The cuts of meat are done how you want them (medium, etc.) and are delicious, hot and juicy. They do an excellent job of keeping the salad bar organized, clean and fresh and everything is very tasty, especially the mozarella, pickled onions and cherry peppers. I was impressed by how well executed this restaurant is, from the service to the food. I have been to most of the big restaurants in Chicago and this one is right at the top of the list.
