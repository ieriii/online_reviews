I thought it was a little above average but more expensive than some other really great BBQ places. I got the pulled pork sandwich which was good, but I wasn't a fan of their sauces. I like a little spice but two of their three sauces were a little too spicy and the vinegar-based one tasted like straight vinegar. I think a really good sauce would have made me rate this place higher and even convince me to go back. The Kobe steak was too chewy and not great and the mac n cheese was a little bland. Two things I loved: hush puppies and pickles (I don't know what they soak those things in, but I'm hooked).
