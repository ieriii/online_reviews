Having recently enjoyed dinner at Rick Bayless's Red O in Los Angeles, I made a point to try XOCO for lunch in Chicago two weeks later. Whereas Red O is a high-end restaurant, XOCO is billed as Bayless's fast-casual or "street food" concept. Yet, no one could plausibly argue that patrons are slumming it here. In fact, XOCO is housed within the same building as Bayless's other restaurants (Frontera, Topolobampo). As much as I enjoyed Red O, XOCO certainly was a better value across all segments (guacamole, two tortas, and churros with chocolate dipping sauce). The bill for two was approximately $35. By comparison, I paid three times that for a comparable dinner at Red O only two weeks ago. As at other Bayless concepts, the guacamole and churros at XOCO were excellent. The tortas, which were basically fancy sandwiches from a wood-fired oven, were also very good. Order the Chicken Tinga over the Pepito, which is too spicy. My only disappointment: I had hoped the braised shortribs of the Pepito would be as good as the shortrib sopes at Red O, but that was not the case. The half hour line here is an excellent alternative to waiting three months for a reservation at Topolobampo.
