I have to write the review - there seems to be some serious confusion on these reviews about the vegetarian sandwiches. Just because there's no meat on the mushroom sandwich (and soup) doesn't mean it's vegetarian! It's not. The beans at Xoco are cooked in pork. That said, the person at the counter was super accomodating, adding extra avocado instead of the beans for the sandwich. It is simply not possible to get the soup made without the beans. Therefore, the soup is not vegetarian. The sandwich was amazing. Simply wonderful. But I have to take a star off for not having a dedicated vegetarian sandwich, and for misleading all the eaters and reviewers on yelp who are calling the mushroom options at xoco vegetarian.
