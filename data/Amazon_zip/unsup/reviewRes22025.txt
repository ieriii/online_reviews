Food: 4-stars, service: 1.5 (based upon 2 visits) BYOB that is cash-only. The Good: Delicious oatmeal shakes that can be made with soy (love!) The busboy was nice, and gave us a bucket full of ice for our Tecate, and also gave us chips and salsa. Yummy fried plantains & sandwiches. The Bad: The waiter was SLOWWWW, (it was not busy on the patio) forgot several items, and our food was lukewarm to cold. Not to mention that people who were seated well after we were, had gotten their food & paid before we even received our meals. He never checked to see how everything was, didn't clear any of our dirty plates, didn't refill our water and pretty much ignored us. UGH! Not good if you are hungover on a Sunday & wanting a burrito or sandwich to help recover. The Ugly: Thinking the bad service was a fluke, we gave this place another try, this time with out of town friends. WRONG! Bad service, forgotten items, and very slow the second time around. If you want to order from this place, I would suggest carry out.
