This is a trek from my usual stomping grounds, but I liked it so much that I came back twice in one week! The scallops were delish and the sloppy joe and fries were a great twist on a classic. They have an extensive bourbon and whiskey selection, but I'm not a fan. My friend, however drinks whiskey like it's his job, and he was impressed with the offerings.
