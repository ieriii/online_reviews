So my girl took me here last night as an early Sweetest Day dinner. I've changed my original 4 stars to 5 stars! I love this place! There's so much food to choose from! Being as greedy as I am, I ordered the grand appetizer platter. It's suppose to feed 4 or more people but I ordered it as my meal. There was not 1 thing in it that I didn't like. I stuffed myself and I shared and I still had food leftover to take home. To top it all off, we ordered the beignets for dessert. I don't know why but I've been craving beignets for about 3 weeks now so when I finally got them I was in heaven! The order includes 3 dipping sauces that I didn't really care for cuz I like them plain. They were so warm and soft and extremely delicious! The food was so good, I wanna make it back here sometime soon!
