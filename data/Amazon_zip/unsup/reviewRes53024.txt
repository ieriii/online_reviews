Great food with some of the friendliest staff in town. They treat you like a neighbor or friend. I have been here numerous times, including around xmas for the toy drive party. Service is usually pretty snappy and the food comes out quick. I am not sure on my favorite dish, but you can not go wrong with the steak sandwich or the steak sandwich served on the plantain.
