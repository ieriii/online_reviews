Top notch service. Excellent presentation. Enjoyed the scallops and beef cheek ravioli, even though the bone marrow foam over the latter didn't look too appetizing. Short rib with unagi entree was excellent. Venison was cooked nicely, but the accompanying sauces were suspect. Banana crepes and chocolate souffle for dessert were well-executed. Food/flavors though weren't as mind-blowing as Alinea or even Charlie Trotter's.
