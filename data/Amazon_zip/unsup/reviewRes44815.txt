Sorry Chicagoans, I too was a bit disappointed by Giordano's. Maybe my expectations were too high? It was definitely a really good pizza--don't get me wrong. I like deep dish, stuffed, thin crust, brick-oven, you name it, so no, I'm not a pizza snob. I guess I wanted to be blown away, and this just didn't do it. I got the "Special" with green peppers, mushrooms and sausage. The cheeze was amazing, the crust was clean but a little underflavored. The sauce on top was not quite tomato-ey enough, but portions are bountiful. I tried tackling a 10-incher by myself and was proud of myself for even getting to half of it. (pizza-by-the-slice isn't an option during dinner hours). I'm definitely a fan of Zachary's Pizza in Oakland, CA. Maybe I'll check out Lou Malnati's next time I'm back in the Windy City.
