Wow! The service was ghastly. The hostess was beyond rude and was dismissive. This was especially appalling since our visit occurred during an off-peak hour. The server seemed annoyed with our table, but we had not exhibited any behavior to warrant such a response. Many other places in the city offer extensive wine lists and flights and would be an infinitely better choice than this establishment.
