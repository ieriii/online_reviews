my mind has been BLOWN by rick bayless. If i ever see him in person i will hug him if he doesn't get weirded out by me! I love Mexican food, but i have never LOVED Mexican food till I've tried Xoco and Frontera. I normally don't like fancy restaurants for Mexican food. but oh no no no, XOCO does it right. SOOOOO right. We came here TWICE in our 5 day trip to chitown. First time was just to get their churro after we tried Frontera. OMG their Churro is amazing. Its freshly made AND they just add some sort of extra spice to it that makes it absolutely divine. We got it with a side of their Mexican vanilla bean ice cream. SOOO GOOD! Second time we came back was for our last meal before heading back to California. We came here for lunch RIGHT when they opened at 11am. We got their Mole Poblano torta which had braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy fresh garnishes, and fresh cheese. YOu can really taste the difference from their quality of ingredients. The pork was juicy and savory and the fresh garnishes and cheese went so well with the fresh torta. Their Caldos was mind blowing. Caldos is a type of stew they have many different kinds there. We got the seafood Caldos. This seafood caldos had Mexican blue shrimp, mussels, catfish, red chile broth, potatoes, grilled knob onions, pea shoots, cilantro, and lime inside. The broth was perfectly seasoned. Not overbearing. it was so well balanced. i couldn't stop eating it. You have to try their caldos when you come here. Plus XOCO is very affordable and very casual I see a lot of locals here for a quick lunch. There's also really cute outdoor seating too if you want some sun (on nice summer days). recap: 1) Churros with a side of ice cream 2) CALDOS 3) everything here is amazing! come early or else there's a long wait!
