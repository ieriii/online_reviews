Great food, great ambience and great service! I've had Ethiopian in LA and Washington DC but I found Demera far better than any of them. The honey wine goes well with the injera platter- my favourite is the red lentils and gomen. All of the chicken dishes are good but I wouldn't take Salmon again( it doesn't exist in Ethiopia so can't be authentic!) Bad thing? Parking situation near Broadway. "Addis Abeba" in Evanston is equally nice and parking is plenty.
