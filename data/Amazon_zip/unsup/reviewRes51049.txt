This place is fun! Good drinks to keep you going the morning after and CHEESE GRITS!!! They are pretty decent Cheese Grits for yankees city folk too ;) Do stay away from the southern benedict plate, I was dissapointed but I've liked everything else. The food never seems to take too long either which can be the must frustrating thing a some brunch spots. I've have been here for anything but brunch.... now that I think about maybe I'll go to dinner there this week, it only make sense, now.
