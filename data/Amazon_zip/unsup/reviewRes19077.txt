Went here with my friend on our Summer Chicago trip! The restaurant is close to the Silversmith Hotel and also to Millenium Park. I was able to rsvp 2 hours ahead of time and able to get a table during dinner hours! On to food: For a college student, this place is pricey! I was fortunate enough to pick some worth while dish like the Rabbit salad. However, my main entree was a steak that was a bit overcooked (I asked for medium). Service was good, but my friend and I might have been "ignored" by the waitress because we look a bit young? I did received a complementary dessert because it was my birthday :)
