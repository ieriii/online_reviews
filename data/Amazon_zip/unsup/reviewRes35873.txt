If you like Hot Sour soup, you have to try theirs. It has a very thin soup (not like the gelatinous types I've have had elsewhere). Having the vinegar bottle on the table to add to taste is a great added touch. The Singapore noodles were very good not too much curry like other places I have tried. Their egg rolls where nice, not greasy. Take it easy on the hot mustard my neighbor we went with still has clear sinuses. My wife had the Crispy Duck strips on egg noodles. Not a big fan of duck but it was nice, very tender. Wife is still raving about it. I miss the hanging ducks and pork in the front window. It was one of the things that drew me to Sun Wah. IT fit my source a perspective. Was very satiated when I left (Still took an order of BBQ & rice), still the best! I enjoyed the chef carving the Peking Duck to the next table. Wife says next visit it's hers. I'll definitely be going back, taking other friends. Got to have some pork & rice now, enjoy !!!
