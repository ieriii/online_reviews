Here is a totally biased report: I went last night at 6:30 after driving around for fifteen minutes looking for a parking spot. People on Broadway near Belmont seem to lose all driving skills. We came here because it's right down the street from my brother's apartment. The space is lovely and spacious. I was honestly taken aback. I'm not sure what it was before (if anything), but I was impressed. I had the seafood chowder (hot and chock full of random seafood) and the special, chicken and arugula quesadillas...very good. My brother had some kind of meat (roast?) which came medium rare, as he asked. Service was pleasant and it wasn't too loud (but also wasn't crowded). For a neighborhood joint, I thought it was pretty nice. It's a good addition to an area inundated with sushi, thai and so-so bar food.
