I came here for lunch with two friends. The layout of the restaurant is less than one could desire. I was bumped into several times by waitstaff- and it seemed as though only one person could get through a path at a time. The hostess seemed very nice- and able to handle multiple things at a time. However the wait staff seemed somewhat oafish. The staff obsessively came by to remove plates, as soon as there might be a possibility of removing the plate- it was gone. The rather irksome thing is with the beverages. The prices charged are more than what appear on the menu by maybe 30 cents- big deal. However, I have a bit of a problem with Diet Coke- and I'd like a refill, not a little 8 oz bottle. The food itself, was a tender lamb sandwich, absent any seasonings on the lamb, but a somewhat seasoned pita. However, the TINY bit of potato salad and Taramosalata were quite excellent.
