I'm not a fan of fusion japanese food but this place was pretty good. We ordered rounds and rounds of drinks and sushi. The things that I remember the most was the: Lobster and Wagu Roll- It was rich, meaty and creamy. The flavors were so concentrated and meaningful, that it broke through the haze of sake and slapped me around and told me what for. Ming Dynasty Cocktail- This is for the whiskey drinker (me), there was Johnny Walker Black, lillet, mangosteen and citrus. Perfect! Well not if you were Scottish or Irish.... Be prepared for the high prices that come with having a hot spot restaurant.
