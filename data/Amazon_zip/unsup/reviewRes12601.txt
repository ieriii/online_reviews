This was our 3rd time going there, and our last... First off, I had the same issue as the reviewer on 12/27. They would not honor the face value of my groupon that expired on 12/1/11. No explanation other then it was a "manager's decision" not to. Sorry, but your place is not stellar enough to just dismiss of such an agreement made with Groupon... anyway... This was the first mediocre experience we had there. Our other 2 visits were awesome beforehand. This time, however... 1. the hostess was cold, borderline rude, about the groupon. Not even an apology. 2. the waiter was spacy and just generally not a good fit for his role 3. we had to ask SEVERAL times for the well done pieces of meat my wife asked for. We asked 2 different servers, and our waiter, only to have a third server actually deliver. 4. some of the meat was not as delicious as before, just below par (the coldcuts, the house special and the filet). Dont get me wrong, the salad bar is still by far the best out of all the Brazilian spots, and the previous 2 times I went were awesome. But the combination of the groupon issue and the lackluster experience have forced my hand to say I will not be back any time soon. I just see it as a sign of decline.
