In a word: overpriced. For some reason, I was expecting a bar with good food, not a relatively upscale restaurant with prices to match. I had the fish and chips, which were really good, but they were over $17! I'm really not sure how this qualifies as a gastropub, seeing as reservations were practically a must. Our waiter seemed annoyed that most of us did not order anything to drink.
