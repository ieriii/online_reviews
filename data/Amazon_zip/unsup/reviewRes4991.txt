To be fair, The Purple Pig really deserves 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 because some people really cannot handle the wine part of "swine, wine and cheese," and that really kills the ambience. (To be clear, this was not anyone in my party.) But other than that, The Purple Pig is fabulous. Even though the wait was obnoxiously long for a table for 4 on a week night during winter, that was only if you wanted to wait for a table INSIDE -- if you had no objection to sitting in a tented area outside with heat lamps, you could be seated immediately. And we were. Our waitress was nothing short of fabulous. She was bubbly and friendly and had extensive knowledge of the menu. We trusted her so much, we let her pick the cheeses for our cheese plate, and a good bottle of sweet white wine to go with it. As far as food went, we went with exactly what she recommended, as well, and we were not disappointed. The fried pig's ears came in this SUPER cute pig-shaped dish, and, mixed with some fried egg, was an awesomely savory treat; the crispy kale lacked any bitterness, and the pickled cherry peppers gave the dish an awesome bite. The roasted bone marrow looked like a couple of volcanoes, and, spread on some crostini, was divine. The turkey leg confit looked, smelled, and tasted nice and smoky, much better than anything you'd get at a Disney theme park. The milk-braised pork shoulder was a little too salty for our tastes, but hey, the boys had to eat something! The way to go here is to order a few small plates and share: If you're an adventurous eater at all, you definitely don't want to miss out on anything this place has to offer! I'm disappointed to think that, during the summer, everyone WILL want outdoor seating, so I probably won't be as lucky in scoring quick seats every time I want to go to The Purple Pig, but this is one place that's worth the wait!
