Hopleaf is awesome for a couple of reasons. One is that it's in Andersonville (personal bias) and not in a trixie-filled area. Another is that it has a MASSIVE beer selection. They even have Allagash White Ale (yay from my home state!). The interior is roomy enough to hold a lot of people, but yeah it's always crowded. The only complaint I have is that once my gf and I tried to have drinks in the backroom because the front was full -- you're not allowed to just have drinks there, you have to dine too. It seems kinda futile to hold that area out and let it go empty when it could be used for people who want to have drinks. But whatever. It's still a great bar.
