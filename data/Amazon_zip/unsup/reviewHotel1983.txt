I got a reservation for this hotel through a groupon purchase, and it was definitely worth it. The hotel itself has an amazing location, great views, and I love that you can go outside on a balcony (a rare treat in the city). The room was beautiful- extremely modern looking, but still comfortable and completely spotless. The staff was very friendly- both at check in and at the Filini Lounge where we had a couple drinks late at night. I was impressed by the overall appearance and the staff. If the hotel was more affordable I would definitely come back... might just have to wait for a special occasion or another groupon!
