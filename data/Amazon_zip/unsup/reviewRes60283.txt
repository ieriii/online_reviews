The food here is always delicious. My favorite is the panini breakfast sandwich with tomatoes, egg and prosciutto. I steer clear of here on the weekend when it's super crowded. One star off because they don't have table service. I like lingering over the menu - it's too much pressure to decide on my order in the two minutes that I'm waiting in line.
