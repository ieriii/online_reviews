SIMPLY Ahhhh-mazing! I think I eat here once month. Never gets old. The price is right and food is delicious. If you are unsure about what to order, go for the Falafel sandwich. The place is always busy, but there's definitely lots of seating available. Great weeknight pick! And remember it is cash only!
