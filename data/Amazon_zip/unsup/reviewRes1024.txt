My political science professor once told the class: "When I was younger, I had a lot of time and little money, so I donated my time by volunteering for political campaigns and such. Now, I have little time and lots of money, so I donate to support candidates." This relationship between time and money is just one of the many topics I thought about as I waited in line at Hot Doug's for over two-and-a-half hours on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend. For reference, the line started along the sidewalk just on the other side of the alley behind the restaurant. An enterprising ice cream truck sold frozen treats and $1 bottles of water to the waiting crowd. It really wasn't a ton of people, but the line just moved so slowly. When I finally did get to order, I was still perplexed why the wait was so long--our group of five got their food in less than 5 minutes after ordering and while all the tables were taken, there were still a number of outward facing seats along the window. On top of that, there was an outdoor eating area available that I didn't visit. As for the food, the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel is extraordinary. The foie gras and truffle aioli combine to make every bite rich, creamy, and memorable. The other two items I had were just so-so: The Corn Dog is exactly what you would expect and not that different than what you would get at a ballpark or a fair. The Duck Fat Fries were...not all what they are quacked up to be. I really didn't experience any extra "oomph" from the fact that these were fried in duck fat. To be clear, if the wait were 30 minutes of less, I would bump Hot Doug's up to four stars--the foie gras hot dog was just that good. But to rate the whole experience--an experience I wouldn't want to go through again--I'll leave Hot Doug's at two stars.
