I've only had one experience here - a catered alumni event back in 2005. What impressed me was the quality and consistency of their catered product.  Usually buffets, even at the establishment itself, have a fairly poor quality. This was different and that was most impressive - I actually enjoyed the food. I took a quick peek in the main dining room. The smells were certainly nice iike a standard Chicago steakhouse. Plus it's a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, and they usually hold to a pretty good standard. I'd try it for dinner, but I wouldn't be expecting Ruth's Chris, Gibson's, or Fogo de Chao. Still, my hopes would be up for at least a three-star experience.
