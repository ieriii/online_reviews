Wandered in here for a very late, almost 10 pm dinner, and the restaurant was still about 60% full, with that nice post dinner-pre party buzz. Our server was a doll, and very attentive. The price point of everything is surprisingly reasonable for the atmosphere (it feels very luxe when you walk in). Highlights of my meal were roasted brussel sprouts that were delectable and the beet salad (I can't remember what they marinated those beets in but they were INSANE!). We could see into the kitchen and there were these three tall, glass hurricane jars filled with undeterminable goods. Our server informed us they were all full of 1) house made caramel corn, 2) homemade licorice, and 3) homemade truffles. I wish I hadn't been so full, b/c I bet that caramel corn would have been awesome... Well, there's always next time.
