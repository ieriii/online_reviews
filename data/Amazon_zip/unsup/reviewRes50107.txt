best Skirt steak in the pueblo period. and if you like to put chimichurri sauce on your steaks welcome to heaven. They have two kinds of chimichurri they bring to your table to use on everything. I drowned my empanadas in this stuff, one is a little more spicy than the other and they are both fantastic. If $20 is too much for you to spend on a skirt steak, then share it. The steak is friggin huge. If you order the empanada combination plate and the skirt steak entre, your bill will be $28 for two people and you will be full.
