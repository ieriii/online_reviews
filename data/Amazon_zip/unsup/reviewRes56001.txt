As busy as the were during 2 lunches during our a recent stay, the wait staff was so attentive. The venison burger was so good my companion had it twice. I had the beet salad which I thoroughly enjoyed and the pear soup - excellent. On the second visit, I enjoyed the turkey sandwich, which was very good. I wish we could have been there at dinner but we did stop in for a drink at night and again, friendly and prompt staff. Drink prices were what we expected and what we pay in NYC.
