Make sure you ask to sit by a window, as this cafe, on top of Ann Taylor on Michigan Avenue, will give you a prime look at the busy Mag Mile and all the people shopping along the street. Grand Lux has one of the largest menus I've ever seen. If you can, try one of their specialty cocktails or coffee drinks, they are delicious! Also seriously consider ordering one of their made-to-order desserts. I've always ordered a salad from this place, which is the perfect lunch spot for girls (I took my mom here when she visited last), but know ahead of time that the portions are gigantic! Even a salad was huge!
