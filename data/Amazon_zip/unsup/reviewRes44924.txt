All I have to say is this is the best pizza I have ever had in my life!! I'm from California and the "chicago" style pizza they have there is a disappointment now that I tasted Giordano's. If only one of them can open a location up in Cali. I have to live with Patxi's and Zachary's which are just sad. The thing you must do though is make sure to order ahead or you'll be stuck for a very very long time.
