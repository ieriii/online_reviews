I was really unimpressed. I really wanted pizza for lunch and this place does it by the slice and is nearby. I ended up with a thin slice of peperoni and jalapenos. Hubs had a deep dish that was supposed to be mushrooms spinach but it ended up also having onions. We split a small side salad. The total was around $12. Crust wasn't crisp on my thin crust. It was doughy. Sauce was a little sweet. The salad was old, nothing special, and totally filler. The deep dish was the best of the bunch, but had kind of bland crust. It's close, but if I go back I will only get deep dish.
