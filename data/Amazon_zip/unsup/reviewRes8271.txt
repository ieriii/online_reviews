Went with the boyfriend, 7pm summer Saturday night, seated immediately. Large elegant main dining room, white table cloths. The wait staff was impeccable, attentive and un-intrusive. The food- delicious!!! Meats rare, medium, well, lots of greens, fresh cheeses and breads, the drinks kept coming, and the ambiance was sophisticated but fun. There were couples, families, groups of people, everything goes. It was a little dressier than you average tourist-y restaurant for sure. We got out for $120: beer, dinner, no dessert. Loved the whole experience!
