There's nothing I can say that a million other reviewers haven't said before. It's very good. I ate so much that my stomach was punching me from the inside, screaming "Stop it, you're killing me!" Thankfully I couldn't hear it over the sound I made shoving food in my mouth. Mmmm Overall, I'd probably take Chama Gaucha over this. But it's conveniently close, so I'm a frequent visitor :) GO MEAT!
