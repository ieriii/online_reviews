Well, it seems like the Hopleaf just doesn't do it for me anymore. That last time I was there they didn't have a single fruit beer on draft, and what's with the crowd they draw these days? It's like Wicker Park north. It seems like the food has gotten steadily better, and is now actually very good, except they never adequately season the mussels, or put enough cream or ale in them. The mussels themselves are good, they just aren't dressed up for the big time.Hopefully someday Wicker Park will go back to the other side of the Kennedy and leave us the Hopleaf we knew once upon a time.
