Firstly - I went here to eat not to drink, so this is only a review on the food. I was a little surprised by the overly-foodie menu. Don't get me wrong, I love new food combinations and flavors, but sometimes you want a simple option to fall back on...Hopleaf doesn't have it, and the sides are $6 so there's not much consolation there that you can support your meal with a tasty familiar side if you don't like your entree. I got a brisket sandwich, and it was nothing to write home about (or finish). They offered rye or sourdough, and brought me what seemed to be pumpernickel. Yes, I realize pumpernickel is a subset of rye, but it wasn't something I wanted. There was plenty of piecemeal brisket between the slices, and NOTHING else. Call me picky, but if I'm paying $12 for a sandwich, I'd like it to have some fixins. And I'd also like a $12 that's easy to eat...not falling all over my plate. At the end of the day it wasn't disgusting, but it was a pretty bland meal. The only thing on my plate that had any flavor was...brisket. The fries were potatoey and forgettable, and all else I had was bread, brisket, and a pickle. I was expecting something a little more varied, a little more exciting. What I got was a bbq leftover sandwich. OK for a brown bag lunch, not something I want served up at a restaurant. Wow, I disliked that more than I thought I did.
