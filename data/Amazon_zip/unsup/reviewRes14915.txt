i've only been to the clybourn location. awesome!! i always get the cubano. cafe con leche also very good- i ask them to make it with half the usual amount of sugar. i definitely recommend this place to anyone!! fyi, if you are getting your food to-go expect a short wait. nothing too bad, but this isn't a fast food joint. oh and they have a small parking lot.
