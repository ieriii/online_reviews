TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!A group of about 30 guests for a birthday party was held in this supposed to be a "classy restaurant". THE EVENT WAS A DISASTER!!!!They don't want to serve food , as if EVERYONE IS BEGGING FOR FOOD!!! And the group paid almost 2,000 dollars. Birthdays are supposed to be happy events and the celebrant and the wife has to text everyone for the TERRIBLE FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE that this restaurant had done to us.They are charging us for extra "ghost" people in the bill as if we cannot read and add the charges.WHOEVER IS THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE MUST DO SOMETHING OR ELSE YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP SOON!!!!WE FELT THAT THE GROUP WAS NOT TREATED FAIR AND RIGHT!!! I WILL NOT EVEN GIVE ANY STAR TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!!! I have to put one star so my review will be saved on the website. I don't have a choice, but I really don't intend to put one.DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY, GO TO BRAZZAZ OR FOGO.....
