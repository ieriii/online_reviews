The grills like the "mixed grill" are just amazing albeit a bit dry. Other than that, India House seems to fall short. If you order something like soup, it tastes like it is out of a can. The desserts have no flair. They over use the same kinds of sauces for different dishes. As far as cuisine goes, I have a pretty well traveled palate, but the menu is unhelpful. The descriptions are anything but descriptive, and it leaves you with too many questions that you really don't know where to begin. I don't like interviewing a server, so I just kinda ask 1 question and fire from my hip. I've been there 3 times and had similar experiences each time. Go with the mixed grill and you will go home satisfied. If you stray from that... good luck!
