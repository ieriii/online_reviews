The first time I went to Graham Elliot it was so delicious that I had to bring back my foodie friend when she visited. Unfortunately the second visit we got miso lobster and it was too salty, the foie groie lollipops were interesting but left a weird aftertaste and unfortunately the dessert was a seasame yuzu and prickly pear jam...I know weird and it tasted weird. So unfortunately until my next visit...it is a 3 star visit!
