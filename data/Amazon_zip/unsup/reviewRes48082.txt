Get yourself a fun group of friends and head over to The Publican.  There is not much I can add that hasn't been said (a hundred times already) in all the great reviews of this place, so just go read them instead of mine. Great food. Amazing service. Kinda loud. Great drinks (try the maple whiskey).  Buy the kitchen a six-pack.
