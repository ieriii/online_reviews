Came here for my second Dinner in Chicago and like TRU, although the food and service was good, it was not quite a 5 star for me. We had the 6 course tasting menu (we didn't really have a choice as that is all they offered on a Saturday) and was a little disappointed that they didn't have any other options like ala carte or a different pre fixe option. The tasting menu had two items that I'm not too fond of so I asked the server if he could replace them with something else and the chef was able to accommodate me with no fuss which I greatly appreciated. All the dishes were pretty solid, but similar to TRU, the wait between dishes were a little on the lengthy side (I'm not sure if it's just my bad luck with these restaurants or if it's a Chicago thing among fine dining establishments) I would come back again still but prob not before I try out all the other great restaurants Chicago has to offer.
