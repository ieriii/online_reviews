When I first read about Sunda opening, I feared a glorified Panda Express with grocery grade sushi. My apologies, Billy Dec! The visit started out with complete awe at the phenomenal interior/decor. Well done, Tony Chi, well done! There's a mixture of communal tables (which seems to be the trend all over town), round tables, couple seating, and a beautiful bar. Now add in the sexy, intimate lighting along with the well-dressed crowd. This is my kind of place! Sure, they know how to decorate, but can they execute Asian food correctly? Most definitely! The duck bao buns were fantastic! I thought the oxtail potstickers could use a little more flavor, but nonetheless were good. I loved their take on toast and jam. How could you not love anything fried that's paired with sushi? In fact, the couple next to us asked what it was called because it looked so good. Having read some negative reviews on the sushi, I was yet again skeptical. However, the Number Nine roll that we ordered was really good! The portion was also pretty big. I'd skip the ridiculous dessert next time. The food rolled out a bit slowly, but the service itself was great. I love the fact that every waiter/busser rocks a pair of converse sneakers! I will definitely be returning again and again.
