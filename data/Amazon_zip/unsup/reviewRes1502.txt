Just to add kindle to the fire... great encased meats, done right. Even though they're now nationally respected, Doug's still keeps prices low. This is the best thing about the location, and probably the reason they're so busy. They exemplify quality + value. Great regular-style dog. I've enjoyed alligator and other unusual encased meals before; for those who haven't been here my advice is just order the one that looks most intriguing and keep an open mind. It's a fun food experience. Someday I'll have to try those duck fat fries, though 2 hours waiting outside on the weekend for french fries cooked in poultry lard seems pretty absurd. It's definitely time, Doug. Open locations downtown and in the north burbs. You're gonna be rich. For gosh sakes at least extend the hours to bar time.
