my husband and i recently had pho for the first time when we were in las vegas. he was craving it today so we came to yelp to help us find a great place. simply it was the recommendation and i must say, it was pretty damn good. we split an order of the tofu spring rolls which were served with a delicious plum sauce for dipping. we both ordered the pho bo (beef soup) and devoured every last drop. i also had a banana bubble tea smoothie which definitely hit the spot. simply put... simply it is simply the best! we will be returning soon!
