This is a cafe that is well worth the experience. My Aunt and I try to eat here at least once a week and have never been disappointed. Staff is super friendly and helpful. Food served hot and while we wait we munch on crispy crackers. I love that they change the art work frequently, it makes for a charming atmosphere that opens conversation. I think my favorite is the cheeseburger, but that is rivaled by the stuffed french toast!!! Wait the blueberry pancakes are mouthwatering, and the turkey club.....oh yumm.
