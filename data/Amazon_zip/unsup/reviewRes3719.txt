Crisp has some amazing wings! first time eating there today, and I was skeptical about the price but upon finding out you get the complete wing (drum and wing in one) I know I was in for a treat. I opted for the seoul sassy, but next time Im lookin to go for something a little on the spicier side. Fries were flawless, perfect compliment to any wing order. I like the bench seating, reminded me of a high school cafeteria haha. Plus it affords you the opportunity to meet new people. Will definitely be going back here again in the near future. Not exactly ideal for a large seating if youre going with a big group of friends, unless you can secure a table or 2 ahead of time. The chicken pretty much lives up to its name : crisp. meaty and crisp, with robust flavor.
