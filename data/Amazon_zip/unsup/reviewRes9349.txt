My wife and I love the city of Chicago but traffic can sometimes be a hassle. One way to enjoy all the city has to offer is to go in on Sunday mornings. Nope, we are not headed to church but rather to brunch. As we prefer to avoid lines, we are trying all the places that will let you make a reservation and luckily, Sprout was one of them. We parked right in front, the waiter and manager even assured us it was legal. We had morning cocktails and with bacon buns. Yes, you read that right, bacon in the buns. I could eat those every Sunday. I then had an omelet with seafood and it was probably the best omelet I have ever eaten. Trust me, I have eaten a lot of them.  Great service, wonderful food and no traffic. I love Sundays.
