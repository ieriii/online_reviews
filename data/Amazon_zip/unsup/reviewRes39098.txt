Just wanted to update my review we finally dined after talking about it for a couple of years. My 4 and 6 year olds poked at everything with suspicions, but I was able to get them to eat the ton katsu and some bul-go-gi. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The restaurant does get pretty smoky as you can cook at your table, so sensitive diners beware.
