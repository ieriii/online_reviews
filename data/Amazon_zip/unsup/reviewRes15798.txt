I have enjoyed Calo's cuisine both by takeout and dine-in. The menu is extensive and the diners represent the diverse neighborhood - families, couples, older and younger groups combined.  The flavors are true Italian - garlic, garlic, garlic! .... in my mussels, pasta, bread... just the way I like it. Portions are generous and price I very reasonable. Daily specials for takeout are very good - salad and sizable entree for $8-9. Baked lasagna is a personal fave - with use of italian sausage in the meat sauce....mmmmm:) It will take me a long time to make my way through the menu, but I am up for the challenge. I recommend this for anyone who is hungry and wants some tasty, affordable Italian fare.... in a great neighborhood!
