I had dinner here with a friend at her suggestion. It's not exactly the type of place I would go for, myself, but I enjoyed dinner. Although it was a Saturday evening, we didn't have to wait terribly long for a table. The food was quite enjoyable, better than expected, really. The dessert, a custard something-or-other who's name I regret not remembering was phenomenal. Really, I would go back just to have that dessert again.On the downside, its design does nothing to minimize sound. As a result, it's very noisy, which can make conversation challenging.
