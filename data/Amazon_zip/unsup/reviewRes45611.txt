I could take or leave this place. The food was good, but not great, the staff was good but not great. The only thing that I was crazy about was the decor on the inside. I love the library sitting area! The bar is also really neat. It is nice to eat outside in the summer, the outdoor seating is a must! However, if you eat inside on a hot day, it is not air conditioned in the front and is VERY hot. I do recommend the mac and cheese. That's one of the best things on the menu that they have going for them!
