The atmosphere was great (house music and a very lively crowd)! The wait was only 5 minutes and the service was prompt and polite. Yes, I ordered the baked macaroni and cheese with added chicken--it was amazing. My girlfriend had the fish and chips and I can report that they were likewise very delicious. The entrees were a little on the expensive side (as were the drinks), but I think the atmosphere and the excellent food were well worth it. I will be returning.
