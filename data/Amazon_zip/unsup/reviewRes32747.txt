I have been wanting to try Demera for a long time. So glad I did. I went with one other person, both virgins to Ethiopian cuisine, and we each loved it. Service was friendly and helpful. Food was interesting and full of flavor. We got a decent bottle of wine for under $30 and more food than we could finish. I definitely recommend getting the Ethiopian coffee. Lovely presentation and quite a value considering how much you get for what it cost. Habiba was our server and we really felt welcomed and well taken care of.
