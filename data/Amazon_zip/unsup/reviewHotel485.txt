Shatangi had a blast at Embassy Suites. From day one, the staff went above and beyond to accommodate even the smallest request. The suites are well maintained and very clean. The breakfast is outstanding. I am amazed at the efficiency of the breakfast staff. In the PM, the bar staff that run the manger's special take the time to get to know you and always remember your order (remember to tip them well) even if the snacks are kind of costcoesque. It was a great opportunity to touch base with my colleagues and see them well liquored. Overall, a great stay in a well-run and well-located hotel. Shatangi told you...
