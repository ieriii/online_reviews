Wow. Honestly the best waffle that I have ever had. That + fried chicken + sweet potato and pork belly hash...I was full all day and completely satisfied. It was the perfect mix of sweet/savory and no matter that I was full to the brim I just kept eating. I cannot wait to go back for another meal! Seriously- get your butt to L&E ASAP!
