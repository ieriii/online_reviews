Since Nathan W. went and outed me in his review, I might as well admit it. I lost my Hot Doug's virginity on Christmas Eve - with world famous b-list celebrity Patton Oswalt! Now it wasn't in the bathroom or anything - it was right at the table next to mine. And I can say he's much smaller in person. Seriously, now if it had been Michael Ian Black, I might really have humped his leg. But as it was, I just listened to his conversation while eating three delicious veggie dogs! Including, and this makes this place heaven for me, a VEGGIE CORN DOG (I accidentally ordered a regular corn dog first and Doug corrected me seeing as I had ordered two veggie dogs before, so that's awesome in my book)! Of course the goal of Hot Doug's seems to be to prove that you can put any sort of meat into a hot dog casing, but I will clearly state for the record that this is an awesome vegetarian restaurant as well. I had a Chicago Style (this also broke a cherry) veggie dog that made me cry a little in joy. The lines are long but the crazy 50s and 60s music (which doesn't really fit with the general decor but who cares) make them more bearable. Tables clear out pretty quickly so by the time our order came off the grill we were already seated next to every amateur food critic's favorite voice-over artist (he was Remy the Rat in "Ratatouille") and all was right in the world. For my next adventure in Avondale I hope to touch Kevin McDonald at Urban Belly. But that may be asking for simply too much. No, I'll probably just go back to Hot Doug's next time I'm star-struck and horny, er, hungry. I meant hungry.
