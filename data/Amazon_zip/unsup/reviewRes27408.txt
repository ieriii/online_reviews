I was afraid I might be disappointed with Frontera Grill. I was worried that all the hype might ruin it somewhat. Well, I was wrong. Like many reviewers have mentioned, the lack of reservations is somewhat of a pain. However, after waiting outside in line, we put our name in, sat at the bar and enjoyed some darn good guacamole and seasonal cocktails, and the next thing we knew our table was ready. I'm a vegetarian and my husband a meat eater. We both really enjoyed our meals. My husband loved the Wednesday special (menu changes with the season) and I enjoyed my vegetarian dish (sorry, I've already forgotten the name). I truly appreciate their commitment to quality, local, organic ingredients, and it definitely comes through when taking that first bite. Tip - just have an early dinner and and get there before they open for the shortest wait.
