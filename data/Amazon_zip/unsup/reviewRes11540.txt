even on a tuesday night, you're gonna have to wait for a table. that's totally fine, because after a pint of one of piece's original craft beers, this 5'2'' shawty can eat half of a medium pizza (which is saying something). here's my philosophy -- thin crust pizza is for smart people. you get a greater sauce-to-crust ratio and more crispness per square inch of dough. what do you do with the extra carbs you accrue from not eating deep dish? chocolate cake! just kidding, that's later. more thin crust pizza! more beer! this delicious pizza is a truly worthwhile gift that new haven is sharing with america. kudos to the city for making a thin crust pizza that tastes better than new york style. the only thing i wont truly buy is the mashed potato/clam combo. weirdo yalies, you're not supposed to mix seafood and cheese. did your blueblood mothers forget to remind you?
