I was a little skeptical when first dining her because it is a such a hyped up place so I wasn't sure if it would live up to the high expectations. I had no need to worry, because it absolutely did. My friends and I had a great dining experience here. The food, the drinks, the service, and the ambiance were just spot on. Ricky Bayless clearly knows what he is doing.
