On the second attempt waiting at Hot Doug, I finally got my fix and understood why people waited 1 hr to 1.5 hrs even in the rain and cold!We got there around 11:30am on a Saturday and found this line around the block to the end of the fence. Believe it or not, from the fence, it will be an hour wait at least. Despite the long wait in the cold and drizzle, I was wowed by the simplicity of the hot dogs and the taste in the sausage itself. We ordered the Chicago Style Hot Dog and the Paul Kelly. We decided that we can judge how good the hot dog is by just sticking to the originals and not trying to figure out the specials. The Hot Dogs had pickles, mustard - the works. The bun was extremely soft and slightly sweet. We also ordered the duck fat fries, which was surprisingly not that oily and had a slightly duck taste that doesn't overpower the fries itself. I would recommend to go before the store even opens because I am sure there will be a line even then.
