I have been here over thirty times and I simply love this place. Only in Chicago, New York or San Francisco would a place like this exist. I'll illustrate by telling you a story. I turned on many friends to this place. One of my friends brought his wife and in-laws (in from Cincinnati) to Anteprima. The Father-in-law was told they were going to an Italian restaurant. He got there and said, "I don't recognize anything on the menu. They don't even have any chicken or veal." Needless to say, he was not keen on the place. This place is very Italian like the Italy in Europe, not the Italian-American cuisine that many associate with "italian" food. If you want to dip your bread in oil dusted with parmesan, skip this place.  The food is the star here. All the pastas are sauteed to order and I have never had a pasta course below very good. I've eaten lamb neck, sweetbreads, sliced steak with Arugula salad, Quail and fish for entrees. All excellent. The Antipasti are also very good. You can order half portions so you can devise your own tasting menu. I usually want to sample at least 5-6 different things when I'm there so I'll tell the owner or the staff to give me the appropriate portion. This way, I don't order too much food and overpay. Which brings me to my last point, if you know how to order, the place is not expensive at all, especially when you compare it to the quality of food you are getting. Wine list is also reasonable and strictly Italian (yes, the way it should be).  Unfortunately, the secret is out. The place is jammed on most nights and hard to get into at a decent hour on the weekends if you don't have a resi.      That being said, if you long for real Italian, you should check this place out.
