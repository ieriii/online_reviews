At this star level and price this place is lacking in a few areas: 1. Nickel and dime guests for receiving packages -- I mean come on - ??? 2. Claustrophobic gym 3. Lacking good restaurant -- the one sushi bar they have is limited 4. No pool Swissotel around the corner is better for this location and price point.
