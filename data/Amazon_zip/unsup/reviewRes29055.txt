This place has been around FOREVER, and I really mean it. My earliest memory of this restaurant is eating here as a very young child with my parents. I am now 24 and my parents have been divorced for 15 years, so that definitely dates this memory. Anywho, on to the review. The food is your standard Thai fare: appetizers, noodle and rice dishes, and dishes based around meat, meat, and more meat. The food is prepared very quickly and it is fresh and tasty... yum. A couple of negatives (even if it is a 5-star review): Their meat dishes don't have a lot of vegetables in them. "Why is this a complaint?" you ask. Because sometimes I want a combination of veggies and not just two chunks of broccoli and beef. I know, call me crazy. Second, their waiters can have attitudes. Why the attitude my friend? I'm only trying to eat some of your delicious food. Prices are great, parking is very easy, and the ambiance is pretty decent if you go into one of the back rooms. The front room has a lot of foot traffic. Okay, so maybe it really isn't deserving of a 5-star review (those are hard to come by) but my fond childhood memories are forcing me to be biased in a positive way. Definitely check it out if you're in the neighborhood.
