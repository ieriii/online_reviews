My fiance and I went here a couple weekends ago because it was around the corner from Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind (30 plays in 60 minutes. Check it out). Good beer selection that didn't just included super hoppy beers. I love a very hoppy beer, but we came with someone who doesn't and they were pleased with the selection. The prices were reasonable for Chicago bar and I can see myself coming again if I were in the area.
