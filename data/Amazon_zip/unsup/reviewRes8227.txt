On a bit of a 'best pizza in Chicago' tour and after a few months of eying Spacca Napoli, we decided to take the plunge. Let's review the holy trinity of 'za crust for a second:              Flaky       Crispy      Chewy Spacca Napoli definitely leans very heavily to the 'chewy' column, proper to its Neapolitan roots. Besides being a touch too chewy (a little crunch goes a long way), it really is about as true to the classic Italian style as you can get. The ingredients are amazing fresh and tasty. We sampled the Funghi Salsiccia - a delicious red sauce with wild mushrooms, house-made sausage and creamy mozz - and the sans-sauce Prosciutto e Rucola - a tangy pie with arugula, shaved parmesan and prosciutto. Spacca also nails the second pillar of a great pie - sauce. The red sauce is tangy, fresh and traditional. The 'bianca' pies come equipped with only olive oil and, though flavorful, can be a bit dry. The wine list is strictly Italian, but reasonably priced. The atmosphere is a where Spacca really shines. The outdoor patio along tree-lined streets of Ravenswood almost make you feel as if you were transported to a back street cafe in Napoli. Perfect spot for a hidden little gem. Inside it is clean and modern, with images of old Italia adorning the walls. Overall, great pies and a great atmosphere. A touch on the pricey side, but worth the experience. And the tour marches on...
