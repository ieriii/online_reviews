Probably THE most unique Mexican style food. The wood fire oven creates sandwiches that are grinder-esque. The suckling pig and short-rib could not be any juicier. If you are not in the mood for sandwiches, then try the caldos (soups). My favorite is the pork belly vermicelli. The fried pork bellies are awesome. Be prepared to wait 20-40 minutes for a table. But it is so worth it.
