I pass 90 Miles Cuban Caf all the time when I take my dogs to the vet and when I venture out to Costco. 90 Miles is located on Clybourn where there is pretty much nothing but residential. They have a small parking lot but there is ample parking on Clybourn. My husband went here for lunch the other day and he took me for lunch the next day. I never had Cuban sandwiches before so I was willing to try it out. The restaurant is tiny. There are 3 small tables around the wall with stools. The walls are covered in comics and articles about 90 Miles. I love the exterior of the restaurant. There is a picture of a dog peeing and they even painted yellow on the cement. I thought it was a kitchy touch! We got there on a Saturday afternoon at noon and we got one of the last seats. They have outdoor seating but it wasn't set up since it was cool outside. We both had the Cubano sandwich and we shared some fries. It was pretty amazing and I can say I love Cuban sandwiches! Not the healthiest option but it is good for a treat once in a while. I will be back once the weather is nicer to enjoy the outdoor seating!
