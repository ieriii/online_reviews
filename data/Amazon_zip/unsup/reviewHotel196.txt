The Doubletree Guest Suites is a very pleasant hotel a block east of the Magnificent Mile. No free breakfast here, but when you check in you get fresh cookies in the Doubletree tradition. The rooms are rather spacious, like mini-suites with the bedroom separate from the living area. There is a sharp indoor pool on one of the higher floors, so bring your binoculars even if you are not swimming.
