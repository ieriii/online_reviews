Great food is a given at a restaurant of this caliber. The duck breast was perfectly cooked and o-so-juicy, and the scallops so sweet, and everything seasoned so perfectly, not too overpowering, but just enough to complement each ingredient. But no...as delightful as each dish was, the food wasn't the highlight of the night...it was the attentive service and the desire to please perfectly, that added that sixth flavor to each dish. Each dish was served in an orchestrated manner reminescent of a michelin rated establishment....but one dish was missing...the server offered to remove the delicious duck breast from the bill. The manager, Tim, stopped by to apologize personally and offered a variety of desserts, on the house. It's easy to do this as a formality, but I felt genuinely cared for. I don't live in Chicago, but I'd wholeheartedly recommend the Gage to anyone who visits. If this were the only restaurant I visited while in Chicago, I would have been more than satisfied.
