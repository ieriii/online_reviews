I *adore* the Violet Hour. The first time we ever came here was at the recommendation of one of the fantastic Piece bartenders, in order to find Frenet, a pretty uncommon eucalyptus liquer that one of my friends had a taste for. Ever since then, this has been our destination for cocktails. What a wonderful place. Admittedly, getting into the Violet Hour can require the patience of a saint - since they no longer take phone numbers (sad face), standing outside and waiting in a big line is pretty much part of the experience, unless you go early on a weeknight. That aside, though, it's definitely worth it. They've just updated their menu, and have some wonderful cocktails (I recommend the Moscow Mule and the Jimmy Roosevelt). The service is always fantastic, but if you can, I highly recommend that you sit at the bar - the bartenders are friendly, knowledgeable, and usually have some absolutely exceptional recommendations (it is as a result of this place and their wonderful staff that I now have an undying love for Pisco). Definitely a great place, and a wonderful location to take friends, dates, or even your parents - but make sure that you come with a little bit of patience, just to get in the door!
