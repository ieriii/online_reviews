Having heard about this restaurant not too long ago, I decided to go randomly the other day since I am such a big fan of southern food (even though I'm not from the south, but we'll keep that a secret). Upon arrival, I noticed how clean the restaurant was and the nice southern decor. It definitely reminded me of some restaurants I ate at last time I was in South Carolina, which was definitely a good thing. From the moment we walked in, we were treated very nicely by the staff. Through the whole thing, our waiter was great. He was probably one of the most genuine waiters I've had in a long time actually. Now for the food. First of all, the beignets were great. I wasn't super hungry and was trying to save room for the main course, but I found myself eating them uncontrollably. I ended up ordering the Shrimp & Grits while my girlfriend, who had never had southern food before, ordered the Gumbo Ya-Ya. Personally, I found my Shrimp & Grits to be great. They were seasoned just right, with the right amount of cheese for the grits, and a nice touch with scallions on top. As far as my girlfriend's Gumbo goes, it was good, but I've had better. Personally, I found it a little too salty for some reason. Even with the salt it wasn't too bad, but if that was toned down a little bit, it would taste a lot better in my opinion. Overall, the food we had was good, although could be a little better. No big complaints though, and the staff was great. One of the more pleasant dining experiences I've had in awhile.
