Two words: SALMON CAKES! Holy shit are they amazing. Better than the Crab Cakes. Better than the Crawfish Cakes. MUCH Better than anything on the sandwich menu. For $10.95, you get 2 nicely sized (and extremely rich in flavor) Salmon Cakes and two sides. The mac 'n cheese, while not Stanley's, is really tasty, cheezy and rich. To "keep things moving", the collard greens have a wonderful flavor and the sauteed spinach does the trick too. If you like sweet potatoes, the mashed sweet potatoes are a nice option too. On Wednesday nights, they have a quartet consisting of stand-up bass, violin and 2 acoustic guitars playing jazz numbers. They're quite good. A nice touch. I recommend dinner on a weeknight at Wishbone. It's not packed with assholes and their SUV strollers like it is for weekend brunch. Yayyyyy for SALMON CAKES!!!
