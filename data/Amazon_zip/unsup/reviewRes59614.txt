The service was the worst I have seen in a long time. We barely sat down and the waitress wanted to take our entire order--not just drinks. We said we weren't ready but I don't think she understood since she pointed out what dishes she recommended. She finally left but literally came back a minute later. She did this several more times until we felt pressured to order right then.My two friends ordered the BBQ. I ordered a rice dish. My friends were half way through their meal and I still did not get my entree. I finally flagged down a waitress (don't expect to see them again until time for the check and don't count on being asked if you want anything else). She said it would be right out. Then 10 minutes later our soup arrived (at the end of my friends' meals) but still no entree for me. Then the waitress brought the check and I said they didn't bring my entree so she needed to remove the charge. She looked confused then said it was ready and walked away. She then came back w/o it but said it would be up soon. I told her I didn't want it anymore. She was not happy about that. To top it off, they tried to charge me for the soup that normally comes with the entree (which I did not eat since I don't like miso soup). She angrily came back with the check after we told her to remove the charge and said nothing to us--never any attempt at an apology.I'm shocked there are so many good reviews although I did see a pattern of poor service and problems communicating with the servers. The food was decent.
