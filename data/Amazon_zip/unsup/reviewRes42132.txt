I order from Art of Pizza at least once a month (that's my story and I'm sticking to it!). Unlike most of the reviewers, however, I am a fan of their thin crust pizza. I love it! It's not cracker thin, it has more "meat" to it and the ratio of cheese to crust is perfect, not to mention that oregano spice - oh baby is that nice!  We've also tied their pastas, ribs, chicken - all pretty good -although nothing to OOH and AHH about. I have never encountered any rude personnel while ordering over the phone - and my orders are almost exclusively delivery...you'd thing that in my years of my semi-weekly...I mean monthly ordering I would have come across at least one instance, but nope... I have tried their stuffed pizza, I wasn't really impressed. Thought it was ok. But I guess when it comes to a fatter pizza, I lean more toward the pan (a la Pequod's) than towards stuffed. But my weekly, I mean monthly, thin crust pizza fix HAS to come from the Art of Pizza!! Also, check out their daily specials!
