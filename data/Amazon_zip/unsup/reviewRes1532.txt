PERFECTION. I never thought I could enjoy hot dogs in such a way. I am not even that big of a hot dog eating fan. Coming here, has made me want to try some hot dog spots in NYC that I never thought about going to. It was by far my favorite meal for the entire 4 day trip I took to Chicago early March. To this day, I find myself craving these bad boys. And those cheese fries...yum. They weren't even the much talked about duck fat fries yet still - amazing. We went on a Thursday afternoon - so no huge line and we had no problem scoring a seat. Service was super friendly. When we changed our mind and went back up to ask for cheese on the fries - there was no extra charge. Since we never been before - and we don't live in Chicago we decided to get 4 hot dogs so we could sample as much as possible. My favorite...not sure of the name but it had green olives, goat cheese and some tasty sauce. The combination was delicious. Anyway - there's tons of reviews all saying the same thing -- so just go :)
