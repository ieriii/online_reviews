My friend & I dined in late afternoon on a Sunday, so it wasn't super busy. I was very pleasantly surprised by the wine list**. While the selection was limited to just a handful of reds & whites, it was a very diverse selection and all bottles were under $30. We ordered a South African pinotage and it was really delicious. They also offer some Ethiopian honey wines which we did not try, but were very tempting (gotta save something for a second visit!). In order to maximize what we got to try, we decided to do one of the messob platters. (Which from previous experiences with Ethiopian, I knew to be the traditional way of dining, with various dishes served on injera on a platter to share.) We went with the vegetarian messob since I'm not a meat eater and neither of us were in the mood for seafood. In our messob platter we ordered: - red lentils - ground chickpeas - split yellow peas - mixed legumes - chopped spinach - potatoes & carrots The favorites were the red lentils which had a really flavorful, slightly sweet sauce; the chopped spinach which was sauteed perfectly with onions, garlic & a hint of ginger; and the legumes which had just a little bit of heat to them. We also enjoyed the chickpeas & yellow peas but they didn't stand out quite as much. The only dish I would say wasn't a hit was the potatoes & carrots. It was alright - but kind of basic, no real 'wow' in the flavor department. We had no issues with the service. We had wine ordered and delivered within a few minutes of sitting down and our water glasses never sat empty. I left with fingers smelling of turmeric and garlic & onion breath that could probably knock someone out. Both pluses in my book - but probably not so much so for the folks around me afterward! **Note - they do have a full bar but you can BYOB with an $8/corkage fee per bottle. We chose not to BYO since the wine was reasonably priced enough that it wasn't worth the couple dollar savings.
