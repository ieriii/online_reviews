Went there for the second time last evening for dinner. We actually ordered a sandwich for an appetizer and 1 soup noodle (duck) and one dry noodle with pork.  The sandwich's there are an amazing deal and are delicious. They also do an excellent job with anything using grilled pork as a main ingredient. To address some of the complaints regarding the broth being bland, with the exception of Hue style, vietnamese broths are not spicy. That is why Tank and other places have the collection of pepper infused vinegar, sambal, raw chiles, etc... to be added into the soup.
