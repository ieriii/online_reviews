I have now been to Glenn's for brunch and dinner. They were both excellent! The potato pancake was soooooo delicious and the biscuits and gravy were to die for! For dinner my friends and I went on a Friday night. We made a reservation and were seated at 8pm. We all ordered seafood of course and the entire meal we were all ooo'ing and ahhh'ing. I had the catfish stuffed with shrimp. My friend ordered the tilapia and I cannot remember what my other friend ordered but we all just raved and raved about the food all night. I would definitely recommend Glenn's and its for sure family friendly!!
