I recommended we dine here to celebrate our friend's birthday because I've enjoyed every dining experience I've had here. Party of 6 on a Saturday night-- 5 pastry students and my boyfriend, a culinary student. Naturally we all love food and are very particular about what we eat. We ordered all the items on the shared appetizers (minus the foie gras, chicken livers, and scotch egg) and shared a nice bottle of white wine. Nothing really stood out. All I can remember was the tasty curry fries. You must order the curry fries. The entree I order was delicious!--that i can clearly remember. My boyfriend and I agree that it was one of the best pork chops I've ever ordered. It was so juicy, perfectly seared and cooked.  We ordered ALL the items on the dessert men--come on, what else can you expect from 5 pastry students? The desserts were hit or miss. We liked some, we hated some. They have changed the dessert menu since my last review some 2 years ago. Back then I fell in love with Gage after having the deconstructed root beer float. Anyway, desserts were all comped--i'm not sure whether it was because our table was very chatty with our server or because we told her to say hello to the pastry chef for us. It was a good night. We had a great time. I left around 11pm but the rest of the party stayed until the bar closed around 2:30am. This is definitely a place to go with a large party. There is something for everyone on the menu.
