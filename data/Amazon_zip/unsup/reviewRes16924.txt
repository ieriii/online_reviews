My father LOVES this place. Every time the husband and I are in town -we go to Carnivale. The food is surprisingly really good (Surprising b/c the place looks likes a suburban place made-up to look like a "cool" city place.) The guacamole is excellent... the drinks are fine and my Pork entree was to die for... AND their Valet service is dirt cheap!
