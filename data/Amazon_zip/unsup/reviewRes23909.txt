Wife and I wanted to patronize Irazu this past sunday BUUT(closed sundays!)..ahem.. hint hint:) Soo we had to wait it out but boy was it worth the wait in gold!! I mean the steak was tender and seasoned to perfection, the Costa Rican rice was savory and the green sauce added just the right amount of kick to my taste buds- WHOA! The guacamole and chips were on point, the chicken was flavorful(a tad dry), Omar the waiter was cool biz, atmosphere was fun and diverse and the prices were MORE than reasonable considering the portion sizes. We'll def be back very soon... what are YOU waiting for?? P.S.- word on the street is Irazu will be open for biz on SUNDAYS this summer...now that's what's up!
