I'm going to start by saying I LOVED the fist beer tappers! I want one :-) Waiting on a Friday night at 6 is a little discouraging with being shoulder to shoulder with people, but, well WORTH the wait. Seeing a few kiddies scattered around wasn't good either but I guess start them young right? The wait let J and I look over the AWESOME beer menu and really try a lot of beers I normally wouldn't try. I fell in love with the Iron Fist Pale Ale, the Samadhi and the Workingman Mild. The bartenders really know their beers too! They ask what kind of beer you like and they recommend the perfect beers according to your preference. After being seated and looking over the menu, I told J I was going to be adventurous and order us the quail with cheese grits. It was tender and the mixture of it with the cheese was so tasty! My first time having quail and it wasn't bad at all. For dinner, we ordered the Apple Pork Pizza. It was sweet and tangy. It had apple, gorgonzola, pork and beer onion. For me, there was a bit too much gorgonzola but the beer onion evened it out. The crust is crispy and light! Yum! We were too full from beer and food that we sadly didn't have room for dessert but, seeing the table next to us devour their Cherry Bourbon Cake and having all the delicious beer we had RB is going to bring us around a lot more times!
