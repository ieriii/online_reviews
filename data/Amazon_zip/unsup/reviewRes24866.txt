Wow. Best tapas I've had anywhere. Amazing flavors and elegant presentation. Each dish is a work of art. And each bite packs a punch. Portions are tiny but the taste more than makes up for it.  Bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds--AMAZING Catalan spinach, raisins, pine nuts, and apples--DELICIOUS Flatbread (porcini, Catalan sausage, garlic, manchego)--GREAT Diver scallops--HEAVENLY Grilled calamari--DELECTABLE Butternut squash dumplings over lamb ragout, mushroom, black truffle--MMMMMM Chocolate croquettes on banana marshmallow with caramel and olive oil--!@%$&*#! How can I best describe the croquettes? Like a chocolate ball explosion in your mouth mixed with ooey gooey marshmallow. As I mentioned before, the portions are really tiny, even for tapas. My friends and I had worked up an appetite salsa dancing across the street at the Chicago Summer Dance Festival, so we were still a bit hungry at the end of our meal. I would recommend getting at least 3 dishes per person. And definitely try the sangria. My favorite was the white sangria (pear and grape), which had a great sweet taste. Our server Juan Carlos was friendly and attentive and guided us through the menu. The restaurant itself, located in the Blackstone Hotel, is beautifully decorated, sleek and modern, fun and cheerful, with large windows overlooking Grant Park. With such steep prices, I won't be a regular here, but Mercat is definitely worth trying at least once.
