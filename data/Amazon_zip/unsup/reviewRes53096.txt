Been here a few times with friends this summer. It is great to sit out on the patio and have a mango drink and relax, it feels like summer and you feel like a rock star at some secret spot that only you know about. Not the best food, but good. Service a little slow but that's ok when you are enjoying feeling like a sexy rock star.
