My husband and I met My Two sisters and my brother for dinner at this fine dining steakhouse. All was well especially the service until at the close of dinner we realized shards of glass in the steaksauce. It is, I suppose customary and more classy to put the steak sauce in small white procelain containers We had maybe three given to our table so we shared the sauce. My brother kept crunching on something he remembers but thought it was the char on the outside of the steak (he takes his well done).When we complained to management, they handled it well until they informed us that they would only take care of my brother sisters portion of the bill. No matter how good the food was we were all placed in potential danger and definitely inconvenienced. For the trouble I think it would have been their pleasure, being the type of establishment it was to pay for everyone at the table. However, they took our information for their incident report and apologized numerously for the inconvenience. In the meantime our server was even embarrased that the check was not handled. Oh management did give a $75.00 gift certificate to my brother and sister together. We chose to use it because we will never eat there again. I'm taking my business to David Burke's, the steak was better there but not the service.
