Every holiday and birthday, my 3 sons, husband and I make our regular jaunt to Wildfire Chicago for the most delicious and oh-so-cozy ambiance of Wildfire. I always get the coconut crusted shrimp...a must have. The desserts are always delicious, but the sweet potatoes could be dessert in themselves. Say hi to John at the host stand, he's the best!
