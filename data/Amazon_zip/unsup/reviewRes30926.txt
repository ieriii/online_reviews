This was really one of the best dining experiences of my life. The Tomahawk steak, I believe it was a dry aged Australian wagyu rib eye, was the best I've ever had. The seas scallop appetizer, the Alaskan king crab and black truffle gnocchi were excellent. The signature dessert, the warm butter cake exceeded all expectations. The service was top notch all the way. The glasses of wine were gigantic, all the cocktails were interesting, delicious, and yes the rumors are true, they leave the shaker.
