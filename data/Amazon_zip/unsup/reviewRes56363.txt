I can't say enough about this place! The owners are really great people and the food is so incredibly fresh. The pho soup (I've only had the beef) can't be beat - the first time I had it, I went back 3 times in the same week. Other favorites are the lemongrass chicken, chicken fried rice, and the Simply It beef. The prices are really reasonable too - just went with a table of 7 and the bill worked out to be less than $20 per person (BYOB helps!!). This place is a must.
