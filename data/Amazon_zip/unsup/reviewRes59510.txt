I've been going to La Villa for about 6 years. I think its really good. I absolutely love the Oysters Rockerfeller. Im also a fan of the Shrimp DeJaughn (spelling?). As far as entrees go, my favorites are the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken and Chicken Parmesan. The pizza is pretty good. I cant comment on the salad bar because Ive never tried it but everytime Ive been there it seemed to be a hot spot. The waitstaff is very attentive, especially the happy waitress...Lydia, I believe? Shes a riot. Good food, great service.
