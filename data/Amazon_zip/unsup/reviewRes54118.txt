I went to Xoco for the first time yesterday, expecting to battle long lines and longer waits. I thought I was lucky that I only had to wait 20 minutes -- my wait at Frontera last time was just under 5 hours. No joke.I see why the wait here is short(er). The food, while good, is overpriced and overhyped. My partner and I got guacamole, a soup, a sandwich, a cookie, and a hot chocolate. Total bill: $35.First off, that's a pretty stiff bill for a simple dinner for two. The soup (the chicken one) was super salty. The sandwich (jamon torta) was just ok, but nothing special. The guacamole was pretty small and delicious -- but kind of pricey at $4. The chocolate chip hazelnut cookie was ridiculously good.And the hot chocolate? I was so disappointed. I got the Aztec, which is chocolate, water, chile, and allspice. My partner thought it tasted like blood. I thought it was just gross. Nearly undrinkable. Maybe the milk-based ones are better?Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Rick Bayless fan. But I'm skipping Xoco and if I need a Bayless torta, I recommend Frontera Fresca -- they serve a Cubana torta that is pretty much the same as Xoco -- and about $4 cheaper. But Xoco just doesn't come close to the quality and value you get at Frontera and Topolobampo.
