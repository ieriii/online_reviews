Went here at 7pm on a Saturday night with a party of three people. Was told that there would be a 20 minute wait, but were seated within five minutes in a heated tent behind the main restaurant. It rained a couple of times during our meal and the tent felt really very cosy. The server was really friendly and personable throughout. As a vegetarian who misses eating meat, I couldn't wait to eat a proper burger again, I can say this: The burger was good. Not amazing, but good enough. I had the BBQ "bacon" cheezeburger although I've never had a good experience with vegan 'cheeze' so ordered it with dairy cheese. The burger itself was fine, the texture wasn't too far off and it tasted OK, although maybe it could have been flavoured more heavily, I ended up adding quite a lot of hot sauce. The perfect rectangles of veggie bacon look a bit odd but did taste something like bacon. If it were the burger alone I'd probably have given this 3/5. The rest of the dinner, though, was delicious! The sweet potato fries, though, were absolutely delicious. Neither too greasy, too soggy or too crunchy, and I couldn't resist ordering a cookie dough milkshake... I don't know how it's possible that the shake was vegan, it's one of the best ones I've ever had! One of my dining partners had the Reuben, which looked AMAZING and if I ever come back here I know what I'm getting.
