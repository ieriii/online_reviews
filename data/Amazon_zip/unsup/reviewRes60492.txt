So I have been going to Wilde for brunch for months now and finally got a chance to write a review. Truth is I took some friends there for the first time and one of them said they were going to yelp about it and I didn't want to be showed up.The restaurant itself is great looking, it is so cozy and comfortable, especially the library. I always ask if there is a table available in the library, sometimes you get lucky!The staff is always attentive and efficient and most of the time they are super friendly.and the food...I love the pancakes here! They are my favorite item on the menu. They are lighty and kinda fluffy, but they have this amazing eggy taste to them that makes them really unique and delicious. No matter what else I order I always get a short stack on the side.I have never ordered anything i did not like, but i am a creature of habit and get the same few things everytime. The Granola is amazing (though I think it is just crushed up cookies), the Chef's Egg Sandwich is great and the Eggs Benedict is remarkable, though I order it mithout the tomato. The Baked Brie and Egg is really good too, but not for everyone. For dinner the Shepherd's Pie and the Mac and Cheese are great choices and the roast Chicken is good,Everytime I go in I tell myself to get something new, but the old favorites are so good I just keep going back to them.As wonderful as I think the place is I am amazed I have never waited for a table on a Sunday morning! So many times brunch is ruined by having to wait an hour for a table. I have never waited more than a few minutes at Wilde....huge plus!
