I been here twice and I felt there's absolute no room for disappointment here. Firstly the service was awesome, the servers on both the times were more than welling to explain the menu and even offer suggestions, the food was simple and tasty, I liked the lamb kebab with flavored rice, the dill rice was much more flavorful and tasty if you like dill. Even though i did not try many more dishes here I would strongly believe that most of them would turn out to be good judging by the 2 entre i tried. The only down side to this place is that I would have liked if the place was larger than it is as there isn't much place between tables and it gets really crowded during the weekends with a lots of wait times for bigger groups.
