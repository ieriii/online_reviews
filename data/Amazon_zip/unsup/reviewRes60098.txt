Good food and good service. I went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed--line ups out both doors. If you go alone or only with a couple friends then you probably won't have to wait too long because they'll seat you wherever there are seats, even if it means sharing a large round table with strangers (I sat alone at a table with three friends, a couple, and a old man). When it's busy, don't bother waiting for help to come around. Just get their attention and they'll be more than happy to help. The food was pretty standard fare for a good Vietnamese restaurant, and it came out pretty fast despite all the people. The price was fair although I've had cheaper for the same quality, but that's hard to find. Two spring rolls, vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and shrimp and egg roll, and iced coffee (unless you like your coffee bitter, make sure you get it with the condensed milk) ran me $15 and change.If you don't want to wait, I suggest you walk down the block to Vietnamese Thai Binh Restaurant. You're likely find the place pretty empty, but I gave it the same 4 star rating.
