Went here on a Saturday night which was very crowded. Make reservations at Open Table ahead of time or you can be looking at an hour wait. Due to the animation on the website, I was under the impression that this place had "hippy counterculture" theme. However, with the exception of 1970s pop music and black and white pictures of women on the wall, it feels like a traditional pub. There is dim lighting, inadequate space, and single stall bathrooms. The line to the washrooms can get a bit pushy as it interferes with the staff entrance to the kitchen.  THE CROWD: This place is kid/parent/grandparent friendly. When I went on a saturday evening, approximately 15% of the crowd was 4-9yr old kids.  THE FOOD: This is your basic pub burger style menu. In addition, you will find a 70's style salad bar. Due to cost, you will have to choose either salad bar or burger as there is no "combo" deal option. The menu even jokes about the salad bar only being available "alone, by itself and including nothing else." The burgers are thick and tasty, but still your standard pub fare. They are available with bacon, cheddar, chiles, etc.. They include home made potato chips as opposed to french fries. THE SERVICE: The service is ok. We requested sweet potato fries but were served regular. In addition, I had to ask for soda refills. OK, not great service. Nothing to get upset about though. WOULD I GO BACK? Yes, the burgers are great and the atmosphere is good for entertaining a more conservative crowd. Look elsewhere if you are looking for a more edgy experience.
