Very good - had an extremely long line, but we wanted to wait to see all they hype (lol)! Long line = good food, right?? Well, it's almost exactly like the cheesecake factory -- the menu was long and had as much as the cheesecake factory - prices were about the same and it hit the spot, but I was expecting maybe something more. The beneigh's with the trio of sauces was superb!!
