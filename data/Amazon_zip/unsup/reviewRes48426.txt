WOW - not much here to complain about folks. I was lucky enough to be in a  group of men that knew the owner and chef and had literally the entire menu ordered and consumed with our Belgium beers. Even the damn Pork Rynes are insanely tasty and not what you expect. Everything about this joint is awesome - the noisy space, the restrooms, the entire menu YUM
