I wish there were half-stars on this thing. I noticed a ton of the excellent reviews this place has received and I understand why. The ambiance is good, the food is amazing, but the service is crap. My dining experience relies heavily on the service I receive. I would much rather be talking about the food, but since I almost passed out from hunger before I was actually fed - my hands are tied. I did get to watch the staff salsa, and laugh before providing us with water or taking our order. Do not go here unless you are an extremely patient patron. On the plus side - if/when you get your food, you will not be sorry.
