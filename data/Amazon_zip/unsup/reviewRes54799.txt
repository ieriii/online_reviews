I'm done with the Hopleaf forever. I've been here a bunch of times over the years, and I'm done. Here are the reasons why:1) Its just too damn busy to be worth it, go buy some good beer and hang out with friends at home instead. If you're a 20 something kid that just starting going out legally to bars then you'd be into this place.  2) I ordered an Aventinus once. I know how to pronounce it, I speak Latin (just look at my name), not to mentioned I've had that beer more than once before. The bartender corrected me, despite being wrong - he also, to me, sounded and acted like an ignorant jackass.3) Bartenders and staff having personal conversations is more important than serving customers. This has happened every single time I've been here. 4) Let's talk about the food. It can be really good. But first of all, the service SUCKS, has always sucked, and always will suck. Every. Single. Time. From the clueless hostess' the Hopleaf employs, to the servers and kitchen staff. Your wait time for your table, server to come by, food to come out, drinks to arrive, bill to come will be forever and not less than forever. Oh, and average wait time to even get a table will be in hours, always. 5) Lets talk about the noise. Forget about conversation, just forget it. You will yell to talk at all times, no exceptions, ever.6) They have a passion for beer but more of a passion for turning people off with their useless pretensions. They are missing not only numerous opportunities for education but also losing customers - but the Hopleaf doesn't have to care with the throngs of mindless hipsters filling up the place. 7) Drinking good beer does NOT make you superior to anyone else. If you understand that statement as a reasonable, rational thing to think, then you will not fit in at the Hopleaf. I'd like to see these same people go to pubs in Europe. I think they'd be shocked.
