We stayed there over the Memorial Day weekend. I'll net it out. The location was fabulous, and the price was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and professional. Our room was right over the El tracks. We could hear the trains go by, but it didn't keep us awake (although I would definitely be concerned about being on a lower floor -- we were on the 6th). The wallpaper was starting to peel off in a couple of spots, but nothing major. We were traveling with our teenager, and all wanted a little privacy, so we reserved a suite with a king sized bed and a fold out couch. The bed was quite comfortable, but the sofa bed was atrociously uncomfortable. The suite didn't have a door between the bedroom and the sleeping area, and no mention of that fact was made on the website when we reserved the room.
