Holy Sweet Rigatoni... BYOB! No Corkage Fee! Now this is a place for Me! How have I never stumbled upon the super sweet, quaint Ravenswood digs of the adorable side street sittin' Caro Mio? Considering it has all the ingredients to make for a delectable and flawless Italiano feasting you'd think I'd have been a bit more in the linguine loop. Eh, better late than never say I... that spectacularly superb gnocchi bolognese is on my radar now and it ain't never leaving my side!! Fluffy, sinful, meaty, decadent gnocchi aside, there are a multitude of dishes at Caro Mio worthy of a crave attack. All of your favorites are here; fresh, tender calamari, creamy gorgonzola risotto, lavish and rich ossobuco milanese, plump frutta di mare and all the 'pasta fatta' aka homemade pasta items that yes, are fabulous pasta dishes that will indeed make you fatta. Wear your favorite Soprano Italia flag-bearing stretchy track pants. Viva New Jersey! Now combine those fan-flippin-tabulous homemade creations with the authentic down home service to match and our beloved BYO, natch, for a wonderful extravaganza with some hearty chow. My lust-inducing, dream-provoking, smile-generating, drool-stimulating Caro Mio mishmash? Combine 2 bottles '04 Antinori Tignanello Toscana + 1 polenta al sugo appetizer + 1 gnocchi gratinati + 1 vitello all' arrabbiata = Complete & Utter Italian Overloaded Bliss. And with that, I bid you a Mangia! Mangia! Buon Appetito.
