Excellent sandwiches and a real old school Chicago feel. We ordered hummus, diablo's beef sandwich and the dutch club. The hummus was average. The diablo's beef was excellent- warm grilled bread, lean and tasty beef. Maybe a bit too salty, but the texture was perfect. The dutch club was the same- freshly grilled, still hot and just the right amount of each ingredient. The diablos beef sandwich came with kind of a jalepeno relish on the side. Temperature wise, it was cold, but very spicy. Not for me, but probably heaven for someone who likes wierd spicy stuff. I would definitely go back. hummus, two sandwiches and tip- $35.
