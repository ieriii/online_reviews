First, I should say that I hate deep dish.  This thin-crust Neapolitan style pizza is like a spiritual experience for me. Best in the world. Try the arugula pizza. I would never think to put it on a pizza, but it combines with their ultra-fresh buffalo mozzarella for a nutty, creamy, perfected flavor. I would eat it every day if I could.Also get the bianco nero if it's on the specials list when you're there. This is a white pizza, with truffle-infused pecorino cheese and porcini mushrooms. I can't talk with my table mates when I order it, because it's like I need to be alone with the bianco nero. It gets into my soul.Their crust is exquisite. Slightly crispy on the outside, but chewy inside. It's so thin you could read through it.The tomato sauce is simple, and brings out the flavors of the pizza so well. It's the perfect blend of sweet and tangy. Just what a pizza sauce should be. At the same time, the white pizzas lack nothing.The insalata mista appetizer has a great balsamic dressing, and the best olives I've ever eaten. They are so fresh, and not overly brined. Get off line and go to Spacca!!!
