I'm so happy that I didn't fall asleep last night. My friend who plays drums wanted to go to Green Mill because after 1 AM they have free cover and the chance for onlookers to go on stage to show off their skill (til 4). THis may be limited to just the weekends, so I would double check on that one. The instant I walked in a smile spread across my face. I was so happy to be here. We had to stand for a little while because there were quite a few people, but soon after a booth opened up we were able to scooch on in and enjoy the rest of the night on padded seats. I was expecting more low key jazz, but that wasn't the case. I think when they have the jam bands it's generally going to be more upbeat. I played the sax for 10 years and haven't touched it since giving it to my sister. Last night I reaaaaaaaally got the urge to start playing again and I may even look for one to purchase just to fool around and have some fun with it again. The booths and tables are quite intimate, small, but it makes for a real close experience with the players. I'm going to try to make myself become a regular here. I can't believe it took me this long to get here, and I've even wanted to come for so long. I guess an excuse always came up. Shame on me. If you need to drink, sorry, it's not going to be that cheap. I was here completely sober and didn't feel the need to have one drink because I was high on the music. However, if I ever got the guts to ask them to show off my vocals, I'd have to definitely throw a couple back. I will definitely, definitely, definitely be back. I love the crowd and I love the music. I will be encouraging everyone I know to go.
