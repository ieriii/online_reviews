$250 and 3 hours later, I left starving and nauseous. My wife and I were celebrating our 9 year anniversary, and each ordered the five course tasting menu. It took 3 hours for them to serve us about 4 ounces of food. And every ridiculous teeny tiny dish was so dramatically over-salted as to be inedible. The temperatures were all off (room-temperature shellfish, yuck), annnndd... they poisoned us! Yay! We were both sick for 16 hours after this terrible "meal" that took forever and never got anywhere. Nothing even tasted good. Terrible all the way around.
