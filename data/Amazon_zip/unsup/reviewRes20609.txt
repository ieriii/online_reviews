This place was not good. It was so not worth the money nor the long wait. This place gets really busy too. My boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar. It was very crowded and loud. Not a good date place. I am a sushi fanatic and heard this place was one of the best sushi places but I was very disappointed. I usually expect sushi to be expensive but I expect it to be GOOD! This place was not good. So I don't know what people are talking about... Also there wasn't a lot. We tried Coast Crab, Dragon, and something for appetizer...forgot what it was.
