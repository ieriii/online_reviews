I love every single thing I've had here, from the soup to the crepes to the water. Water - With cucumber in it! So refreshing, and a great complement to the flavorful... Soup - I always get the vegetable soup. They really aren't more specific than that, but I believe it's lentil? Maybe? At any rate, it's amazing, and just enough to tide me over before my crepe arrives. Savory crepes - They have a good selection of crepes on the menu, but I always opt to build my own: Roma tomatoes, baby spinach, garlic, goat cheese, olive oil. Sweet crepes - Also delicious, though I generally skip dessert unless they have the blueberry/brie crepe. The first time ordered it, the person I went with was a little afraid to try a fruit/cheese crepe, but it blew us both away completely.
