The line wasn't as bad as expected. We waited about 25 minutes a little after 12:30p.m. It was worth the wait. The short rib torta was very flavorful and was seasoned well. I was a little upset with the little amount of guacamole they give with the chips though. The cubana my friend had was excellent! A must try if your in the hood!
