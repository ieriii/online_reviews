I'm sure if I went here on a weekday this would have been a better experience. We walked in at 7pm on a Friday night and was told 30-45 minutes for a table for two. Having been told about all of the tasty micro brews I had no problem with the wait . The problem was we waited for almost two hours and had to remind the hostess that we were still there. The staff of all super hipsters were aggro and pushy to any and all guests that walked in. Basically if you didn't have gaping holes in your ears, plaid , or your little sisters jeans on they pay you no mind. Sorry, ms. hostess...I don't speak irony. The place was PACKED and super loud, from the bar and the entire dining room. Playing hip hop like talib kweli or mos def, but of course nothing too main stream. The beers were outstanding, i had the "Oktoberfest" and the GF had the "golder arm" which is the house pilsner. Both were very strong and tasty. We had a few of these beers as I said we waited TWICE the quoted time after being told we were "the next name on the list" So after finally being sat down our server was pissed that we didn't know what we wanted yet and left us alone for another 10 minutes. We finally order the med pizza, red sauce, spinach, banana peppers. about 15 later out comes a steaming pile of cheese and meat on bread. As soon as my girl picked up the first piece all of the toppings slid off and she had to eat it with a fork.  Unless you are into a scene or trying to get a free ticket to the pitchfork festival save yourself the stress and go for the beer only. "piece" of shit is a more appropriate title
