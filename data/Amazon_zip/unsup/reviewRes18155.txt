Went to the Bad Apple Saturday night for the first time. What a great neighborhood place! Cool vibe, friendly staff, and a beer list that is unrivaled. Burgers are freshly made, and fries come in a variety of different ways. I had truffle oil on them, and I also tasted them with Old Bay on them. Garlic, firecracker, Chipotle and more are other choice fry finishes. I loved the Slow Burn Burger with the right amount of griddled hot peppers, cheese and bacon. We shared the fried cheese curds appetizer and they were fresh, crispy outside and creamy melty inside. The photos are spot on.  This place even makes it's own ketchup! I am no beer expert, and the waitress made excellent recommendations based on other beers I like. Good thing, as there are tons and tons of drafts and bottle/cans to choose from. A great place to hang out with friends. Internet jukebox mixed it up all over the place in a good way. I'll be back and trying out more beer and burgers soon.
