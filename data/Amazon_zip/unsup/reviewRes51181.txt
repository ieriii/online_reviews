I've been here on 3 occasions, the first time was for an office party so we had dinner there. The second and third times were for brunch. The lemon poppy seed pancake with the creme glaze is awesome! I would also recommend the Southern Benedict...simply amazing. I give it three stars because while the things I've ordered have been pretty amazing, the items others I've gone with have ordered have been sub par to say the least. I would definitely return, but I wouldn't recommend playing it safe here...if your going to eat here get something from the menu that's southern. All else may be disappointing
