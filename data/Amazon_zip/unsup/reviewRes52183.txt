Cheese: Bland. Roughly as flavorful as cottage cheese. Sauce: Bland. Someone must have misplaced the oregano. Pepperoni: Bland. Could just as well have been hamburger. Crust: Leaden, characterless and bland, bland, bland. Maybe this is how tourists visiting my town feel when we take them to Pat's or Geno's for a "real" Philly cheesesteak. (We apologize. There's much better.) All I know is, when you visit a town, you get all set for a taste of the local chili, weiner dog or cheese curds, and you expect a revelation. You expect to say to yourself: I just never knew cheese curds could be a life-changing experience. Gino's deep-dish Chicago-style pizza reveals nothing. I'm not saying it is genuinely bad. It is just boring. It is the wingtip shoes and corduroy trousers of the pizza world. We waited over a half-hour in line to get into the joint. Once in, we waited close to 40 minutes for a small deep-dish pie. Points to the waiter for telling us in advance that it would take that long. Points, too, for steering us clear of a larger pie. He was right: For two people, one small pizza (4 slices) was more than filling. OK, so, you're thinking: He's complaining about the pizza, but he ate the whole thing. But here's the deal: When you wait in line a half hour, and you wait for close to three-quarters of an hour for the pie to somehow clear the kitchen, you eat the whole friggin' thing. My guess is, locals steer clear of the place. They probably go to Blah-Blah-Blah in Oak Park or Whosis in Northside. They know better. And now you do. My advice on how to avoid the long line? Avoid the place altogether.
