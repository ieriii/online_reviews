This place makes me dream of falafel at night! I was never really "into" middle eastern food, but that all changed when my hubby took me to Sultan's Market! The chicken schwarma is really good, I wish it had less dark meat, but I know that is kinda how it is supposed to be. (I'm more of a white meat girl) I love love love the falafel, I could eat like 454340 of them. The Jerusalum salad is awesome and fresh, I am also obsessed with cucumbers so that helps. I always used to get the rice, but then I found out I could get cous cous and my life will never be the same. I wish I knew what they put in it so I could make it at home. Nom Nom Nom....it's like tomato-y and delicious! Oh and this place is so cheap, and they deliver in like one second, I swear. One.
