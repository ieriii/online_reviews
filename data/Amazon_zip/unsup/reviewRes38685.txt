I didn't know what to expect on my first visit. WOW, the wait was long but the local 312 brew on tap was good. I watched the skillful chefs make each pie. Freshly spun saucers of dough are thrown across the kitchen and caught by the next chef and hand decorated with ingredients that will make your stomach growl. The stuffed pizza is amazing. I love thin NY style crust, but this stuff will make you a lover of true deep dish quality Chicago style pizza. LOVE THIS STUFF! Hands down best in Chicago!
