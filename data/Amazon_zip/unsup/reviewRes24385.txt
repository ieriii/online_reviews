I made a second visit hoping the second was just as good as the first. We ordered empanadas. They were the special on the menu. Sadly, there was nothing special or delicious about them. We ordered a veggie burrito and it tasted good but bland The black bean soup was ok and the order of plantains was ok too. I dont think I will be back here for a while. How disappointing!
