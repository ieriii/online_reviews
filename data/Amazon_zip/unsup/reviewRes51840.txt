We were visiting Chicago for the first time and stumbled across Gino's. We had just seen the Man v. Food episode where Adam was in Chicago, so when we found Gino's, we knew we had to stop in. So far, we've gone twice - yesterday and today. When we found it yesterday, it was late afternoon and we were looking for something to eat after our flight, but we had a dinner reservation so when we were told 45 minutes for a deep dish and 35 for a thin crust, we thought we'd better go with appetizers instead. We ordered the sampler platter (can't remember the name of it exactly) with spinach sticks (mozz sticks w/spinach), toasted ravioli, calamari and bruschetta. The calamari was just ok, but everything else was really good. And our server, Michael, was great. So we knew we wanted some deep dish, so we went back today for lunch. We ordered the Gino's supreme with with sausage. Our server, Ed, asked if we wanted crumbled or patty and we said crumbled. We later heard him explaining the difference to other tables and wished we'd gone with patty. Apparently patty just means that they cover the entire thing with sausage. Oh well, the pizza was still delicious. And they were definitely right about the 45 minutes to make it. The cheese was fantastic and fresh. The veggies were also very fresh and you could taste each one. I would definitely recommend Gino's to anyone visiting Chicago and wanted Deep Dish.
