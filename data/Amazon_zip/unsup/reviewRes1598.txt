Walking into Hot Doug's, I had pretty high expectations from all the hype. And this place definitely lived up to the hype. The foie gras with the duck sausage was incredible. To me, it was the sausage that made it great. They do put quite a bit of foie gras on there, so it makes it worth the price. This is one of the few places where I actually feel that it is worth buying a hot dog. Although the wait might be quite long, it's definitely worth the wait
