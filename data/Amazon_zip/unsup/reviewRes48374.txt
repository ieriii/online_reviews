We went with a group of four at 5:30 pm on a Tuesday. At first we were the only people there, but it quickly got crowded (and noisy.)  The room is a big rectangle with booths along one side, a bar along another side, and a few very large communal tables in the middle.  The booths are WEIRD.  To get into the booth one has to open a half-door and climb in, then shut the little door behind them. The waiter served the food over the door.  I felt like I was eating in a car.  Cramped and claustrophobic. My party, on the other hand, thought it was cozy. Food: VERY heavy on the meat. There are some veggie dishes, but they are more like sides than main dishes. (i.e. small plate of pickles).  We ordered the whole chicken for the table, which was served already cut and boned, and was DELICIOUS. It was served on top of a bed of frites which were gooey with juicy chicken deliciousness. For dessert we got a belgian waffle, which was very airy inside but seemed to be deep fried- a little too much for me.  You have to be adventurous to eat here, there's stuff on the menu like sweetbreads and head cheese.  Decor: The bathrooms were more aesthetically pleasing than the main dining room.  The main dining area has plain yellow walls which are bare- I felt they could use something on the walls, especially to absorb some of the sound.  Service: Great. We had no problems with any of the previously mentioned service issues that others had. Our waiter was great- very attentive, explained everything on the menu, helped us pick out what apps and what sides to get, and helped my husband pick out his beer. The other waitstaff were great as well, always filling our water and clearing away empty dishes immediately.  In summary, the meal was delicious but heavy and a little weird, and dessert not so great. The decor was weird as well- the booth door thing bothered me for some reason.  Five stars for the service, three for food and decor.
