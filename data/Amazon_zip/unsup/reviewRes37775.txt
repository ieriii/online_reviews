If you wanted a neighborhood market where you can spend more than you need even at Whole Foods but still enjoy it then F&O is your choice. It is pricey but a lot of the items aren't necessarily the sort of things you can find at Jewel or Dominick's. I haven't dined in the Cafe but I've always gotten helpful service from the different counter staff and cashiers and the cheesemonger is always happy to give a small tasting sample (love that Keen's Cheddar!) If you're assembling supplies for a fancy picnic or special dinner, or maybe you just have a lot of discretionary income this is your place. Definitely worth a visit if you're in River East/Streeterville
