Great value for reliably good food. Ambience is OK. BYOB and CASH ONLY (ATM on premises) Friendly busy staff We really like the lentil soup, but recently it is NEVER hot enough. The drinking water isn't cold enough and no ice is available which is irritating. I love the Zatter Bread Fettia sandwich spicy with hummus (you have an option to choose hummus or babaganoush) with Feta. The husband loves the Egg and Cheese Bread Fettia spicy sandwich with babaganoush (option to choose hummus). These sandwiches run out frequently, so our second choices are the falafel sandwich spicy for the husband, and either the tabbouleh or the rice and lentils with Jerusalem salad for me. The cold and hot buffet offers a by the pound option which is enticing, delicious, and quickly becomes more costly than one expects.  Carry out, delivery, and eat-in options. Street parking can be difficult.
