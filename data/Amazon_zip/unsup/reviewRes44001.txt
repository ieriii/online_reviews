We went last night for Valentine's Day. They had a special menu offering for two people. It includes four courses (including dessert) and ran $119/couple. Considering all the food you got this wasn't a bad deal. I had the Surf n' Turf and my wife had the New Zealand lamb. Other courses included large crab cakes and a mushroom risotto with duck. The service was attentive. The food was excellent! I would definitely go back and try their other steaks.
