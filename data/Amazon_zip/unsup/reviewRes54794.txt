BEER BLISS!!!Do not let the outside fool you! It looks a little dicey on the outside, but heaven awaits on the inside. And apparently, everyone else in Chicago agrees.You have to time going to this restaurant just right. My friend and I were aware of this when he and I went, so we got there at 6:00p.m. on the dot and we were still too late. We assumed since it was pouring rain, the wait wouldn't be as long. WRONG!The problem with this place is that it's so small and cramped that even when you're waiting for your table, it is incredibly inconvenient because you're always in someones way. Unless you're lucky enough to score a seat at the bar which after 15 minutes of waiting, we did. I couldn't tell you how many new and incredible beers I had that night. I can tell you I was feeling good and my stomach was full pre-dinner. My friend that I was with is another foodie, so he and I went all out.We ordered the potato latkes and the German sausage plate as an appetizer and then went on to have meals, more beers, and dessert.We were beyond stuffed. We needed a dolly to roll both of us outta there. The food was out of this world, It's very rich and heavy, so keep that in mind. I didn't eat until dinner the next day. It's definitely a great date place!
