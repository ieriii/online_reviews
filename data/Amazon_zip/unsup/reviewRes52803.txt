This place is pretty solid. It feels like upscale latin america, good music good outdoorsy feel. Can't wait to try it in the summer. BYOB and they make mixers for you which is pretty sweet. The sangria is awesome, they also had a mojito but wasn't my fav compared to the sangria. The food was cook with precision yet authentic, a combo hard to find in Latin cuisine in the Northern US. We had a group of 20 people and during a late rush and we were accommodated pretty well overall.
