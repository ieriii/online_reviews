I came to this restaurant all excited because of the good ratings it had, but when we got there we experienced very rude and horrible service from the waiters. It was the first time eating korean bbq for me and my friends. We asked the server to teach us, but all she did was said a few words and walked away. When we ran out of water no waiter came by until an hour later. Also, when we were almost done eating, my friend had spotted a  long brown bug crawling on the counter in the back (we had the last table by the washroom and the counter with the register). It was disgusting. This restaurant might be good for those who are familiar with korean bbq, doesnt mind rude service, and do not mind seeing bugs crawling all over.
