The Chicago dining scene seems to be as tenuous and tempestuous as the Hollywood clubs/bars; patrons are fickle and the "hottest restaurant" you have to book at least 2 weeks in advance one season can suddenly become that 3/5-star establishment everyone says "was really good when it first came out...." So when a restaurant manages to retain a good reputation among foodies despite having been on the map for several years, you know it's earned it through some legitimate praises. Carnivale is one of those restaurants I just hadn't yet made my way to since living downtown, but had heard of repeatedly throughout the years, always in pleasant, satisfied terms. When my girlfriend said she'd made reservations there, I was excited. I did a sampling of 3 ceviches: salmon, hiramasa (yellowtail) and tuna. Hiramasa had a firmer, sweeter, less fatty than the salmon or tuna. each of them had a serious spicy kick to it,and had much less liquid than i'm used to - the tuna actually looked straight up like sashimi with jicama, avocado and jalapeno, but i'm not complaining because i love sashimi. I tried the plantain side, which was delicious, but plantains are awesome so no surprise there. I also split fish tacos with my girlfriend which were less than awesome (for you west coasters, I'm pretty sure Rubio's would have laid the smackdown on these tacos). Raspberry mojito was refreshing and well made, generous with the puree. The decor is a definite conversation piece, though I don't know if I'd recommend Carnivale if you're looking to have a lot of group conversation or an intimate date - it's loud, it's a party atmosphere, it's aptly named.
