Being Italian, I tend to opt out when going out for food that I can make at home. However, I was with some friends when we stumbled upon Calo's. I had never heard of this restaurant before and was skeptical. After sitting down and taking 1 bite out of the fresh focaccia bread brought to the table - I knew I had to give this place a try. I ordered the ziti with sun-dried tomatoes, peas, grilled chicken in a vodka sauce -- it was absolutely delicious. Everyone else ordered an variety of chicken, gnocchi and pasta with shrimp meals and were equally impressed. I would definitely revisit this restaurant - the service was a bit slow, but I was so caught up in the good food that I barely noticed.
