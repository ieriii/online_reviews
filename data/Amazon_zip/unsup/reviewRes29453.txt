I hit up Chicago Diner three times during my trip out there and each time came away impressed. Really awesome vegetarian/vegan place that no doubt lives up to its reputation and all the great reviews. First trip through I got the chicken fried steak and it was decent, and the cookie dough shake was very good. That trip I missed the Texas mushroom melt, and I'm so glad I came back to try it because it's beyond delicious. The patty they make is so flavorful and I love the Texas toast. Plus, the mashed potatoes and gravy were also excellent, and this is big for me because I'm a big gravy person and I had yet to find a vegan restaurant that made gravy that wasn't a bland mess. Chicago Diner makes it great. Big points scored there. We also then tried the caramel torte recommended by our server and it also was delicious. Thanks, dude. Chicago Diner was one of my favorite places to eat on my vacation. I'll definitely be back.
