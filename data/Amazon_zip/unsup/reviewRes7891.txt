Wow, I've found a new favorite place! Holy crap is this place good! It's a bit off the beaten path (to me, at least) but I'm so glad I found this place. Parking was easy, and we were seated immediately (good timing...the place filled up after we arrived). The owner (I think) brought a lovely amuse-bouche (is it still called that if it's in an Italian restaurant?) of ricotta on a small slice of bread drizzled with olive oil. Very nice. The menu is simple and perfect...very nice antipasti selections, also red and white pizzas. We ordered the white anchovy and arugula salad, and the buffalo mozzarella w/prosciutto, along with the pizza margherita. Service was phenomenal...timing was perfect. Salads were brought out and they were gorgeous...fresh, generous portions, and delicious. I felt like I was back in Italy eating this stuff, especially the buffalo mozzarella. Oh, and the dark-eyed waiter didn't hurt {swoon}. The pizza came next...piping hot out of the oven. I like that they give you the pizza cutter to portion however you want (while retaining the heat...I like my pizza hot hot hot). Pizza was delicious...the dough so light and thin and chewy, topped by fresh ingredients. Simple and perfect. I ran the cutter through twice and BF and I chowed down our 4 large slices. I knew their gelato was going to be good, but I had no idea how good. We split a pistachio and it was the best damn gelato I've ever had. First of all, it was not died green, and it was packed with whole pistachios. It was a pretty large portion too...not some teeny golfball-sized lame-ass presentation. Just a big ol' scoop of deliciousness in a bowl. So yeah, this place is awesome...great food served by nice people. You can't ask for more!
