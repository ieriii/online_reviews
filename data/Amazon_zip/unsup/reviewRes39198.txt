Just one small thing to add, kind of an oddity. Last time I was here, my man ordered the chicken which he's had before and LOVED. This time the dish was so ridiculously underseasoned that he requested salt from the waitress.  From my perspective, the patron requesting salt for a dish at a place like L&E should send a message to the kitchen that something went wrong with the dish (this chicken quarter escaped the brine, perhaps?) and perhaps that ought to be addressed. Instead, the waitress returned with a tiny bowl, inside of which was a TINY spoon, upon which were approximately 7 grains of kosher salt. To me, that was the kitchen saying "I know you are, but what am I??" Not cool.
