Frontera is often crowded and getting seated on the weekends can be tough. But the food is awesome and won't disappoint. While everything on the menu is great, strongly consider one of the daily specials. My experience has been that these dishes are exceptional. After your meal, be sure to get yourself some french press coffee. It's Intelligentsia (the best) and french press is the right way to have it.
