I wish Yelp had a thumbs up functionality like FB--I am quite sure I can't add much more praise than has already been paid to this place. We went on a Sunday night at 8 and it was packed; clearly an indication of its following in the hood. I slurped down a Barbar (or two), soaked some mussel juice in bread from my boyfriend's plate and killed the grilled ham and cheese all on my own. The food was hot and delicious. The ham in the sandwich was extraordinary--hard to explain and the cheese was extra gooey. I really liked this little spot.
