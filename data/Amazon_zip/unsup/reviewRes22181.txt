Summer visit...weekday, early evening Something different to do with the fam bam for sure... On the positive: + Drive thru is a fun novelty + Cute retro decor + really good dogs Room for Improvement : - soggy fries :( - pricey for fast-food meal, I guess you are paying for the kitsch  A Chicago must! :)
