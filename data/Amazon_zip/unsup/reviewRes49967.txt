Sports bars aren't my favorite spots, but I don't mind going to the Fifty. Why? They make a killer hoe-mosa, which is a Hoegaarden beer lightly topped off with orange juice. "Hair of the dog" has never gone down so easily! Also, their Bloody Marys are some of the best I've had - they're prettily decorated with a celery stalk, lemon, lime AND a strip of bacon. And the food - this isn't your typical bar fare. Today, I had "Egg in a Hole", which is two slices of buttered toast with an over-easy egg cooked in the middle of each slice. You also get sweet potato hashbrowns and your choice of sausage or bacon. Quite the hangover helper for $6.50! My friend tried the breakfast lasagna which is as sinful as it sounds. Also noteworthy: the cheese fries (the best I've found in Chicago!) and the boneless BBQ wings. Plenty of TVs to get your fill of sports and all the servers are smiley, genuinely nice and efficient. Check out the huge outdoor patio when the weather's right!
