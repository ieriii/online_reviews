I'm putting Sapori Trattoria at the top of my Italian and "Fit for Foodies" lists and I have a feeling it's going to be a long time, if ever, that it gets bumped down from the number one spot. I will try my best to string together a bunch of adjectives that can do the food here any justice, but you will have to just taste for yourself to get the full picture. I originally came to Sapori a few months ago for a Yelp elite event and the appetizers at the event were so out-of-this-world amazing that I knew I had to come back for dinner. Thanks Yelp for introducing me to this restaurant. My friend and I both ordered the braised lamb shank (with fresh seasonal vegetables, roasted red peppers)--it was so tender and flavorful, the meat just fell off the bone--best lamb shank I've had anywhere hands down! We also got the Cappellacci di Zucca to share as an appetizer (pasta stuffed with pumpkin in a burnt butter sauce with butternut squash, sage and pinenuts)--amazing, heavenly, melts in your mouth, tastes like you're eating a whole stick of butter--delicious! Excellent selection of wines, we ordered a fantastic bottle of Sangiovese. The tiramisu was classic and a great way to end the meal. Setting is cozy, comfortable, intimate. Service is friendly and attentive, they treat you like family. There are so many other things on their menu that I want to try like the pasta stuffed with lobster, seafood risotto, milk and honey ribs, etc (I could list the whole menu). Their "Family Style Monday" night special is a steal! The prix fixe menu includes 2 appetizers, 2 soup/salad, 3 entrees & dessert for $20.95 (some items excluded). They also have Tuesdays In Tuscany which includes Italian style tapas and live jazz. Sapori Trattoria has a new fan and I look forward to many future visits here, or at least until I eat my way through the entire menu.
