Still the best pizza I've ever had! Just went back for the 1st time since they re-opened and it was worth the wait. The three things that make Pequod's stand out to me are: 1) the carmelized crust, 2) the fact that they never skimp on the toppings, and 3) this pizza tastes just as good the next day.  The new renovations to the interior look great. Can't wait to go back!
