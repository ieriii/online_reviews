Finally! We've found a Thai place in Chicago that is really good. We were starting to think that the best Thai food in Illinois was in Champaign. This time we tried the mainstays (Lard Nar, Pad Thai, Panang Curry), but the more we order it, I believe we'll get more adventurous. Only problem (and a big one) is that they have a limited delivery area. I can't believe that neither the South Loop nor the Lincoln Square location will deliver to Old Town. Very strange. But when the food is this good, you gotta do what you gotta do.
