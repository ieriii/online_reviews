Believe the hype! This was my first stop, just a few hours after rolling into Chicago. I arrived a bit earlier than my dining companions, and an attractive hipster dude (seriously a dime a dozen, but if it makes my dining experience more enjoyable, who cares?!) seated me. I took in the ambiance and people-watched for the next five or ten minutes... lots of different types including people on dates, groups of friends and families. Ohh, and pretty good music playing too. The fellas arrived not too long after and we ordered. I had the vegan philly cheesesteak, one of my companions had the vegan sweet potato quesadilla, and the other had the vegetarian chicken caesar salad. I absolutely loved my meal, although the sweet potato fries weren't as phenomenal as I had been expecting (namely they were kind of cold). But the couple beers I had more than made up for it, and the cheesesteak was served hot, just as it should be. I haven't had anything else yet, so I can't really give testament to how good (or not good) any of it is, but I do know I enjoyed my initial visit here. Chicago Diner also has a constantly updated and rotating menu, which helps it maintain an interesting and fresh kind of feel.
