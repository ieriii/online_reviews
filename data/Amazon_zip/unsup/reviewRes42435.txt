Hands down the best deep dish and stuffed pizza in the city. The sauce is definitely what sets this Art of Pizza apart from the rest of the places in the city, the perfect consistency and level of spice.  Delivery has always been prompt resulting in a pizza that is still plenty warm. I always enjoy the free surprise 1-liter of soda they bring, makes for a good bet with friends: What will it be this time? Mountain Dew Code Red? Sierra Mist? Who knows!
