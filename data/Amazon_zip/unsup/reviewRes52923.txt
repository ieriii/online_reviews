Absolutely impeccable service. Our waiter held our order while I ran to the liquor store to pick up a six-pack. (NB: the closest place to buy beer is MW Food & Liquor at Milwaukee and Western). When I returned, the waiter brought a bucket of ice and opened our beers. He was very attentive, and his recommendation, the ox-tail special, was excellent. My date ordered the Media Noche sandwich, also excellent. The empanadas were okay. The chorizo was a little dry and the guava and cheese was too sweet. The ambience was informal but it was nice enough to bring a date. We were seated on the heated back patio at a table with oversized wicker chairs lined with pillows. A gas-powered fireplace nearby provided additional heat. The entire bill came to less than 30 dollars before tax and tip - really a steal for the quantity and quality of food. Very much looking forward to trying the Roscoe Village location, but for a more intimate dining experience I recommend you try this place out.
