I have been walking by this place since it replaced Feed The Beast and have been meaning to try it... finally did last weekend and was very pleased!  The hostess was friendly and kept us updated on our wait to sit down, the bartenders were friendly while we sat at the bar awaiting our table, and our waitress was friendly and just the right amount of attentive once we were seated. Great. Pretty good beer list with a lot of options, and I noticed that several beers at this place were cheaper than they typically are at other bars that serve them. Perhaps only 50 cents or a dollar, but hey, it's still a perk.  The fried cheese curds were amaaaaaaaaazing! I'm sure there exist better in Wisconsin, but these are officially the best I've had in Chicago. We polished off one serving and promptly ordered another.  The menu isn't full of variety, mainly burgers and sandwiches, but they have several vegetarian options mixed in and all four members of my group were very pleased with their orders.  I have only been here in the later evening hours, after 9pm, so I don't know what kind of crowd or wait times are expected for the dinner rush, but it wasn't an issue at all later on in the evening. Definitely worth checking out!
