India House is super tasty, but a little expensive. Entrees run close to $20, which, while good, is a bit much for Indian food. Dining in is great - service is really nice, plus they start the meal with naan bits + a tomato butter sauce. I really like their naan and chicken makhani, but everything I've tried has been really tasty. I'm definitely a fan, albeit a reluctant one since it's so expensive. I suggest nabbing Groupons whenever you can.
