I give it 3.5 stars (round down). Based on my date's reaction, I'd guess she would say four stars. We ordered the Banh Cuon (ravioli) as an appetizer. The ravioli was a little dry unless you make sure to put the sauce on it. Once the sauce was put on it was pretty good. For entrees we ordered Ga Xao Xa Ot (lemon grass chicken) and the Vit Quay (duck). The lemon grass chicken was a bit average to be honest, nothing really special. It was tasty though. The real gem in this was the mushrooms that were in with the chicken - they were divine. The duck was good, crunchy skin, moist meat, and tasty sauce. Overall though the appetizer and chicken which were both recommended to us dragged the weighting down from the duck, which was excellent. Wine list was more expensive than it should have been. I purchase several of the wines on the list regularly and the markup was higher than I would have considered normal (eg two wines which I pay 16 - 18 a bottle were selling for 45 - 52 a bottle, where I would have expected 30 - 40)
