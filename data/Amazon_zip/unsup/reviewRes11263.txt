Oh I love this place. Totally creative types of breakfasts and its not for the faint of heart in the calorie department. The only problem is the wait, but at least there are plenty of places in the area to hang out. Take your out of town friends there and check out the Chocolate Tower French Toast or the Oreo pancakes. Yum.
