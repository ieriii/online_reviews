I love love LOVE Coast. They are super reasonably priced, they are fairly convenient in terms of parking and trendy neighborhood atmosphere, and they are BYOB. 1 bottle per 2 people, however we managed to smuggle in 6 for a group of 6 and the waitress didn't even filp out. Yes I said it, one bottle per person. Awesome! Unfortunately I am allergic to avocado. Most sushi places look at me like i'm insane when I say skip the avocado..."WHAA You don't want avocado?!?! We can't do that?" Ummmm excuse me, if you don't skip the avocado I will die, end of discussion just DO IT! Here at Coast, they wrote it in big bold letters ALLERGY, sure no problem! Now that's what I like to hear. Some reviewers will remark "This place is not real sushi." Whatever, it's always packed in here so they must be doing something right. I was a little irritated when we tried to drop in one Friday night and they said it would be up to a 2 hour wait....ha....no thanks. But I guess that is a lesson learned in planning ahead!
