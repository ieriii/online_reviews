First try: we waited for 20 minutes to be seated and another 35 before we hot our good. The food was eggsallent! We would recommend, come in the afternoon for a shorter wait. Second try: We came back for a second time on our trip, we only waited about 10 minutes to be seated and under 10 minutes for our food. This place is definitely come back to.
