Yum! Q is a refreshing take on comfort food with the trendiness of the Gold Coast. I would go back just for the corn bread! Don't forget to ask about their brunch specials- I had the chicken eggs benedict and it was delicious! The outdoor seating is adorable, it feels like a lake house porch. As a bonus they bring out chips and pickels for the table! The reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because their soda is served in 8 oz non-refillable bottles. This isn't Europe- when I order a soda I expect free refills and I definitely don't expect to pay $3 for EIGHT ounces of diet coke. Stick with an alcoholic drink or the iced tea.
