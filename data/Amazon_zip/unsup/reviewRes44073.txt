I had the pleasure to dine at the Kinzie Chophouse while on business. It started with friendly service from the host Frannie. Then the service from George was unbelievable. I had their $20 spring menu, let me tell you the entree was bigger than most "fine dining". The fillet medallions were soft and flavorful. The scallops were huge and fresh. The wine list was plentiful and had something for each menu item. Anytime I go to Chicago I will make it a point to search out the Kinzie Chophouse.
