I've been eating Indie since 2005 and have never had a problem with delivery. It usually arrives within 20 minutes and not the quoted 45 to an hour. It's never been cold. The presentation is beautiful, (when dining-in). They are a very friendly but the servers need to work on "timing". Last visit I finished my meal before my partners dish even arrived and nothing was comped. Indie, I love you and your food but the customer service seems to be questionable lately.
