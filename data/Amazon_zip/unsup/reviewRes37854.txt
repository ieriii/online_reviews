The second that people found I was moving to Chicago they told me that I had to eat a deep dish pizza as my first meal, and most likely not my last meal. This place popped up as one of THE places to go and without fail I went with some family members. Hey your going to have one of those pizzas you must bring backup! Our waitress was very nice and informative that the pizzas take a while to bake so if we were getting one we should put it in now - and we did! We ordered some glasses or wine and salads to tide us over for the ultimate in Chicago dining. After a long day of moving - we were ready to eat anything! When the pizza arrived it did not disappoint. It was truly an experience in my mouth - and so much fun for the family. It's something about a gathering of family around a table that just reminds me of being a kid on pizza night. We devoured the whole thing and left happy.
