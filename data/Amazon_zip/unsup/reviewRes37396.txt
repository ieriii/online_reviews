Is 40 GAZILLION a real number? Cause I'm pretty sure they have that many beers on tap.  I was here for just a pint, but I could have easily spent my entire day here. Chill atmosphere, with a beer selection fit for a beer queen. A friend and I popped in only 25 minutes after they opened on a sunday and it was packed. Standing room only. My only question is why did I have to wait til 4 on a sunday for a freaking fantastic beer? My guess is that I will be rating this a 5 once i get to sit down. The 4 is for the selection of american craft and imported beers and cool people to chill around with.
