The owners are trying to market towards the Wicker Park/Bucktown crowd with a lax 'tude but also the sporty frat guys.Somehow it works and everyone gets along. Speaking of getting along-the pizza combined with reasonably priced craft beers goes together wonderfully. Not your "Chicago style" pizza joint-thank god. I like the idea of having 3 styles of basic pizza that you can add ingredients to. Its like pizza with pizzazz!
