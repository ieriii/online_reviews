I like this place. Nothing too fancy, but very reasonably priced and something for everyone. Went here for a bachelorrette dinner. There are definitely times I passed by this restaurant on my way to another and wish I had went to Grand Lux over the bad restaurants I tried out elsewhere. You won't have a bad time here.
