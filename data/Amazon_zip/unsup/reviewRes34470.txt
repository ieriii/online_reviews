I've been coming here for brunch recently and finally decided to write a review. I like the open kitchen and the friendly atmosphere. The waitstaff was friendly and sometimes a little non-attentive. The food is a solid 4, but the ambiance with the crowd is what makes the difference. If like like a fast busy place, this is your bet.
