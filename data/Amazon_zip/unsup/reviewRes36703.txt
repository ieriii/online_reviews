I went to this place last Sunday and the service was absolutely horrible. They tried to pack too many people in to the restaurant and so nearly half of the place had a 15 degree draft coming in every two minutes as the door would open and close. Additionally, since they put tables on top of the waiting area the servers trip over you as they try to bring food to the tables. I admit the food is good but it is a horrible experience in the winter if they sit you in the front half of the restaurant. I wish we would have waited the extra 30 minutes to find a table in the back half.
