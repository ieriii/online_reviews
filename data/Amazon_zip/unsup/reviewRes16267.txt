If you love guacamole as much as I do, you should definitely try this place. It's very colorful and spacious, and the salsa music is fun to listen to. It caters more to the meat eaters, but there are a few vegetarian options, as well as a few seafood items. The ceviche is great, as are the empanadas. The desserts are very tasty, too! I found the service to be up to par, but my boyfriend used to work here, so the times I've gone have been with him, so maybe that helped. I would recommend giving it a try. I hear the skirt steak is delicious.
