I don't go as regularly but I definitely recommend this place whenever I can. It's casual, the food is fresh and the crowd is always upbeat. Great customer service even when they are obviously running around busy and the the whole place is packed. Some favorites are the tostones with mojo, the simple palmito salad and the very juicy steak sandwich.
