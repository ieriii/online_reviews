I had dinner here last week at the bar. I ordered the Gage Burger. It was really good. A little messy but that is not a bad thing when it comes to a burger. The fries were great too. Only a couple disappointments, the mustard which is not a big deal and the bartender which is a big deal. He just seemed too cocky. A couple tourists walked up and they said they wanted a whiskey, yea it's vague if you stock a lot of different whiskeys but he could have been more helpful and suggestive. He was like come on guy you gotta be more specific. I'm not going to totally throw him under the bus, he did warm up to them as the conversation went on but I just felt his first impression was abrasive. I wouldn't expect that from a Mich. ave high end establishment. Would I go back? Maybe if I was in the area, the food was really good just the atmosphere and service wasn't my speed.
