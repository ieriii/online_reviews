Went on a Monday night for my bday and it was still fairly packed. My friend and I both went for vegetarian pizzas and they were delish. The light crispy crust just wouldn't seem right with big chunks of meat glommed on to it... Anyhoo, the food was delish, i can't wait to go back. The server we had was very nice, but could have been a little more attentive. Then again, it was packed. Come here for a great alternative to Chicago's deep-dish, heart-attack inducing pizza tradition...
