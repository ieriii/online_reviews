Came here for a late lunch. Had the lunch combo (pork chop curry and California rolls) and unagi nigiri. Dining companion had the combo (ginger salmon and Spicy Tuna rolls) and salmon nigiri. Curry should have been spicier and the unagi was a little too sweet, but the food was otherwise quite good. Companion enjoyed the Spicy Tuna rolls very much. Service was attentive, and our waters were regularly replenished. A little on the pricey side but it is Chicago, after all. RECOMMENDED.
