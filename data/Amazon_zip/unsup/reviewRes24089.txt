met here with my fellow "teach in china" friends for a mini reunion. we were all very excited to order tsingtao and our favorite szechuan dishes. since we all lived it china, we've tried our fare share of various regional chinese foods and i think it's fare to say lao sze chuan has some of the most authentic szechuan cuisine in chicago. the gam bien dou jiao (fried chili green beans), cu liu tu dou si (potato strings in garlic vinegar),yu xiang rou si (slices of pork in a sweet sauce), and gong bao ji ding (kung pao chicken) were all very tasty :) service was awesome. the only reason i gave it 4/5 is because i think it's a tad overpriced butttt i'm still excited to go back and try other dishes!
