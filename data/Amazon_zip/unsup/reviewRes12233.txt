My roommie and I stopped by here to grub on some much raved about honey jalapeno pork chops. Only one problem. Server: "We're out of our famous honey jalapeno pork chops tonight." Me: "Bummer! Well, that's okay, I hear the Almond Crusted Halibut is a great dish, so I'll go ahead and try that." Server: "Ohhhh....weelllll.....we're out of the Halibut, too." Yeah. My heart broke. Twice. However, we did attempt to salvage the evening: 1) Bacon-Wrapped Dates: (4 stars) 4 small pieces bursting with that heavenly sweet and salty flavor 2) Ropa Vieja: (3 stars) Love the side of black beans. The flank steak was very tender but unfortunately somewhat more on the bland side. 3) Comal with Chicken: (4 stars) Darn tasty. Several chunks of seasoned chicken admixed with corn, onions, zuchini......enough for 2 people. 4) Flan: (3 stars) Not memorable. Just okay. 5) Triple Layered Chocolate Cake: (4 stars) Very rich. It tasted as if there was a higher ratio of cocoa than sugar. 6) Strawberry Margarita: (3 stars) Average. Service was friendly but a bit slow. It took 15 minutes to get our appetizer order and another 30 minutes after that to get our entrees. We were so friggin hungry! It gave us plenty of time to eat all the bread though. Speaking of which, that butter spread (mixed with honey and various peppers) was absolutely heavenly! Overall, A-OK. Maybe next time they'll actually have some of those supposedly delicious pork chops. I can always hope.
