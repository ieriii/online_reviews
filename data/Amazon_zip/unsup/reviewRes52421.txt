Beware!!!! If you decide to eat here you are taking a HUGE gamble. We made a birthday reservation for a Wednesday night and everything was tasting great and most of the wait staff was attentive. About 3/4 of the way through the meal I started to feel very strange. I sat there and drank water for a little while to settle my stomach. My boyfriend then ordered his birthday dessert and I couldn't even sit there to watch him enjoy it. Very shortly after making it to their bathroom I became violently ill. I couln't even return to our table and had to cancel our plans for the rest of the evening. I attempted to contact the restaurant the next day to tell them what happened with no response. I waited a few days and contacted them again finally receiving a response in which they said it was basically impossible. They never offered a refund only another opportunity to get sick again with one free meal. No thanks. I've already paid $106 to get food poisoning once. So try this place at your own risk.
