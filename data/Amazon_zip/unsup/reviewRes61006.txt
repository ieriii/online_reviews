This place is great. One of the first bars in the city to show the UFC fights. Being a big fan of the UFC brought me in and the service and food kept me coming back. Gets real crowded before the fights so you have to get there an hour early if you want a seat. Love it though. I think about the skirt steak sandwhich all day.
