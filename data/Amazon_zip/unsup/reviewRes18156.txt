Caro Mio was recommended to us and we have had this place on the list for a while. So we went early on a Saturday and the place is quite welcoming with attentive service. I wish Yelp would let me rank here 2.5 stars. We wanted very much to like this place but the pastas really disappointed us. Perhaps our expectations were too high. If you like American-Italian with LOADS of sauce, then this is for you. The servings are indeed generous and each pasta would cater for two people. I commend the generosity of the servings. However this is not really our thing - we are after flavor. We had the polenta in tomato sauce which was ok, not really grilled enough for my tastes to bring the flavor out in the polenta and it was masked by the red sauce a fair bit. The bruschetta with mozz was fairly good - very generous servings, with the tomato finely cut and nicely marinated with oil and herbs. This was the nicest thing we ate. For entrees we got the lobster ravioli in cream sauce w/ sundried tomatoes and the cavatelli con salisiccia, with homemade sausage. Overall the pastas were very one note with tons of sauce and not much variety. The lobster ravioli overall was quite salty and the sauce just overpowered it to the point where it was like eating a bowl of cream. The cavatelli didn't really have much sausage to it, and was also super creamy. We'll probably give this place another go in a while as a lot of people like it very much and maybe we got a bit unlucky.
