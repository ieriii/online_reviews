It's an ok chubby dog compressed in a little cardboard box, buried with all your fries and some unexpected green tomatoes on top, so that you have to eat most of the fries before even trying to bite the red hot. The giant Tarzan-Jane dogs on the roof and the whole 1950's drive-in, order-board, car-hop, window-tray experience is what makes this place special. If I owned a convertible souped-up hot rod, I'd spend entire summers here in Happy Days glory. But I don't.
