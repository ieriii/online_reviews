They are still consistent with the quality of their food. I think the portion might have gotten a little bit smaller because I used to have a hard time finishing their El Tico with ribeye... or maybe I've become more of a glutton. still BYOB, still good food, still a bit of a wait, still only 1 co-ed bathroom... but I like consistency.
