Yes, the wait SUCKS, but there was a guy there selling ice cream! The duck fat fries were nothing special to me, in fact I'm not sure I was too impressed with them. The hot dogs were AWESOME. However, I wouldn't stand in that kind of line for one again. It was fun to try and nice to be able to say I did it. So, that said, I think it's definitely worth your time to try it out!
