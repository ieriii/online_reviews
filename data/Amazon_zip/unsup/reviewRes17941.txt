Went there for a birthday dinner with a group of 15.  We had 8:30 reservations, and probably got seated around 9:00.  That wouldn't have been bad, except there is nowhere to wait, so we all stood outside.  They do not have a bar area. This is a BYOB restaurant with no corkage fee - huge bonus! The portions are huge and prices reasonable. I think everyone in the group enjoyed the food. I had the special rigatoni of the night and the sauce was amazing. They do have gluten free options. Menu is huge.  The place is small-ish and very loud. They do not have any music playing at all, which was strange.  I would absolutely go back.
