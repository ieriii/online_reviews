Let's see, food attractively served and its tasty. I had an "authentic Costa Rican breakfast" named Gallo Pinto. I figure that I'll probably not see Costa Rica in the near future, so Costa Rican breakfast sounded good. It was attractive, well priced, and tasty. Come to have some fun and tasty food. Bring your kids, bring your spouse, bring a friend. You'll enjoy it. And its affordable and parking seemed available on a Saturday at noon.
