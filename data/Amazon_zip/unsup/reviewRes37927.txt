What do you get when you take a bunch of monks, lock them in a monastery for a few hundred years, tell them they can't ever have sex, but that they CAN drink beer? You get the greatest beer, EVER MADE. If you love beer, you really should love Belgian beer and the Hopleaf has one of the widest ranges of belgian beers in the city. What makes Hopleaf exceptional though is the food: the black forest ham sandwich with gruyere cheese and sweet cole slaw has to be one of the best grilled sandwiches I have ever eaten. On the negative side, this place is terribly noisy for eating, especially if everyone has been drinking aforementioned belgian beer and the last time we were here, we waited for maybe 2 hours for a table. Still, I will definitely be back because I can't stop thinking about that sandwich...
