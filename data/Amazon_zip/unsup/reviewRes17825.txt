I really dig this place! Didn't expect to click with 8 different types of ice, but I guess that it suits my Southern sensibility- and my drink wasn't watered down! I think that The Violet Hour is swank, yet unpretentious. The bartenders were lovely and gracious, and chatted us up, creating a new cocktail for us, and arguing about how best to make a mojito-  I hate the things, but Michael made me the first one that I actually enjoyed. The drinks were very good, and I didn't mind the $11 price tag. I can't wait to go back, and I find myself wishing that this could be my neighborhood bar- I live elsewhere in Chicago, obviously. So the Violet Hour will be a special place to enjoy sometimes...
