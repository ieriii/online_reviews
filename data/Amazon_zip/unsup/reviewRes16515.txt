I had dinner here as a member of a group from work on Wednesday of last week. We had a private room and eight of us were there. The semi-private room was nice because the curtains let you see the rest of the room and keep it from feeling close, while it still feels as though you are in a more intimate setting. We presented the service staff with a challenge that they seem adroit in handling: a broad range of arrival times. Three or four people arrived first around 5:30, I got there a little after 6:00, another joined at nearly 7:00 and the eighth (who was arriving from the airport and was not expected given the need for last-minute travel) arrived sometime between 7:00 and 8:00. The staff was attentive the whole time, bringing fresh hors d'oeuvre happily around and never making us feel hurried. The thin-cut steak that was offered as one of our two entree options was excellent, as were the hors d'oeuvre. I would recommend Carnivale for a celebratory dinner like we were having, but not one where negotiations or deliberation would be involved, as the room was not private enough for that.
