Wow... Is the only word I heard from my boyfriends mouth throughout the entire meal. He was in heaven with all the amazing meats. His favorite cut was the Prime Rib. For not being much of a meat eater I really enjoyed myself also. Their house specialty meat was my favorite, the Beef Picahha. Their salad bar was also very satisfying with everything from veggie sushi rolls to Mediterranean marinaded artichoke hearts. This was not our favorite Churrascaria (Zed 451) but I would have no issue going back.
