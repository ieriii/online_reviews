Thankful I went on a Thursday around 5:30 because I heard the wait is pretty long. We ordered a lot of starches, namely, the gnocchi, cornbread and balsamic on toast. All 3 were delicious, especially the cornbread a mixture of salty and sweet. The portions are quite small especially considering the price. The drinks are comparable to Violet Hour, minus the wait. Their beer menu is extensive with many off the beaten track labels but I chose to go with a Whiskey with ginger infused concoction instead and enjoyed it. The decor is nothing extraordinary, it's what you would expect for a high end Chicago bar and lounge, although going to the bathroom is pretty cute with signs telling you there are still miles to go down the dark hallway before you reach the final designation. People who had too much to drink and need to puke probably won't make it.
