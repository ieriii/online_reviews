I thank the god of living locations that I don't live in Chicago. Otherwise I would probably weigh about 500 lbs thanks to Bongo Room. I found this place on yelp and decided to head on that way. We got there before it opened and we had to make a line to go in... this place is serious about their breakfast. FOOD: AWE-SOME. I had the sweet-potato bean burrito with "hash-browns". the burrito was a welcome surprise every time i bit into it... is this sweet? is this salty? was that a piece of unicorn meat? is this spicy? simply amazing. and then..... we decided to order the Red Velvet Pancakes since everyone mentioned them on yelp. I don't even like pancakes.. but these have ruined my life. Every day I wake up and eat my cereal with non-fat yogurt and it just makes me sad that I have to settle for this when the gods of breakfast have created such a delicious set of pancakes. The only think I do not recommend is the Orange Juice. SERVICE: They seem experienced to move people along.. not excellent but did the deed
