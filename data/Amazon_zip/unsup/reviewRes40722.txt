Their steak tacos were sooooo DELICIOUS! They were perfectly marinated and showered with fresh onions and cilantro....leave the lettuce and tomato out, please. The green salsa was delightfully spicy and contributed to a wonderful explosion of flavors as I chewed away into bliss. Mexican husband agreed, and he definitely knows good Mexican food. He had the steak burrito and my mom had the milanesa torta (breaded steak)....thumbs up from the both of them. The horchata was delicious too....thick, creamy, and sweet, just how I like it! Service was friendly and I will definitely return!
