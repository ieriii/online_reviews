Not too impressed. While they advertise one of Chicago's largest selection of seafood, by 7:45 PM on a Saturday night, over 50% of the menu was "sold-out"! Waiter returned 15 minutes after ordering to let us know that two of our five selections were no longer available. Started with extra large shrimp that were way over cooked, served with a lack luster garlic butter (made with pre-chopped garlic) . All 5 of our fish filet entree portions are very large, but had no flavor whatsoever ( bigger is not always, better!) Very disappointing. Won't go back.
