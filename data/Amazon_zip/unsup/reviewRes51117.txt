My first time having Low Country cuisine and was very pleased. I've had plenty of cajun/creole, but not low country and this place kicks Heaven on Seven's butt anytime. Plus I thought the beignets were better than Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. So much to choose from and try that I will definately be back to try out something else. This time I have the Eggs New Orleans and a aperole mimosa. The co-owner Mark was very friendly and so was our server.
