I absolutely love Indie Cafe. In my opinion, it is the best place to get sushi and thai in the neighborhood, and maybe some of the best thai in the city. My absolute favorite is the red curry. I am a huge red curry fan and try it everywhere I go. At Indie Cafe, it is the perfect balance of creamy, thick, and spicy, with yummy vegetables and delicious meat. The sushi rolls are all very good. This is my go-to place for takeout, and a casual meal out. Pleasant atmosphere and friendly staff.
