Alright, I've stayed here a few times. Here is what's going on at this swank joint on the Mag Mile: I'm going to say I do NOT recommend making this reservation via Priceline or Travelocity or a site of the type. You will end up getting their "Studio" room which isn't really given in ANY of the room descriptions (as it different GREATLY from the regular one rooms that others will get. I learned this my first time staying. Needless to say, I was not happy that I wasn't getting the room type I had asked for. I spoke with their CS Rep online and wasn't given any remedy to make it right. Worst customer service call experience I ever had. Finally, the hotel manager offered a consolation to the misunderstanding. Before you book, also, make sure you save up for their Guest Rewards Programn, which entitles you to several freebies. The rooms are SWANKY! Very nice indeed. Modern furniture and the bed will make you just want to sink in it and never get up. Heck, you even get ROBES! The restaurant they have there is nice. Nice decor, decent food....but pricey. But hey, let's face it, if you're staying here, you're obviously not broke. Hotel staff is generally very helpful in anything you need, so don't be afraid to ask them. I had all my requests taken care of. It's prime location for all your shopping needs. My SO (Significant Other) was pleased with the location and was poised to make this spot for our stay as it is so close to so many retail stores. Downers about this place? The access to the lobby and elevators. They are on the 2nd floor which requires an elevator to get to. It's weird. Also, I'd like better customer service. Mine wasn't bad....but I've had better. I'm paying good money for this hotel so I'd expect excellent customer service.
