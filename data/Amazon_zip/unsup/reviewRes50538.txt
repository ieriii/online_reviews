5 stars for brunch for sure. I have a hard time not ordering black bean cakes (with the red pepper sauce!) and cheese grits e-ver-y single time I come here. So delicious. The breakfast burrito is always a tasty choice too, as are the corn cakes with eggs over easy if you are super hungry. For the most part, the service here is great. I've had waiters who remember my order (maybe because I come in so often!), but I've also had the seriously lame experience of having a hostess LOCK THE DOOR as I approached it several minutes before closing time. Ouch! I've had dinner here once, and it was good but seemed more expensive and not quite up to my Wishbone brunch standards. I'll stick to my eggs, coffee and juice for weekend breakfast decadence.
