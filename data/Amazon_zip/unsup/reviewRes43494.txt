We order from Art of Pizza about once a week. The pizza is consistently good and delivery usually takes 45 min to an hour, pretty standard for the city especially since we live on the north end of their delivery area. However, last night was a completely different story, we ordered last night at 6:30pm and did not receive our pizza until almost 9:00pm. When we called at 8:15 to see where our pizza was, we were told its out and should be there any minute, no apology, no offer of a discount, and it still took 45 minutes longer for the pizza to be delivered luke warm. A real disappointment from a good pizza place, I think we are going to take some time off from Art of Pizza.
