Lovely Tapas Bar right in the heart of Chicago. The interior is warm and inviting, and the service the night I went was very good. The food is quality as well, crispy and flavorful flatbreads, tasty olives, cured salami, and pork chopped right from a roasted pig. I highly recommend. I recommend checking the place out on a Sunday as there will be lots of street parking. A good way to start the week.
