I love the Bongo Room with all of its ridiculousness. Sometimes you want some simple pancakes. Sometimes you want pancakes drenched in candy and cookies and chocolate and crazy sauce. That's when you go to the Bongo Room. The fun part is going different times of the year to see what concoction they have on the menu this time. I've always found them to be good, and the best plan if you are with a few friends is to order ONE pancake of the types you want to try, and then you all share. Getting a full stack of three is just waaaaaay too much to eat on your own. I like this Wicker Park location because it is laid back and not obnoxious. As always, it's best to go on a weekday if you can, or try to hit the off hours on the weekends because there will be one helluva wait.
