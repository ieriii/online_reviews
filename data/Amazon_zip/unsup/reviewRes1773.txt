As I rounded the corner to hot dougs, I was worried because I saw people outside the door. I drove around more and saw that the line continued. With more driving, I realized the line was more than a freaking hundred feet long. It was 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, mind you. Fast forward an hour and a half later, its 3:00 and I'm starving. We finally get to the front counter to order. Wtf, 1 person taking orders? I peeked in the back and 3 guys were cooking. Coming from 7 years at in n out burger, I know the Snyders would be turning in their graves at such inefficiency. It seems like the large crowd is slowly allowed to filter into the restaurant via 1 cash register. Think a la 300, where the spartans held off the Persians by using the narrow terrain. So after an hour and a half of waiting I ordered an order of duck grease fries, cheese fries, a corn dog, and regular hot dog. After so much hype, sad to say it wasn't the best hot dog and fries I've ever tasted. It was OK. Even if I had waited for only 10 minutes, I still would think it was only OK. If I were to rate the items separately out of 5 stars: Corndog: 4 Hotdog: 3 Cheesefries: 5 Duck fries: 4
