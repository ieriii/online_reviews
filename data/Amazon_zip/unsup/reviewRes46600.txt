Lettuce Entertain You just never disappoints. I ordered the burger and it is on a par with the better steakhouse burgers...and actually better than the burger at Gibson's. The only minor flaw is that the buns are not up to the task of containing what seems to be around a half pound patty -- the bottom of the bun was simply not up to the task of holding the burger securely, even when cutting it in half. For a burger that good, invest in some premium, hearty buns! Also, the cottage fries were soggy. But minor complaints. One of the best burgers I've had in a very long time!
