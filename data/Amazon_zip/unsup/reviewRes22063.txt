Everyone and their mother thinks of Greek Islands when they think Greektown dining. I'm not quite sure if it is the epic recreation of outdoor Grecian alleyways through out the restaurant or the fact that the staff is attentive and mostly Greek born. I personally think that this place is over rated. I feel that the prices are higher than I would like to pay but I suppose you should expect paying them because it's a tourist trap.  I recommend the avgalemono and make sure they keep that tasty bread coming!
