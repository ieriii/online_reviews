I live right around the corner from Meli and it is by far my favorite breakfast spot. I know that I have to get there before 9am to guarantee an immediate table, but its well worth getting up a little earlier on a Saturday or Sunday morning. If you can't make it before then, it is still well worth the wait.  I've been to Meli about 10 times and I haven't had a bad meal yet. For a breakfast menu, there are so many diverse options. Want to gorge yourself? Get the red velvet or donut pancakes. Want a well balance meal? Get the skillets. Eat light? Get some eggs and toast. No matter what you eat for breakfast, you will be more than satisfied. Not only is the food outstanding, but the coffee and juices are both top-notch. I love the variety of fresh juices to help cure my hangover.  Well, I now know where I'm eating breakfast Saturday morning. See you there.
