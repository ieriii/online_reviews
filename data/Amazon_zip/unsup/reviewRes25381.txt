Was this really Catalan and not some Balearic foam party? The blaring techno and cougars made me feel like I was in Ibiza. Not only was the atmosphere weird and the loud music made it difficult to carry on a conversation, Iron Chef Jose Garces' interpretation of tapas really disappointed me. At least they have Estrella Damm, even though it's like $8 a bottle when you can get this in Spain for 2 euros. Here's the run-down: Chef's selection of three cheeses - Good selection of cheese and nice fruit compote pairings. Serrano ham and fig salad - Good, they definitely don't skimp on the jamon! Tortilla - Nice and fluffy, but a little overkill with the onions. Croquetas - We ordered the serrano ham ones and EW. The inside tasted like cheap supermarket tomato sauce and was all oozy. Coca de cepes - Consistency of the flatbread wasn't right. Espinicas - Don't plan on kissing anyone for a few days. I smelled the garlic in this dish before it was on our table. Patas bravas - I thought this was going to be the traditional comfort food, but it was a pretentious version of tater tots overloaded with the paprika sauce. Ew. One of the specials was the tuna wrapped in serrano ham and this was good. Dessert: Chocolate croquetas - Much better than their dinner counterparts. Almond ice cream - Mmmmm. Pretty sure Iberico is a better spot for tapas in the neighborhood...
