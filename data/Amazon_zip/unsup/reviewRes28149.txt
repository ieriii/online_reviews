Don't believe the hype. Tried the thin crust...where's the sauce? And so flavorless, forget about complex flavors I couldn't even taste salt. In their defense I got a mushroom slice and there were a ton of mushrooms, but that's it. I guess I have to try the deep dish to see what's the big deal, but for now red baron would be better than pequod's thin crust.
