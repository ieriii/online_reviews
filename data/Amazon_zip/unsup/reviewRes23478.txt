I only order the fried rice and string beans because all of the other stuff on the menu is a hit or miss, and I'm tired of striking out. I had really bad service once wherein I ordered garlic chicken with bone, as it stated on the menu. It came chopped up like nuggets and boneless. I complained to manager and they said it was a typo. Well that's great! I ordered something I didn't want and it didn't even taste good. That was definitely a miss. The service was also terrible. They were somewhat busy, but took 15 mins to get my check, sent me wrong order, brought out my friend's meal 10 minutes before my meal, and the servers barely speak English there! If you go there do try the fried rice it's the best in Chinatown.
