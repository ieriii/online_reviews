Hot Doug's is pretty good, although it's super annoying that they're not open more. If I had such a successful business, though, I'd probably not want to work often either. It's also not really in an area that'd get much nightly passer's by. I really appreciated the cognac infused pheasant dog. Wow. I can't go without snagging one of the Italian sausages (Luca Brasi, I think it's called).  This place is a must for chubby visitors. :)
