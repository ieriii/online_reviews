Just returned from Brazazz. Compared to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil, Brazazz comes in a distant third. Service was so-so, not much attention was paid to us until it was time to turn the table. Salad bar was standard for this type of restaurant. Texas de Brazil's salad bar is much better, but you are not there to eat salad. They seemed to bring the cheaper cuts of meat - Chicken and Sausages, early and often. We had to ask for beef. The filet was well done and dry. Our waiter started hovering around us at the 1:30 mark as if they had another reservation they needed to seat. For the money, Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil offers a better dining experience.
