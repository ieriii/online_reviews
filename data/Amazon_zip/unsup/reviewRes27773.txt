"Well, at least the guacamole was good" The statement above sums up my $90 dining experience at Frontera last weekend. To say I'm mad is the understatement of the year. The reason? I have almost every episode of 'Mexico: One plate at a time' recorded on my DVR. I even own a Bayless cook book and look to him for inspiration in that one day I hope to find myself in a restaurant kitchen. So what went wrong? Well, the appetizers were good. The guac was creamy and done very well but none of the other items impressed in a way that I was expecting. Dinner was cold. My thinly sliced skirt steak was cold, undercooked (apparently medium means still moving), flavorless, and served with a side of spicy salsa. I kept thinking I should have just gone with the tacos. Looking to find something enjoyable, I ordered dessert and a mexican hot chocolate. This only made things worse as I didn't finish either. Our 2 month long reservation started as a trip to heaven and left us with a trip to hell. I won't be back until this place learns to raise their standards to a level of what once was. My recommendation would be to hit the bar for a few appetizers and a margarita. You really can't go wrong there.
