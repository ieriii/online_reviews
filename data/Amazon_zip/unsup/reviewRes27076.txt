This is probably the worst pizza I've had in Chicago-- though I've had much worse in recent memory during a day's jaunt over to Indiana that made me shudder to think about living outside a city every again. Although, perhaps I'm being harsh on Pequod's, because the problem here was one of unmet expectations. We ordered a thin crust pizza, and the waitress followed up with "Do you want any cheesy garlic breadsticks?". Caught off guard, we said "Sure, ok," expecting something along the lines of a small breadbasket. We were instead served two long planks of garlic bread, bubbling with cheese, and marinara sauce. And everything was excellent-- good quality cheese, and the sauce! Perfection! So, naturally, we were excited to see what our actual pizza would be like... ...and this is where Pequod's really faltered. The pizza appeared to have nothing in common with our fantastic appetizer-- poorer quality dough, cheese, and appallingly bad sauce. Also, we ordered our pizza with bell peppers, which had been over-cooked-- that's become a pet peeve since that fated Indiana pizza *shudders*, and it could have been worse, but I really prefer them crisp. Again, it wasn't terrible, it just suffered from a lack of melding of the flavors, as though the sauce wasn't in tune with the cheese, which wasn't in tune with anything else. Considering they seem to know what they're doing in the "bread + cheese + sauce" department, as evidenced by our appetizer, it must be just sheer perversity that leads them to make such poor quality pizza. We will not be back, cheesy garlic bread notwithstanding.
