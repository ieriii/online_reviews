I don't get what all the hoopla is about. Davanti Enoteca is okay. It's pretty cheap, and the food isn't bad, but it is pretty blah. The service was good and the interior of the place has a nice, old, wooden feeling. Their alcohol was confusing to us. We all thought it was BYOB, but instead you can buy alcohol from them and drink it there, as if there's a separate wine shop and restaurant (maybe it's some kind of liquor license work around). On to the food. We had the crisp pork belly to start, and, you know, it tasted like pork belly. Of course it's pretty good, it's pure fat. We also had the truffle egg toast which was strange. Again, not good or bad (the theme of the night I suppose), just strangely textured with any hint of truffle flavor absent from the dish. Our dishes encompassed the world of pizzas to pastas. The pastas were all lacking a decent amount of meat, especially the rigatoni with sausage. I don't regret stopping in at Davanti, but I also don't think I'll be coming back.
