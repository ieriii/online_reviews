The pros: food was good, decor was nice and has parking. The cons: price was totally unreasonable, $14 for a breakfast burrito? The Bongo Room has one that is equally as good for $6 less, in a trendier neighborhood. I am concerned that this area of Edgwater/Rogers Park won't be able to support the prices, not sure why they need to charge the prices that they do?
