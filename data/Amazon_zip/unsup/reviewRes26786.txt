This was my first culinary stop in Chicago. Despite arriving at an already-packed dining room, we were promptly seated. The extensive lunch menu made it quite difficult to decide on what to eat. My friend and I decided to share the Old School Frontera Trio appetizer of taquitos, quesadillas, and ceviche tostadas. All three items were delicious and I couldn't wait till my entre is served. When my duck breast taco finally arrived, I couldn't wait to dig in. The good part of the entre is that I got warm tortilla and I can build my own taco. However, the highlight of the dish - the duck breast - lacked flavor complexity and was somewhat chewy. In terms of service, I found it difficult to get the attention of the servers while seated next to the wall and a room partition. Maybe it was a busy day or maybe it was the partition, I was disappointed about the lukewarm service that we received.
