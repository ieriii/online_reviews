I don't believe I've been this wonderfully packed with meat in a long time. I'll keep this review brief, because all the major points have been touched on by previous reviews: -The Combination plates are marvelous - I ordered the skirt steak and baby octopus. The steak was incredible, and the octopus was chewy without being rubbery, which is always a fear. It was delicious. Having tried some of the chicken from my date's similar combination plate, their chicken was also very tasty. Not a fan of yucca. No matter though, as I didn't have much room left for it anyway. -I want to put their chimichurri on everything. -The empanada combination plate was great, but we were both in agreement that the potato and beef were the best of the three. -Prices were very fair for the quality and quantity of food. -Service was super quick and very attentive. -Come hungry. Sitting by the kitchen gave me a constant view of mammoth piles of steaming meats of various types. I will have to try this someday - preferably with several other people. I barely made it out of the combination plate with no leftovers. The place was pretty busy on a Sunday night, but without reservations, my date and I didn't have trouble getting a seat at all. Best to call ahead, especially for groups.
