A friend of mine happened to be in the area, so I decided on this place as I know he loves this type of food. Everything we had was delicious.. From the shrimp and grits, pork shoulder sandwich, chicken n dumplings, to the catfish and grits, everyone loved their dish.  I love that this place is in Andersonville and adds a different flavor to what is offered in the area. From what I've heard the breakfast/brunch is fantastic. Will have to try it soon!!!
