went here over restaurant week and forgot to review this place! because it was restaurant week, it was packed...and they had the price fixed menu. however, i have to say, we were impressed. it took a while to get to our table despite our reservation (minus half star) but the booths were dimly lit and super romantic (too bad i wasnt w/the bf haha). definitely an amazing place to go for a special date. the food? delicious. pretty similar to the melting pot menu wise, but i felt the food was of higher quality. minus another half star because i think restaurant week is the only time i could afford this place.... could be fun and affordable for just apps (cheese/fruit/etc) & dessert, though... gejas gets a thumbs up :)
