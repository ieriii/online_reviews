I was absolutely SO disappointed in my experience. I have been a fan of Rick Bayless for years, and was thrilled to see him win Top Chef Masters, not only for his clear mastery and devotion to Mexican cooking, but because he's philanthropic, committed to local and sustainable foods, and seems like such a nice guy. My friend who was visiting from out of town was similarly excited. We had to wait about 2 hours at the bar, but we knew what we were in for so that was no problem. Between us we tried blackberry mojitos, she had a margarita, and I had some vodka drink that was more like a sno cone. The blackberry mojitos were too tart, the margarita was not great (according to my friend) and the vodka cocktail was way too sweet and syrupy. The bar has an amazing selection of tequila, but if you don't like tequila (and I don't) you're stuck with beer, wine or subpar cocktails. While waiting, we had the ceviche tasting and the queso fundido. The ceviche was great and we both enjoyed it. The queso fundido was just ok. Dinner is where things got REALLY disappointing. We both wanted to try dishes from the Topolobampo menu. My friend ordered the pork belly and I had a seafood dish with lobster and scallops in a tomatillo cream. Both dishes were way, way too salty, almost inedibly salty. The fat on my friend's pork belly was squishy, not crispy. My seafood was cooked well, but again, it was so salty I really didn't enjoy it at all. $200 and 3+ hours later, we left exceptionally disappointed. I have no reason to go back for drinks, because I have had better many, many places. I have no interest in waiting 2+ hours for salty nasty dinner. I love ceviche, but that's not a reason to pay the cab fare, fight the crowd, and suffer through crappy drinks. We were both seriously disappointed.
