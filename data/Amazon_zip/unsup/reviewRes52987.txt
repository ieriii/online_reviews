Here's an experience you won't likely find in most restaurants: You bring a 750ml bottle of Captain Morgan to a restaurant, the waiter proceeds to abscond with it to the back of the kitchen. A little while later, a pitcher of the freshest mojito you've had comes back in its stead. Groovy. Then its empty, and another comes out. And you get your food, and its fantastic. Then it empties... and another comes out... Then by the 5th pitcher, the mojito serving has gone from regular, to supersize. One of the owner's of the establishment sits down at your table and has one of your drinks!, then comps you a couple deserts. What? Yea, 90 miles is that kind of awesome. Only thing that kicked it back a star was there was some initially brusque treatment from some of the staff (not the hostess though, not only is she always awesome every time I've been, but she makes the mojito in a vat herself!) and the waits between some things have been excessively lengthy at times. Otherwise, this is a fantastic Chicago business and I wish them continued success!
