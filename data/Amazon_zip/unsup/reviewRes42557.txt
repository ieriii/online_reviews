After looking at a promising website & menu I decided to order on-line pizza for my wife, two kids & myself. An hour wait seemed a bit excessive but I went ahead & ordered anyway. After an hour & twenty minutes I called to see what the problem was to which I was told the driver had left already. Living just about a mile away this answer was good enough however after an hour & forty minutes after calling again we were told that the driver had left with 30, (yes, 30) separate orders. It has been two hours now & our order is still not here. Some advice for this place: if you don't have the decency to let customers know an accurate delivery time or further explain the exact situation upon calling to inquire you don't have the necessary human let alone business qualities to be delivering pizza. If you can't staff appropriately then do yourself & everybody else a favor & stop your pathetic attempts at delivery. To say this is substandard service is a huge understatement. I can't believe this pizza will not be soggy by the time it gets here now so even if at one point there was some quality to it, it doesn't matter anymore. NEVER will I call this place again. Update. The kids had to go to bed as school was in the morning & so my wife made them grilled cheese sandwiches. The pizza finally arrived after 2 hours & fifteen minutes & was cold. There was no way 30 orders fit into the car which angered me further as we were clearly lied to with this drivel on the phone. I can tell the food was probably good when it was made however the deceitful manner in which I was dealt with just so this place could make a quick buck at the expense of repeat business will prevent me from in any way reconsidering ordering here again. Of course I will try different pizzerias who are interested in a repeatedly satisfied customer.
