Was here for a work function a few weeks ago, so we got the fancy upstairs room all to ourselves. The service was great - even though they were out of some things, the waitress was extremely apologetic and somehow managed to memorize our orders, even though we were a really large group. Props to her! The food was delicious, too, although I rather regretted it as I was just coming off the flu and it was a bit heavy for poor sick me. It tasted reaaal good going down, though! I can imagine that it gets a little loud, although luckily it wasn't too bad upstairs for us. As other reviewers mentioned - it feels like someone else's beautiful home. The decor and ambience is really very nice. All around a solid place!
