My second visit to Opart was much better than the first. This time, I had the Panang curry and my dining partner had the curry fried rice. My panang curry was really delicious. The fried rice was fine in flavor and the portion was huge. I would order it again but not as a main dish. We also did the crab rangoon again. Sooo. Good. Still minus one star for the very slow (though very friendly) service and the inconsistent temperature. It was way too warm in there!
