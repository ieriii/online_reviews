The sloppy joe will change your life. I'm not a 'loose meat' gal, but this sandwich makes you believe in a God (pickled jalapeno, hello???). I think they could pepper in a few more interesting beers - but the sloppy joe really cancels out any possible criticisms I have about L&E. The decor is most excellent and I'm so happy to see a cool neighborhood hotel open in Chicago (better late than never). Kudos to Longman & Eagle for taking a risk - it has paid off! (Can I buy your beautiful jukebox?)
