On a wintry cold evening, there is nothing better than Xoco's carnitas caldo capped off with an Aztec hot chocolate. I mean, really, nothing better. I love the food at this place! It helps to come here on off hours or during the week in the evenings to avoid long lines and long waits. At 6pm on a Thursday evening we were seated and enjoying our dinner in five minutes. I've learned to avoid XOCO on the weekends and during the height of the lunch rush.
