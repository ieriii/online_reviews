Still need to go here for their famous brunch on a nice Sunday morning. But went to check out the rooftop a few weeks ago, and it is definitely an experience. They have a great design/flow and friendly staff. The view of the rooftop on the 3rd floor is pretty intimate night setting, and you'll see a lot of surrounding skyscrapers hovering over the roof. The bartenders working the roof are awesome, and definitely know how to make a bomb drink. Mojitos/martinis are about $10, but they're served in some pretty tall glasses, definitely worth it. Also ordered their spicy samosas appetizer which was scrumptious (the cook also brought it out to the bar, which is super-class!)
