I've ordered deliver from here a couple times. It's always been solid food - I've had the Farfalle Pollo - bowtie pasta and grilled chicken with a cream sauce and sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms. I'm a sucker for mushrooms. Be sure to order with plenty of time to spare - whenever we order, it generally takes a full hour for delivery (worth it) but we can get kind of punchy after 45 minutes or so...
