Yummy!! I have lived in Chicago all my life and when I crave deep dish pizza it has to be Art of Pizza.Their thin crust pizza is good as well. If you are not in the mood for pizza, they have daily specials which range from pasta to ribs. I have to admit sometimes it is difficult for me to place my order because they have a great shrimp dinner. Their slices are reasonably priced.
