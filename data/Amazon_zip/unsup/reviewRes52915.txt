I've passed by this place about a million times and I finally came here for lunch/dinner (whatever that meal that you eat at 4 p.m. is) last week. It was hot outside, but with all the doors open and some fans going, it felt nice and cool inside. The waitress was super patient with my friend and I as we discussed various menu options. I settled on the traditional Cuban sandwich and my friend got the veggie platter. The sandwich was pretty good, not too greasy and full of pork. My only complaint was that overall, it was a little bland. There definitely could have been more pickles/mustard to give it a little kick. I ended up dipping it into the house-made hot sauce, which was really a really nice and smoky sauce. For about $8, I was stuffed and happy. Service was really attentive and overall, 90 miles is a nice place to grab a quick, inexpensive meal.
