I am disappointed in 3rd Coast. To begin with, it s a bit unusual - wine bar meets dinner place meets breakfast joint meets coffee shop? Why? What sort of identity crisis do you have? The menu was extremely uninspiring and the decor makes you feel like you are in a hotel cafe. My waiter was fairly inattentive even though I was sitting right by the staging area and he left my (rather tiny) coffee cup sitting empty for most of my meal. They used processed cheese slices for the omelette, torn into bits and the veggies weren't very fresh (though the fruit was). When the omelettes I cook at home are far tastier than those I pay for, that's a shame.
