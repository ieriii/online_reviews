I really wanted to like this place. It's right by an L stop. Cute area. Cute ambiance.  Alas - it was not meant to be! The chicken I ordered was flavorful but the plantains (a Cuban staple) were rock hard and the rice and beans grainy. The mojitos looked great so I ordered one but mine was sweet but pretty weak on both mint flavor and alcohol. Maybe I didn't look 21? All and all - won't complain if someone wants to go but will probably be skipping this place.
