High-end and BBQ are not two things you normally put together, but q has brought it to Chicago and demonstrated how to do it well. The dark wood tables and off-white painted walls make you feel like you're almost in an old Southern mansion, except more updated with the enlarged photograph of a country road which brings contemporary flair. The staff wear plaid long sleeve shirts which balances the semi-formal ambiance to keep it relaxed. I don't think you can go wrong on the menu - all the meats are good. We had the St. Louis ribs which are prepared with a dry rub and then you have the option of slathering them at the table with one of three sauces: mild, vineagar-based, and spicy. Some may be a bit disappointed that the sauce is not basted on during the cooking, but to keep things simple and play to different palettes I assume q's approach is the best compromise. The mac n' cheese side is absolutely wonderful - fresh cheese, light breaded crust on top - one of the best I've ever had. They also make their own potato chips and cucumber pickles to get you started off. If you can, save room for the classic american desserts and pies which are so tasty you'll want to keep eating even if your full from your slab of ribs. Grab a Pimm's cup, order a slab and update your BBQ!
