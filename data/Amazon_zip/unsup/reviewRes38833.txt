Who DOESN'T love hop leaf. Delicious food, amazing beer. Bar tenders are the requisite grumpy vikings, and the bouncer you just want to hug. And they have mead! Minus one star for serving rabbit: not cool at all. Unlike every other meat industry, the rabbit trade is unregulated and therefore run by sadistic hacks. So what if it comes from some "small local farm?" More like a run down trailer surrounded by chicken coops and baseball bats.
