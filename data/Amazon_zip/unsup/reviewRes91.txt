No matter who you are or what your experience at Alinea, the food stands alone in excellence. SO, despite us being a little disappointed in our dinner, I recognize that the expectation was SO HIGH, that Alinea could have never met it. Also: be prepared for price. Our dinner was $1100 when it was all said and done. 5 stars all the way for the food and knowledge of the wait staff. Incredible. Few rules to follow: 1. Keep your imagination in check! The food is great, but it won't change your life. 2. Wine pairing: STAY AWAY!! It's not worth the price, especially for the Reserve Pairing which we opted for. Fellow Yelpers were spot-on with this. 3. Don't come with alot of conversation topics for your fellow diners: The atmosphere is very quiet, and somewhat cold. Focus on the food and you'll be good to go. I will never go back to Alinea, because frankly I cannot afford it, but I'm so happy we chose to experience it once in our lives.
