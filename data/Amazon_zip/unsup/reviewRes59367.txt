The dine in meal was quick and tasty. They have great hours for late night dining. I wish I had deeper pockets for the great array of cheeses they offer. The groceries are definitely high end with prices to reflect that. I would ask about the cupcakes (freshness) before buying though, they were a bit dry. The dark chocolate tarts are the best thing in the Bakery case!
