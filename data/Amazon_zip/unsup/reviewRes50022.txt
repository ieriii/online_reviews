The food was very good, but the atmosphere was chaotic for my taste. My wife and I went on a Friday night and the place was packed. We didn't have to wait for very long, but the volume of our fellow diners was almost unbearable. There were quite a few large groups with people yelling across the table to each other. I definitely walked out with a headache! That being said, I'd reccomend the shrimp and steak combo, which was cooked excellently and with interesting spices. The service was friendly, although not that attentive. Maybe try it on a weekday, when the crowds are probably a little more tame.
