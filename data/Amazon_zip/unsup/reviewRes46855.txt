Following the scent of delicious fried fish, my man & I headed to UG for some more awesome Friday night halibut.  We were quoted a 25 min wait at 8pm. Okay, no problem--I know where the bar is at. Just give me a good drink and I'll be fine. The Farmers Mojito sounded perfect--a bit of seasonal fruit tossed in a standard mojito. Delish, no? Answer: No. I have never been so disappointed in a drink--it had no flavor. The bartender was slammed. I know. She probably thought omitting the muddling of mint would be okay, right? Wrong. It tasted like really expensive minty water. My uninspiring "mojito" was $12 ($10 + $2 tip).  So I paid for a glass of ice cubes, 5 mint leaves, and a splash of rum?  I demand a refund!!! Oh, and they ran out of the fish & chips.  We left with empty stomachs and $12 less in our wallets. What I learned from this experience: 1) Muddling mint is essential 2) Get to UG early to snag the halibut 3) Order beer
