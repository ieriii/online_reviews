One of my favorite Pho places on the "Little Hanoi" strip. Aside from the "every odd animal part" special Pho, my other favorite dish there is the Lotus Root Salad, which is satisfying and fresh. I also appreciate the fact that they offer vegetarian Pho made with vegetarian broth (I'm a meat-eater, but I appreciate that it's available as an option).
