just to clarify, since so many seem to feel the bread is stale.....traditionally the bread in fondue was somewhat stale in order to hold up to being dunked in hot cheese as the less moist the bread, the more it absorbs the cheese and flavor. each piece should have a portion of crust, as this helps it hold up as well.
