I stopped in here for the first time because I was bringing desert to a dates house and didn't want to overwhelm him with an entire cake, or with the effort of making my own desert (It was only our second date afterall!).  I found precisely what I was looking for when I feasted my eyes on the cupcakes. Two red velvets and one Double Chocolate later, I made my way out. They were beautiful to look at (yes!), smelled delish (yes!) and looked much more expensive than they were (yes!). I didn't want to take them to the said date's nicely prepared dinner unless I knew they were good (hence why I got three), so I have to say - the double chocolate was amazing. It was moist and flavorful. The frosting complimented the flavor of the cake nicely - it wasn't overly sweet (and I love them sweet!) but it was perfect.  Don't ask me about the Red Velvet though.. We just didn't have time :) I'll ask him for an update though so stay tuned!
