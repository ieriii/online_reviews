Came here for a quick bite to eat before a 5-hour Memorial Weekend drive and was pleasantly surprised. Decor looks very authentic and they sell so many delicious things, it's almost like a Whole Foods. Their pastries looked really really good, too. I had a Spinach Leaf salad, which is "Fresh spinach leaves, pinenuts, Florina roasted peppers, Sesame goat cheese, reduction of balsamic vinaigrette." (Had it sans cheese, b/c lactose intolerance + 5 hour drive = bad idea.) It was delicious and a good portion. The addition of pine nuts really upped the ante and I couldn't get enough.  Friend had the Tequila Pollo, which is "Wood-roasted chicken breast, Roma tomato, arugula, avocado, tequila lime mayonnaise, on Sour Dough Boul." From what I could pick off her plate, the chicken was a bit dry, but everything else was pretty tasty. Big portion, though! I just really liked the atmosphere of fine dining at deli prices, and eating with real silverware and stemware. The indoor/outdoor seating was nice for people watching, as well. I'll have to stop by Greektown more often and not just for greasy gyro plates. K, let's be honest, in addition to gyro plates. =)
