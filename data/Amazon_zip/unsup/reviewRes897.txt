Worth the wait.....hell, worth flying to from Florida just for lunch! The wait wasn't bad although I only waited 45 mins. Doug was a very nice guy, you really feel welcome. I got the Ginger spiked Rabbit sausage with pumpkin creme fraiche and goat cheese. All quality ingredients, and the first bite pops with flavor. I've never had anything better.  The duck sausage with foi gras was AMAZING.  I left feeling that my Chicago trip was complete, not to mentioned inspired to grind my recently shot wild boar and put it in tube form once I got back home! Cheers, to Doug BTW great for kids, and the duck fat fries are only available 1-2 days out of the week, Saturday being one. (delicious)
