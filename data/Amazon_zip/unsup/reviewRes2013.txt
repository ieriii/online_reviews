I would have to give this place 5 stars because Doug makes some of the most amazing hot dogs you will ever try anywhere! Some of the flavor combinations he comes up with at the Sausage Emporium will absolutely blow you away. You'll have to wait in line to get in and he is only open a ridiculously limited number of hours but once you get inside, you see what all the fuss is about. All of the standard dogs such as the Elvis or Keira Knightly would keep me coming back. But its his daily special menu that is really where you see his imagination at work....duck sausage with brie on top? I personally am not the biggest fan of the duckfat fries, but they are good and more of a novelty thing in my opinion. The inside of the restaurant is very fun and you feel like a kid again when you sit down to eat. Its worth a special trip.
