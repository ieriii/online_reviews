Where do we start? Ok, The staff was 4 star great!! Now let's talk about the hotel it self. My wife and I thought we would use http://Priceline.com for the first time and BOY!!!, what a suprise when we got there. We got room 415 and, it was smaller than the cabin the we had on our most recent cruise. Me being over 6 feet tall and my wife almost 6 feet tall had to stuff ourselves into a full size bed. When we asked the front desk for a larger room or bed they told us that's as big as they have. DON'T LET THEIR WEBSITE FOOL YOU ALL THE PICTURES ARE TAKEN WITH A WIDE ANGLE LENS AND PHOTOSHOPPED!!! We left the hotel with severe back aches. The folks that are giving great reviews on the Hotel Felix must work there. If you are 5'5" or shorter and weigh less than 120 pounds the place would be great. Don't order any food while you're there it's horrible. My wife and I both give the hotel 4 thumbs down. Please, Please don't waste your money at the Hotel Felix. I have to rate this crap hole now and it can't be rated as a -1.
