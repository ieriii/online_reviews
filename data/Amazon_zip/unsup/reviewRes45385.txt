My new favorite bar! As everyone has already mentioned, Wilde Bar just has a warm, comfortable feel the moment you step inside. Beers on tap range from $5-7, from what I've tried. My favorite drink has been the deliciously potent hot toddy, which packs a punch for $7. The presentation was very nice too - it contained a lemon spiked with cloves, which I thought was a great, flavorful touch. Though I haven't eaten a full meal here, I snacked on the curry fries this weekend and they were delicious. I've been dreaming about them ever since. In terms of the staff, I found table service to be a tad slow, but the bartenders are awesome and very attentive. Also, I think they have a mix CD that they play on repeat because I swear I've heard the exact same music each time I've gone over there. No need to deduct stars, though.
