I wanted to REALLY like this place but I would go to a lot of other places in Chicago for BBQ before I came back here. I had the feeling like this place is set up for out-of-town business travelers, leaving all the "good places" for the Chicago residents. The food was okay. We had the hush puppies and dry wings as appetizers and had better on both. Then we ordered our entrees and they were brought out 90 seconds after we ordered . . . literally . . . 90 seconds. We had the feeling they were either rushing us or that they were just dishing our food up from the steam table in the kitchen. The pulled meats were good but a little dry. They give you four small ramekins of BBQ sauce to share for the table and they don't go far. I would have rather they asked me what sauce I wanted and gave me more of my preference. Portions were large. The Mac & Cheese stood out as a side dish. For all the hassle of the reservations and the confirmation calls and the driving into that area and the parking, it will be a while before I go back to Q. I would much rather go to Smoque on the north side and get better BBQ with less atmosphere and less hassle.
