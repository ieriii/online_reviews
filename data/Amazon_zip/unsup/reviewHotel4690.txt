Hotel is very clean, staff extreamly nice.. downside paying 40 bucks a night for parking, and room is just a bed and shower absolutely no space. The shampoo, conditioner, and soap is from the store around the corner called H20, very nice stuff. We asked for a better view and they were more than willing to upgrade us for free. So overall very pleased. The bed was very cozy, didnt hurt my back as most hotels.
