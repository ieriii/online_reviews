From the outside, I would not have imagined the view I had as I walked in the door. It is large without being overwhelming, well lit and inviting. The fresh salsa that they bring at the start of the meal is super delicious with a decent amount of heat. For dinner I had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. It is definitely worth coming back just for the salsa verde. I am not sure if I could go back to eating the bottled stuff after that. It was a Friday night and although we were seated right away our server seemed a bit busy. In the end, our food came out really fast after we ordered, so that is all that really matters. I will be back for more salsa (both regular and verde).
