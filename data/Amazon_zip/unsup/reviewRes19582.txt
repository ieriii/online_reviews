There are precious few circumstances when staring is appropriate. If you think my friends and I are hot stuff, stare all you want. However, if you are staring down my table of gal pals to determine when we'll be done with our meal so you can seat your next group of people, well, then it's just irritating and weird. Thus my biggest gripe about The Gage. I made reservations here for my birthday dinner last night, in hopes of great adult bevs and good food. I did find great drinks (I've never SEEN a whiskey menu like theirs before...and I discovered a top five beer fave in the Pauwel Kwak) and the food was good (the cheese selection was excellent, the goat cheese tart was a bit cold, the monkfish was seriously tasty seafood - as my friend, and fellow yelper would say, "like lobster, only cheaper" - and the spiced apple semifreddo was an exceptional concoction of braised apples, cake, caramel and ice cream).  However, the staring issue must be addressed. Not one, but two Gage workers felt the need to stand not five feet from our table and stare at what I can only assume was our progress in getting the h-e-double-hockey-sticks out of there so they could get more paying customers into our spot. Needless to say, by the end of the night, my friends and I were pretty annoyed. I enjoyed the evening, but it was mostly because I spent it with a great group of women. The setting certainly wasn't bad - strong 4 star showing (aside from the bizarro staring issue) it was a good experience.
