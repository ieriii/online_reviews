Never having had Chicago style deep dish pizza before, I was very intrigued and surprised trying it for the first time. I always thought deep dish pizza just meant thicker crust and more dough. But it turns out Chicago deep dish pizza isn't "deep" in a sense that the dough is thicker, but more so it's deep like a pie. In fact, the crust is actually quite thin! It's the many layers of toppings and cheese that makes it thick. My friends and I ordered the "Large Special Deep Dish Pizza ($26.75) - Sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions". It took 40 mins to prepare and cook, and we were tempted to order other things on the menu like salad and pasta while we waited. But we persevered, and when it finally came, it was worth it! The large pizza is cut into 8 slices that are seemingly manageable at first, until you start eating and realize how much substance there is to it. The crust is also notably different; it isn't the bread-like crust that you get at most chained pizza places but instead a crunchy flake pastry. The entire pie crust is filled with toppings, and all of the remaining space in between is smothered with melted cheese. If you've ever wanted to imitate those pizza commercials with the stringy cheese, this is the time to do it. So. Much.Cheese. It's a messy pie, and you'll begin to feel disgusting with cheese sweats after 2 slices, but it absolutely lived up to all the good praise. Would I eat it again? Yes. Oh, most-positively-definitely-yes. Maybe just not in the same day.....or make that the same week.
