We stayed here four nights. First room we had was very outdated and cramped. Due to some major issues with room service, the manager upgraded us to a newly renovated room. It was slightly larger, had new carpeting, updated bathroom and a great view of the river/city. Ate breakfast here twice. Got the full breakfast buffet the first time. It was pricey at $24, but good. I wouldn't rate it great. The second time, I got the Continental for $19. Found a dead bug in my dish of fruit...they comped my meal. Bistro / patisserie has good coffee and a small selection of pastries, etc. A bottle of Fiji water will set you back more than $5 - more than most airports I've been to. Stock up on snacks and bottled water at Walgreen's nearby. Yolk is a good breakfast / lunch place, and it's near the hotel if you don't want to drop $20+ for breakfast. I wasn't very impressed with Sheraton although their location on the river and their city views were terrific.
