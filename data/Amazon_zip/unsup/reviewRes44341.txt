I have always wanted to like Alliance more than I have in the past. It's always been so so for me.. BUT I had never really given it chance.. Last night in a last minute decision to have the whole family back over to the house for Birthday cake, I ran over there. Decided on a cute little carrot cake, the man behind the counter was super sweet and they even personalized it and supplied a few free candles. This made me happy enough! But what made everyone happier was the cake. It was delicious! I was half expecting something overly sweet and dry (as carrot cakes can sometimes be at other places) -This was the opposite. Hooray! I will go back there again to check out their cakes any day!
