Graham Elliot was a great dining experience.Everything from the music playing in the background to the juxtaposition of fine dining in a completely casual atmosphere, made this not only one of my great dining experiences, but also a place I would suggest to just about any foodie looking for a good time.We had the tasting menu, which I would recommend to anyone coming here for the first time. The drinks were also very tasty. We tried the Man-jito All in all, this is one of my absolute favorite spots in Chicago. Highly recommended!!
