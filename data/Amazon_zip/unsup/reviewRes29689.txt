OMG - this place is heaven! If you like Mexican food, and I do, you will absolutely love Frontera. Ok - here is the low down.....get there BEFORE they open and get in line. Sound pathetic - uh uh. It isn't. I have even waiting in the middle of January to make sure I am one of the first ones in the door. Reason being they DO NOT take reservations for parties smaller than 5. Total bummer when it's just me and my boyfriend going - even with another couple we're screwed. So...we get there 45 minutes or so beforehand and are one of the first in to get our names in - if you aren't one of the first 10 or 15 parties through you'll be in for a LOOOOONG wait. Go to the bar, get a margarita (all are great) and wait a few minutes till your name is called. Now - here is another tip - if you like chile rellenos tell your waiter RIGHT AWAY!!! They only make a certain amount and its worth getting their early for. Parking is so-so, but isn't it always downtown?  I really want to give it 4.5 stars for not taking reservations for parties of 5, but I'll always round up with Frontera.
