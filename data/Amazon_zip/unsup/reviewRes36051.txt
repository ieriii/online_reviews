A group of us came here for brunch yesterday and we all really enjoyed it. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but waited at their bar down the street. This was nice considering there is no waiting area and the place was packed. I ordered the Brie Salad and it was very good. Everyone commented on how great the salad looked and my friend even offered to switch his dish for mine...he was out of luck. The salad was huge and came with grilled chicken, artichokes, tomates, capers, cucumbers, brie cheese and sun dried tomatoes. It was seriously delish. Three other people ordered the frittata's and they looked delicious. The cup of soup is definitely more of a bowl of soup and he said it was really tasty. He drank the entire bowl so I would hope so ;) Meli is a great brunch spot, a little on the pricey side, but the food is fresh and the portions are rather large. I would definitely come back here for brunch or lunch any day of the week.
