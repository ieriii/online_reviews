The honey and I went here for lunch this afternoon, after finding this little gem by accident. He had raspberry cream cheese crepes and I had the Iberica, filled with tomatoes, greens, ricotta, pistachios and grilled pineapple! Both were super yummy, as was the raspberry/chocolate crepe we shared for dessert. The service was good, and I have to say we were pretty amazed at how busy they were at 2:30 in the afternoon. All in all a great experience for both of us, especially the S.O. as he is super picky!
