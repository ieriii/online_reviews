My family has been coming to this place for years even after moving to the suburbs of Chicago. Soups are great. My family loves the duck. I personally like the Malaysian Chicken wings and would only go here for that. But I have one question, WHY ARE THEY CLOSED ON THURSDAYS?! Oh heavenly god, why!?
