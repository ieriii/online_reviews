The worst part of the experience was the doorman, then it got a little better. He really loves the "power" he has as a doorman...pleeeeaassee..I went to Violet Hour with 2 lady friends and we were the only 3 trying to get inside. The doorman asked the 3 of us to stand in a single file line against the building and then studied our IDs in the most arrogant manner. As I was told, I did feel like I was in Alice and Wonderland right when we walked in. The blue violet color is nice and relaxing on the eyes. This is definitely not a place to pick up any babes since you are blocked off from all other tables with the extremely tall seats. The server was friendly, but I thought she could have been more attentive to the table considering how upscale they strive to be. I was kind of disappointed with my drink, it had an after taste of vomit. It was a champagne cocktail with chartreuse and pineapple. I wasn't in a very drink-y mood, so I only had 1 drink. My friends loved their drink, so maybe I just had a dud. The doorman left me with a bad taste of the place as well as the drink, but I think I will give Violet Hour 1 more chance to redeem itself.
