Went here for lunch with a friend for a beer and to check out the pizza that I've heard so much about...got to say I wasn't that impressed with the 'za. The service wasn't that great, the pizza wasn't really anything special - but the crafted beers were pretty decent. Don't even try to go to Piece if something is going on, or if it's a party night - we stopped by here this week and were told we'd have to wait an hour for a table. Really, Piece?
