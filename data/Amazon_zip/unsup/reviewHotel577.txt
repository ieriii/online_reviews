I stayed here recently for a business trip. Before its OFFICAL opening, I got a great deal on a room. I was never a devotee of the old Ambassador East Hotel, so I can't speak to the comparison. What I do know is that I LOVE this hotel. It works for me as I am a minimalist, modernist and I dig clean, spare spaces. I booked on price line and got a very good deal, but when I showed up, they upgraded me to a one room suite on the 16th floor...which had the MOST amazing view of both the towers and a little picnic table and a cupboard for the dining implementry in a completely different room. The living room was done all in white and was gorgeously appointed. The bed was a king size, low to the ground and extremely comfortable. Very Asian in feeling, but Swedish in style. Bathroom was a little bit small, but well turned out. There were two large flat screen tvs...I don't really watch tv, but I'm sure a sports fan or news junkie would have been pleased. The iPhone/iPod charger didn't seem to work for my 4G, but I didn't try my Nano, so I'm not sure if it was just a compatibility issue. I loved the location. Only a block or two away from the Zebra Lounge...a funky little piano bar with a tiny space but an excellent vibe. Also, only blocks away from th Rush/Division bars that stay open all night and on warm nights, which this was, is a place where people congregate outside regularly. Good people watching. The hotel staff was INCREDIBLY nice and accommodating. When I called at 12:30 am for a turkey sandwich and chocolate pudding room service delivery, they forgot or messed it up and, not being a very fussy person, I didn't bother to call back to check on it until 4:30am, where they immediately said they were SO sorry and could they please sendit up now, gratis, and also could they buy me breakfast in the morning? Yes and yes, thanks! That was the best 5am turkey sandwich ever. :) I really loved my stay here and will book again in the future.
