My friend and I came here for brunch and we wanted outdoor seating and the wait was 20 min (this was Sunday around 11am) so it wasn't too bad. We just went across to Millenium Park and then by the time we came back, the table was ready.  I ordered the Apple Pancake Souffle and my friend got the eggs benedict. I really wanted to get the strawberry stuffed french toast but it had cream cheese and I don't like cream cheese.  The souffle was pretty disappointing. I was hoping it would taste like the dutch baby from Walker Bros but it wasn't as good.  Sad. However, it was good. My friend liked the eggs benedict and it looked good.  There were umbrellas covering the tables and there was a big gust of wind and one of the umbrellas fell and hit out table and almost my friend. It was scary. I mean don't they secure those things or what?!? So that's why I'm only giving it 3 stars. And the manager didn't even compensate us or anything. Ugh.
