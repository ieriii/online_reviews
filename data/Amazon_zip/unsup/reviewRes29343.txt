This place is EXTREMELY overrated. Don't be fooled by the designer price tag, the product does not deliver. I love mexican, latin, southwestern food, and this place wasn't really any of the above, just meh. Like you'd get in a food court. Seriously. But with fancier preparation. I know it has lots of hype, and you think you'll be magically transported to Arizona or something... But from someone who grew up in Arizona, just skip it. There are much better options in the city where you don't pay for the name.
