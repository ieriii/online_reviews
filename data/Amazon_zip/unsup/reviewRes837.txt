foie gras hot dog was amazing. super rich, and the sausage itself was so......tasty and delicious and flavorful and the foie gras mousse on top complemented perfectly with the sausage. Doug is like the nicest guy ever! on a weekday before noon the line wasn't bad at all but after we left the line had doubled! so get here early!
