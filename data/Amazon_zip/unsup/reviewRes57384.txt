I live in Streeterville yet this is my favorite sushi place to go to. Sushi is always tasty and fresh! Service is great. I always make reservations, especially on the weekend. This is a great place to meet with your girlfriends, try different kinds of sushi and have a bottle of vine. The bill is always inexpensive and the place is super cozy. I had my birthday dinner there as well and all the girls loved the atmosphere.
