Was taken to Cafe 28 for my birthday dinner. Hadn't been here in a year or so. 45 minute wait, not so bad for a Friday night. They have flavored butter with their bread basket. I love that. For my money the Green Tamales are one my favorite first courses at any restaurant in the city. Made with poblano peppers, corn and brick cheese served with sour cream and pico de gallo. I wish there was an entree size this. That's what I would always order. Or I guess I could just order two.... The bff ordered the Ropa Vieja, beef slowly simmered in a garlic tomato sauce until it falls apart. Served with white rice, black beans and sweet plantains. Which is their specialty. She enjoyed it. I had the Almond Crusted Halibut served with a saffron cream, Jalapeo mashed potatoes and sauteed seasonal vegetables. It was just ok. I love the bar area and the decor. Our server was great.
