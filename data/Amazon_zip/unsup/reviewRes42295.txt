I'm getting too old for 'scenes' so I don't really care if Gilt is hip or not (though I do care if attention-hungry girls screeching in the corner are going to be a regular appearance.) I care about cocktails and Gilt has wonderful cocktails. The French 75 is top notch - it tastes like a summer in Italy in a glass; their Pimms is fabulous. And the friendly, fast, bearded young man who served us got all our orders right and kept the cocktails flowing.
