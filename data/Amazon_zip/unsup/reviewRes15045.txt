I love the Violet Hour. I love that they don't allow cellphones and that you don't get in until a seat opens up. I love the drinks and the ambiance and the decor and the lighting. It's a little escape in Wicker Park. Perfect for a romantic evening or a night out with a group of friends. It is worth the wait and honestly $12 for a craft cocktail is very inexpensive! The Juliet and Romeo is like sipping on a cloud-a cloud of delicious gin. If you need a nosh get the gnocchi. It's incredible.
