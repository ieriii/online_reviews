Five star steak in an ordinary steakhouse atmosphere. Service was decent, not great. Timing is not their expertise.  The decor is 100% standard steakhouse. I can just see all the twice-a-year suburban visitors to Chicago loving the place. Three stars all the way.  Then we get to the steaks... This is the place for the greatest steaks in Chicago! Why? Because of how they cut the meat. We ordered rib eyes. They're NOT the standard extremely thick cuts, round and tall, with all fat trimmed off. They're moderately thick, with the side strip of meat left on and the fat left tied to the meat. The fat is where the flavor is!!! That's why you want marbled steaks. Here, you get the narrow strip of fat surrounding much of the meat. Served on their sizzling platters. It was heavenly. Now I understand why my father-in-law, when he was alive, loved Ruth's Chris'. He raised cattle and sold them to the packing company that supplied Ruth's Chris'. He knew great meat when he had it and this is great meat. My suggestion: Give it a try. If you prefer the fat-free version served elsewhere, fine. Your call. I like them too. Love the steaks at Morton's and Ditka's. But if you've worked through many of Chicago's finest steakhouses, try Ruth's Chris'. At a minimum it'll expand your knowledge of how steaks can be served. The salad was nice, the sides were good (what steakhouse doesn't have good spinach?), and dessert is adequate if you're still hungry. But this is now my #1 place for steaks - damn it was good.
