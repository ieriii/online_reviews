My third trip there - the food is very good. Tons and tons of side dishes / appetizer type plates (around 20 small plates). Good for those who like Korean food - I only like the bbq. I always get the kalbi and this visit was no different. However, I got the squid and the pork bbq also. Very delicious, but can't beat the kalbi. Only reason why it isn't a 5 is b/c the service staff is very pushy. B/c they are so popular and busy, they always have people waiting at the front to be seated. So the moment they see you finish, they do everything to get you out the door for the next table (including telling you they have people waiting for your table). This place still gets a 4 from me which reflects just how good their Korean bbq food is.
