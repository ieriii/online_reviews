This is still my favorite Sunday brunch ever, but they have changed it up a bit. Now it is $25 for a "chef's tasting menu" that included 10 different tapas, a charcuterie station and a dessert station. You then have the option of adding on the unlimited mimosas, sangria and bloody Mary bar for $8. So the grand total is now $33, but you are getting twice as much food. #WINNING
