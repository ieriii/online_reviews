This is the best pizza I have ever had outside of Naples. No deep-dish nonsense here, just the perfect blend of fresh ingredients (I had Bianca con Bufala e Rucola: Pizza Bianca with Mozzarella Di Bufala, Arugula, Basil, Olive Oil) and crust that was thin-ish, chewy and crispy, and actually flavorful, not just bland bread. We also had the appetizer special of cheese and prosciutto between pieces of sourdough bread and then deep fried served with a mouthwatering tomato sauce. My mouth is actually watering as I remember eating it. My husby got Salsiccia: Tomatoes, Fior Di Latte Mozzarella, Basil, Italian Sausage, Olive Oil as his pizza, and as I am not a huge sausage person I was shocked at how much I loved it.  This carb-heavy fantastic meal was topped off with espresso and panna cotta served with some sort of tangy, sour-ish sauce and fruit (I wish I had been paying more attention, but I knew I wanted panna cotta as soon as I heard the words and blanked out, but I think it was maybe pears in a marsala wine sauce). Husby got tiramisu, which he loved, but I was so in love with the perfectly sweet and sour blend of creamy custard and sauce that I hardly tasted his. The topper of it all is that the pizzas are individual size, but huge, so I have half of the amazing pizza to look forward to for lunch today! Go there!
