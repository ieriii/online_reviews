We were both hungry and when we walked up to a line out the door at 1:30p, it gave us really good vibes for this place. We were sat, well she pointed out our table, thats cool, they're busy. The table had 2 menus and shortly after we sat down, the busser brought us our setting and tea. More than 5 minutes later the server came up to us, and the first thing out of his mouth- what do you want to order? Luckily we had enough uninterrupted time to figure this out. 2 waters, 2 wonton soups, a crab rangoon, a ma po tofu for Sara and a chili chicken for me. The entree's came first, followed by the crab rangoon, then the soup AND then after that our water. The crab rangoon was full of lump crab and really good. Sara's dish was really spicy and good, a lil too spicy for her. My chicken was very crispy, flavorful and had some spice. It definitely looks spicier than it is.  I'd go again hoping I had a different server. Go for the food, not the service!
