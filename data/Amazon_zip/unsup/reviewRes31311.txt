This place is awesome! Great menu - very hard to decide what to get with all the amazing options. I've been trying to get my sister to go vegan and this was a perfect place to start. We had the mozzarella sticks, the radical reuben with mac and cheese, carrot cake and snicker doddle cookies. It was all so good. My sister actually thought it was way better than the non-vegan versions! I live in Phoenix, but will definitely make it into the diner whenever I'm in Chicago. Vegan or not you'll love this place!
