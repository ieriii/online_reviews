I have been dining at and ordering take out from La Villa for 20 years. The restaurant is a bit outdated but that doesn't stop me from enjoying their home made focassia (sp) bread, warm bread from the oven and house minestrone soup. On Saturday nights they have a table side magician. I'm not a fan and can do with out him. Just don't' make eye contact and keep your head down in that soup and he'll leave you alone! Their pizza is all good! They can make pretty much any kind of pizza - from roast beef to pineapple. It's delicious! Their delivery service is reliable and the food is always hot!
