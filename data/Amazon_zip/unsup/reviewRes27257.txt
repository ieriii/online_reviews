Near the el. Check! Easy to spot sign. Check! And when we sat down we were only given the drink menu. No entree menu. Hmm, did they forget? No, apparently, they want you to order drinks first. Thought it was going to be a gastropub but really dark and trendy inside. Highlights were the truffle popcorn and foie-lollypops. We liked some things on the five course tasting menu. Like the parmesan infused brioche in the deconstructed cesear salad and the skate was delicious. Chicken with carrot was ok. Dessert of chocolate with vinaigrette was so decadent. Although the food was very tasty it was small portions on a big plate. Understand this was a tasting and the portions were smaller than the normal entree portions...but I was still hungry a couple of hours later. Wished there was more food for $75. Very tasty food in every bite. Maybe that is what Chef Elliot is trying to achieve, not engorging us like in other restaurants. How did they know my husband likes Built to Spill songs?
