Realized I never did a review even though I came here about a year ago. I think I'm due back for round 2! Took my BF for his birthday last April and it was phenomenal! We ordered Belgian micro-brews, which were both wonderful. I hate to admit we didn't experience more of their fabulous selection, but we had just come from a Goose Island beer & cheese tasting sipping faves like Juliet (which was on the Publican's beer menu for ~$30 a glass!). The beer menu is EXTENSIVE! If you know a beer guru, bring him/her with you! Started with a dozen oysters...I was in heaven. An oyster is not just an oyster. The Publican has an outstanding selection, each with its own size, texture and flavor. They are accompanied with a malt vinegar. Loved the pairing! Next was the potted pork rillettes with country toast. OMG. This was one of faves of the night!! Pig heaven! For the final course, we shared the family style pork platter, which came with pork tenderloin and pork sausages with sides of root vegetables. So delicious!!!! I know the menu is ever changing and I'm very curious to see what they are serving now. Plus I need to order the infamous pork rinds next time I go! BONUS: The setting is really impressive and the "beer relics" in the restroom area are such a great touch. Vintage goblets, etc. Very very cool. I'm also in love with the Pig Art.
