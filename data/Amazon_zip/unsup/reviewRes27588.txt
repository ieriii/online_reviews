To start off I am a huge Food Network fan and have been curious to try Rick Bayless' food for quite a while! So when I had some friends visit from NYC it was the perfect place to go! I have to say I absolutely loved the energy and the vibe It's hard for me to describe the interior, but it brought me to some distant (fun) place in Mexico...very colorful, filled with art work that in my opinion resembled Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) -- which is actually more like a colorful celebration honoring those that have passed. Maybe I got that impression from the skeletons randomy placed on walls...either way it was actually very fun to look at. Okay so now to the food...everything I've tasted was just delicious. Since there were four of us, I got to sample quite a few things off the menu. We started off with margaritas which were great. Then ahi tuna ceviche (amazing), guacamole & chips. By that time I was pretty much stuffed, but I ordered the Tamal De Elote (sweet corn tomale in banana leaves) and Tinga Poblana (pork shoulder braised with roasted tomatoes, homemade chorizo & potatoes. avocado, queso fresco). Tinga Poblana was one of my favorite things I've ever eaten - seriously.  I've also tried some of the Tamal De Chile Poblano (corn tamale), Carne Asada, Verduras Borrachas and Enchiladas De Mole Poblano that my friends ordered, which were all equally as good as the rest of the items I've had. And of course what's better than following up all of this with some ice cream? More specifically, fresh apricot with torres orange liqueur along side some bittersweet hot fudge.... Ah salivating right about now :) Just GOOOO there!
