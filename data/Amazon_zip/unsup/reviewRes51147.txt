Having eaten here a half dozen or so times this past year and previously enjoying my meals immensely, I must say I was disappointed this time. I thought the artichoke appetizer was almost flavorless and the pork shoulder though tasty was overcooked.  The cheese biscuit was very good, though in place of the second one on the plate, I might have preferred something else fresh and green. The fried pickled okra was very good and the burger my friend had was excellent. The whole meal seemed to lack the zest I have enjoyed prior. I wonder if there is a new chef. I will go back again and see if it was just an off meal.
