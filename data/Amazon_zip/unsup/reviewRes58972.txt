Very good place if you enjoy the Viagra triangle crowd that flocks to Hubbard. Think: orange, receding, douche-types. A Rockit Ranch production so you know the space is going to look amazing. And it does!Service was excellent especially since I was with a large group.Did not have the sushi. Had actual food.The actual food was like BEN PAO, or a saltier and less appetizing version of PF CHANG'S.Had:- Chicken and mushroom dim sum: Trader Joe's frozen is better. It was soggy, bland, and just overall gross- Lemongrass beef lollipops: excellent meat quality as it fell off the bone, oversalted like crazy though. It was like sucking on a big giant rock of Bolivian rose salt. High quality yes. Sodium explosion no.- Roasted duck hash salad: highly highly recommended by the waiter. Was a plate with mush (I would say the faux lardon "daikon cakes" were a failure) and shredded duck. Just not what you want out of a salad. Tasty but would be better as in a Cuban sandwich style.Did not want to order anything more after that and just stuck with downing Jameson on the rocks to ease the pain of dinner.Loved the waiter though!
