I'm sure you've heard this from many, but OATMEAL SHAKE! Seriously the miracle elixir after a long, rough night of red wine! haha That aside, the food is outstanding considering the fact that Costa Rican cuisine is new to me. I would definitely recommend the Casado plate (grilled choice of meat accompanied with various sides) It's a huge portion and a real steal for under $13. It seriously lasted me two meals. I also would definitely recommend the Chicharron plate. It's very comparable to fried lechon. But unlike many variations I had, the meat actually remained moist and succulent and still had a very nice crunch! Gallo Pinto (their rice and beans) are on point. And who doesn't love fried plantains? I've also had the ceviche here, and it's among the better ceviches I've had in the city. Good citrus, but sometimes an additional dash of salt really wakes up the dish. Dining is enjoyable, they have a lot of outdoor seating and indoor. The waitstaff is very friendly. My only problem would be the cash only policy. But that's minor.
