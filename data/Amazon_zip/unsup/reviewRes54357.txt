First of all, Pequod's serves the best pizza I've ever had- in Chicago or anywhere. The caramelized crust (it's not burnt, people) on the deep dish pizza is what makes them unique so don't even think about ordering thin crust. Also, if it is your first time, you'll want to go in and try it fresh, not delivered. It is worth pointing out that the Pequod's deep dish is different from other chicago-style pizza like Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's. This isn't stuffed pizza, it is more traditional- but again, it's all about the crust. For me, nothing beats the topping combination of pepperoni and pepperoncini. They smother the pie with toppings so I don't recommend going crazy with a lot of different toppings. The restaurant itself can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends. If you have a large party, be sure to make a reservation. You can also place your order while you wait since it takes about 30 minutes to cook. After you try Pequod's, you will probably never eat pizza anywhere else ever again.
