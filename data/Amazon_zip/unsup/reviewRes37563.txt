I almost did not even want to go to Hopleaf because I normally do not like overly hyped places. The hype for Hopleaf is out of control and frankly, it's all correct. Hopleaf is the best beer bar I have been to in my life...not just in Chicago. The selection of beers on draught is unparalleled at least in Chicago. I had a couple different beers that were fantastic. The bartenders had good suggestions and were helpful in general. I found all of the staff to be great...which was impressive because the crowd was (and always is for the most part) pretty out of control. The food is great...don't drink too much and miss it! The problem with Hopleaf (which is why I probably won't return for a while...but I still have to give it 5 stars) is the crowd. The place has become so popular that the crowd is always huge. One time I went at 6:00pm on a Wednesday and could not get a table for 45 minutes! Hopefully they can open another location further south without adulterating the original appeal of the place!!!!
