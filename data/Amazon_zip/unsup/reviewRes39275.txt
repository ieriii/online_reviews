Based on a recommendation from a friend who lives in Logan Square, we popped over to Longman & Eagle for a late dinner after an art show in the neighborhood. We got there around 10 and had to wait a bit for a table. No problem, we bellied up to the (very busy) bar and ordered two cocktails. I had something with tequila and apricot ale. It was light and summery. I don't know if I would get it again, but it was pretty tasty. The drinks took a bit to make, but as I mentioned, the bar was busy, so it was understandable. Once seated by a very kind host, we were greeted by our server, who was really sweet. We ordered a salad to split that had compressed watermelon and canteloupe, greens, pine nuts, humboldt fog and a chili-honey dressing. Wow. Best salad I have had in a very long time, maybe ever... I ordered the wild board sloppy joe and fries. First, the sloppy joe was delicious, not overly game-y at all. The crispy fried sage was my favorite part. It was served with french fries that had been fried in beef fat, which reminded me of my time in Belgium. I only wish they were served with some andalouse sauce to make them really authentic belgian frites. Even without it, they were definitely the best fries I have had in this country. My boyfriend ordered their roast chicken, which I snuck a few bites of. It was amazing. The potatoes that came with it were so buttery and rich. Not a light meal, but a delicious one. Crazily enough, the next day we met some friends who were visiting from NYC for brunch and they suggested Longman & Eagle. It's that good...
