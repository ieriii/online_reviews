This place is so unique! My bf brought me here for my birthday, and it was awesome. It's supposed to resemble the family style eating of communal dining halls, but there are private smaller tables on the periphery. Also, the menu changes each week with fresh food (they tell you where everything comes from)! They have an extensive list of beers as well. I really liked the decor in this place. The bathrooms have a big communal sink with nicely scented soap from C.O. Bigelow (+lotion!). The staff were all very helpful with recommendations (both food and drink), and the prices are actually quite reasonable for the amount of food you get. We ordered the fish stew, frites topped with eggs from georgia, and fresh radishes with butter and sea salt, and it filled us to the brim. The beers were great as well, and we definitely did not have any more room for dessert. We did take a peek at the dessert menu and they have cheeses along with the more traditional sweets. We're definitely coming back here again to try out brunch! A great venue for a casual outing with friends :o].
