Here I go food tripping again and now I chance upon this crazy place. I find that the service is unique and entertaining, definitely worth a visit though it may be pricey, They've got quite a mix of salads and a non-stop meat course after which you would like to try out their desserts if you have the time. They've got cheese , hot soups, but the wine service really grabbed my attention, I guess they took advantage of the high ceiling, their structure and their interest for these kind of gymnastics, you'd have to appreciate that.They've got a spacious seating area, very nice interior and nice lighting, nice ambiance, nice service. We ordered the portabello, artichokes with the bacon goat cheese terraine, spent some time at the cool salad bar. I'd come back if i have the time again. See you there.
