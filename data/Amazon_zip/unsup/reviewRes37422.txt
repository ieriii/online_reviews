I love shopping at Fox & Obel for last 5 years or so.....I was a Whole Foods girl up until then...but my lazy butt loves its prepared gourmet foods. My poor fiancee has to probably eat their quiche lorraine and lasagna for the rest of our married life...but...well, it;s better than McDonalds,....right? :D Seriously though, we always pick up a small champagne bottle, some finger foods, and desserts (oh..creme brulee...why must you look so tempting in that window of yours...) for the night if we are tired to go out for a meal. Olive oil section is very well designed with varieties of really really good oil....and the cheese sample right in front of it is hard to pass by!! Their winery isn't bad...considering the size of the market. I don't have to run to Just Grapes everytime I run out of wine! And I love picking up some fresh flowers in the morning...they have good selections of wild flowers....and I love its attempt to imitate a European market..(but yes, they do fail :D) Their free valet is now 7$ (tip too), and the items can be bit on the higher end of the scale. Prepare to spend couple hundred dollars for 3 days worth of groceries if you like higher end items! :D
