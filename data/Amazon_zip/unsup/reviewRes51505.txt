You and your friend (both visiting out-of-towners) being ditched by the guys while you're all helping your other drunken friend, only to find out that they went on a McDonalds drive through run and didn't bring you anything back? Not cool! And a good excuse to leave on your own late night quest for food. The two of you drunkenly discovering that McDonalds really means it when they say they won't serve people on foot through the drive-through? Pretty damn amusing. Though still no food. Wandering around aimlessly, past a closed Burger King, only to see lights in the distance, with the words "Garcia's" and "Mexican" on the sign? Ooooooooooooh. In, ordered, and out within 10-15 minutes. Coming home in triumph with giant burritos, seeing the OMG WANT looks on the guys faces, and going OH YEAH WE WIN AT LATE NIGHT FOOD QUEST? Sweet, sweet triumph. Getting a thoroughly delicious al pastor and avocado burrito (crisped tasty bits of flavorful pork, large chunks of avocado, some lettuce, a little salsa) at 3 am? Priceless. Actually, though, pretty damn inexpensive in fact, which makes it all the more awesome. (note: rating for late night drunken burrito-age. may not apply for other uses.)
