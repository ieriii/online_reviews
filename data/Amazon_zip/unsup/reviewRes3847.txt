This is one of the truly best small ethnic spots in Chicago. Lots of good traditional Korean options on the menu, but you're supposed to order the chicken. It is superb. The bi bim bap is also delicious, and the owners are extremely personable, making for a very enjoyable casual dining experience. I would probably eat here a couple times/week if it were closer to me.  If you want an excellent example of contemporary Korean cuisine, this is probably your best choice outside of LA.
