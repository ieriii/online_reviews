90: miles it is from Cuba to Florida 10: pounds I gained from this amazing meal. I highly recommend the masas de puerco: fried chunks of juicy pork, served with rice and beans and plantains. Ask for the garlic sauce on the side; otherwise, it'll be WAY TOO garlic-y, even if you want to fend off the vampires. 3.95: dollars the bread pudding dessert is. Skip it. It tastes like cold, solidified flan. Not in a good way. 3: number of drinks our table ordered that all came in non-sustainable to-go cups. Development opportunity, 90 Miles, development opportunity! We can be more earth friendly than that, especially since our cafe con leche/hot chocolate/fruit smoothie were all consumed in the restaurant. Nice laidback, beach-like vibe, especially in the tented outdoor patio area with the fireplace. Lastly, it's BYOB, and if you bring your rum, they'll make you mojitos. If you bring wine, it'll get transformed into sangria. Is that awesome, or is that awesome?
