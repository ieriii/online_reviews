Stayed here for 2 days with my boyfriend this last weekend when Chicago was blasted with 8 inches of snow. Pricelined for a reasonable price others have quoted below for a 4 star hotel in the River North district. This eco-friendly boutique hotel is more of a 3.5 star hotel (due to small room size) overall but I had a great experience and would gladly stay again. Pros: - Impeccable service. From the doorman opening the door and greeting me warmly every single time to the maid redirecting me to my room b/c I was lost, everyone here was wonderful. - Great location in River North just 5 minutes away from the Red line. The 22 bus is right outside the hotel door. - Amazingly, comfortable bed. Trust me, I spend enough time in it to know! - FREE WIFI! - Cool, trendy, modern restaurant ELATE next door. Beware that they do not have the late night menu during the winter. I hear they do unlimited mimosas for $20 on the weekends. - Really nice bath products by H20. My boyfriend couldn't stop smelling my hair! They even included make up removal toilettes, cotton balls, and Q-tips. - Gym on site with 3 treadmills, some elliptical machines, a cycling machine, and some free weights. - Nice looking lobby with a fireplace to warm you up after braving the cold streets. Cons: - Size. Rooms here are "cozy". We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a king sized room which still had very little space for us to store our luggage. - Bathroom had very little storage space to store toiletries and such. - Didn't have a fridge or a coffee machine. Things that you would expect from a Priceline 4 star hotel. However, they do serve free coffee downstairs in the morning. - TV remote control didn't work very well. I had trouble changing channels.
