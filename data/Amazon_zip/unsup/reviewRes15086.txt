I had been meaning to try this place for quite sometime, and on Saturday night we finally made it here. We arrived at around 10:30 and stood in line for around 45 minutes. There does not seem to be a rhyme or reason to how the host lets people in--meaning the order of where you're standing in line doesn't necessarily matter. If the number in your party is a good fit for some seats that are open, you will be the lucky chosen ones. Plan on waiting in line. The decor is gorgeous-- curtains separate the three main rooms to drink in. The high back chairs and seating areas are really cool. The restrooms are pristine with Malin + Goetz rum soap--- my personal favorite! The service is prompt and the servers and bartenders are very skilled. The drinks are top notch, especially with the cocktail trend in full swing right now. The glasses are mini-goblet, Nucky Thompson style. It's a nice touch. I ordered a gin based drink to begin-- the something or other purse. It was really good. I then ordered the Juliet and Romeo afterward. I couldn't finish it, my husband had to for me. The cocktails are potent. They do have a small selection of nosh as well. We tried the caramelized onion dip, which was phenomenal. They should bottle it and sell it a grocery stores because it was the best dip I have ever eaten anywhere! Don't even think about ordering any light beers, jager bombs, or bombs of any kind. That's a disclaimer at the door where you will wait-- be warned this isn't that type of place. And I like it! The music was nice; Radiohead in particular was on during our visit. This is a breath of fresh air from techno or pop-esque music played at other places. Overall, from start to finish, a 5 star experience.
