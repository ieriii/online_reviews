The best brunch place in the city hands down. The huevos rancheros on weekend are the way to go. My boyfriend usually gets the lox plate which at other places could easily be 12 bucks but here is only 6.75. Can't get much cheaper than that as this quality. Nothing is more expensive than 6.75 and for the quality and value, this is where its at. Also, I get anxiety about places that you order first and then have to wait around for a table. But Milk and Honey has a system where you order and then wait for your table number to be called. Woohoo for Milk and Honey, for their excellent food and service.
