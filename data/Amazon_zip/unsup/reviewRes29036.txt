Last night was our 2nd visit at this place. We loved it here. it was simple, casual, fast, friendly and food was good. We had : Shrimp risotto with sun dried tomato, - it was good. Rice was abit under cooked but not a big problem. Shrimp was fresh and it was tasty. Clams Cappellini - was good, i liked the sauce that comes with. it was blended with some kind of white wine sauce. Fettucine Alfredo with shrimp - was also good. Portion here was big. We couln't finish it and had it wrapped up. The table next to us also had left over. This place isn't the best place for pasta but considering from the price, portion and quality, i believe that they deserve 4 stars.
