What a quirky, kitschy place to grab a dog. Beware-the lines get LONG. I usually order off the daily specials listing. Sure you can get a regular old dog, but that is not why you come here! Doug is always manning the cash register and is very friendly. Fries are freaking delicious as well. I love the decor of this place oh so much. I recommend eating your dogs there! It's just one of the places I miss so much. Can't he come to Denver, PLEASE??
