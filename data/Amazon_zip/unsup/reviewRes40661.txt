This is a very cool place. I had the pot eu feu with a beef tenderloin, short rib, foiegras, and bone marrow...it was really nice. The drink menu was perfect for the evening I was having. The pricing is very affordable considering it's Michelin star status...it was only $90/couple with drinks, app, dinner, and dessert. The donuts are awesome for dessert by the way. Having been to only one other Michelin restaurant, this seems to fit in just fine(though the other experience I had was way different. Overall, you should check this place out.
