I recently moved into this neighborhood from California. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A NEIGHBORHOOD GEM. the night I came into the restaurant was pretty quiet. The service was attentive, my appetizer of shrimp tempura came quickly. My main course of coconut mango beef came out and I was absolutely stunned by how amazing it looked. Also tasted delicious!I also got some very tasty oranges and rice cookies at the end of my meal.I must say, this is definitely a food diverse neighborhood and I'm loving every minute of it!
