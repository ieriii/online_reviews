Definitely a place with a river north edge, so they can charge a bunch more. Ive had better pan asian and sushi before. Not sure if Id seen such good people watching lately though. So we started off with the grilled ahi and pork which was really good, i really loved the red chilis thrown up in there. We also got the lemongrass skewers, which we munched up. Then rock shrimp tempura with honey and walnuts, just meh but I dont love love love shrimps like some peeps. I got the pancit and the crunchy pork lobster roll, which were both ok, nothing real amazing there. And they were "auctioning" off the food at the table which was kinda trashy considering the level of restaurant it is. I also tasted the adobo pork belly which was actually really super good stuff, but it coulda been cooked longer since it was still kinda tough in some spots. Desserts were good too, the taro coconut bread puddding was nice, my fave. So overall, its solid but nothing spectacular. I don't think that I would go back but I would recommend it if someone is looking for asian in river north. There is just much better pan asian around town otherwise.
