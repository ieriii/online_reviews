i love thai food. thai food in chicago has done me wrong so many times that i had almost given up on thai food here. where i grew up thai food was fresh, light, sweet, sour, spicy. all the things thai food should be. perhaps i have just had a very very bad string of luck these last 11 years with thai food in chicago but what i usually receive is thick and heavy. so so sad. opart thai is what thai food should be. reasonably sized portions or light, delicious, fresh, spicy, sweet, sout, thai food love and it is byob with a liquor store next door. if it were even vaguely close to my home or i could order delivery i would be tossing out 5 stars. though i guess that is a flaw on my part not theirs.
