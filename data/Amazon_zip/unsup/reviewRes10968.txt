I read the reviews and was expecting something heaven-sent. Well it wasn't heaven sent. Perhaps sent from the local diner. The Bongo Room has a somewhat good location, but not stellar. The interior is Spartan with little to no decor. The seating and tables look like they're from a children's IKEA catalog.  The food was average at best. Potatoes were pretty good, but many were burnt to the point of substituting as charcoal. If you're in the area there are many better choices.
