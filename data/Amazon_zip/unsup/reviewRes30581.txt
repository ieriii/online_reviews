I haven't been to a lot of steakhouses, but I have a general idea of how a $50 ribeye should taste. It should taste like it cost $50. Regardless, I wasn't impressed with my $50 hunk of meat. Service was decent, and the tables were too large; I could barely hear my date over the lady singing Earth, Wind and Fire with the live band. Also tried some sort of chocolate pudding cake. I'm not a fan of chocolate so I wouldn't be the best one to judge. Date liked it though. Went to David Burkes the next day for lunch, and the $20 sirloin that came with soup, side and martini was better than the $50 ribeye by a large margin. Go figure
