This was mos def on our top "Places to go in Chicago" list. Had the lobster club from the cafe, damn it was awesome. I love this store. Bought a chocolate croissant and a onion roll from the bakery. Both were cheap and delicious, my favorite combination! I want another lobster club, goddamnit! Way better than Whole Foods and Fresh Market put together.
