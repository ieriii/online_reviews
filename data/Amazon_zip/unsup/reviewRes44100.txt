I was not impressed. We ordered a bunch of rolls and sushi, and if I could pick one word to describe our experience, it would be mushy. The fish was extremely mushy and not fresh. I couldn't tell if I was chewing the avocado or the fish - both were mushy! I guess it was good that the avocado was ripe - but the tuna, red snapper, and salmon all had the same texture as the avocado! Gross! The rice had the same texture as the fish and avocado! It was a big icky mush in my mouth - nothing had any flavor! Overcooked rice?  The food isn't cheap here either, and I guess Wakamono is about to get their liquor license.  We spent $60 (with tip), and I can get a lot of good rolls and sushi elsewhere for this price.  They also sat us at the bar - they need to get more comfortable bar stools. The service was pretty mushy too - cold and blah!  I'm never going back.
