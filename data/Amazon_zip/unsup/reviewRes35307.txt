Lemon Drop martini? Check. Lobster Bisque? Check. TWO types of oysters? Check. A big ass plate full of scallops, nantucket shrimp and crabcakes? Check. Key Lime Pie? Check. There's not much more about Shaw's that needs saying. The food was unbelievable. The service was mostly okay - a table by us was (clearly) getting more attention than we were for a period of time. However, that was remedied. The decor was a little dated I guess. It looked like an 80's movie where a high powered attorney was trying to bang a park avenue chic by impressing her with a big, fat plate of lobster. She's wearing some sweet ass shoulderpadded dress and her hair is teased/hairsprayed up to the ceiling. My review got off track... It was very crowded and there was a very annoying child who kept kicking the bottom of the seats we were all sitting on. I was ready to throw him across my room. However, the magnificent lobster bisque soothed my frayed nerves. Reservations are definitely recommended. MMM. Shaws.
