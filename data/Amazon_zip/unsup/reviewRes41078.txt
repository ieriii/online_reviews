I expected a lot more from Bonsoiree. In regards to food, there was one amazing dish of scallops and crab meat baked into a shell. The lobster bisque with sweetbreads was also decent. The rabbit dish was no good. One of the dessert courses was so terrible it had to be sent back. It was hastily and half-hardheartedly replaced with small scoop of ice cream. The rest of the dishes were forgettable. However, there were a couple huge issues with the service/restaurant itself:  1. Our courses were timed with that of another MUCH slower eating table. Most of my meal was spent without a plate in front of me. Last I checked Bonsoiree did not have time grouped seating. 2. Our server had terrible, revolting BO. 3. There is only one small bathroom for both men and women. 4. At the end of the meal we needed a cab home. Our waiter informed us that cabs drove by often enough, but I decided to have him request a cab anyway since it was late and I hadn't seen many pass while eating. He said he would call, but also suggested we wait for a cab in the hopes of catching one sooner. I ended up having to wait 20 minutes in light rain for a cab. Our waiter never called one for us as promised. My overall experience at Bonsoiree gets rounded up to two stars, barely.
