Went here on a Tuesday for lunch. It wasn't too crowded but there were plenty of people eating there. I loved the decor and feel of the place - everyone was so nice. Got a bistec (with cheese) and lechon sandwich to go along with a mango shake. Everything was so delicious! My bf and I will definitely be coming back - the breakfast and dinner looks great.
