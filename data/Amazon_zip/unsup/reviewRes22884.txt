The food is okay, but a "true" Chicago hot dog shouldn't cost this much. A hot dog, fries, and a drink will set you back at least $10. You can get better dogs and fries all over the city for a couple of bucks, so if you are attracted to bright shiny objects this might be a great place for you. If you want a great, cheap, real Chicago experience go to Susie's Beef or Duke's.
