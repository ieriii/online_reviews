maybe my expectations were too high- i thought a bar that was open (and packed to the freakin gills) on xmas would have some kind of special. even some nasty, holiday colored shot? a buck or 2 off a beer? nope. there i was, ready to get my holiday drink on, and everything was full price. and at hopleaf, full price= overpriced. you know what else? i realize you are a "beer bar/gastropub," but not many places are open, and i could do without the eyeroll when i order a miller lite (my bad, dude). i ask if they have any mexican beers. not a one. i ask if they have pyramid apricot wheat. nope. hoegaarden? you would think so, but again- no. WTF? i guess i'll shell out for an allagash, or $7 for a measly jim and ginger. and if the bartenders could be just a little more pleasant, this place would be greatly improved (yeah, sucks to work on xmas, but you're there, so move on). i didn't hate it, but it's just another place to get a bougie beer with an attitude.
