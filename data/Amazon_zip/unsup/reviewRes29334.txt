Three-star food, five-star execution. The food is what you'd expect for the price/place, but they get it out very quickly. It's a great place to put on speed dial if you live in the hood. I live about 1.5 blocks away and can call in an order, leave a few minutes later and it'll be ready when I get there. Not having to cook makes it taste so much better!
