I come here quite often when i'm craving pasta. It's the only place where I can get it just how I want it. I don't know of many places where you can pick your pasta and your sauce and it's a wide variety of both). I always get the same thing when I come here - tortellini with pesto sauce. MMMMMMMmmmmmm.  The place is never too crowded, I've always been seated right away. The waiter we usually get is very attentive and doesn't ever write down our orders which is fine with me since he's always right on the mark! The food is made very fast without ever comprising its deliciousness! It always happen - they bring me my plate and I think "Gee, small serving" and it is totally is NOT, must be an optical illusion because it fills me up every time. Their specials are always good too which is what my friend usually gets (they had a pasta with calamari and it was deeeeelish!) The price for its quality is surely hard to beat. \ My only complaint is the parking  but that would go for any store/restaurant in the fullerton and clark area :(
