What a fun place. A warning though, we waited outside in line for an hour before getting to the front of the line. Was it worth it? Yes! The food is great, I like their non-hotdog options (like boar) and their duckfat fries which are only offered on Saturdays (and either Friday or Sunday I can't remember) are terrific. Will be back for sure.
