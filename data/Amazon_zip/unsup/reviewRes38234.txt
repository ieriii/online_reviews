I am SO not a fan of places where you have to smash yourself up against the person standing beside you just so you all fit into the place. We stayed long enough for a beer, and then promptly headed a few doors down for dinner. Based on all the great reviews, I might be willing to give this place another chance, but not on a Saturday night.
