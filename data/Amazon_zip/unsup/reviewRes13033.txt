If you want delicious, authentic Cuban food in an intimate, cozy setting then Cafe 28 is for you. First off, all of the cocktails are good and strong from the Pisco Sours to the Mojitos. Also, the wine list is very good if you prefer wine. Your meal here starts with bread and butter, but my what butter! I don't know what they do, but it tastes like the butter has been blended with honey and some time of chili. So delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu at some time and it is all delicious. Last time I went, we started with the Calamar a la Parrilla, which is grilled calamari with roasted red pepper, sauteed vegetables and goat cheese. The combination was amazing. We followed this with mixed greens salad and the ropa vieja. Ropa Vieja, aka "old clothes" is one of my favorite Cuban dishes. It's name stems from the fact that this dish was traditionally prepared using leftover meat. Basically it is steak simmered in tomato and bell pepper sauce until it is literally falling apart. It is served with black beans, rice and plantains and it is absolutely delicious. For dessert we had the flan. Another amazing meal at Cafe 28. They will remain on my "must eat" list for whenever I visit Chicago.
