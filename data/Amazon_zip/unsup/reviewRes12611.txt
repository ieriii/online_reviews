This place is really nice, a great Lincoln Square hideaway. The bar is small but sweet, a nice place to grab a drink with a friend. Dining area is lovely, a nice place for a date or trio. I think I've had the Ropa Vieja every time I've been here and it's always so delicious that I don't think I'm ever going to stray, and my dining companions have always been delighted with their dishes too. All of my meals here have felt luxurious because the staff is never trying to push you out the door, they let you take the time you want to savor your meal and wine and dessert and conversation, and I'm thankful for their graciousness.
