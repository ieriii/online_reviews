This is really a four and half star review, Alinea lost half a star for its stuffy atmosphere but in a fine dining restaurant you always expect it to be stuffy to some degree. I ate here in January and like most people it was a special treat after hearing so much about this restaurant for years. My favourite dish was the plate that was a study in butter which had lobster,popcorn and curry all mixed together. A combination that shouldn't work but tasted amazing. The wagyu beef was also cooked to perfection (you will crave more however part of the allure of Alinea is that you will receive modest portions so that you do crave more). Keep in mind that two people will easily spend $500 in Alinea so my expectations will always be higher when that kind of cash is being thrown around. On a funny note one of our servers (you will have many at Alinea who are all highly trained and attentive)rebuked my girlfriend for getting her plate with a linen cover on it dirty as she put her butter knife on top of it. Funny but a bit strange to be ticked off for ultimately getting a side plate dirty. Overall a great evening but once you get the Alinea experience out of your system you won't rush back there.
