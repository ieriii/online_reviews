This was a great dining experience. It was recommended by my boyfriend's sister and what a great suggestion it was! BYO'd our own white wine which they chilled for us while we waited for our table (20 mins on a friday night at 7 not bad) ...with no corckage charge! They do take rezzos but only for larger groups. The food is great. We had the sampler appetizer dish to start...yummy fried shrip and marvelous crab Rangoon. mmmmm. Then we had a hot and sour shrimp soup...This was some of the best soup I ever had and it's served with it's own heating element so it is deliciously warm until the last drop. For dinner the Pad thai which was very delicious...I'm a huge fan of pad thai and this was a standout among the dish. Then...even though we were stuffed we had the banana spring roll desert, gooey and creamy with a flaky spring roll wrapper...it was delightful. We got some coffee and tea with our deserts...The coffee was a rich and delicious dark roast and jasmine tea was really flavorful. Grand bill total was only $32.00 ... yes for all of that food! Only warning: I was in a food coma for the rest of the night. I was planning on going to a party but passed out...when I asked my boyfriend why he didn't wake me up he said he couldn't because I had a huge content smile on my face in my comatose state.
