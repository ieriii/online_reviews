My first visit here and it didn't live up to it's local reputation or most of the reviews here. We went for Sunday brunch with another couple. The atmosphere is nice and the waitstaff are friendly and welcoming but the food was just BAD. I ordered cornbread french toast, the cornbread was dry, it was cold when it arrived at the table and there was no batter to speak of although it had, apparently, been on the grill at some point because parts of it were browned. My wife ordered scrambled eggs and toast - not too hard to get right, eh? Well the eggs weren't scrambled, they were just broken into an omelet pan and cooked until rubbery; the hash browns were burnt. There are plenty of diners and cafes on Halsted and Broadway, do yourself a favor and eat there. If you're vegetarian, they'll accommodate you. Skip this place.
