I heart Tank. They have the best Vietnemese pork chops (Believe me, they're the best... I've tried them allllll). Sometimes I have cravings for Pho (very good here too), but for some reason, I always end up with #100. The egg rolls here are very yummy too and I love that they have pulp in their dipping sauces. Yum! I also love their pickled veggies that come with the rice dishes. But really... its all about the pork chops here. =)
