I've only had deep dish once before in my life, and that was at Zachary's in Berkeley. It was damn good, considering that it's in CA. But, if you want the real thing, Giordano's is THE place! It gets very crowded here, so best come early, or be willing to wait at least an hour before you get seated. And then another 30-45 min for the pizza to actually cook. Everything is made fresh to order, and when it gets to your table, it is piping hot. It's cool that they serve it on a stool-like thing to make it easier for the servers to cut the pizza. For many people, 1 slice is enough to satiate your hunger for pizza and make you come crawling back for more next time. I'd have to say the best thing about the pizza is that since the cheese is on the bottom, and the toppings mixed in the marinara sauce, you don't really taste the greasiness that you get on regular pizzas. The thought of it kind of sickens me and makes me think twice about eating pizza. But not at Giordano's. Definitely a must for people visiting Chicago.
