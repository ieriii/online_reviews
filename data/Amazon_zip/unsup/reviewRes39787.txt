awesome birthday party idea! contrary to some of the other reviews, service was great. not only were we seated on time for our reservation, our waitress helped us order - even making a few suggestions for things we wouldn't otherwise have known about (hello, delicious seafood pancake.) once that was settled, the food came out very quickly. after we got cooking, the server was nice enough to change out our grill a few times, which helps reduce the amount smoke coming from your table. i wouldn't recommend this kind of experience to picky eaters or to the unadventurous. none of us were korean, so we didn't know what any of the sides on the table were - but we happily tested away anyway. as for our meat selections, we ordered short rib (very good,) chicken (decent) and bacon (the least favorite of the group.) we also took a risk and ordered some spicy squid - which ended up being a big hit. we had no idea what we were doing when we ordered, but we still ended up having an awesome meal - so i can only imagine what it'd be like to eat with someone who's familiar with korean food. most likely amazeballs. a few FYIs - you'll have to take your shoes off. i wasn't expecting this and i don't think the rest of my party was either. more importantly, the vents above the tables aren't very powerful. (read: you will smell like korean bbq afterward.) come to dinner with only the essentials (best to leave coats at home or in the car.) overall, it was a super fun and enjoyable experience - my entire party had a great time. side note - one sure fire way to know this place is legit is by its clientele - 90% of the people dining that saturday night were korean. looking forward to visiting again!
