Yummy time here after being on a train from California for 2 days. They let me order a personal size pizza even though it was dinner and that size pizza is offered only for lunch. thank you so much. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Had a nice conversation at the bar with some military bro. He said he was trying to drink more beer so he could bro out with his bros. His drink of choice is normally vodka/cran... teehee. However, I feel every bar should have at least one West Coast Microbrew available and Giordano's didn't have. East Coast beer just isn't as good.
