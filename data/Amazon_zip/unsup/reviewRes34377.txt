yeah, it's just okay. everyone loves this place, and I hate to be Debbie Downer (fuck, I just became my mother) but I'm just not that hot on this place. The food is decent, but it's not the hidden gem that everyone makes it out to be. It's just too hipster & they always always always manage to screw up my order.
