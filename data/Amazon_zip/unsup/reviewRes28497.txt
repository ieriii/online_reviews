The Frontera Grill was one of my better experiences eating in Chicago during the week I was there. We were seated very quickly, which I hear is a rarity. Maybe if we had to wait an hour, I would have been less impressed with the place. The atmosphere is colorful, the patrons were loud, the tables a little cramped. There were many enticing choices on the menu and many dishes that were new to me. We decided to make dinner out of a few small plates: the corn soup, trio of civiche and sopes de ranceros. All were very flavorful and quite tasty. Although it didn't look like a lot of food, the portions were satisfying. My partner had room for desert and I had a hot coco. The service was friendly and prompt. Attentive, perhaps a bit too much, even. I thought the pacing was good, and never felt rushed to leave despite the popularity of the place. Certainly not a street taco vendor, you pay for the ambience, the service, the exciting menu and the quality ingredients. A little much for day to day, but a great treat once in a while.
