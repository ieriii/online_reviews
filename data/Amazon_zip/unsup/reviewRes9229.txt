I love this place, they have authentic Persian food and use ethnic spices which is huge for me. In my previous review I wrote about my Reza dislikes, I feel as if the food is too mild, but Noon O Kabob is completely opposite. It's a small place, family owned and they are just so friendly and really pay attention to their cooking. Since I was born and raised in Iran I typically crave Persian food and it's hard to make it out to the suburbs and have my mom cook, so Noon O Kabob does the trick. Please try this place out and don't be afraid to taste everything! My all time favorite is Ash, it's a traditional Persian soup that is perfect on a cold winter night.
