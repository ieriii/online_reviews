I hate to say it, but this is the only good pizza I've had in Chicago thus far. Closest you'll get to New Haven pizza, filled with a luscious amount of generous sodium. And they have bacon, I like Canadian bacon as much as the next person, but I want strips of America on my pizza. I've ordered 3 pies in the last two weeks so I don't have to do dishes. Don't judge me.
