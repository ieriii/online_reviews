I came here during restaurant week with some friends. This restaurant is very masculine. Like we were supposed to have a larger group (with more boys) but some people cancelled, so we just had three girls and one guy. But we still pulled all of our collective efforts forward to eat as much as possible. I was so full that I was practically rolling home afterwards, and I'm going to be scared to eat meat for awhile. The food is tasty. Get a bed of salad to make you feel better about yourself when you get the meat, and be sure to try the lobster bisque. I think I tried most of the meats, and my favorites were the house special sirloin, the flank steak, and the ribs. We also ordered the Brazillian papaya cream a la cart for dessert and split it among the four of us (it's a pretty big serving so you need to share). It was refreshing but a tad too rich after such a large meal. Their other desserts were just a variety of cakes and pies, which are also pretty heavy. They should offer sorbets or some other kind of lighter palette cleanser. The wine wall with the acrobat was pretty cool. We tried to watch them after our meal (we weren't seated near the wall) but the person was already gone :( Tip is that if you don't mention it's restaurant week to your server, they will give you the bill with the full price, so be sure to mention it. We just thought that it would just apply it to all the people who were eating there, so we were surprised by the bill and asked our server to correct it.
