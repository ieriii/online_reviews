very cute and cozy bar & restaurant. i was very glad the upstairs bar (cash only; no food!) was open b/c everything was filled up when we got there at 8pm on a thursday night. great beer list and we moved once there was a table in the restaurant and ordered some food. the fries were delicious, the mussels looked great (didn't have any but my table did) and the server brought us some tasty bacon & brussel sprouts which were a mistaken order by the kitchen (yes please!).  i would say hopleaf is a great place to catch up with friends over some tasty beer and more sophisticated bar food. do it!
