one of the most memorable dining experience.old school/classic chicago.from the food to impaccable service, every thing was just great!a spot-on.It may look expensive and feel expensive.and yes it is pricey.but, in the end, it is such a bargain.best bread/pastry couse. spot on amuse-bouche.generous cheese couse.even amazing coffee!and they have by far the best dessert menu in the city.I am not a steak person, but Tru converted me.perfect for every occasion.ambience could seem little dated, but it's classy.can't go wrong with anything on the menu.wine list could use little more affordable wine though.don't forget your jacket.you will need them.
