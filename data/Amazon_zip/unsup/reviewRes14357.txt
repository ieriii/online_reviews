Fantastic, legit Cuban food. Sweet, tiny little place that has some really cool stuff up on the walls - but it's absolutely tiny. Went with a friend who had just moved to Chicago from Miami - and her mother was from Panama. Basically she said it was fantastic - and has been back several times. Bit of a wait - unsurprising because of how absolutely tiny the place was - but worth it...for me.
