Go to the Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig! For very reasonably priced fine dining in a very comfortable casual atmosphere and food that will knock your socks off. Here's the scoop. 1. Go early (5-5:30pm) so you don't have to wait and then complain on Yelp about it. 2. Try a small plate from each of the different categories (Anitpasti, Smears, etc) 3. I've had the pleasure of dining here twice now and the stand out items on the menu for me were: - Butternut Squash - Bone Marrow - Fried Manchego - Pork Neck Bone Rillette - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder Any day is a good day to eat pig! So enjoy!
