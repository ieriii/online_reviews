There's 2 bits everyone talks about with Geja's: The food, and the experience. Neither were all that great. I've had much better fondue and experiences at Fondue Stube, and even the Melting Pot despite it being a chain. We were seated next to a loud, obnoxious group of people, and the lighting was so dim that we couldn't tell if our steak we were cooking was medium rare, raw, or well done. Don't get me wrong, I love a nice dim ambiance, but when your waiter has a flashlight (seriously!) so that the menu can be read... well... that's a bit too much... The fondue was not noteworthy at all. First, there aren't a whole lot of choices. We each ordered a fondue 'meal', consisting of salad, cheese fondue, meat/fish fondue, and chocolate fondue. There's no choice of what dressing comes on your fondue, only one variety of cheese fondue, only one variety of oil fondue, and only one variety of dessert fondue. This is not the case at a place like Fondue Stube or Melting Pot, where you have choices in ALL of those categories. I can see people thinking Geja's is romantic if they're not seated next to an obnoxiously loud table, but I really didn't find the experience all that compelling. All in all, I was pretty underwhelmed with Geja's and would strongly recommend you dine somewhere else.
