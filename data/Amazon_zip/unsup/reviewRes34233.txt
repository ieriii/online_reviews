Our carry-out order arrived packaged nicely and piping hot, even after the 10-minute walk home. Each pasta dish we ordered was AMAZING in flavor; even the simple red sauce was incredible. The prices were reasonable, and I'm looking forward to trying a dine-in experience soon, not to mention another carry-out dinner! =)
