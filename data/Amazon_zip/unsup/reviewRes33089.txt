When brunch died and went to heaven, they named heaven Yolk. You will wait forever, because the people who showed up before you are busy watching angels dance on their tongues and in their happy bellies. You will wait your turn, and then after you're done marveling at the INSANE and mouth-watering menu, you will come close to fainting with hungry fever. Then you will receive your dish and float away on a fat cloud.
