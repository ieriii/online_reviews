I can not believe people would compare this place to Kuma's. A.) it is a clear and obvious rip off of Kuma's. So no points for originality. B.) their basic ingrediants are inferior, you can tell they cut corners in a lot of their cooking, like pre-cooked packaged bacon, cheese sauce in the mac and cheese as oppose to real cheese, etc. C.) while their service isn't rude their staff seem to be extremely incompetent. When my party walked in there was no server on duty, we seem to have three servers(none of which knew what was going on) and they brought out the wrong food meant for other tables TWICE and our appetizer was brought out after our regular meal. They server then used the excuse that they have not yet numbered tables and orders occasionally get mixed? Really? Great excuse. Overall it was pretty dissapointing and they will not have my repeat business.
