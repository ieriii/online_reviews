On a whim, we decided to come here for hot dogs. We were in the mood for hot dogs and wanted to try a new place. After pulling up and realizing it is a cash only establishment, we pulled out and went to Walgreen's. We parked and order two Superdawgs to go. I was nervous about my fries getting soggy so I had my husband hold the box while I started eating and driving. Unsafe? Possibly but those fries were worth it! So crispy, crunchy and full of flavor! I stopped after a few and when we arrived home, started in. Wow! That is one big hot dog! I loved the pickled green tomato but could have done with the red ones as well. The fries were still crispy and I was stuffed after my meal. Sure, it's a little bit of a drive but aren't some things worth it?
