I've just recently discovered my favorite Thai dish of all time: Basil Chicken Fried Rice. Since then, it's the only thing I order! It's a simple and common dish apparently and so not a lot of Thai restaurants have it on their menu, but they will prepare it should you ask them to. Such is the case with Opart. I called in for a carry out and they made it customized. And my goodness was it good! Plus I love the size of the carry out dish! You get your money's worth! Placing and picking up the order was a breeze and the whole transaction went over very nicely!
