Hugh disappointment. Love the bar, have gone there for years. Think I ate there before and remember it as very good gastro fare. But last night, ugh, ugh, ugh. Ordered the brisket plate on a recommendation - and understand this is a signature dish and it was unedible. Had my companion taste, and he said the same - so two of us felt the same way. They did notice I wasn't eating it, and asked if it was okay - so they did make good and give me an order to take home. Haven't tasted it yet, so not quite certain. I am not afraid to send stuff back, but didn't this time because just because just had had it, know what I mean? Just done!!! Oh well. The mussels were very good. and plenty for the table to share. Service a bit slow, especially for the appetizers. Had to ask twice where they were. But the staff is nice, no attitude which is always a bonus. Will try again, but will stay away from the brisket. Maybe just go to the bar!
