Though I've been to the Lakeview restaurant a bunch of times, this was my first time dining at the Edgewater UG. I was very pleased to discover that mac and cheese was on the menu at both locations! Love that stuff. UG is one of those places where I really struggle to settle on dishes because everything sounds so fantastic. One of these days I should get around to trying their bacon-wrapped meatloaf, because there's no way that could be anything less than heavenly. LOVE: - macaroni and cheese - eco-friendliness - decor...wood, local art, awesome mosaic in the women's restroom. It's just a huge, comfortable, beautiful space. (The entire restaurant, I mean...not the bathroom specifically, haha). - they serve Metropolis coffee! And a bacon Bloody Mary! I need to go back for brunch.
