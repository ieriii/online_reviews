I'm honestly not sure what all the fuss is about. We stopped by around 5 on a weeknight to grab a bite on the way home from work, and were promptly seated outside (the inside was already full). Our table was adjacent to a heater, but also adjacent to the bus stand, and all of the servers and bussers congregated basically on top of us for the duration of our stay. The service was just okay - our server was a little abrasive. The food was just okay - we ordered a selection of cheeses that were delicious, but minuscule portions for the amount being charged. The bread served with the cheese was delicious, The wine was just okay - and I'd expect something at least *good* for $15/glass. We left without ordering more food - it wasn't worth the discomfort of the experience, the poor service, or the price point - and I probably won't be back.
