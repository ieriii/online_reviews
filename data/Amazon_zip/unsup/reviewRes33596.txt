I lived in NY for 3 years, and there are a ton of good falafel places, and I definitely looked for them too. I know about Mamoun's, Sido, Maoz, and I'm sure many more that i've been to but do not remember the names of. I've got to say, Sultan's Market not only hangs with them, it BEATS THEM ALL. It is excellent middle eastern food at an excellent price. If you live in the area, be happy in knowing that you are truly lucky. Best Falafel. Ever.
