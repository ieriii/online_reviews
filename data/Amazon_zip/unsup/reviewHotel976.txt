This place had some major downfalls, with a few good qualities that I will give them full credit for. Downfalls: NOISY! I booked through a show I go to 6 times a year and it was my first time at the Amalfi. I got a room on the alley (lovely I know), and there was constant noise ALL NIGHT LONG! Glass breaking, loud party goers, blasted trash trucks at all hours! Maybe invest in better windows Amalfi? My favorite part was on the day I checked out the maids came to all the rooms on my floor knocking at 7:30 and when I said I was still using the room she shouted through the door "When are you leaving!", um... not the friendliest service! I also had an issue with my shower and called down and asked them to service it 2 days in a row and don't think anyone ever came to fix it because it still had issues. My company had to send me a box and they charged me a $5 recieving fee? They never even brought the box to my room, I had to go down two days in a row and ask for it. Good qualities: Nice rooms for the price, Chicago is PRICEY! Within walking distance to my destination the Merchandise Mart. Continental breakfast on every floor was a nice touch. Never got to the happy hour because I was working but I heard great thigns about it. They have umbrella's in the room you can use or purchase if you decide to keep, this came into great use as it rained most of my trip. If I chose to stay here again I would demand a room on a different side of the building and put out the do not disturb sign on my check out day!!!
