I had been lamenting the demise of my favorite Ethiopian joint (Sheba Caf) and was very happy to finally stumble into Demera. The space is comfortable and it is fun to see how some of the fixtures from the previous tenant (a Chinese restaurant) have been morphed into new purposes. A fellow yelp buddy and I popped in for lunch recently and it was delightful! The lunch special is an excellent value - a mere $7.95 gets you four choices from the smaller lunch menu. The food is fresh, plentiful and satisfying. I think it's only available during the week, though. If it were available on weekends, it would be even better. Based on my lunch experience, I will definitely be back to try some of the delights that are offered on the much larger dinner menu. The dinner prices seem to be very fair and there are some mouth-watering choices. I will definitely update my review once I've tried the dinner service. Service was friendly. The food did take a little while, but that has truthfully been my experience in most Ethiopian restaurants. If you are in the area at lunchtime, I highly recommend it! I'm convinced that dinner would be even better! I'll let you know soon!
