How do you say, "Damn that's a delicious sandwich," in Cubano? This little stop offers huge flavors, and authentic Cuban fare. It is small inside, with a little counter space to enjoy your food, but there are a handful of tables on the patio. There is also a bowl of water outside for your dog, or your buddy that forgot his wallet at home.  My favorite sandwich is the Media Noche, which is the Cubano on a delicious sweet n' savory bread. The sandwich has cheese, pickles, mustard, ham, and a karate chop of flavor. 90 Miles Cafe also has this smokin' hot red pepper sauce that is incredible. The sauce definitely burns your mouth, but in a good way; Fellow spice aficionados will enjoy the heat for sure. Look for this Cuban Cafe to be on an upcoming Diners - Drive ins - and Dives. That spiky haired flake Guy Fieri was spotted here recently shooting an episode, enjoying his food, and looking like an idiot.
