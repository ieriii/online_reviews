This is really an awesome gem for crepes. I love crepes to death and I hate places that have tiny ones with no filling. Icosium did not disappoint. I had the Banana Nutella crepes. They came with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream and had a ton of nutella and fresh bananas inside. It was topped with chocolate sauce and yummy whipped cream! I also had the cream of broccoli soup which was very good and a hot chocolate which was amazing. The price is right and the service is wonderful.
