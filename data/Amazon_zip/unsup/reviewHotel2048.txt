Got a pretty decent deal on Priceline with "name your own price" at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. The location is fantastic: close to a variety of el trains, the loop, and other neighborhoods and shopping. The views are beautiful and the bar is a great place to unwind as the sun sets and the city lights come on. However, I've had better experiences at other hotels. Upon checking in, the front desk continuously tried to up sell me. It would cost another $20/night to have a room on the outside, that had a view. We declined, and got a nice room with absolutely no view in the interior corridor of the hotel. They also claimed there were no rooms with king size beds unless we upgraded. I'm not sure if they could see the price we paid, but if so, is there a certain price threshold that grants you access to the nicer rooms? I'd be pretty upset if I paid close to regular price on priceline but still had to pay another $20/night for a nice view. But if you won't be hanging out in your room much, this hotel may be a good bet. The fitness center and pool were pretty large and were open from 6AM - 11PM. The bar had a happy hour which included a complimentary buffet of jalapeno poppers, wings and a crudite platter. The bartenders were friendly and made some excellent cocktails.  The only other minus was since this is on top of a convention center, it is somewhat hard to get to. You enter the doors, go down a hall, take an elevator to the 9th floor, cross over to the other side of the lobby, and then take an elevator to your floor. Not the most convenient entry. Just break up the long trek with a drink at the bar, and it's worth it.
