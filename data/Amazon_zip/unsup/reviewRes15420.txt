By far one of the top brunches of my life. I've since had dreams about the bacon fat popcorn. We had a large group so luckily I got to taste several foods and beers, and everything was incredible. I highly recommend the Eugene, and I'm usually not a dark beer person, but it was just so chocolaty and delicious. Of course we also had to try the Eugene cake and ice cream, which was also fabulous. We had an awesome waitress who gave us great recommendations and... wait for it... offered to split the check!!! This is such a rarity in Chicago and we had 8 people! I'm going back next weekend. Parking is even free on the side street half a block away under the train tracks. I'd like to live here.
