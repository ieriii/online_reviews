3 stars or 4 stars that is the question. I decided to go with 4 stars because, other than you can't do .5 stars here. XOCO was overall really tasty. I had the short rib soup and tasted the short rib sandwich, and pork soup, as well as the free gifts from the kitchen of Cuban sandwich, churros, and 3 different types of hot chocolate....yay for having worked in the industry! Free food! My short rib soup was tasty but really really salty. Overall not sure it was worth the bucks for it. The pork soup was better and I would defiantly try it again. Maybe. The short rib sandwich was, well, a short rib sandwich. The Cuban, oh the Cuban!!! Best Cuban I've ever had and I don't even really like them! Delicious meat and avocado and who knows what magic...crunchy bread...absolute perfection!! Churros were fab, of course, and the hot chocolates were just ok. I didn't like the almond one but I don't like to mix nuts and chocolate even though I love dark chocolate covered whole nuts....yes, I'm weird leave me alone!! I also wasn't a fan of the one made with water...rather bitter though now that I think about it perhaps would be tasty as a dip for churro...hmm. And last but not least the good ole regular hot cocoa otherwise known as my favorite.....Rick, gimme a spicy one and I'll be one happy girl! Go for the cubano.
