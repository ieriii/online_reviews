Came yet again to this awesome italian yummy for my sister's birthday. HERE'S WHAT ROCKED! - 2007 Red Zinfindel Terra De' Oro (CA)- for serious red wine drinkers, this totally is so good! Full bodied, complex, enjoyable. - Appetizer: Crostini di Avocado- another mindblowing dish. Our table favorite!!  Creamy avocado, basil pesto, parmesan cheese and chopped tomatoes - delectable! YUMMY! -Fried Calamari-Delicious! light and crisp. -Meat lasagna-very tasty; fresh-tasting layers of pasta, sizeable portions for lasanga lovers. PRETTY GOOD BUT NOT STANDOUT - Linguine and clams in a White wine sauce. Seafood all very fresh but not memorable compared to other dishes. - Dessert: panna cotta-chocolate Hazelnut. Thick creamy.
