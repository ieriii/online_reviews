(the other location gets 5 stars, but this one sometimes is swingy in quality) This review isn't about the great pizza, or who it challenges for what sort of pizza challenge in the city. This is specific to one thing: lunch. Holy cow is the special efficient! If you're the type to imbibe, you might actually be stealing from them. Well, if you can drink just the one you get with the special. (Alcoholism - it's how they get ya) Yes, yes, it's lunch so we don't imbibe. Soda's also free, Coke products. Warning - no free refills in the special. (Sugarholism - it's how they get ya) The deal's a drink and a personal pan with one topping. Extra toppings cost a little bit more. I usually got sausage, onions, jalapenos because I'm a weirdo and it made the afternoon meetings shorter. It does take a little while if you don't call ahead - you're looking at a 45 minute lunch at least. (so, maybe call ahead, slacker)
