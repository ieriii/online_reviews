Tonight I met up with some friends to grab dinner....we were in the area of Mayan Palace and decided to give it a try. I have to tell you the service was incredible! Really outstanding. When we arrived we were greeted and seated. As you would expect we were given water, salsa and chips (with a smile). A minute later our waiter came up and greeted us and gave us our menus (with a smile). After telling us what the special was we decided on one sangria and two mojitos along with some queso fundito. A few minutes later our drinks were delivered with our appetizer (and a smile). The drinks were really big....pint glasses...only $4....and quite strong. The queso was very delicious and had a garnish of fresh thinly sliced jalapeno pepper (yum). A few minutes later we ordered our food from our (smiling) waiter. ***as an aside, our water glasses were continuously filled throughout the meal*** When our food arrived (with a smile) everyone was very pleased...even my picky friend. I ordered the Mayan Chimichanga and it was very good. The ambiance was very warm and inviting and there was a significant crowd of people dining there for a stormy summer night. It was obvious many of them were regulars as they knew the friendly staff. The main reason I am giving Mayan Palace five stars is because of their amazing service. I did think the food was very good, but the service (with a smile) made my night. I will definitely go back!
