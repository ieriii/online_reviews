I've eaten here once, and only once, because I was sick for the rest of that night. I think it was the puddle of butter that every item, especially the steak, was drowning in. I had Morton's the night before, which has a lot more variety and was more enjoyable both during and after the meal. For steak, I'd rather go to Morton's or Wildfire.
