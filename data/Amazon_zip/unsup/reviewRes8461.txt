Thank you Spacca Napoli for introducing me to bufaleta pizza. I had no idea how to pronounce the pizzas when I went into this little gem, but the waitor was extremely friendly and helped me interpret everything. I had an awesome goat cheese & lentil appetizer, 2 pizzas (amongst friends) and spumoni rolled in cocoa powder and hazelnuts. All fresh, authentic, and ridiculously delicious. Check out my food blog for more in-depth descriptions for several other restaurants, too: http://chicagofoodfan.wo No editing here, folks - eat up!
