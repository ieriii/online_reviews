I came here when the aunts were in town, so the family parked near my place and then we walked to Glenn's. I wouldn't consider Glenn's to be a Diner. Its most definitely a seafood restaurant. If you go to Glenn's go for the seafood and don't touch the diner food! Their selection of fish dishes is very impressive! Taking my family to a different restaurant is very difficult. I think its because my parents lived in the suburbs for too long. My mom kinda freaked out at the prices of the fish, ordered the Russian Ruben and didn't like it. I had the Black Russian and thought it was ok, my sister had the meatloaf and that was ok....We were kinda disappointed at the Diner food and thought those dishes didn't live up to the name of the restaurant. My aunts ordered the mahi mahi and the alaskan halibut. Being the nicest, most coolest aunts that they are, they let the rest of the family (except my brother, who is deathly allergic to seafood) have a taste. And I have to say that was the best fish I've ever had! I've even gone to places like Devon Seafood downtown and loved Glenn's fish a lot more than Devon's. You will never look at fish at another restaurant the same again. Glenn's fish makes other high-end fish dishes seem like fishticks that you find in the frozen food section of the Jewels. I will definitely come back, either with just the sister or just the aunts (because they know good food).
