To all the nice people of chicago, I would like to share my experience at 90 miles, I am a cuban native living in Miami I was in a business trip in Chicago and had dinner at 90 miles and I was totally amazed knowing that Chicago had such an authentic Cuban restaurant, for the first time in years I ate better Cuban food than in Miami and that is hard to sale. I really enjoyed it , for all you locals I strongly suggest this place great food , freindly staff and awesome crowd I wish they would Open in Miami soon!!!!
