Awesome awesome food and GREAT outdoor seating! I've never seen an outside seating area so big and comfortable. The inside is nice, but when the weather is nice too, there is no one inside...allll outside. There is a nice little pond, too. The menu here is quite extensive, much better than my lincoln park fave, Athenian Room. There is just soooo much more to choose from! Hot and cold apps up the wazoo and seafood options are must as well. The service is great and the prices aren't too shabby either. The wine is nicely priced too. Will come here again, such a beautiful area.
