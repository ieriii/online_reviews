Good food! My hubby's favorite food in the world is Korean. So therefore, for his birthday surprise I approached my Korean students at school and asked them... "where do YOU go?." Many of them answered San Soo Gab San.  The place is set up with raised private rooms, which sit around a table that are equipped to handle real charcoal grills... this is unlike most Korean places.  I ordered the chap che, Bulgogi, kalbi, and the prime rib, as well as steak and chicken to grill. If you have never eaten Korean this way, it is the " you cook it yourself" format. They also bring out massive amounts of panchan, which are little appetizers of fish, veggies, pickled things, GOOD STUFF!  I would really recommend this place to anyone looking for something a little different. Only one or two warnings... the wait-staff really doesn't speak english very well, so make sure that you know what you want to order and speak clearly, or bring a Korean! Also, careful getting out of the parking lot! It's dangerous! :0)
