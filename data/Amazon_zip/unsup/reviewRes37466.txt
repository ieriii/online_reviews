When I came in for the first time, I stood at the bar looking over their extensive craft beer list. Someone next to me tried to order a Bud Lite. To my endless joy, the bartender scoffed and said, "We don't serve that here." He ended up recommending a light pilsner to the poor fella and I have been laughing about it ever since. Food: They tend to be known for the mussels (Belgian or White-Wine) and that crazy peanut butter and jelly concoction. Normally adventurous, I can never pry myself away from the mussels to try anything else. Atmosphere: Plan on waiting to sit. Beer snobs hike for hundreds of thousands of miles just to drink in this Mecca. It's worth it. The two-level restaurant in back is cozy and the bar in front is always swarming with people. A friend described it as a place for men who look like lumberjacks and girls with lots of tattoos. That is absolutely right (and ideal for any night in my book).
