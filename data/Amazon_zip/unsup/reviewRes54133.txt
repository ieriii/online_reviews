Holy crap this place is uh-mazing! I had some of the porkbelly soup and was blown away by flavors. The pork belly was crispy yet tender, and the broth was just so tasty. It had plenty of avocados, and my mexican friend tells me this is how it should be. I also had the the churro with chocolate, and I could not get enough of it. I don't even like churro (at least the ones I've eaten from Sams club - LOL)! I docked a point off since parking sucks in this area and the seating is lame.
