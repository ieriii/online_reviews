A veritable feast of deliciousness! My lady friend and I decided to go all out with a meal fit for Costa Rican royalty. After a round of guacamole, we split three empanadas: spinach/cheese, plantain and zucchini. The empanada was perfectly flaky and they were all great, but I was most partial to the plantain. Despite the fact that I was probably full enough at that point, I still had a veggie burrito on the way. Stuffed with extra mushrooms and zucchini, it was one of the best burritos I've ever tasted. Generally, I'm a carnivore, and I have to have chicken or another dead animal in my tortilla to make a burrito worthwhile... but not so here. Delicious, gigantic and cheap. Is it wrong that I want to go back and have a meal of just oatmeal shakes and plantains?? Mmm...
