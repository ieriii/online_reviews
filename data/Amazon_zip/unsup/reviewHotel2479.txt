Stayed here in July for a conference - it was alright, just glad I didn't have to foot the bill! I had a corner room on the rear of the building and had a view of the Sears Tower. At night it was a little noisy hearing the train pass, but I got used to it after a while. My room did not have 2 bathrooms as several others have mentioned, but I think it's because I had a corner room. The second day of my stay, the cleaning crew took my iron! I had to call for a replacement, and they had it to me in about 15 minutes. Other than that, I had no complaints.
