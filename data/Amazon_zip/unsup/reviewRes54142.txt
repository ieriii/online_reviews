Why are people complaining about service? You don't come to a place like this for service, you come for the food. You knew going into the experience you would have to wait so why post a complaint when you arrive and SURPRISE, there is a wait. You also don't come for the ambiance so why comment. I had-1. Chips w/Guac and Salsa- So so but didn't come for the chips/salsa.2. Ahodaga Torta- Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. It was delicious, a must get. 3. Aztec Hot Chocolate- Very good. Best Hot Chocolate I have had, love the fresh chocolate made in house with the touch of chile/all spice. 4. Churros- nice touch to end the meal.Come for the food, leave your complaining at home. One of the waitresses will warn you of the wait when you arrive so don't complain after you wait, it was your choice.
