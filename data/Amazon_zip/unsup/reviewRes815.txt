Great place. Had the foie dog as well as the merguez sausage, both were absolutely delicious. Very flavorful and moist sausages, and great flavor combinations with the toppings. Doug was there both times I have been and is very friendly. He clearly cares a lot about his business. Get there early as the line gets long, but once you order there are usually tables available and the service is fast.
