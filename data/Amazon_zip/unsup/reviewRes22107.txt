This place is great I have been going here since I was a little kid. The burgers are great they do get a little soggy sometimes though. I love their fries. I love the fact they put a slice of pickle in the side with not too hot pepper in your burger box. It's a great late night restaurant, or maybe you just want to eat a burger in the car while in your pj's. I never had a complaint with this place. I sure will keep returning.
