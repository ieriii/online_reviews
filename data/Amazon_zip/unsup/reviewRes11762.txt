I went to Piece last night, and though it wasn't my first time there, I felt I had to write a review to rave about how well our group was treated. We went there with a group of 8 at 8 PM. It was packed as expected. The host told us that our table would be ready in 15 minutes as a table of 8 just paid and were finishing up their beers. Well, we ended up waiting almost an hour for that group to clear, but in the meantime, the host and another person, who I assume was the manager, came to our group another two times to apologize and promise that we'd be "well taken care of" while we were there. They were extremely gracious and kind, and I liked the idea of being "well taken care of," so I wasn't that mad about waiting. The dinner proceeded normally, nothing really special. However, when we received our bill and saw a whopping $31 taken off the bill as "good will" and a huge heart drawn around it, I definitely really good about this place. Karaoke started around 10, and even though this place was packed, nobody was going up to sing. Six of us were able to get up to sing a song without any wait. We had a super fun time! Food was pretty good. All the pizzas are build your own, and luckily for us, we had a Yale-ite with us who said that typical New Haven toppings were mashed potatoes and bacon. Mashed potatoes on pizza? It totally works. I also loved the clams.
