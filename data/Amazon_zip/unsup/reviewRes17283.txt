the violet hour is hip. super hip. there's even a poem about unicorns on their website! unicorns! majestic horse hybrids aside, the violet hour is many things, but one thing it is not? a secret. prepare yourself for long lines on weekends unless you go early (i recommend a pre-dinner drink rather than post-dinner for a shot at being seated on a thursday, friday or saturday). going on a weeknight with a smaller group also usually gets you seated relatively quickly. however, once in, the atmosphere is fabulous and well, sexy. velvet curtains, high back chairs and low lighting definitely make you feel like you're somewhere special. it's styled to be like a speakeasy, where you sit, relax and drink. i definitely felt transported back to the 20's with the hushed tones and decor, which i loved. the servers and mixologists know their stuff- the cocktails are certainly unique (note: you pay the price for this 'uniqueness'). i can't speak to the food, i didn't try it, but everything we saw walk by looked tasty. a must visit unique chicago place.
