Each and every time I visit them I'm always happy with their product, price and friendly service... it never ceases to amaze me the new items they create, they're all great! While I've tried nearly all the menu items, my staple is their DAGWOOD creation :) with extra sauce... it NEVER fails to overfill me all the time... the rest of my family too enjoys trying their new/seasonal items. Please remember if you're looking for HEALTH food, while they're meat free since '83 and non dairy is always an option, it's still a diner :)
