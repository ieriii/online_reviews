Me and my boyfriend went to TDB on my birthday, they send me an email for a free meal for my birthday (nice :)). And it was so easy to use the certificate by just presenting it to your server.  Everything is good as always, especially the part that they have a dancer inside the mirror, it makes you enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Service was attentive. Meat was delich, perfectly cooked The salad bar was good, the seared ahi tuna was so good that i had almost 15 pieces.
