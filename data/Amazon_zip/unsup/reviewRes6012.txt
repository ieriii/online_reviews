Wildfire is one of my favorite steak restaurants in the city. When I don't have the kind of money to spend on a place like Chicago Chop House, I head over to this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant to get a quality, affordable steak. First of all, the atmosphere is great! Decorated in classic 1920's decor, this place is a wonderful fusion of both contemporary and Roaring 20's style. The space is multi-tiered and enormous. The only "beef" I have with the atmosphere is that when the place is at full capacity the acoustics tend to make the room very loud, making it hard to enjoy dinner conversation. Not a big deal though, since the food makes you forget all about the conversation anyway. Try the French Onion soup --- excellent. Also, the crusted medallion steaks are phenomenal. I recommend mustard and blue cheese crusted steak medallions, they are my favorite. Try them both with a glass of Robert Mondavi 2003, and you won't be disappointed. This place is a great steak house, with so much potential to become a premier steak house in a few years time.
