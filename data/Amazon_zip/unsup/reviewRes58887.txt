This was our second visit to Sunda and it was as great as the first time, if not better. We celebrated the 15th annniversary of our first date--and the food and atmosphere were just perfect. Service was terrific, the food was unique and yummy, and the personal service was unforgettable--particularly the Ridiculous dessert we were surprised with from management in honor of our big day. I highly recommend Sunda to anybody who loves food and a great atmosphere that showcases Chicago culinary at its fineset.
