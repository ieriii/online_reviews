I wanted to love this place, I really did...but I dont, this place is just average. We walked in and we were greeted immediately; off to a great start! I wish this were the case. We were seated and given menus, our waiter did not return for 20 minutes! BTW, I was starved, can I get a snack or something to hold me over? Finally our server comes back and just stared at me...finally he asked if we were ready to order. We ordered cheese and meat empanadas, they were pretty good. Not the best I have ever had but good none the less. We also ordered a cuban sandwich and Ropa Vieja (shredded beef). The Ropa Vieja was top notch, the beef melted in your mouth and the sauce was delish. Unfortunately the Cuban Sandwich was'nt as good as we had hoped. I am not Cuban but i can taste a good cuban sandwich when I eat one and this one was just average. The one thing that I LOVED were the Yuca Con Mojo (Cassava in garlic sauce) YUM! I have never been a huge fan of Cassava but these were fantastic. One more thing that you must know about this place, its BYOB! Why didnt I know this before I went? Bad Sammie (Slapping my own hand). They offer their signature mojito mix, all you need to do is provide the booze. I will be returning for more, if not for the cassava fries, for the mojito mix!
