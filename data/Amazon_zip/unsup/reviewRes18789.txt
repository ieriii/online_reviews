This place is like a more chill, more modern, and cafe-like version of Frontera Grill...just like Rick Bayless intended it to be. My review isn't completely comprehensive, as we got the items to go. I did an extensive amount of research, so I decided to go during off-peak hours (anytime before 6pm) just to grab a couple of yummy snacks. Here's my individual ranking of everything we ate: Pepito Torta (5 stars) - The bread was perfectly crisp, although it was more reminiscent of a submarine sandwich, as opposed to your traditional torta. Nonetheless, the meat was incredibly tender and of high quality (braised tallgrass short ribs!), the onions added a great sweetness, and the jalapenos, black beans, and artisan jack cheese added a wonderfully spicy kick. I loved this sandwich! I would definitely get it again. Churros (5 stars) - XOCO is known for these! These were the fluffiest, lightest, and most delectable churros I've ever had the chance to consume. Perfectly dusted with sugar and tiny specks of cinnamon for a powerfully sweet experience! They came with chocolate sauce for dipping, but I actually preferred them plain because the chocolate was way too rich for my taste. Fresh guacamole, salsa, and chips (3 stars) - Underwhelming. Do yourself a favor and just pick up some Bayless salsas in the Frontera jars at any grocery store in Chicago. Pretty much the same thing. Nothing special at all. Hot Chocolate (3 stars) - Overhyped. Waaaaay too sweet and rich for my taste. You could really taste the cacao beans, which reminded me of coffee, but was unbelievably strong for my liking. Because the latter two items were not that great...I am ranking this place 4 stars. Frontera Grill is still waaaay better, but this is still definitely a restaurant not to be missed if you are in Chicago! The churros are beyond amazing!
