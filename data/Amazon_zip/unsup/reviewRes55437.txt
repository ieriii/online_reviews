My wife and I just ate here tonight, we had a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday and when we arrived a half hour early we were immediately seated with a smile. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, answered all our questions and gave great wine suggestions. I want to apologize in advance if I use the word amazing too often. For a first course I had a perfectly poached egg atop a bed of frisee over fried potato strings and crunchy pork belly bits all enfused with the perfect level of truffle aroma and taste, a great start!! Between the first and second course we were served a subtle yet amazing potato leek soup, amazing. For a second course I had the quail, perfectly cooked, rich moist meat and crispy maple skin. This was served atop a root vegetable hash and stuffed with a fois gras stuffing, I say again...Amazing!!!! Between the second and third course we were pleasantly surprised with a course consisting of complementary local hard cider and the best grilled cheese I have ever eaten. Finally, I finished with the corn, a brioche bread pudding combined with ice-cream dehydrated fresh corn kernels, pop corn and macadamia nuts all drizzled with an amazing caramel sauce. I am not really a fan of corn but wanted to try something different and was very pleased. In conclusion, well done Dale!
