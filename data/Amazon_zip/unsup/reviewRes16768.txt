As a big fan of Indian, we decided to take a long walk to this place based on the recommendations in Yelp... and we were NOT disappointed! We were seated quickly in a nice booth and promptly served cold water which hit the spot after a long day of tracking around Chicago. From my vantage, I got to watch the Chiefs in the kitchen preparing breads and other items in the ovens - nice. After I opened the menu, I was totally overwhelmed!! There are more than 300 items on the menu, so you can be adventurous if you feel in the mood. Doing the buffet, as others have recommended, is probably the way to go if it is available. For our dishes, I had Eggplant Tamarind and my partner had Chicken Palak with a Mango Lassi. The kid had an order of Chicken Dumbiryani. All dishes were OUTSTANDING executions! Mine was not too spicy and the eggplant was cooked to perfection! Our water glasses were constantly filled and they promptly cleared away the dishes when we finished. Also, they brought hot towels at the end of the meal to clean our hands - a nice touch and something I've not seen before here. If you want some of the best Indian food in Chicago, give this place a try. Enjoy
