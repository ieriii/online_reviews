The best thing about Gejas is the atmosphere. Dimly lit, friendly servers, romantic. A nice date atmosphere. The food for the price is just average. My dining partner and i both had the premium seafood dinner, which was a little over $50 per person. That includes a salad, cheese fondue, seafood/ veggie fondue, and chocolate fondue. The salad was tiny with a ton of dressing, and appeared to have been sitting in the back ready to serve for a while. The cheese fondue was good, but again, the fruit and bread wasn't very plentiful and had definitely been waiting to be served for a while. Per person, we each got 3 scallops, one lobster tail, and two shrimp. The scallops and shrimp were good, but my lobster tail was gristly and hard to chew. I love lobster... But here it had the consistency of connective tissue. The chocolate fondue was good, I was pleased that it was dark and not milk chocolate. As other reviewers have said, the fruit had seen better days and there wasn't much of it. I'm sure Gejas knows that the tables will be filled on date nights because of its unique atmosphere, and lack of competition as there aren't many fondue places in the area. It's worth one trip here, but definitely try to wait for a groupon or something because the price of what we received was definitely higher than the quality.
