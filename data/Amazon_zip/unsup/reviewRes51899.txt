The best deep dish pizza I had on my trip, and probably one of the best pizzas of its kind you can get in Chi-town. The crust was perfectly cooked and flavored, the veggies in our veggie pizza (zucchini, squash and the like) were fresh, and the crumbled sausage as flavorful and didn't make the pizza extra greasy. Perfect amount of tomato sauce for a perfect pizza. I only tried a few pizza places during my trip, but from what I can tell and what I've been told by more frequent visitors, this place is the winner. Tip: come here at an off-peak time to get seated quickly. This place gets packed FAST.
