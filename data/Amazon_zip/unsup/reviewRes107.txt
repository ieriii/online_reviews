Amazingly delicious food with creative presentation; friendly, professional yet un-stuffy service, generous wine pairing poured by a knowledgeable staff.  I recommend getting an early reservation so you eat comfortably for 4+ hours. Menu changes 4 times a year.  Really memorable dishes: Beef short rib served with 10 different garnishes and you manually wrap it all in a tomato based pasta sheet. Delicious "walk in the woods" dish that's of various mushroom served with a pine cream. The centerpiece that predictably turns out to be your salad later on. Of course, the "splat, splat, crack" dessert that you've read all about everywhere else.  Minor things: Restaurant was very quiet so you can't speak too loudly before 6pm. Almost wish they had some background music. There were two chefs serving our dessert. One of them broke our frozen chocolate mousse prematurely before putting it on our table and didn't serve us the broken pieces.  $210 for the gazillion course dinner, $160 for basic wine pairing, $225 (?) for the reserved wine pairing, Wine by the glass averages $15 - $30 (very reasonable). Didn't read the half bottle or bottle pages.  I love how all dishes were served on these functional yet creative dinnerware. These are no ordinary plates. You'll have to see it for yourself.
