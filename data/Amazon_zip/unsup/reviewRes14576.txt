Great place for flavorful Cuban food, served in a cozy, casual and friendly atmosphere. The Cubano Sandwich and empanada were the best I have tasted in Chicago. The Cubano was full of delicious roasted pork and ham, served up on a perfectly toasted roll. I will definitely be coming back to try the Lechon and other sandwich offerings.
