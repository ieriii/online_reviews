Chicken wings are one item many restaurants carry. It's actually really hard to find a REAL GOOD chicken wing. Crisp nails it. The skin is crispy but light. The meat is really tender. The sauces here are perfection. I usually go for BBQ or buffalo. and oh, try the bon bon drink. it's awesome. This is my routine whenever I come to Crisp: 1. Come here with a group of people. 2. Order a whole chicken, buddha bowl, and maybe some side dishes. 3. Share it family style.
