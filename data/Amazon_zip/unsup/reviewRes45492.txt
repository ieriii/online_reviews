I have been living across from Wilde for so long, I remember when it was the Ace Hardware. I have been dining here ever since and the mac & cheese is the best thing on the menu. I also love that on Sundays they have $3 Miller and Bud specials. This has become a problem over the last few months because my friend and I sit outside for 5-6 hours. We sit there through shift changes, menu changes and just keep happily drinking away. It has been too hot this summer to eat the mac & cheese so I have been trying different menu items. I recommend the edamame & black bean salad, the wedge salad, the cobb salad, and the cesar. The grilled tomato with herb butter is also DELICIOUS and really cheap.  We have also grown to know the loop of music they play and I have rediscovered my love for George Michael. Freedom 90 is my song of the summer and I am trying to learn all the words for a possible karaoke night.
