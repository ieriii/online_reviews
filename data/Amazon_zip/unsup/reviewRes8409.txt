Good flavor, adequate execution of a pizza and great service. fourth star is for the service... My wife and I went Wednesday night. I did like the flavor of my pizza (sausage and mushroom) but the middle was soggy... very soggy. The sausage wouldn't even stay on a traditionally pie shaped slice. Regarding the service... they have about 12 appetizers all with no explanation and written in Italian. We wanted an appetizer so she explained all of them... and was very nice about it. She was also spot-on regarding the two types of cheese that go on the pizzas. One spreads out better and is saltier and the other stays in clumps... I liked them both!!! My complaint is that she shouldn't of had to explain 12 different appetizers. They could have easily been described in two-three words after the Italian name. Overall, I likely won't seek it out but I did enjoy it.
