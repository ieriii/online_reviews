I wanted to go to Carnivale for a long time, but unfortunately it was not a good experience. Since we got there around 6:30 PM, the hostess told us that there were no reservations available until 9:00 PM, however I was able to find a reservation in Open Table at 7 PM which I found odd, and finally after a long discussion they were able to sit our group in the main dinning area. Later on our server was very rude, making an awful lot of bad taste sarcastic jokes. Food was OK, elegant decor but it was served cold. To kill the evening the server brought our check and literally throw it on the table without saying anything. When we asked him to separate the bill he got very mad and then he did it completely wrong. Overall, very nice atmosphere. But costumer service is really bad, I felt like they were doing me a favor to eat there.
