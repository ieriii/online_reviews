Ohhh, Purple Pig. I still feel like a pig the morning after. Stuffed, rolling around from place to place and very, very happy. So the food I have no complaints about. They even brought us more toast for our feta-cucumber smear when they noticed we were low on toast, high on smear ;-). Lovely service and delicious, unique food. I just didn't know it was a 200 sq. ft. place that ignores every fire code or that you sit at high tables with 10 other people, so that was really disappointing. It's a busy place. Be forewarned: That popularity you've heard rumors about is true. We waited 15 minutes or so at 8pm on a Sunday evening, standing in the wind by the crammed bar and enjoying about half a drink before we were seated. Our servers were very sweet and very glad we went whole hog (ha!), ordering 10 dishes plus three desserts and a decent amount of alcohol. My uncle was in town from San Fran and admits he was overambitious, but damn everything was so good. I couldn't name half the things I ate, but I don't think it matters. You don't need a recommendation, nor do you need to remember what you ate last time. You only need to remember one thing: Come hungry. Bon appetit!
