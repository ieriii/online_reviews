A Chicago-must. It takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust down here as the romantic candles and fondue burners are the only thing lighting the basement-like restaurant. With the Melting Pot as it's only major fondue competition in the city, Geja's offers a considerably more unique experience for special occasions.For those unsavvy about fondue dining- Geja's starts each meal with a small salad, and then has three different types of fondue- cheese (with apples and bread to dip) to start, oil for the main course, and chocolate for dessert. Though Melting Pot offers a few more variables (particularly with the dessert options) you still cant go wrong with Geja's, it's less expensive without a drop in quality, and an infinitely better dining experience.Factor in more time (3 or more hours) for a meal that involves the patron in the cooking process. (Apparently, some people don't like the idea of having to cook your own food.) I think it's fun- part of the experience.Geja's has top-notch service, an extensive wine list, and usually a live guitarist playing (non-obtrusively) in the background. Look for nightly specials and local coupons that help bring down the cost, which for what you're getting, is still fairly reasonable.Make it a point to try Geja's if you haven't already. It's on a very short list of my favorite restaurants in the city.
