So I booked a reservation for 6 for restaurant week at sunda, it was for the lunch prix fix menu which we saw online and were excited to try. I received a call from the hostess there confirming our reservation and I asked her about the prix fixed menu to see that it was still available during their brunch time on sunday. She told us no that it is only brunch on sunday no restaurant week. That was fine with me but then my phone rang again, it was Sunda.  The host told me she talked to the chef and they could do the Lunch menu for us. When we got there they couldn't find my reservation and sat us with the brunch menu which we did not want. I asked the waiter about the lunch prix fix for restaurant week and he said no. The hostess came over and gave us a "brunch prix fix menu" which was really lousy. I did not want french toast and bananas for restaurant week from this hyped up restaurant. All in all they said sorry the host must have misinterpreted what was asked over the phone. So we picked up and left it just wasn't worth wasting a birthday there or having french toast, ill go to ihop for that for 3$. Thanks for wasting our time.
