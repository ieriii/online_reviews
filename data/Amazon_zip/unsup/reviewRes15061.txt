There's a certain magical mystery about the Violet Hour - a feeling that as soon as you step past those dark velvet curtains you're entering a secret, private world. Be prepared on busy weekend nights to wait a full HOUR AND A HALF. We had to, but the drinks are so deliciously potent and the ambiance so calmingly beautiful that it's well worth it. The best seats in the house are definitely at the bar, where you have front row seats to the precise alchemy the bartenders practice to craft every single drink. The cocktail menu itself has the perfect mix of classics - most with a VH twist - and new inventions if you're feeling adventurous. The quote from Bernard deVoto from which VH took its name sums it up perfectly: "This is the violet hour, the hour of hush and wonder, when the affections glow again and valor is reborn, when the shadows deepen magically along the edge of the forest and we believe that, if we watch carefully, at any moment we may see the unicorn." So get classed up, turn off your cell phones (both are House Rules, btw), and be prepared for a night of mixology magic!
