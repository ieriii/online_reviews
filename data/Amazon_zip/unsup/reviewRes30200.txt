I love this restaurant. The appetizer platter and house margaritas are awesome. I adore the duck tacos and the ceviche is also top notch. The service is pretty a-ok for this popular of a restaurant but interestingly enough it is especially awesome at the bar, making Frontera one my favorite places to in Chicago in the daylight hours.
