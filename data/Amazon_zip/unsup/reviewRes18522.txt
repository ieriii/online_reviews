I got the Mahalo burger b/c it got recommended as one of the best burgers in town from TimeOut. I also read one yelper's review below that compared it to McDonalds. Hahahaha, oh wow...nah, nah, no way, not even close, this burger was amazing. No ketchup needed for this one, it tasted amazing down to the last bite. Not sure how you compare McD's to this place, that's absurd. One thing, though, why does everyone complain about the price of their burgers as if $8- $10 is expensive? You know what... you want a cheap burger, stick to the drive-through lanes and stop complaining. I haven't seen a decently cooked burger at a sit down joint/ trendy bar that was ever worth anything for less than $8 since the early 90's. If you think $10 is too much than stop ordering burgers.
