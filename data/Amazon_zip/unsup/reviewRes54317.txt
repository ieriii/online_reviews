Love the Pizza, but their staff can be rude when taking your order over the phone. Be ready to give your order fast. I have ordered in the past and on several occasions feel rushed when given my order for pick up. Then I get there and have to wait half an hour for the pizza. I love their pizza, but wish they had a more courteous staff.
