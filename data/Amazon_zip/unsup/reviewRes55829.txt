Great Pasta, Pizza, and more! Calo is an excellent place for dining in or grabbing something to go. If you like a lot of cheese on your pizza, this is the place to go. Chicken is always very nice. They give you lots of food, you can definately split dishes or take some to go. Make sure to call ahead. Parking isn't bad as they have a lot across the street. We go on special occasions as it is a little pricey, but worth every penny.
