Stopped in for dessert and drinks with a friend on the recommendation of her boyfriend. When we ordered two of the same desserts, the waiter kindly shared that the dessert would probably be big enough for the two of us (it definitely was). Chocolate martini was pretty good and the location was intimate and not too noisy. Perfect end to the evening!
