I love Crisp!!! One of my favorite places in Lakeview--over the last 6 months, I've probably been there (and had it delivered) over a dozen times! The Chicken Wings are just outstanding--I don't know how they do it. The Seoul Sassy and the Crisp BBQ are both great. I wasn't too excited about the Buffalo Style, but they are alright. They get the flavoring just right and have such a perfect crispiness. I'm originally from Buffalo, NY, so I take Chicken Wings seriously, and Crisp is the only place in Chicago that has chicken wings that are good enough to make me consistently happy. The Chicken tenders are nice too, but were a smaller pieces than I thought they would be. As for the other offerings, the bowls are good, I like that their bibimbap has a good selection of veggies.  Their fries are pretty wonderful too--you get a pretty great sized basket when you dine in. Lastly--I do have to say that the seating area confused the heck out of me the first time I went, I didn't realize that you had to just find a spot and sit down. It has a nice community feeling though. And don't forget that it's BYOB! Overall, I think their food is mega-tasty, and always makes me want to go back as soon as it is once again appropriate for me to stuff my face with a bunch of amazing wings. Yum!!
