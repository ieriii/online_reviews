LaVilla is one of my favorite casual restaurants in the city. This might be due to the fact that my husband used to work there, and he and I had our wedding there, so every time we go, Chris takes extra-special care of us... Their pizza is some of the best around... no joke! Try their thin crust, with extra sauce and well-done. If you are a meatatarian, it's worthwhile to try their sausage, since they make their own in-house. The sauce is also very tasty, and you can buy it in a jar to take home. Other than pizza, my favorite thing on the menu is bruscetta... I had the opportunity to sample most of their menu at my wedding reception, and the best thing I remember (it was a long night) was the garlic potatoes. For good stuffed pizza, try Art of Pizza or Lou's. LaVilla's is okay, but Art and Lou have the superior deep-dish slice.
