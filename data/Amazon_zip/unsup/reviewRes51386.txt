"Hey, it's late and I'm starving. Where can we go?!?!" Yea, we've all been there. Thank goodness for us north-siders we have Garcia's. Especially key in those moments of extreme hunger since they bring you some of the best salsa the moment you sit down. The menu has all the traditional favorites and combination varieties. I enjoying adding one of their fish tacos on to a plate sometimes. Definitely a tasty taco. The flautas are also great as is the streak they use. Good margaritas, sure. But if you're more of a beer person like myself and you've played out the Carona card one too many times, switch it up for a Pacifico. Similar in taste but definitely distinguishable.
