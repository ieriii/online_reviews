As previous yelpers have expressed, the staff of this establishment is less than spectacular. My virgin experience at San Soo Gab San was delectible and a little awkwardly uncomfortable. My friends warned me in advance that the staff is pushy and pretty unkind overall. My friend Al was tending the grill and the woman came and muttered some reprimand at him gesturing that he was doing it all wrong "Get the bean sprouts off the GRILL!". Well the meat's cooked to perfection lady so... yeah... it can't be that wrong. The amount of different Kimchees they had to offer pretty much JFK'd my mind. I did try the minifishies and wasn't too keen on it. I'm all about Daikon. I couldn't even make it through all those little bowls of foodstuffs with all the meats we were about to eat. We ordered a metric ton of meat, delicious meat. Beef (what's for dinner) is what we started off with, though it wasn't the kalbi. The sauce they give you to dip that ish in....must be something illegal because that shit melted in my MFing mouth, son. I'm not even that big of a carnivore but I would continually go Hungry Hungry Hippos all over that. That sauce, I would like to be buried in it. The chicken? Oh yeah the chicken. Put some more of that shit in my mouth now, please and then serve me a delicious dessert of grilled kalbi beef. Oh dear lord, if there is a God on earth he would somehow make San Soo Gab San beef (w/grill) appear in my kitchen everyday. Outside of the unfriendly staff, this place is pretty much aces with regards to foodliciousness.
