i hesitated on doing a review of alinea since its so well known and so expensive but i think my objective in doing it is to say it was worth it. growing up in the business i have always always always always always believed foodservice is about experience NOT just the food. you can apply that to a place like mcdonalds or a place like charlie trotters. alinea just takes it to a whole new level. its perfect for foodies obviously. service was great and i say this because i look so young and i went several years ago with a gf at the time yet they took us seriously. they didn't have gloves and aprons waiting for us thinking we wouldn't be able to pay. they treated us very very well. food was actually great if you were wondering and i hope anyone whose never heard of molecular gastronmy or has a love of it will go. it got voted best restaurant in the world one year. also if you've never head of grant achatz story about his tongue - google it. there will be several LONG articles about his journey with cancer. i think esquire had a really long story. i think its going to be a movie soon. think about it: what is the worst possible sensory capability he could have lost being a chef??
