Try the Chateaubriand, prepared table-side for two. It's a great show and a fabulous meal. We also like the bananas foster for two and the cherries jubilee for two. I guess we just like flaming food. Seriously, everything here is good, but the menu items that are prepared table-side all seem like they come from an even BETTER restaurant.
