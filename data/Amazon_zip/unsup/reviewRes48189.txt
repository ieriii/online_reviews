Everyone knows how great The Publican is. Three times at dinner here and I have never been disappointed by the food or the beer...but let me make a recommendation - come here for brunch! Honestly I didn't even know that The Publican served brunch until my BF suggested it for Sunday.  Five notes: 1. Their Bloody Marys are pretty close to perfection (and it comes with a sidecar of beer!). It has the perfect amount of kick to it and it's served with some slices of bread & butter pickle & pickled red onion. I am of the "the more garnishes the better" school but in this case, KISS ("keep it simple, stupid") rules.  2. Get the maple syrup-braised bacon. Just do it. It ain't your mom's bacon...it is essentially a thick slab of sweet tender pork belly. Note to The Publican: can you please incorporate it into a fancy breakfast sandwich? Kthx. 3. My Fulton Market Quad. HOBOY...two sunny side up eggs, one special breakfast sausage, braised beef tongue, and a slice of delicious spreadable chorizo nduja. And two perfectly toasted slices of bread. And some bread & butter pickle slices & some more pickled red onion. Sorry John G, but I am in loooooove. 4. John G's charred mortadella sandwich with fried egg, cole slaw, & BBQ baked beans. It was so good that I only got one bite of it.  5. End a perfect meal with their homemade jelly doughnut. Sure, you might be bursting at the seams but it is completely worth it. Bold statement, but I think brunch at The Publican may even be better than their dinners...
