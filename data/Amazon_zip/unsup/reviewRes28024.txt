It tastes like i'm eating a giant buttermilk biscuit with tomato sauce on top with my choice of toppings. This may sound awesome if you like buttermilk biscuits... but I don't. The only thing I like about their deep dish pizza is the burnt outer edges of the crust. I also like how they USED to (and i say this because they don't anymore) pile on the pepperoni. I prefer their thin crust although i find that their crust is not so thin... but more doughy. Make sure you confirm that you want deep dish or thin crust if you order over the phone. They use a dumb push to talk phone to eliminate background noise and it seems like the phone operator that was helping me didn't know it's "push to talk" not... "talk and then push." I got home and saw that they gave me a deep dish instead of thin crust making my night majorly disappointing. Can't bash on this place cause it's the only pizza place that's near where I live that's walkable. If I lived further away... I'd probably never go here... why would you when theres lous, uno, and girodanos. oh and stay away from their meatball sandwich... unless you usually lick a block of salt after every bite of food. Salt City.
