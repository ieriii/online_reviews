Amazing, inexpensive food! The Carne Asada is mouth watering! And their flour tortillas can put you into a glorious carb coma. If you're looking for some amazing eats at about $10 per person, this is it. Plus it's a BYOB. Breakfast is also great at about $4-8 per person. Just come early or else lines can get insane.
