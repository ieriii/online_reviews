Long story short. I'm an Italian food snob who comes from a family with a gourmet Italian chef as a mother. I walk into Italian restaurants expecting very, very little and am often not impressed. And then there is Piccolo Sogno. One of the few Italian restaurants I have ever been to in the city of Chicago that has gone above and beyond any expectations. Amazing, amazing food, I am consistently impressed every time I go in. It feels like I'm back in Italy whenever I eat here. The waitstaff is BEYOND friendly and the atmosphere is fabulous. My favorite is during the warmer months when their wonderful outdoor patio is open. Eating great Italian food while sitting outside? One of my favorite things. Chef Tony never ceases to amaze.
