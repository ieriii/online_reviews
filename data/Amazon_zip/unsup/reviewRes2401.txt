Strangely enough, if you just want a classic Chicago style hot dog, you could find a better one elsewhere. But if you want to expand your horizons, there is no better place for dog innovation. I had the bacon jalapeno duck sausage with goat cheese gobs and the first bite was the most heavenly bite of food I've had in a long time. It's $7.50 but it is so worth it. Amazing sausage.
