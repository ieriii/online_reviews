I came here for a wedding reception and the hotel did a great job. They had a room off of the main ballroom for a reception for the guest until the wedding party arrived, then we moved in the ballroom which was very elegant. The staff was great the food was decent. I would highly recommend this place for a wedding and/or wedding reception.
