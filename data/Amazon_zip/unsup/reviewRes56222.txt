5 stars for their cakes and desserts , not so sweet , but yet full of flavors . I always order birthday cakes there for my friends but I took off 1 star for their staff -- the girl at the dessert bar was AWFUL , what the hell is wrong with her attitude ?? She seemed like she don'r want to work at all , even tho her only job was to put the cakes in a box for the customers. Anyway, that does not effect my love to their mango mousses cake , lol
