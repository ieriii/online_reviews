I stayed here last year for the Chicago Gourmet festival in Millennium Park. Can't say enough about this place as far as service, location, and actual rooms.  I can't really speak to the amenities as I didn't do anything except eat, sleep, and walk while I was there. When I go back to Chicago, I'm staying here. The price was just fine, I had a room with a view of the Lake, and the location was dead center in the heart of where you want to be.
