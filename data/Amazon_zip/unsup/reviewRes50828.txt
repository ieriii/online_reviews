I came here for a Saturday afternoon brunch and found the experience to be less than satisfying. The food is delicious but pretty pricey (well over $10/plate). I was surprised to see such an extensive menu of teas. My table ordered and split the following items: - Sally Lunn French Toast: raspberry jelly, coconut pudding, crystallized coffee - Leek and Mushroom: fresh goat cheese, melted leeks, market mushrooms - Migas: farm egg and corn tortilla scramble, tomato, chilies, black beans, spicy red sauce, avocado, sour cream I love that they bring you delicious complimentary pastry puffs while you wait for your meal! The problem I had with Big Jones was the poor service. We spent over 1 and half hours dining here. The place was half full and not incredibly busy, yet it took our server well over 15 minutes to even get our order. And waiting for the check was painfully longer - I had to run back to my car and insert more money into the meter even though I already paid for 90 minutes. Every time I asked the server for something she was rude and never came by to check up on me. The worst was when I forgot my coupon after the check came by, she refused to void the check (yeah, I know it might be a pain in the ass, but I've worked other jobs before and had to deal with situations like these - it sucks, but you just deal with it). When my companion requested a manager, our server claimed that she needed the manger to void the check and recharge me the lesser amount. But then she ended up doing it anyways! It took her under one minute! I know it's my own fault, but I'm still a customer and was being very nice and funny about the whole situation, yet she could be anything but the exact opposite. Thumbs down. I'm sorry to have been such a inconvenience, but I was being very nice about the whole thing!
