Carnivale definitely offers the whole experience when it comes to Latin American food. The music, the decor and the food are all exceptional. I recommend the Chuleta (wood grilled pork-chops with a side of bacon-plantain fufu and caramelized onions). However if you want a cheaper option just order a few appetizers since they are all delicious and very filling. We came here for a company outing before as well and they have private rooms for groups, although i heard they require a minimum dollar amount when it comes to groups. They boast about having the best Mojitos in Chicago, and they might be right. However all 3 times I have been here they were out of the ginger and millionario mojito which is disappointing. The reason why this does not get 5 stars is the seating. We had a reservation for 8PM and we arrived there around 7:55PM. We were given a buzzer and we waited about 20 min. Which is what you can expect to wait at a restaurant when you don't have a reservation. However as soon as we sat down and ate we forgot all about that.
