Hopleaf is wonderful and, from the 500+ reviews of this place, it looks like the secret's out. So I guess going on a weeknight, or Sunday. And it's still going to be a bit crowded then. But I think that they use their space well and if you hang out and chillax for a bit, you will find a place to park the ole caboose. The 40 beers on tap are worth the wait. And the bottled beers are great, too. I never get the same thing twice; I love having little taste tests that always supply good tastes and a buzz! And for those of you who don't know about the food...it is to die for! To go to Hopleaf just for the food is worth it! From the mussels, to the pomme frites to the sandwiches (the CB+J and the duck Reuben are both out of this world)...the food is unique, yet familiar and always delicious. So if you haven't heard the secret, lean in...HOPLEAF IS AWESOME AND YOU SHOULD GET THEE TO THIS GEM IN ANDERSONVILLE POST HASTE!
