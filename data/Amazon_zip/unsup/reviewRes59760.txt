The ingredients here (most important part of a pizza of course) are always top-notch. I am thoroughly convinced Art of Pizza has the best deep-dish in the city. Admittedly I've only ever tried like three other places, but I've never been disappointed by a deep-dish slice here. Environment is chill, cute, and informal (not tacky or too casual though, so informal on the nicer side) and it's nice on the wallet, too -- especially for its quality!
