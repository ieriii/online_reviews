This has now become one of my favorite restaurants! Our meal was amazing! My bf and I went on a sunday when the chef buys fresh ingredients at the farmers market and makes a fresh original menu that same day. We had the 7 course menu and we loved all the dishes. It was BYOB which was perfect and every dish was artfully displayed with wonderful dishes/pots/wodden stands/giant shells, etc. The presentation was beautiful and the food tasty. What a perfect meal! I'll def. be back!
