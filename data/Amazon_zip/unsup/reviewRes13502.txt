I'd give 5 stars just for the cask-conditioned, hand pump brown sound ale. If i were rich, I would buy a huge pool and fill it with this beer so that I could swim in it. Try it. The lower carbonation works wonders on this creamy brown ale, and I will go back here for this beer alone repeatedly. I really enjoyed my food too. Popcorn was good, but not stellar. Sweet potato patties were killer. We also split a burger that satisfied me.  For a burger, 3 appetizers, and 4 beers ran us $70, including tip. A little expensive, but worth it in my opinion
