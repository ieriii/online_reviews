I am quite picky when it comes to Indian food. I grew up on Indian food and I do believe that the Downtown India House is the best Indian Restaurant in the Chicagoland area. It is pricey compared to Devon ave, but the quality and the taste of the food is definitely worth it. The Lunch Buffet is fantastic. I highly recommend the Chicken Makhani, Chicken Chaat, and the Malai Kofta.
