This W has a fair amount of pros and cons for me. Pros - great views of Lake Michigan, clean rooms, fresh baked chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon, Fonte coffee in the morning, very helpful concierge, decent sized gym. Cons - Not ideal for business travel since it is kinda far from everything business (and also a hike from the El), very poor a/c in the lobby/common areas/elevators. I was there this past week when it was in the mid-90's and it was absolutely unbearable outside of the actual guest room. There is a nice lobby bar, which gets a decent amount of action at night but other than that, there is not too much within a short walking distance of this W. On the other hand, cabs are easily accessible.
