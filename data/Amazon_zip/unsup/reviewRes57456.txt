I went for dinner last night and had an exceptionally average experience. The restaurant was really crowded and we had to wait for about 30 minutes at the bar which wasn't very pleasant.Most of all, I didn't find my food to be very good. I had the Lamb which was slightly overcooked, I certainly wouldn't order it again. The best part of the meal was that saganaki appetizer.I am unlikely to return.
