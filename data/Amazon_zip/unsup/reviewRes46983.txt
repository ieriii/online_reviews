Oh, I just love this place. I've been several times for lunch/brunch (special shout-out to their bloody Mary!), but last night was the first time for dinner. Um, remind me again why I waited to have dinner here?! K and I joined a group of folks to celebrate my former roomie's birthday. For our group of 10, service was excellent, and just as nice and pleasant as can be! K and I started with the Korean spiced calamari. Nicely fried, not overcooked, yet the reviews at the table were mixed on the sauce - Was it hot? sweet? spicy? tangy? I certainly enjoyed it.  For a main, I opted for the Friday fish-n-chips special; excellent choice on my part. The batter on the fish was light, yet the edges were the exact crispiness you want from fried fish. And a substantial portion to boot. I opted to get the sweet potato fries...totally worth the $1 upcharge. K had the new-to-the-menu halibut over risotto. The fish had a nice crust on it, and the flavors of the risotto were balanced. The only curious thing about the dish were these weird green "sticks" on top - not quite bean sprouts, not pea shoots. Still not sure what they were, but K didn't think they added to the dish. The other 8 diners enjoyed their meals - bacon-wrapped meatloaf, chef's choice steak cut (topped with a yummy chimichurri), and two of the day's specials. Dessert was fine - a S'mores tart, which was basically a chocolate ganache with graham cracker crust, topped with bruleed marshmallows. Another plus for me about this place is their commitment to fresh and organic (when they can) ingredients. Sure makes me feel better about eating all that fried fish...
