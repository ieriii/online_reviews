4.5 i came right at 11AM to get the tortas (no takeout), line wasn't too bad. tried aztec, churro with mexican vanilla soft serve the churro was tasty but not something i would crave all the time. *Ahogada golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions *Gunthrop Chicken wood-roasted red chile chicken, caramelized onion, black beans, avocado, tomatillo salsa what stands out the most about these sandwiches is the bread. that woodburning oven makes for a perfect toasting. yum the ahogada flavor of the carnitas was slightly too salty, and the pickled onions a little too pickled, but otherwise very good. medium spice worked out well for the broth. flavors are bold, also the chicken sandwich tasted very good as well; my guess is you can't go wrong with any wooden oven sandwich now that i learned frontera fresco is in Macy's SF, gotta get my rick bayless fill there.
