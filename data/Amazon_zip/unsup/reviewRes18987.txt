Totally underwhelmed by this place. I decided to take my mom out to lunch here based on the decent reviews. The interior decor was charming with celadon subway tiles, dark wood, and art deco-esque stylized fonts and logos. The waitstaff was unusually pretensious. Having just moved from NY after many years I have an unusually high tolerance for snootiness. I read the warnings in other reviews and didn't think too much about it. However, this restaurant topped the list of pretension I've experienced and undeserved - their food is NOT stellar. The food was greasy and so-so. We had the Gage burger, pastrami special, and pot o' tea. From the cold greeting at the door, to the awkward owner who struck up conversation with every guest except notably two separate tables of Asians. Wow!! He half-heartedly mumbled something to my mom and myself as if we would not be able to understand. The restaurant was not yet busy yet we were rushed. Our check was placed on the table mid meal and our waitress was cold as we got up. My mom is the sweetest woman, and I felt terrible taking her to such a charmless place where they define a hierarchy of customers. Imagine if the waitstaff genuinely smiled vs. being too cool for school.
