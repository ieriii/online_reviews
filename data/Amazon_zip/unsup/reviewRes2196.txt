I love this place. It's perfect for foodies that get excited about a sausage made with elk or alligator or some other unusual meat. If you are such a person, then you must make a trip. If you don't see why paying more for a hot dog made of alligator and shrimp than a normal hot dog, than you probably won't like it here. The lines get long, but moved pretty quickly. The times I've been I was with a group so we could each try several of their unique hot dogs. I haven't been disappointed with one yet, the flavors are huge. I wish I could go here more often.
