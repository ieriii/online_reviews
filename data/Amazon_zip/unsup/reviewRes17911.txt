Aight. I know this place is supposed to be known for their burgers, but I went to The Bad Apple after Ribfest. I had not quite filled myself to the brim on ribs, but I had surely consumed enough of them that a burger just wasn't an option. I opted for the Quinoa Salad and then...I thought about it for days...actually weeks.  Walking completely zoned when the crosswalk is flashing "Do Not Walk." There's me, almost getting hit by a car for some sort of rice/couscous hybrid. Fast forward to last Thursday. I'm getting my nails done at 2x10 and all I can think about is that darn salad...STILL. Quinoa, arugula, peas, golden raisins, mint, pine nuts with a cider vinaigrette...so I called in a pick up order while my nails dried and that was that. It was as good as I had dreamed every night since having it. Okay, I dreamed like four times...and they were daydreams, but still - it's a salad! And even better - the large salad is $8 so it's an affordable and filling option. I definitely plan on returning to try more on the menu but if a restaurant has sold me based on a quinoa salad alone I'm feeling pretty good about their other options. Expansive beer list to boot. My heart is full.
