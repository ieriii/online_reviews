Dear God in heaven the food! I came here a few nights ago with a couple of coworkers and hope to come back soon! Despite a lifelong aversion to everything avocado, the guacamole here is tremendous. I was scarfing the generous chunks down even though I usually shy away from the fatty veg. Deilcious. I also had the rum-glazed pork shoulder with rice and beans which proved a wise decision. The food was perfection and my coworkers swear by the Raspberry Mojitos - though I stayed with the Negro Modelo myself. Great food, slick atmosphere. It was definitely the first of many future trips.
