Sinfully good. The food is all good. Ive been here two times now and have had nothing that was bad. The Purple Pig is a Mediterranean small plates spot (which is to say they have Spanish tapas but include dishes with inspiration or origins from outside Spain). Each time Ive been here, I always feel a bit odd; a but out of place and outside my comfort zone, sitting at the communal tables, but at the end of the meal, after a couple or three glasses of wine, and perhaps a Pedro Ximenez aperitif, all is well and I have made friends with the strangers sitting across from me. Dishes of note: all of them. Pig Platter? why yes! Poached Tuna with french fingerling potatoes? Yes, please! Morcilla and fava beans...oh yeah...and Milk Braised Pork Shoulder....OMG YES!. The Purple Pig does not disappoint. My one criticism is that the space behind the seats at the communal tables is not big enough to accommodate wide Chicagoans sitting whilst the waif-like waitstaff pass behind us. Fun for groups especially, good for a date, but probably not a first date. One thing that was forgettable was the desert I had on my first visit, bit they made up for that with the Bread pudding desert the second time.Oh, and the manager needs to choose different music; 80's pop just doesnt fit in with the vibe from the food and drink. But go, because the food is just good enough to drown out "Karma Chameleon" for the umpteenth time.
