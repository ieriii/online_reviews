The wife and I stayed here for a night as a reward for not going insane after being cooped up with our newborn for three months. Yes, probably a Holiday Inn would have been quite fine at that point, but i tend to believe i am a good judge of things, and the Public Hotel deserves my accolades.  The staff were incredibly friendly to start. The lobby was beautiful, with lots of places to relax if you needed a break, but didn't want to be in your hotel room.  The hotel room, which was reasonably priced compared to some other local hotels, was really cool and modern. They did a nice job with the old bathrooms, without having to completely redo them. The bed was cozy, and the bath products were top notch. There was a nice flat screen with an easy to use operating system. My only complaint on the room was that there was a gap between the door bottom and the floor, and when our neighbors returned to their room at 5AM (must have been a good night), we heard their whole conversation through their and our closed doors. I opened the door and knocked on theirs and asked them to keep it down. We ate at the restaurant that evening, and the food was excellent. I had the Pork Tenderloin and my wife had their Weiner Schnitzel. The Schnitzel was outstanding. They also had a good wine list, however later i found out the glass of $12 Chardonnay i was drinking retailed for $10.99 a bottle. That is some mark up. After dinner we had another drink in the lobby which turned into a total 40 to 60 year old meat market. We went to sleep early, but i hear the crowd gets younger as thee night goes on. It was good people watching anyway. Brunch in the morning wasn't bad, but next time i will meander over to the Original House of Pancakes off Rush street. We also loved the location of the hotel. It was in a quieter area, but only minutes from the action by foot or by cab.  We would definitely stay here again.
