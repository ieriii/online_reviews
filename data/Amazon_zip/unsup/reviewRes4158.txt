Shocked and Awed, is that a saying? As my name states i am skeptic when there's a lot of hype and good reviews. I've heard of the chef and live down the street from the place so left messages and finally got a reservation. Our table was held by another group and we waited outside (no big deal). When they came out it was obvious the staff said something, nicely I'm sure, and they and the staff were extremely apologetic.    The moment I put the first dish in my mouth, grapefruit amuse, I was impressed and very happy about our choice. They brought us several different types of wine, we did bring our own,from other diners and even an orange blossom beer. After consuming increasingly more delicious meals we were extremely intoxicated. The quail egg ravioli is the best...I describe it as the best eggy cheesy melty thing I've ever had. I actually told the chef that I hoped not to embarrass myself but I was so full and drunk that I had to stop. He brought out dessert with sweetbreads and caramel (I think) and had one taste and paid the bill.    Overall a great experience not just with food but the chefs were friendly and great. We can't stop talking about it. And it costed less than we thought it was going to be but were ready to pay more.
