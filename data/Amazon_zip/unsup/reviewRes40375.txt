One word, AMAZING. We visited Longman & Eagle as part of a dear friends surprise birthday dinner and weren't expecting much from the food or dining experience based on their menu (which we interpreted to be a little stuffy)... we were so wrong. We waited for a short period of time, around 15 - 20min, but we did get there early-ish - around 5:15 on a Friday. The atmosphere is very hip and relaxed and not too trendy, which I love - jeans are welcome and the crowd is fun. Our server was fabulous - very attentive and friendly but still professional and wasn't in our faces asking if we needed anything every 30 seconds (hate that). We started with a few apps which were good but not anything amazing... the amazing happened with dinner. I ordered the steak, and my boyfriend ordered their burger - both cooked and seasoned PERFECTLY and so very delicious. It was obvious that the chef took every last detail seriously and made this one of the best steaks and burgers I've ever tasted. The real surprise amazing moment though was the FRIES... beef fat fries. Honestly, after eating these fries, any potato not fried in beef fat just doesn't seem worth it. SO good we couldn't believe it! Was an overall delightful experience and I'll be returning the first chance I get.
