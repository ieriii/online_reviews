Fox & Obel, I've tried to like you. I've given you too many chances, though, and I give up.I didn't give up on you when I was robbed by a guy you recognized as a regular thief when we reviewed the security tapes.I didn't give up on you the first time you messed up and left items out of my to-go order. I didn't give up on you the second time, either. I just swore I'd never do another to-go order.Today was the final straw. We attempted to eat brunch in the bistro. The wait-staff ranged from avoiding the patrons to ambivalence. The coffee was burned. Our food never came. We waited for 30 minutes for our breakfast before giving up, paying for our coffee, and leaving. How can you not notice that your tables aren't getting their food?!?! Gourmet my foot. We should have waited the 30 minutes at Yolk.
