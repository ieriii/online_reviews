Delicious Korean BBQ - we had Kalbi beef and pork ribs. Plenty of tasty side dishes to nosh on (our jaws dropped when we saw how many dishes our server was placing on our table) , and our orders also included lettuce, spring onion, miso soup and bowls of rice. Left stuffed and needing a nap! The only thing I was disappointed with was that the server didn't ask if we needed help with the grilling (didn't ask if this was our first time there or anything). We could have used help with the timing so we wouldn't burn (and waste) the delicate and tasty slices of meat.
