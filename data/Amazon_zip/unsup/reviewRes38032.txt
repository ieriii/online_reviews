I saw this place on the Travel Channel and initially didn't plan on eating here. But when we came across the restaurant while exploring downtown, I went crazy and coerced my brother and cousins to eat! We all planned on trying the famous Chicago deep dish pizza and for some reason we ordered the vegetarian deep dish. I'm not completely sure why we did that, but it didnt' matter! The 2.5 inch thick PIE was so full of vegetables that midway through the pizza my brother asked: "oh shoot, there's no meat in this huh... why am I so full?" After two slices each we still had a fourth of the pizza left and found ourselves in a complete 'food-coma.' Poor waiter, had to put up with our consistent 'can I have more ice?' for nearly 45 minutes after we finished eating! Haha... Personally I'm a thin-crust pizza kind of girl, not that I'm watching my weight I just like that crisp-crust-crunch but this pizza was eye-opening! So overall, DELICIOUS!!!
