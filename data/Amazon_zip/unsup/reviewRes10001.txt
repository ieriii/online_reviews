My husband made reservations here for our 4 year anniversary after hearing many good things. We were hoping to sit in the lovely outdoor dining area, but it was rainy and chilly that nigh we went. Regardless, we enjoyed a VERY good meal! Since I was torn between 2 dishes, I was happy to find out that the risotto came in an appetizer-size portion... It was on the pricey side ($15 for a small plate!) but it was creamy, delicious goodness. A bit more al dente than I expected, but I personally like it that way. My husband ordered the Rosticianna (braised beef short rib), which we would give 3 stars. It was good, but not extraordinary. I ordered Fruti di Marre (black spagetti with seafood), and I would give that 5 stars, it was amazing! For $17, I was amazed by how generously they doled out the seafood. We couldn't leave without trying the dessert, so we had a chocolate molten cake with hazelnut ice cream... and wow, I seriously wanted to lick the plate clean. Too bad I was in a fancy restaurant :) All in all, we really enjoyed the meal, and were surprised that the tab only came out to $75 (pre-tip)! Especially because I also had a glass a wine and my husband had a beer.
