Having moved to Chicago from the suburbs a few years ago, Carnivale had been all anyone could talk about. Anyone who enjoys rich culture and a colorful environment both through decor and in food is sure to love Carnivale. I was hesitant at first, thinking it would be heavy on the South American-side which it is--but it works. I had a strip steak prepared in a traditional brazilian way which made a bit spicy but it was perfect.Great music and a warm environment surround you and let you take a trip to South America, minus the cost! A great place for groups and great for families with a penchant for trying something different. As the evening went on, the bar filled up and by the time we had finished dinner the scene was buzzing with young socials who came out for the night. I definitely see what all the hype was about, and now I've joined the group of people who tells all my friends they need to go here. Definitely try Carnivale, it will not disappoint you!
