I came here again just to be sure the food was still super good. It is. I ordered almost the same thing, instead of red we ordered plain. Personally I thought it was better. Plus, we timed it just right so that we got there and right after we placed our order a ton of people came and the wait was long. I'm super impatient and hate waiting so doing this whole arriving just before the normal eating hour works for me. Can't wait to come back because that will happen in the nearby future.
