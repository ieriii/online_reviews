Cold day = craving pho. yum-my!!! I always go to another joint down the street which I love, but attempted to venture to another place with good ratings and was not disappointed! We both had vegetarian pho and veggie spring rolls and they were the absolute most perfect thing to eat on a cold winter day; I wouldn't change a thing about either. Here's where we differ from my standby (777) - I got a lime soda which was THE BEST THING EVAH! (not sure if competition has it and I never saw it on menu? since most menus are pretty much the same in this stretch), but my partner had a bubble tea which he thought wasn't as good as the competition (too thick and milky with slightly off-tasting tapioca), so the deciding factor (the drinks since food was equally tasty) was a toss-up. Still I'd go again, happily. And I suspect in the summer, a take-out of lime soda will be a regular occurrence!
