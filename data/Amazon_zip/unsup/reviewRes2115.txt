Tip: A minute before 10:30am on Saturday, and there's barely any line. Of course maybe you don't want to face eating hot dogs at 10:30am on Saturday -- fair enough. Wasn't crazy about my duck sausage with blood orange mustard and blue cheese -- I mean, it tasted good, but the sausage was a wee bit dry. And at first, the duck fat fries didn't overwhelm me. I thought they were really good, crispy, brown, fresh fries, but just as good as fries fried in regular ol' peanut oil. But the weird thing is that they kinda got better and better over time. I snacked on them out of desperation later in the afternoon (yes, a little gross) and I'll be damned if they still weren't pretty crisp and fresh-tasting. Bionic fries!
