I am the kind of girl that loves a big cheeseburger and good beer, so obviously I had to check out Bad Apple. I have been here several times since my first visit in late December and I know I will continue to visit in the future. Most important to me is their affordable beer selection. There are other bars that serve good beers, but as you are drinking it you can't help but to think about how much they are ripping you off. Not here! (I usually go for the Left Hand Milk Stout) Their burgers as well as service are always great as well. While I have never been here during dinner time on a Friday or Saturday night I am always surprised at how much open seating there is when I am there. I truly want Bad Apple to be very successful in the future, I just hope it doesn't ever turn into the chaos of the "other" burger place.
