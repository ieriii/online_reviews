While on a business trip to Chicago we found this place in the booklet at the Hotel. This was a fabulous place, the brazilian salad bar was very fresh and had everything you could think of. The bacon chicken was excellent, the steak, on and on, they just keep coming to the table. That was some good food! Way better than the place in San Fran, the meat was tasty at both, but the salad bar was really excellent at this place.The DRINKS! OhMyGawd! GOOD!
