MMM.... Love you! Love you! Love you! You would get all 5 stars if you weren't so expensive...  I've been here a few times and each time I've loved it. It's been the best Korean BBQ place in the area I've been to. I crave it.  I love the wine selection so much I now make regular trips to the Korean grocery store just for the liquor. haha.  The service is by American standards not that great, but let's get real folks, it's an authetic Korean restaurant, not an American one. My waitresses have always been super helpful in telling me what to order, nearly demanding it at times. But you do have to ask for things multiple times before it comes and it is occasionally hard to order or understand what your server is saying. But in the end, I get food and it tastes great! I love the seating also, it's very traditional.  If you are not adventurous and don't do well with standards that are normal for other cultures, you should probably stick to the Cheesecake Factory.
