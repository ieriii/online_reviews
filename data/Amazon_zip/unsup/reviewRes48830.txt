This place is very cool! I went there for the first time for a beer pairing dinner with Stone Brewing. I got to meet with one of the founders of Stone. He was super cool, and I shared a bottle of very rare Why Winter from Two Bros Brewing with him. The decore is warm and fun. I especialy liked the booths, thay have doors on them! The food we where served was top notch. Because we had a set menu, I can only guess that their everyday menu must be outstanding, bassed on our pairings. The chef knows his flavors. The course that stood out the most was dessert. Cheesecake served on a toffy crust with masserated blueberrys, paired with Stone Smoked Porter! The other courses were also super. The main course was in house made ham, served with spicy sweet potato mash savoy cabbage walnuts and mole sauce! This dish was well thought out and exicuted.   The beer menu is also super. I had a Monks Cafe flemish sour on tap, a rare find. Also some of my favorets, including Whitcap Pater single and of course Hop Juice DIPA. I was pleasently surprised to see thay had a few bottles of Why Winter. That was our night cap.   This place is awsome if you like good beer. I will have to go back to eat from the menu. No T.V. in the place is a cool thing too. The bathrooms are clean and cool, with tall doors and super speedy Dyson hand dryers! Not a place for bargen dinning, but you get what you pay for.
