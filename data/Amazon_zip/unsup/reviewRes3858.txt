I challenge anyone to find better wings in chicago then Crisp. Seriously. None of your puny freezer dried crap here. The quantity may be misleading, because their wings include BOTH the wing, and the associated drumstick. So 5 is like 10 anywhere else.  I have tried their other fares, and all are good, but i keep going back for the wings. The guys that work there are great, esp. Howie and Alden,  (yeah, I go there enough I know their names...), and are more then happy to accomodate any mixture of tastes you might have a proclivity for. Again, find better wings in chicago, I dare you.
