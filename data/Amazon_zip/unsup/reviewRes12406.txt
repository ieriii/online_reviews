absolutely delicious! we went there twice in two days, and killed off a small between 2 ppl. got the white with mashed potatoes the first day, then the same thing plus bacon the next day. we had 4 other pizzas, all deep dish, with tons of ingredients, but the simplicity of this one is amazing. i really miss it :(
