Went to Tank Noodle for the first time on Saturday afternoon, the victim of a crushing hangover. The service was not good at all, but the noodles more than made up for it. Two standouts: Beef Pho and Lemongrass Chicken with rice. The Pho was full of beef and noodles; the broth was excellent.  The Lemongrass Chicken had nice spice to it and was very flavorful. This is not a fancy restaurant, and there was a wait when I went. I would argue that it's worth the wait. There's no atmosphere, it took forever to get food, but I have been thinking about that bowl of noodles for the last four days.
