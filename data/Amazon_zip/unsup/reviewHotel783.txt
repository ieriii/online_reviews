I love you priceline! I was a little disappointed as I booked my flight to Chicago to spend a weekend away with my boyfriend as he had to go for a few days for work- there was a gigantic city-wide convention in town and all the hotels were booked or $300+ to stay anywhere decent. I have been lucky with priceline before- and since I could cancel my Best Western reservation up until 6pm the night of arrival I thought that I would gamble and see what I could get. Luckily we got this place for $100 a night instead of its $369 rack rate. Wooohooo! We were happy with the location as it was right on Michigan Avenue in the thick of things. The room was spacious and clean, but since we got in so late because of our American Airlines flight (we flew them in the middle of all the drama of canceled flights) we could only get a room with two beds that seemed like they were full size. We picked possibly the worst weekend to go as it was pouring rain, windy and freezing the whole time, but we were happy to be able to come back to nap and stay warm in a really nice hotel,
