Lookin' for some hot pho baby this evenin' I need some hot pho baby tonight I want some hot pho baby this evenin' gotta have some hot pho Don't give me that look! You know you get Donna Summer stuck in your head some times too!! Unfortunately 777 was closed so Mr Nachos and I walked two buildings down for a different Pho place. Yes, there are probably around 86 Pho places just on this street alone. But as we learned they are NOT all the same. Tank kind of reminds me of a cafeteria more then a restaurant. A few tables on the sides and front but the whole middle of the room is filled with big long tables. Families sitting next to other families, it all seemed to work well. The waiters also bring around carts to clean or to bring out the food. They just zipped up and down the aisles. Speaking of the service, like Nachos said "Service was quick at the beginning but forgot about us, and we had to flag down the check.". As for the food... it wasn't horrible but we BOTH were picking out items to toss from our meals. I also got an order of the spring rolls; I think I'll pass on them next time. Pho is very filling and perfect for those winter days. Add some Bubble tea and it makes for a mellow and content evening. Like Kyle, I'd go back but only as a back up place to Pho 777.
