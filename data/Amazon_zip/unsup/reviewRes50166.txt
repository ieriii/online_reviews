Amazing place. I was in jeans and a t-shirt, and felt a bit under dressed at first, but I was not. The ambiance was great. Service was amazing. This is definitely a place where they do not hurry you out. We sat and had a great conversation over appetizers, main course and desert. I had the absolute most amazing Chicken and Dumplings I've ever had. The broth was perfect. Just enough pepper and the Chicken was so tender and juicy.
