i live a hundred yards away from the long eagleman. i've been there twice. both times my sig other and i left after the first beer and went to smallbar. i like the decor. i liked the beers i had. the bartenders and fellow patrons were friendly. i just don't like the layout. it's really mostly just a restaurant with 10 seats at the bar and a crowded corner to stand in that constantly has servers weaving through. which is fine if that's what you're looking for. except as a vegetarian there's not much motivation to go to a restaurant with one veg option. in conclusion...i miss the winds. skittle martinis, open-mic drum-circle nights and all.
