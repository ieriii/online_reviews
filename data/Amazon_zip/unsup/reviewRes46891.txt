Really really good drinks. Both boozy and coffee. Service is always pretty great. Knowledgeable smiley people who greet you with coffee even when they were out as late as you were (as overheard by my bat ears). Too bad the food can't back it up. Yeah, I said it. The food leaves much to be desired. Under seasoned and overpriced. I get the appeal of the organic foods and local farms and markets but ya ain't doing them any justice either, Menu Makers!
