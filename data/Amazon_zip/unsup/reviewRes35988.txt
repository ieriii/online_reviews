Super duper stoked the night that I finally decided to Sun Wah...My asian friends were telling me about this place that I would just love it. Came on a Friday night, good decent crowd, but no wait. As you walk in you see all the animals cooking on hooks, probably not the best date for your vegetarians, but then again BBQ of any ethnic is not the place for veg eaters! :) Decided to go w/ the BBQ combo and I think it was shrimp fried rice. A big plate comes out w/ two layers and 3 different meats on it. Duck, pork, and chicken. I obviously tried the duck first and it was floored by the flavors. The meat would melt right in your mouth.  I didnt even want to try the others bc I was in a meat duck coma at this time. I ate the whole top level of duck and went in for the 2nd level and a bit into fattier, bonier, almost like the garbage meat of the duck. It was like that for the whole bottom row. Kinda makes sense presentation and best meat on top to hide the other stuff they give you! Typical but still its not as good.  Moving onto the pork and it was great again. Loved it, flavorful and not dried out. The chicken well was just chicken. Not great, not bad. Chicken never does anything for me...The fried rice was just ok. More bland for me but I still had no problem eating it. HA! :) My friend had a noodle soup and she said it was a great asian soup.  The best part about this meal was when the bill came. No they didnt give you free ice cream and palette cleansers, nor where there any happy endings. I know that was randomn, but honestly my bill for all of this was like $22 bucks! Ive never been to dinner almost anywhere, to eat like a king and queen, and on top of it be great! No alchy was consumed but I almost felt like I should've paid more. :) It was almost like that the Sun Wah-s waving over my head when I made this choice! Haha...terrible I know, but kinda funny!
