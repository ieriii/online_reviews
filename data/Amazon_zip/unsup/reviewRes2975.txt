I got engaged at this restaurant, simply put it's best dining experience I've ever had. The decor is very simply and yet exquisite. There are literally a dz servers all dressed in black suits continually replacing silverware, linen, and tableware. We had the chef's prixed menu, it seemed like endless platings of eclectic cuisines. The most memorable had to be the caviar staircase, which is a showcase of abut 8 different caviars sitting on crystal spiral stairs. It was exquisitely presented but taste wise forgetable. I am not a fan of caviars. Overall, I'm truly in love with this restaurant for it's top notch service and sophistications.
