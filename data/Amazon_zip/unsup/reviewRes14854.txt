Just opened last week. They are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner Monday-Saturday.  The Ropa Vieja dinner is my favorite. The dinner portions are large and can be shared. They include rice and black beans and plantains. There is minimal seating inside and some seating outside. The owner and staff are welcoming and answer the intriguing questions of the forbidden.
