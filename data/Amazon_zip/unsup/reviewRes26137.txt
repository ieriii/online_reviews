The fondue is amazing! Everything about this restaurant deserves 5 stars, the location, the decor, the food, the wine, and the service! The waiters are so helpful and they explain everything to you and offer suggestions. The cheese fondue is delicious and we had the steak and shrimp fondue for the main course. Follow that up with the chocolate fondue and you will be so happy you went there. It's amazing!
