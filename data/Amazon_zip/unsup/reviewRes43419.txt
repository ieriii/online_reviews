I was wandering around in the area (wig-shopping and post-officing!) one Saturday afternoon, when I got really, really hungry. It was that weird time of day, between brunch & lunch. Brunch places were closing up and lunch places were not quite open yet! Luckily, I stumbled across Milk & Honey. I had a sandwich (it was like 2:30pm, so no breakfast) and a Bloody Mary. The sandwich was perfect! But the Bloody Mary was truly, unexpectedly, outstanding. mmmmm Cheese, sausage, pickles, olives and..what is that, homemade giardinara? YES PLEASE Plus, b/c it was the afternoon the place was almost deserted so I didn't have to wait, and I got to sit right in the sun. I'll be coming back.
