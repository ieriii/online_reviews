The best tacos. Ever. Amazing. I crave these about once a week. Go to the little yellow hut on the east side of the street. Sit at the counter and enjoy your authentic carne asada tacos, and if you'd like ask for extra limes. Just perfect. And the Chile Rellano in corn tortilla is pretty amazing too.
