ARE YOU HUNGRY? In the mood for yummy satisfying food to fill the void in an empty stomach?picking the lint out of your pocket book?GO TO SULTANS!!! delicious and cheap!The Falafal is one of the best ive ever had, the lentil soup warm and lovely. I would recommend getting the Falafal spicey, it leaves a warm tingle on the lips without overpowering the delicious taste that exists in and of itself... go there.. enjoy!
