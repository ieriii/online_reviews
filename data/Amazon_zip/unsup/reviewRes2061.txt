We went on Saturday and had the duck fat fries, which are amazing! I also had the smoked yak sausage and the Paul Kelly, they were great! The wait was just over an hour, we didn't get there until about 1:30 though. It is hard to get to the place and a bit pricey if you take a taxi, but its 100% worth it! This place is CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash.
