My sister wanted ribs for her birthday and we had a group of 9. I havent been to Calo in 30 years but checked it out on Yelp. It was great. Comfortable, great friendly service, good prices. Ribs are fall off the bone, Special on Sunday. A couple of people in our party had seafood in pasta, it was great shrimp, octopus, mussels in shell. I had a great time and I'll be back.
