This is really as good as it gets. I no longer live in Chicago, but alas, when I visit, I have to hit Gino's to get my deep dish on.  They now have free WiFi - just ask the server for the password.  The deep dish is still THE BEST and the prices are still good as they were years ago... Yep, it still takes 45 minutes to bake your deep dish so either be patient and wait for it or call in your order before you get there and have it served as soon as you get there and sit down. Either way, this is a must for anyone visiting Chicago,,,ahh Sweet Home Chicago. C'mon baby don't you wanna go...back to dat sweet ole place, sweet home Chicago...
