I've been here a few times (inside, outside, weekend, weekday, etc.). And I have not been crazy impressed. The food is good. But the set up is just weird. It's like they can't decide if they want to be sit-down or counter service. And frankly, due to that confusion they do a poor job of taking care of patrons. Just be counter service or sit down. Then serving costumers is easy. I've never had bad food. But given all the amazing other brunch places in the 'hood, it's not worth it to come here, and certainly not worth the wait.
