Quite simply, I really don't care for Chicago's deep dish (being a NYC transplant and all), but - gasp - I actually enjoyed it at Pequod's tonight. It mainly came down to the following: 1) not as doughy as all those "famous" chains, 2) no disgusting amount of cheese like those "famous" chains, 3) excellent sauce with a hint of smokey flavor, 4) caramelized edge (which I hadn't seen at those "famous" chains).  A sub-par beer list, however. My avid beer enthusiast friend was rather disappointed with his choices of beers throughout the meal.  Next time, I shall try the thin crust and see how it compares to my beloved NY pie.
