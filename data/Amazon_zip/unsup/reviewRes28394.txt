I had a wonderful time at G.E. Friday night! Anyone who says you do not get enough food should stick to going to Maggiano's and not venture into fine dining which G.E. is. The waitstaff is amazing, the food is insanely awesome. The wine selection is top notch! There is nothing bad I can say about G.E. I will be back!
