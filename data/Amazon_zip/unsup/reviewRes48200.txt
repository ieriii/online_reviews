I would give this place 4 stars for the food, but I have to take away one star automatically for the ambiance. Even though it's dimly lit, cozy, and has a unique feel to it because it's an upscale gastropub in the middle of a shady neighborhood (very random, if you ask me) with fancy service...the restaurant is CRAZY loud. I had such a difficult time hearing the handsome man I was sitting across (aka my boyfriend) because people were sooo boisterous! The food was definitely yummy, though. I heard a lot of pork places are on the rise out in Chicago, so this seemed to be a good choice. To start out with, we got the pomme frites! Excellent french fries - they were greasy and probably fried in animal fat, just how McDonalds used to make theirs! :) We got a fresh citrus salad with fruit flown in from California, which was extremely yummy! The asparagus with escargot was good, but the snails were a little too greasy and overly fried for my taste. For dinner, I got the sweetbreads for my entree - it's a very popular veal dish, which tasted just like super yummy chicken nuggets! My bf got their specialty, which is the suckling pig. I enjoyed the pulled pork pieces, as they were very crispy. The portion sizes here are decent, but they still leave a bit to be desired in my opinion. Then again, maybe I'm just used to grossly huge meal portions since I grew up in America. I really enjoyed the dessert! We shared a delicious chocolate bread pudding, which had a wonderfully crispy texture and just the right amount of cinnamon, along with melted chocolate. I loooved this! So again, the food was great and unique...but unfortunately, the place was just too loud. I also don't like the idea of communal tables, especially in uncomfy wooden benches. The environment made me feel like I was in a school back in the early 1900's or something! Kind of a strange experience. Next time I come to Chicago, I plan on hitting up The Purple Pig, which I hear is another cool pork place!
