I can honestly say I came here a few years ago and I told myself I wouldn't be going back b/c I just didn't like their pizza. However, I went back last night and tried their food again. I liked it! I tried mashed potatoes with giardinera and also mushrooms + garlic pizzas. Both were good-- i know what you're probably thinking, mashed potatoes? on a pizza? But trust me, I don't even really like mashed potatoes by themselves, but it was pretty darn good with the giardinera! The service was good-- they were nice a the front door, our waitress was nice, as well. I also liked the fact that they seated a party of 7 people without a wait!!! I guess I don't have much to rant on about this place because it was just plain good and I'm glad I came back a second time.
