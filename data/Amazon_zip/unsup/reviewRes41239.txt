It was my second trip here and it was great. They changed the format so there is no more ala cart, only prixe fix. We did the 5 course along with a suplemental add on of the Duck-Duck-Goose(duck breast, duck confit, and goose liver). THe DDG was our favorite. The amuse bouche was an amazing scallop. The salad course was my least favorite. It was just kind of a wierd deconstructed salad. And the rabbit and gnocchi was great, soup course great. I opted for the Skatewing as my main course but liked the wifes short rib better. And that pomogranite cheesecake blew me away. Great food, great service, and the price is right.
