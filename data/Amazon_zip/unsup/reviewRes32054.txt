This was my second experience with Ethiopian food so I knew diners aren't supposed to eat with utensils. If you want to attain the best of the meal, I'd advise you to dig in with your hand. Literally. It was a Friday evening and we went in a group of six so we figured it'd be best to order the family style messob sampler. We had a vegetarian in the group so they allowed us to order a mix of veggie and meat dishes. It came in a huge bamboo-weaved platter in which the entrees were placed together. The sour Ethiopian flat bread was served in a separate plate. The way to do it is to hold the bread with your left hand and peel small slices with your right hand and proceed to wrap that around a piece of meat or vegetable in the platter. It can become messy, so it will be an ill advice to suggest children below 10 years of age to join in. The food was great although I'm not a fan of the flat bread. Quite a few of the meat choices were spicy so if you're a spicy person, that'd be very satisfying. Many of my friends were also appalled by the presentation of the food. But I believe it's the quality and flavor that should be prioritized. Enjoy the meal open-heartedly and do not be judgmental. It can be a pleasant dining experience. Service was superb and they also had a live band for the evening. There is street parking as well as a parking lot for $1.
