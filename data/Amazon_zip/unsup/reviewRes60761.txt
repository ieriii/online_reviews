Went her last Saturday night on the suggestion of my sister and loved it! Much better location than the Wrigley one and a much better space. Great beer menu, including some of my favorites from Hopleaf, and and even better dinner menu. Started with the sweet potato fries with goat cheese dipping sauce (could have drank the rest down, it was so good)... My boyfriend said his meatloaf was some of, if not THE best his ever had. I had the pumpkin ravioli with hazelnuts and gorganzola which was also amazing. Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert. We will definitely be going back!!!
