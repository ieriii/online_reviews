The best service and Italian that I have eaten in the city. The first time I ate at Sapori we were seated by the kitchen (my fault for making reservations 10 minutes before). Although the seats were not ideal the staff made the experience well worth it. The owner actually brought out free appetizers and dessert for the entire table, as well as offering to re-seat us several times. Not only was the service excellent the food was AMAZING and the portions were large. You definitely get what you pay for and more.  Lastly, about a month later I received a handwritten letter and a $14 gift certificate in the mail which was signed by the cook/owner. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the mood for a good meal and great service.
