My last meal on earth would be a steak... from here. I'm a repeat offender when it comes to this restaurant. I prefer to start off with the chicken and beef empanadas. They also have cheese ones which I've heard are good, but my stomach won't allow me to have those. The empanada plate comes with a nice, simple salad that I find quite tasty. If I'm feeling like a fat kid, I might add the grilled shrimp appetizer to the group. Always amazing. The reason why I come here - the skirt steak. Second time you come here, try whatever you want. But if this is your first visit, be sure there is mind-blowing slab of cow on your plate. You can get one big piece or a combination of two different proteins. I wish I could give this place maybe half a star less because they put these plain, boring, dry potatoes on every one of my plates, insulting my skirt steak. Also, every drink I've tried there has been very lack luster. Overly sweet and pulpy. Oh well. Go on a week day and bring your own bottle of wine. Red wine. To compliment your steak.
