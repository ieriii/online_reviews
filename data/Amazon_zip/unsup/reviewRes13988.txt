90 miles? No distance is too far too to come for this Cuban deliciousness. (Insert annoying Proclaimers song here: "But I would walk 500 miles....and I would walk 500 more.") This place rocks. Not only does it get points right off the bat for the actual building itself (tiny and unassuming, beautiful mural artwork all over it, cozy get-to-know-the-stranger-sitting-next-to-you inside seating) it scores big for the consistently great food and friendly employees. Sample of an experience goes something like this:  1. Parking: Easily park in their lot or on many open spaces in the street.   2. Ordering: Order, and while waiting you may be treated to a free sample. Last time we were there it was with a cup of their Cuban coffee. Sweet, big flavor and ah-mazingly thick. (That's what she said.)  3. Scarfing: Eat at the few seats inside bar area or take it outside to the cute side patio. My suggestion? Opt for the Guarjirito: a killer grilled steak (or pork if you like) sandwich that uses fried green plantains instead of bread. The sandwich is fairly large, so it should fill you--but if feeling extra hungry, add an empanada or two to your order.
