Oh, Chicago Diner. It hurts me to say this. When I first moved into the 'hood, I was thrilled. You were right down the street. We hung out a lot, I recognized your waiters, I practically had the menu memorized. But things have changed. I mean, we're still friends. But you took the chicken parm sandwich off the menu - which was the best sandwich ever. The vibe isn't quite the same. The food is fine, but not outstanding like used to be. So I'll still come here if a friend suggests it, but I don't have the craving anymore.
