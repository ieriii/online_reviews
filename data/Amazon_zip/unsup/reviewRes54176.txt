I had a phenomenal lunch here. Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and waited in line for about 45 minutes. We bought a couple of beers and some chips and guacamole to enjoy while we waited. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There's no pressure to find a seat, they'll find one for you. Someone passed out menus to look at while we waited in line. At the counter they assured me I could come to the take-out line after I finished my meal to get a hot churro. Had the Woodland Mushroom and Ahodaga tortas. Both were incredible. I found the Ahodaga to be extremely spicy but super delicious. The Woodland Mushroom melted in my mouth it was so tasty. The two of us were so full by the end of the meal, but attempted to stuff down some dessert. I got into the take-out line to order a few churros and a chocolate cafe con leche. Delicious. I wish I'd tried the chocolate but I was already so full. My only complaint is that this place isn't open on Sundays and Mondays. I definitely would have returned for breakfast or for the soups (served after 3pm). Nonetheless, this is a great option if you can't get a reservation or don't want to spend more $ at one of the other Rick Bayless places.
