Ohmygosh. Giordano's nom, nom, nom!!! Chicago hands down is the best food city in the US. After eating NYC pizza and Chicago pizza I am handing the trophy to Chicago for their pie. And if you go to Chicago for pizza Giordano's seems to be the place to be. At least that is what I have been told. I would love to go back and try more pizza places, just to compare. This would be after I purchase stock in stretch pants companies. The best part of Giordano's is the dough. I was picking mine apart and examining it up against the light, I was rubbing it in between my fingers like a kid with Play Dough just to see how it would roll. The dough is so FRESH, and bouncy, and delicious. I was told they chop up garlic and put in the mix which is part of the reason why it is so good. The cheese is smooth, and doesn't make you have to choke which is good for me because I choke on food all the time. (small windpipe). The red sauce is fresh and doesn't taste like it came out of a can. I was told by an experienced diner that you should always order a medium or smaller otherwise the large could still be a bit raw in the middle. Not sure if this is true but just a tip. These pizza's are so good you can order them and ship them to loved one's for special occasions, like Christmas or birthdays. Ladies, no cologne for your man. This pizza is your answer. They ship next day, on dry ice. It is a present you can partake in too, if you can get them to share.
