Originally from Kansas City, so I have high expectations for BBQ. Great BBQ for me is sliced brisket that has a deep pink color into the meat as a result of the smoking process, or textured pulled pork that isn't a ball of mush. Along with that - great BBQ meat will be flavored by the rub and the wood that has smoked the meat, and there isn't any need for much BBQ sauce. The sauce is a condiment, you like to taste it, but like a great hamburger you don't want the mustard or ketchup to over power the meat. That being said, the meat that I had included, baby back ribs, sliced brisket, and the pulled pork, and is the reason for the 2 stars. As for the BBQ sauce, I like the spicy and the South Carolina were both good (3 stars). I did really enjoy the house made pickles, jalapeno hush puppies with a spicy sauce (3 stars), the bourbon cocktails were a nice addition to the BBQ menu, as well. The atmosphere is very much "gold coast", fun and loud, but comfortable for a Friday/Saturday night. Casual dress for men but the ladies will want to look cute/sexy/flirty. If you want truly tasty BBQ in Chicago then go to Smoke Daddy or Smoque.
