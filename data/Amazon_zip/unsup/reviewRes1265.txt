Reason #1 you should skip the overcrowded Elston Target(bleh), and go to Addison Mall for a Target fix: You're an extremely short drive or walk away from Hot Doug's goodness, and even better if you do it on a weekday! After going on a Saturday this past summer, I can honestly say I never will do that again. The thought of going here suddenly came when I was helping my mom shop at the Addison Mall Tar-ghey, and I'm so glad it occurred in my mind right as I was leaving there. My new favorite sausage by far is their Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage, the thought of how amazing it was almost makes me want to go there right this second. I tried my mom's Polish, and it interestingly was the first time I'd ever gotten one of their basic meats(traditionally sticking to the gourmet sausages). Finally, I will second Julia's comment about how great of an idea it is to program HD's number into your cell phone. I've done it, and making either a call to that(or checking the website beforehand) will save you accidental trips when Doug takes a break(err, vacation) from serving gourmet sausages, and(obviously) call your order in.
