Look for an update on this place the next time I go and I will definitely go again. The whole prix fixe menu was very well done. Nice variety of flavors, textures and some rather usual stuff. One of the cooler things about the food is the presentation, for those of you into eating your food with your eyes as well as your mouth, you'll enjoy this a lot. OH and the BYOB was great. With corkage, food, tax and tip the bill was very reasonable for the number of courses and the service. I will say the service was really good.  Only downside to the meal and this was a big downside that's why I'm looking to try this place again because I don't think this will happen again or at least I really hope this doesn't happen again....We were the last people to be sat, which was on purpose because I figured by the end of the night it was be a little quieter. I say this because its a really small restaurant with only 26 seats. For some reason in an almost completely empty restaurant, the host sits us next to a party of four who were celebrating a birthday. I knew I should have said something, but didn't. These people were so loud and the friendly staff was joining in on the conversation that is was just really really annoying. I was on a date looking to be able to actually have a conversation which in a restaurant with 6 people shouldn't be a problem. It actually got to the point where I had to say something to the people behind me because I didn't feel like yelling during what should have been a nice quite meal. It would have been better if the place was full and all the talking sounded more like white noise. After saying something to the people next to us they were a little bit better but still pretty much yelling. So in closing I'm planning to go back to see if its possible to not only enjoy the food, but also enjoy the meal.
