Outstanding time and time again. The thin body of the pizza dough with that exceptional burnt bubbly crust excites every taste sensation I have. The hand pulled dough gives the pizza a chewy yet crisp crust that get enhanced by the fire in the wood burning oven. Go for the over simplied toppings such as tomato, garlic and herbs. Add bufalo mozz for an extra treat. One must is to ask for the house infused chili olive oil to moisten the pizza and bring out yet another layer of flavor. The nice touches by owner Joe such as a small comp glass of sparkling at the beginning or end always brings a smile to my face and reminds me of the home goodness of this joint. Only thing I could ask for is a view of the bay of Napoli with Mt. Vesuvius smouldering in the background.
