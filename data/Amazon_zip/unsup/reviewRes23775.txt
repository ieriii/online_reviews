you know what..im not asian..by any means..but what i do know is this place to me at least was pretty authentic..i say this because the place was packed and my buddy and i were some of the only white boys in there... rocked out the szechuan chicken..ha..why not..it was a yelp recommendation..and it was hot..maybe because they poured the chili pepper bottle into the sauce..good stuff though..the chicken fell apart while i ate it..my buddy had the duck..and i think he was a fan of it..the wonton soup was pretty awesome and his hot and sour was really good too...they made home made sweet and sour and spicy mustard sauces for the crab rangoon and egg rolls also. good stuff big fan..if you feel like being an asian for a day..this spot up right off the chinatown red line..then go get some desserts down the street from the asian bakeries..you cant find that stuff anywhere else in the city
