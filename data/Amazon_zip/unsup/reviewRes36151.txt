Went to the one in Greektown after a patient suggested it. We waited a little bit... for 4 of us... but that happens when you go during prime time. The food was delicious as was the pineapple, ginger, pear juice I got. But my friend chewed on a piece of plastic in her eggs... looks like they cut a package open and left the corner in her eggs. The waitress was right at the table and saw the whole thing happening, my friend pulling this large piece of plastic out of her mouth, and she didn't do anything about it, not even an apology. It was a crowded place. The turnover was fast, which was why we were seated so fast... but also because they don't really check up on you and refill your water. That's why the 2 stars.... for booty ass service and careless about our satisfaction. See my review for the other Meli on Wells
