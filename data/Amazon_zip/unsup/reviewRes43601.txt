This place is definitely in my standard rotation of brunch spots. While it sounds like many reviewers don't like the way service is run here, I beg to differ. I am amazed at how many people Milk & Honey is able to serve in such a small place...and so quickly! Even when there is a long line, and the place looks packed, I have always had a table waiting for me by the time I place my order. It's so efficient! And SO much better than the 45 minute wait you often have to endure at other popular brunch spots. Plus, their prices are much lower than other brunch places around town...I've always assumed this is because they don't have waitresses. So, I love the way Milk & Honey does things. That being said, if you're looking to be waited on for a long, leisurely brunch, this isn't the spot. As for the food...the oatmeal is amazing! It's perfect on a cold chicago morning. As a decaf coffee drinker (love coffee, hate feeling caffinated. I know, it's weird), I appreciate that they have good decaf too. It's surprisingly hard to find! I know people love the Huevos, but I've always found them to be a bit bland. Not my favorite menu option. Pretty much everything else is delicious though. Highly recommended!
