We went here because it averaged four stars on Yelp!. Needless to say, I had pretty high expectations about the entire restaurant package. I wasn't impressed, based on both quality of food for the price and the service we received. We (a party of six) were put outside in the small corner after a 15min or so wait, which was fine. However, our server, when taking our drinks, tried to get us to order small bottles of soda instead of fountain drinks without actually telling us about the fountain (which has free refills). When we discovered this after he left and informed him, he stated solemnly that he had already put in the order for the bottled sodas and could not return it. After arguing with him about it, he resumed his service with the replacement, only having an unpleasant demeanor the entire time. If you want us to be good patrons, don't try to trick us! The food was good, but not as good as I expected - nor was it particularly unique and exquisite for the price. I ordered the Grecian Spaghetti - very basic, I know - but it wasn't of either impressive size nor quality. I admit that I could potentially have a four- or five-star experience here. However, my experience was only worthy of three.
