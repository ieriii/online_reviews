I had been dying to try Sunda since it opened. I recently started working right around the corner and was craving Asian so decided to take the opportunity give Sunda a try. The only positive was that the staff was surprisingly very nice, especially the bartender who handled my takeout order. The negative = the food. I ordered the Loompya and Lo Mein with beef off of the lunch menu. I really wanted to try the sushi instead but couldn't fathom spending that much money on lunch ($30 wasalready pushing it...) I'm pretty convinced the Loompya came from a freezer bag. You know those terrifying frozen snack taquitos soccer moms feed to their kids? Yeah... I'm pretty convinced the loompya here is made by the same company. They didn't taste fresh to me whatsoever. Several of my coworkers tried them as well and agreed, many of them joking that it's something that would be decent when you're drunk --- but that's about it. The Lo Mein was super greasy (and that's going out on a limb for me since my grease tolerance is pretty high, ha). The dish in general was bland and so greasy that I could only eat about 1/4 of the dish before tossing it. The only positive was the bok choy mixed in. In short? I don't get the hype. I'm guessing that perhaps Sunda is better known for their sushi than for their other dishes? If I had bought the loompya and lo mein from a street cart or a food court and had paid $7 for it, I'd totally be fine. But getting it from such a buzzed-about restaurant and paying $30 for things off of the lunch menu? BLEH. Not a fan.
