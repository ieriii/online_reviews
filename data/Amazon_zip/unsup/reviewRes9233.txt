I went to Le Colonial on Saturday of Restaurant week for lunch. I love the theme of the place with the trees inside and how cozy it looks. The service was excellent and the food was unbelievable. The Business Prefix menu was a great deal 22.50 for 2 courses and it had several plates to choose from. So was the Restaurant Week menu, I like that they had several options to pick from. For dessert, my boyfriend and I shared the Banana wonton and it was soooo good definitely recommend it. This place is a great spot! Would definitely go back for dinner or lunch.
