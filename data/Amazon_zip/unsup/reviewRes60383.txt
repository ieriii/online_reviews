very much a touristy deep-dish sensation. although it is good they have certainly become a franchise and have gone off what made them so great. however, I still enjoy a deep dish Giordano's pizza for old times sake. usually with the family because they find it acceptable to wait such a long time to be seated. I usually bypass this and get a better pizza. But i am a good grandpa.
