Coming to 90 Miles was my first experience of Cuban food, and I definitely have to say that I love it! Just about everything about 90 Miles shows the thought and effort that has gone into making this a lovely restaurant. The decor is homey, and very welcoming. The servers are very friendly. I went for dinner and had the Ropa Viejas. This was absolutely delicious and mouth watering. My friend and I also wanted to try a few desserts. I had the Flan which is perfectly portioned, and equally delicious. My friend had the Bread Pudding; I was surprised to see that it was a very large piece of soaked bread instead of a pudding. I thought that it was great, but the portion size was a bit much to finish.
