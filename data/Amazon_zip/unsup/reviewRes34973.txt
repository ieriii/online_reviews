I gave a poor qualification to this restaurant because of terribly slow service and regular food. I said you could close your eyes, go to a Red Lobster and probably have a better dining experience than at Shaw's. However, I downgraded the rating even more, because after my first review, I was contacted by the restaurant, and this person apologized and offered a later call from the VP of whatever to chat with me. THEY NEVER CALLED ME BACK. and if you are reading this Amanda, don't even bother doing it. Awful service all around.
