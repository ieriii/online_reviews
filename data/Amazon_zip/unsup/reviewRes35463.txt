Even after living on the East Coast, I didn't love oysters until I came to Shaw's. I know... you're thinking "oysters in the midwest??" Indeed. Fresh and tasty. And what is that frozen champagne/vinegar (?) sauce they serve as an alternative to cocktail sauce? Delicious! That's what! My husband and I prefer to sit in the bar, which is always bustling and on some nights has a great band. Too bad they don't regularly feature fresh clams and mussels. 6/18/2012 I just had dinner at Shaw's again tonight. I had the sampler of 6 oysters... still delicious. Fresh and ocean-flavored, just like they should be. Just when you think the menu is same ol' same ol' ... a chopped seafood salad shows up on the menu. It was totally delicious to the last bite. Yum!
