In town for a medical conference at the nearby Hilton, I ate at Yolk three times in four days. The first two times I was alone and I must say it is a great place for solo diners - a big bar where you can eat, read the paper, and watch the hyper organized yet friendly wait staff and cooks do their yummy thing. The variety of food is amazing and everything is well executed from the pancakes to the omlettes and everything in between. The coffee is constantly refilled.
