We had a group dinner here the other night and it was great!  The prices are a little high. Around $6-15 for appetizers and $18-35 for entrees. Drinks run about $7-12. My fiance had the pork chops and they were delicious as was my seafood rice dish. I think everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  This is a good place for a large group. It may be too big and too noisy for a romantic dinner.
