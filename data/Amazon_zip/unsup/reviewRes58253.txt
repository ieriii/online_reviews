They don't have mustard, mayo, cornichons... heh. I wonder if the waitress even new what pickles were. Before I could let her finish her uneducated excuse that the chefs were really particular.... I gave up. If I were her I would have given up 5 weeks ago when they first opened. Mario Batali's protege- you should be ashamed- no mustard? f... man.
