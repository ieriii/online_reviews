A friend and I went at 9:30 am on a Saturday, which for most brunch places means that we're all by ourselves in a sea of empty tables. At Bongo Room, that means that we manage to snag the last two counter seats. The place really felt much more like a bar than somewhere we would normally go for brunch.  The bartender/waitress behind the counter was very helpful. She made sure that my coffee cup was never less than 3/4 full and when I asked about the berry French toast, she told me that I could have the "half-portion," which was definitely not stated on the menu. It was awesome that she suggested that, since I could barely finish the half. But what I did eat was more decadent than dessert.  The toast itself served as a background for a mound of blackberries, strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, covered in a rich sauce. I'm not huge on having something very sweet for breakfast, but I definitely would love to have that again! My friend had the lemon blueberry pancakes, which was good but not as great as mine. Despite the fact that it was a busy morning, we didn't feel rushed at all and took our time enjoying the food. The only cons were: 1) the food took about thirty minutes to come out, 2) really? $3.00 for milk?
