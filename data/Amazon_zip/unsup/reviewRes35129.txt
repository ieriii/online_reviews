I ordered one of the rice bowls ($13)....it was disgusting. I did not enjoy it one bit. After the 2nd bite i couldnt eat anymore because it tasted so bad. My friends ordered 3 different types of sushi and only liked one of them. The only time we saw our waitress was when she took our order, dropped off the food and gave us the check. She never once asked us if we liked what we were eating or if we needed anything else. This place had random art decorations and no windows. We had 3 different sushi rolls and my rice bowl and had water...we paid $83 with tip. NOT WORTH IT!
