3.75 stars, but I rounded up to give it a 4. Overall, it was a really nice dining experience. I don't normally like Italian food, but I was impressed by the their culinary skills. This place was really busy for a Tuesday night, but I think that's partly due to the Lady Gaga concert that was happening. I mention the crowd because their waiting area is quite small. They may be able to seat 12 people at the bar, but that's really about it. We ended up going to the wine bar across the street to wait for our table. Once we sat down, we really started to appreciate the cozy, close-to-home-but-classy atmosphere. Ordering was pleasant because our waiter was very pleasant. The food...the food is what makes this place. We started with three appetizers: stewed calamari, truffle egg toast with fontana and asparagus, and the crispy pork belly with apple mostarda. All were outstanding except for the calamari. It wasn't bad, but stewing it isn't my preference. The truffle egg toast is just simply out of this world. Then we ordered a bunch of entrees to get a taste of everything. The pizza della fattoria was a pleasant surprise. I didn't think pork belly and farmed eggs go on a pizza, but that goes to show how ignorant I've been. Then came the polenta board and bistecca alla griglia. Very interesting taste. After that were the pasta dishes - riccio di mare e granchio (linguine plus sea urchin and crab) and paccheri con salsiccia (rigatoni and sausage) - both were done very nicely. The only disappointment came at the end - the Kobe NY Strip - it was under-seasoned, over-cooked...just overall a mistake. If this is how Italians cook Kobe steaks, they should stop doing this right away. But like I said, this was an enjoyable experience, definitely worth checking out.
