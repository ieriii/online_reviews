How have I not reviewed this spot yet? This is my favorite Pho place in Chicago. Their broth is the BEST in my opinion - it is SO good - not too salty, not bland, just right! It's a standout...a place you go craving for especially when the days turn cold. I always get #47 (Vietnamese beef noodle) and add meatballs into it. I get this specifically because i do not like flank steak and those other kinds of meats that are put into traditional Pho. Basically any of those soups in this section of the menu has that special broth so order whatever! Also, their Taro bubble milk shake is SO good - i'd say they make one of the best in the city. They also make really fresh spring rolls. If you're not a Pho lover, no problem - as you'll see, their menu is really huge and from what i hear, a lot of their dishes are just really good. So take ur pick! Their desserts are just ok, but i think it's just that vietnamese desserts are not my thang.
