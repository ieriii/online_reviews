There is a door hidden within the giant violet expanse that is the exterior covered by an eye-test of geometric shapes directly across from Big Star. You'll never find the door if you're already drunk. Beautiful, sensuous setting with velvet drapes, candlelight and tall-back seats. The ambiance is non-distracting and oh-so-chill in shades of greys and whites giving center stage to your amazingly delicious cocktails (1st) and conversation partner(s) (2nd). We arrived at 6PM just as the doors opened and we were the first ones in. 3 hours later, not realizing how quickly time went by, the lounge had filled up and we didn't even realize that others had been seated and well into their cocktails and conversations. Private in a public setting which is so hard to do. Well done VH!!! Yelp has this listed as "dressy." I didn't find it to be that way, nor do they require it, though it's not a tattered jeans and flipflop type of establishment. Be sure to check out the house rules on their website for a very specific list of don't's. Perfect for a night out with girlfriends or as a date-night starter (or finisher). Whatever sultry mood you establish from within its velvet walls, make sure it's solid before you step out because walking out onto N Damen slaps you with reality on the opposite end of the spectrum.
