The food was really good for what it was, they just gave so much rice that my mind was blown. If you're only going to get one kabob of something for instance, sweet god, just get more alright? It's one of those things where you're not getting rice wth a kabob you're getting a kabob with rice. But the rice is good. Personally I'm not too much a fan of the dill rice, but I looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooved the Persian rice. You can get half and half or one or the other. Personally I think the half and half though is pretty cool. I had chicken from there so I have to recommend it because it was tasty. Kind of a crappy parking situation outside, but it's manageable. :)
