The food was really tasty and the presentation was phenomenal and really added to the experience. Some highlights... '8 tastes of summer' which were 8 small bites presented on one plate with a variety of interesting flavor combinations from blueberries macerated with horseradish to cucumber ice with black tahini. A lot of the items were very carefully put together, you could tell they put a lot of time into plating each course, especially with the small bites, with great attention to detail. Another highlight was the peach flight which involved 7 different peach desserts on one plate, along with some cilantro foam and god knows what else. Another dessert course involved a watermellon coulis and an 'ice cream' made with angostura bitters and habaneros that was so good as to be possibly habit forming. I'm not going to give 5 stars because I reserve that for Alinea, but this was damn good. I would venture to say the peach dessert was one of the best dessert courses I've ever had, including Alinea. Our waitress was really friendly and food came out at exactly the right pace. I left feeling quite full but just short of over the top. Tables were a little close to others, but it's no big deal. I am hoping to come back on a sunday when they make the menu on a whim. All in all, this is one of my favorite places ever right now. Hope to come back for more.
