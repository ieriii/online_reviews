Top 3 reasons I will never, ever go back to this suck-fest. 3. Service blows.   No one seemed to know if we had been helped or not. We were served the wrong order 3 times! Silverware? I guess they like to eat salad with their fingers. Speaking of salad, mine was missing ingredients, not that I could find my waitress to tell her or that it would have mattered. My dinner came out before the appetizers, then everyone elses dinners came out last. We waited for eons for someone to take our check, I finally got up and flagged someone down. 2. The noise level is beyond insane.   I couldn't talk to the person sitting directly across from me, I had to lean over and yell. We were sitting outside. There are TVs outside playing concerts on DVD. Shitty concerts of some dip-shit butchering Johnny Cash. It was painful in more ways than one. 1. It is overflowing with douche-bags.  They were everywhere and they seemed to be multiplying by the second. Where did they all come from? AND.... They serve bagged salad. Disgusting. Is it so hard to wash and cut some lettuce? Any restaurant serving hot wings/buffalo wings that does not pay as much attention to their blue cheese as their buffalo sauce is missing the point. The menu lacks creativity, the food lacks quality ingredients, the ambiance is non-existent and the people saying the mac and cheese rocks must have only eaten Kraft prior to this.
