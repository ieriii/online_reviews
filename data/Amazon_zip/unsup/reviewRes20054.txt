Price range as expected, trendy, dimly lit, and very loud, average sushi. If it weren't so close, I probably wouldn't go back a second time. It's definitely a fusion place rather than authentic/traditional, but the wait was a little long, lots of loud people (it's BYOB and they all brought too much), and they were out of super fat tuna.
