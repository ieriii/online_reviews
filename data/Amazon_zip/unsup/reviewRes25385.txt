Just like many other ladies, i do enjoy my fondue, but I definitely can't see myself going here more than once a year at the most. I loved the romantic dark atmosphere with all the candles and dark shades of red. The food was also quite fresh and tasty. Definitely a notch or two above melting pot. My only complaint was having to fry all the entree meats and seafood in oil. It felt every very unhealthy. i kno...fondue isn't suppose to be healthy but still. after the end of the night, i felt like i had gained 15 lbs and 5 lbs of it was grease from the oil. by the time we left, my face felt all oily from frying the meats and i was FONDUED-OUT.
