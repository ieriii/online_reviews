I had bought a deal on travel zoo because my friends have been here and said it was great....Atmospher is romantic, but its very loud there for such a small place. Cheese was way over-rated. I did not order the meat plate, so I can not say anything about that. Overal I was not very impressed with the food, cheese was too 'cheesy' and the desesert fondue was wayyy too sweet. I wish you were given a choice or cheese and chocolate. I have had better at melting pot =(
