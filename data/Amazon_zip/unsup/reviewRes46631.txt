Did brunch this past Sunday: Positives: You get the full salad bar with the buffet for $12 French Toast in the buffet is the most amazing thing I've ever tasted Cute Mini bagels Even though the breakfast buffet looks small, there's really everything you'd ever want offered there Fresh fruit includes raspberries, strawberries, and pineapple Negatives The cup of coffee was actually an extra $2.50 and probably cost 2 cents to make.... semi-irritating when usually buffets include beverages. Overall, pretty good option for brunch. The servers are friendly and helpful.
