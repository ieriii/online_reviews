This is for non-beer drinkers that find themselves at Hopleaf. Let's be honest... this is not going to be your favorite spot. Do get there early--4p on a recent Sunday felt like an odd time for meeting up for drinks with friends, but we were able to grab a table before it got packed. Also, unless you're miniature size, come even earlier to grab extra chairs and a table to add to the booth. My group seemed to enjoy their variety of beers, but I admit I was disappointed when they didn't have any root beer. Really? You can't even order some bottled Goose Island with the rest of your shipment? Hopleaf, sometimes it's just not meant to be.
