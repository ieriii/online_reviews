Lao Sze Chuan is good, quality Chinese food - I have finally found a place in Chinatown that I can go to. The restaurant is very popular and crowded, and they display all of the press and awards that they have gotten in the past. We ordered a chicken and basil dish that was quite tasty, along with a spicy beef dish. The spicy beef dish was way too spicy for my taste. I enjoyed the other flavors, but I couldn't take the heat. I plan to go back and try some of the other items on the menu. Definitely tell them that you want mild or no heat if you are sensitive to spicy food like me.
