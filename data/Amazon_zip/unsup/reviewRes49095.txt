If you're a carnivore looking to kick it up a notch, this is your place. I came here last night with a group of friends and had a great time. I recommend reservations because this place does get busy. The seating here is communal which might bother some but I thought it was clever and added to the character of the restaurant. The dishes are family style so it's good to get some big entrees and share them.  A friend of mine went on and on about the Mussels here and now I know why. They were superb and come in this great butter sauce that can be soaked up with the loaf of bread it comes with. In addition to the fantastic mussels, we also feasted on the oysters, sweetbreads (I've always been so curious about these), country ribs, potee and carpaccio. Everything was delicious except the ribs were a little dry and the carpaccio wasn't worth the price. We ended the meal with the pear crisp dessert that more than satisfied our sweet tooth. Overall, I recommend this place to anyone looking for something more adventurous in their dining experience.
