I just need to comment on how when you dine at Simply It, it feels like you are being welcome into a household. Each time I have been there, I have been greeted by the man who I assume is the owner. I've always gone for lunch, and always feel like I am being served a multicourse meal, but each time it's a little different. Also, they have avocado wontons on the menu. They are simply a chunk of avocado, and a chunk of cream cheese put together in a wonton and fried. It's delicious and is the best idea since crab rangoon (especially for vegetarians).
