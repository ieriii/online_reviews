Best BBQ in the city! OMG, everything was amazing! Upon sitting down, we were served homemade bread and butter pickles and potato chips . . . both delicious! I highly recommend sharing because you get to taste everything and the portions are large. We started with the hominy Salad (Smoked Corn, Black Beans, Avocados). It was amazing (the theme for all of the food). Even the half portion was hard to finish. U know what they say, life's an entree. . . We had the Q 3 for our entree . . . baby-back ribs, pulled pork and brisket. For sides, we had cornbread and mac and cheese. All the meats were dry-rub so you don't need sauce, but who can resist bbq sauce . . . right? Overall, I was extremely satisfied. I keep thinking about the food and it has been three days (that also could be because I started a 5-day juice cleanse the next morning and I haven't had solid food since). Don't get me wrong, Smoke Daddy and Smoque are good, but Q is by far the best!
