Hopleaf is first and foremost a pub that seems determined to have every Belgian beer ever brewed. Now most places would pride themselves in that alone. However there is also a very healthy representation of the North American craft brews. That is usually enough reason for me to never leave a pub. Hopleaf though does you one better. They produce REALLY good food. I think they would have been fine with your garden variety pub grub -not so, they are able somehow to make gourmet quality meals in one of the tiniest kitchens I have ever set my eyes on. My kitchen at home is significantly larger than the one at Hopleaf. Be sure to try the Mussels. If seafood is not your thing make sure you try their steak and frites. Hopleaf since it made it on the television show Check Please! has a long wait to get a meal. This has never bothered me as I live in the neighborhood and I can pass my time sampling beers. The hipster count has also upped significantly. Historically Hopleaf has had (an unfair) a reputation of having dismissive staff. I think too many people walk to the bar and are overwhelmed by the number of beers. Unfortunately too many of them subsequently misinterpret the blank stares from the staff. If you are scared ask them what beers they would drink. I quite like the service I get.
