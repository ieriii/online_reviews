I'm a New Yorker, so the few years I spent living in Chicago was like pizza purgatory. Let me be perfectly clear - what most Chicagoans refer to as pizza is actually not. It is an open faced calzone, or a pastry with marinara sauce and too much cheese. Something not pizza. So when someone first told me to try out Piece I was skeptical to say the least. I could not have been more happy at being introduced to this place. After the first time I was hooked and spent many many hours at this location drinking up the delicious beers and eating the amazing pizza. The crust is perfect - not too chewy, not too crispy. The cheese they use is great, their sauce is perfectly sweet and tart, and their toppings are all really well done. My favorite combination: goat cheese, spinach, and sausage on a red pizza. Awesome combination of salty & sweet (and healthy too, cuz of the spinach!). Of course Piece is a microbrew, so I have to mention the beers. I am generally a fan of microbrews, and Piece is no exception. They do a great job and feature very finely crafted beers. I must recommend the "Camel Toe" or the "Worryin Ale". While I initially ordered the Camel Toe just cuz I got a kick out of the name, it's really a great beer. Very hoppy and it get's an almost tart-fruity flavor to it. In any case, I'm back in New York never at a loss for some good pizza, but I have to say, I really miss Piece. Haven't found a comparably good pizza joint here yet, sad to say.
