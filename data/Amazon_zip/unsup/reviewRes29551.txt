My friend who knows a thing or two about good restaurants wanted to go here. I was hesitant. Chicago, Mexican restaurant didn't go together well for me. And the lord knows I have been searching for a good Mexican place because Jersey has none. So we arrived around 7, place was packed. It's Wed, how so? Well because it's well known and Rick Bayless runs the place. Wait time for 2, 1.5 hours...crazy! So we searched the bar...packed...then out of nowhere (like the parting of the red sea) there was an opening...2 people putting on their jackets...I nearly tackled them and grabbed the seats (in a nice way)...yeah I was hungry! And it was a great spot so people weren't all over us trying to order drinks, we had room to spare. We looked over the menu and although the prices seemed high, the food that surrounded us (other people's plates) looked yummy. We started with the Guac. It was good but not like my ex used to make.. For a meal I had the tacos al carbon (beef)...soooo good...juicy strips of steak marinated and flavorful. The homemade tortilla's were great and it came with roasted pepper rajas, two salsas, frijoles charros and guacamole. My buddy had the same but with chicken...I know it's lame and we should have gone with a specialty dish. We were not disappointed. The portion size to the price was a bit much (pricey but worth it). Especially since it was a business dinner. :-) We didn't try any of their margarita's or fancy drinks. The bartender was busy and not very talkative but was still friendly. The food came out quick. I mean we were there for about 35 mins total...I guess a combo of quick food and quick eats. ENJOY!
