Although the name is better known for the literary reference to T.S. Eliot's text from The Fire Sermon, I think Bernard DeVoto's ode to the martini better encompasses what the Violet Hour is all about.  There is a point where the marriage of gin and vermouth is consummated. It varies a little with the constituents, but for a gin of 95 proof and a harmonious vermouth it may be generalized as about 3.7 to one. And that is not only the proper proportion but the critical one; if you use less gin it is a marriage in name only and the name is not martini. You get a drinkable and even pleasurable result, but not art's sunburst of imagined delight becoming real. Happily, the upper limit is not so fixed; you may make it four to one or a little more than that, which is a comfort if you cannot do fractions in your head and an assurance when you must use an unfamiliar gin. But not much more. This is the violet hour, the hour of hush and wonder, when the affections glow again and valor is reborn, when the shadows deepen magically along the edge of the forest and we believe that, if we watch carefully, at any moment we may see the unicorn. But it would not be a martini if we should see him. I tried the Part & Parcel, Cereja Rosa, Pimm's, and Sunburned Dane. I thought the drinks would be stiffer, but they were all well balanced and smooth. The smell of tequila gives me the shivers and flashbacks, but the Sundburned Dane was excellent. If they can make cocktails this great, I may entrust Violet Hour to shift my the taste from light to dark liquor.  As far as atmosphere goes, I felt almost like I was in a colonial Plantation house with the white moldings, fireplace, and bluesy music in the background. I have been to enough rockin' sports bars, untz untz dance clubs, and lounges that play downtempo. Violet Hour is definitely the type of exp I crave. I also added a youtube link for you to get a sense of their dedication to making cocktails. http://www.youtube.com/w
