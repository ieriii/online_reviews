I've passed this place a few times and never thought much of it, until after passing it by and noticing a packed patio. So I checked it out the other day and was happily surprised. I got the Cubano and was sent instantly to my happy place. I was even treated to free shot of Cafe Cubano (a sort of Cuban espresso). I will defiantly be back for more.
