I went to Brazzaz last night with my girlfriend. I received a $50 gift certificate for my 30th birthday just over a year and a half ago. We also had a coupon for buy one meal, get one meal free. I don't think it could be less of a dent in the pocket book, all things considered.  I have only been to one other Brazilian steak house. It was in 1999 in Queens- New York, I don't really remember my experience very well there. I would say overall my experience was mixed. The salad bar items were pretty good, although I just had about half a plate because I was there for the meat. The service varied, it was either I was being bombarded with meat, or would spend a couple of minutes looking around. My favorites were the bottom sirloin, the top sirloin, and the special- rump roast. the pork was pretty good, Im not a huge fan of pork in general though. I would recommend staying away from the richer items like the parmesean crusted pork tenderloin. It was pretty good, but the richness seems to fill you up. I would also recommend staying away from the bacon wrapped filet. Honestly, the more inexpensive cuts worked better for me, the bacon flavors the meet well, but you pretty much have to peel it from the filet.  Brazzaz was good, if I did not have a coupon for a free meal and a gift certificate for $50 I would have felt ripped off though. For that money I could go to a top rate american steak house and walk out just as full.  I would call Brazzaz an interesting novelty, but not fine dining. Those prices are borderline fine dining. I would definetly consider going for lunch at $19.99 and a couple of beers, but I could not justify the price for dinner unless I had a corperate expense account, which I would guess supports this place.
