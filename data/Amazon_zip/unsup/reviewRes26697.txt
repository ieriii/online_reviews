Caramelized Crust. Deep Dish. Sausage. 5 - stars for their 'za, definitely. Certainly one the top three here in the ole Chi-town. I just wish that they had a few other things on the menu filled with equal portions awesome. Their pizza gives you the HOOOH YEAH! While everything else there is kinda ho hum. Regardless, they're a great place for a pitcher, pizza, and watching a ball game on one of their epic TVs.
