in some ways, this place is tainted for me - i'll always remember going on a date here with my X-whatever-he-was, ordering grilled octopus, loving the bread and greek olive oil and leaving pissed! (at him) i went back years later for lunch and loved the greek salad with chicken - but MAN did i have some killer garlic breath. we also ordered the chilled octopus in olive oil, which was pretty awesome. the service is always quick, just like most greek restaurants. this place is good for lunch and a chill dinner but for a nice night out and guaranteed great greek food...i usually head to their neighbors...pegasus
