As others have said, just not worth it. I am a fan of desert-y pancakes (don't come here if you aren't because the other selections are nothing special) and all the ones I've had here were delicious. But every brunch place in wicker park (Milk & Honey, Francesca's, Bin Cafe, Silver Cloud, Feast, Blue Line) offers some kind desert-y pancake and they're all good. So why wait around starving for an hour to go to a restaurant that is severely overcrowded not to mention so loud you have to yell over all the baby screams to hear your brunch companions. Also every time I've been here the servers have been rude about rushing to turn over the table. The food is good, but not THAT good!
