I came to Shaw's with a bit of trepidation. It was on my "has-been" list, knowing that I had visited it 20 years (?) ago as a teenager. Shaw's proved that certain restaurants can indeed stand the test of time. Given that last night was the Saturday before Valentine's Day and our party of 5 was without a reservation, we arrived around 4:30, old-timer's style, and were seated in the oyster bar. My only complaint was that the seats were very slippery, and all of us felt like we were on the brink of falling out of our seats all night long. The atmosphere itself was lively without being too loud for easy conversation. For an appetizer, a few of us shared the shrimp ceviche. If you don't like cilantro, this isn't the dish for you as it does somewhat over-power the dish. It could be a bit spicier, at least for my tastes. The king crab entree, however, was delicious! The legs were packed with sweet meat, and they were cracked sufficiently enough that I didn't have to spend much time getting to my meal. I challenge you to find better crab in Chicago (other than at CostCo)... Shaw's is pricey, making it the perfect use of my parent's Lettuce Entertain You gift certificates. Chicago somewhat lacks on seafood choices, but I'd now add Shaw's to the limited list of acceptable seafood restaurants in the city!
