NO other sushi place compares!!! Friends have tried to take me to other places saying that it is better than Coast, and it was equal at best, but at Twice the Price!! Start with the Exotic Tempura, which comes with and amazing dipping sauce "not soy sauce" (I always ask for extra sauce for my rolls) and then get anything on the menu, I have never been disappointed! Its BYOB is which is great. Waiters/Waitresses are always courteous and helpful. the seats are a little too close together for my liking, but if you go not during prime time, you can avoid the crowd. A small price to pay for amazing sushi!
