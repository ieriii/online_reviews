If this huge restaurant is packed on a Tuesday night, half an hour before closing, you know it's good!!! I've been to Sun-Wah numerous times since discovering their glorious Peking Duck a couple of years ago. It's what everyone comes here for. You see it on every table and the poor duck carvers just can't keep up with the demand. Juicy slices of duck tucked into fluffy bread pillows. Add some pickled radish, carrots, green onions, drizzle some sauce over it and you've created a bomb ass duck sandwich. What about that duck carcass? You just can't be wasteful and throw it away...there's still succulent pieces of duck in it! Moments later, a bowl of duck soup and duck fried rice accompany your already delicious meal....genius!  I love taking people here....everyone's just like "Wow." You too will be wowed, even if you don't like duck, like my husband.  But I suppose the bread and other fixings help in masking the strong flavor of the duck.  So duck lovers and haters can unite! Some honorable mentions: honey walnut shrimp is amazing, the salt and pepper smelt would satisfy your salt cravings, and the beef chow mein is delicious and plentiful!
