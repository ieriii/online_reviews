I have heard friends rave about this place, so we finally decided to check it out this past weekend...and....don't tell anyone....ssshhhhhhhh Ok, I will reveal a little secret - birchwood kitchen is soooooo much better. But, its a secret, so don't tell anyone...I don't want to wait for my table there :) We had the biscuit special and the lox and bagel, which were both good (especially the perfect bagel), but not great. We will have to give this place 1 more chance and try the huevos rancheros very soon, but....shhhhhhh....birchwood kitchen has so many more creative and yummy options. Very similar concept, cheaper and less crowded with a beautiful back patio, not sitting on a major street... You didn't hear it from me....
