i've always been a big fan of wishbone. long before the convenient large lakeview brance had opened. mostly i think "breakfast" and love the red eggs, the crawfish cakes, the biscuits & gravy, the breakfast spinach salad. i always refer to it as "the naughty place" cause it is, calorie-wise. you just want to eat the whole menu when you go in there. but end up with the same thing over & over cause they do it SO well (crawfish cakes are really good).  today i went cause i was in the hood ironically purchasing a meditation cushion at the temple, hit paulina market (good god) and having lunch at wishbone. today both of us ordered the plate specials. he had home made meatloaf smothered in gravy, mash sweet potatoes, cheese grits, a corn muffin & slaw for around 8 bucks. i had the chicken breast stuffed with ricotta & spinach smothered in gravy, mashed potatoes and gravy, sauteed spinach, corn muffin & slaw. also under 10 bucks. it's sub zero weather today, i had to take a bus & walk to my destination. and this was as good as it gets in the way of real american comfort food. don't be like me. try something else sometimes. and seriously-nothing beats the bizarre artwork both outside of the building and inside.
