My husband and I went during the middle of the week. The meal started with cornbread and honey butter. It was seriously missing salt. And the corn bread wasn't anything special. I ordered the "chicken and dumplings" ($21) The chicken was almost perfectly cooked, I say almost because it was slightly dry, but it was still very tasty. It was served atop some undercooked lima beans, some perfectly cooked carrots and shitake mushrooms. The dumplings, however, were horrible! Both tasted burned and were gummy and flavorless. Yuck! I was very lucky that my husband let me have one of his cheddar biscuits, which though good, also needed salt and wasn't competely cooked through. My husband ordered the pork shoulder ($16), which came on a cute plate with cole slaw, two HUGE cheddar biscuits, and fried okra. The fried okra was perfectly done. And he said the pork tasted 'North Carolina style' and really liked it. Though we liked our meal, we couldn't say we loved it. And in Chicago, that means we won't be back again when there are so many other places where we could spend this money (Sepia).  I was excited to see the dessert menu, expecting there to be something with peaches. Nope. Not even an apple dessert. I understand these fruits may be out of season, but still.... peach ice cream? Something! So we didn't have any dessert. Overall, it was just OK. Won't be back.
