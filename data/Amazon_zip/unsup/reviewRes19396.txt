Have you guys heard of this Rick Bayless guy? He's OK. Apparently in between tweets, he makes some Mexican food. But not like "oh I'd like a gordita with extra supreme", but like real Mexican Indian Frida Kahlo shit. I tried some red chili shortrib soup (which was intense, like maybe a little too overwhelming), the suckling pig torta (it was extra suckling), some guac + chips (limey!) and one of the hot chocolates (you should share this with someone. too much decadence for one soul.) There was like a 25 min wait at 9pm on a Tuesday night. However, we got through a lot faster 'cause there was only two of us. All in all? It's worth a try.
