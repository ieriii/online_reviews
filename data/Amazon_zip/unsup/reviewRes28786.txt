Yum Yum Yum. This is what I call "melt in your mouth" pasta... and that's a good thing. Although its easy enough to cook pasta at home and have it be tasty, the Pasta Bowl offers delicious, fresh ingredients, and stuff that I know I don't have laying around my apartment, like really high quality fresh cheeses. The prices are more than reasonable and it's in a great location. I say SU-PERB
