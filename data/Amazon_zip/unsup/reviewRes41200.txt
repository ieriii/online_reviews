there is no doubt why everyone loves this place. this dining experience is without a doubt the most unique culinary adventure i've been on so far in my life. Everyone raves about the food, so to keep this post short I'll list my 3 favorite things 1. camp fire in a box spare ribs: if a food could capture a childhood memory, this was it 2. wagyu beef: i'm not sure I can ever go back to regular beef after this 3. scallop s'mores: the oddest food i've ever had, but still very enjoyable. scallop that actually kind of tasted like a marshmallow...with chocolate and graham crackers 2 bottles of red and a bottle of champagne later...I only wish I had a sugar daddy who could bring me here whenever my heart desired.
