What can I say? Ruth Chris is absolutely amazing. Down to the name-recognition when you sit down to the consistent service, this is the place to go when you really feel like indulging. I highly recommend the martinis---haven't had a bad one yet! My favorite is the pomegranate---delicious. The steaks are amazing--cut well, seasoned perfectly and served to you on a sizzling plate with the infamous butter drizzled over the steak. RC is definitely a place to go for a special occasion or just if you want to treat yourself....either way you can't go wrong with a martini, filet and great company at Ruth's Chris Steak House.
