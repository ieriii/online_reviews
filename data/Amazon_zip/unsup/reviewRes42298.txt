I like this place. Arrived at 10:45 on a Friday with the wife. I had 10:30 reservations but the show I was coming from ran longer than expected. Called to alert the hostess I was running a bit behind and she was very accommodating. Was seated immediately upon arrival. The place was nicely crowded but there was still a few available tables. Great atmoshpere with dim lighting yet enough light to what you're eating. 1st floor is a nice mix of bar and restaurant. I didnt know about the lower level lounge until i went to the restroom and spotted it but i only did a walk by inspection. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. Food was reallly good. The basalmic and garlic toast appetizer was great...maybe the best "bread" I've ever had. Not very many entree choices for the non pork/beef eating crowd, and only 1 choice for the chicken eating crowd (me). I ordered the 1 chicken entree they had, the gunthrop (sp) chicken. This over sized breast was well season and extremely moist. I was very pleased with this dish and happy to be taking home half my chicken after getting full. We had mashed potatoes with chicken jus and corn with jalepeno sides. Both really good. Thumbs up on Gilt Bar...I intend to go back.
