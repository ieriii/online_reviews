WOWEEEE WOW WOW WOW!! I don't know where to begin! I was a little skeptical when my boyfriend told me he wanted to take me here from dinner during one of our vacations and boy was I wrong (and I don't admit to that very much!)  When we got there, we were definitely NOT prepared for how small this restaurant is and we were told that there would be an hour-hour and a half wait for a table and there was no available seating at the bar but we were more than welcome to wait for something to open up. My feet (in brand new heels, mind you) were not happy at the sound of that, but we put our names on the list and first look at the extensive beer and wine list eased my pain. The bartenders were VERY attentive and for as crowded as the place was we were able to order and receive our drinks in a matter of minutes.  We waited just a mere 20 minutes before the bartender who was serving us flagged us over to two seats that had just become available at the bar. Talk about service, right?! We ordered four of the small plates and they were AMAZING! If you go, please - you owe it to yourself! - try the deviled egg, fried pig ears, and the pig tail. All three are a life changing experience for your taste buds!  I could go on for DAYS about how great this restaurant is, but I'll save you the rambling and time and just tell you that this is by far one of my favorite restaurants, if not my absolute fave. The service is GREAT, everyone is so friendly, and the vibe is energetic and contagious! Check it out - you won't be disappointed!
