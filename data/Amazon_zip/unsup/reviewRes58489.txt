By far my favorite restaurant in Greektown, Artopolis makes the best soup I've ever tasted. Notice I didn't say soups - only order the good soup, lemon chicken - if you refer to the lemon chicken soup simply as the good soup they will know what you mean. The alternative is usually dreadful. If you find yourself trying to decide between the Artopita or pizza, always go Artopita.
