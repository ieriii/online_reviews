very casual, quicky style place for a quick bite or sit down. yummy cubano torta. light crispy bread, thin tender slices pork, smooth bean smeared inside, cheese, crema smothered and married well together. salsa was delicious with a hint of spiciness. def needa try the churros and hot choc next time!
