BAD CRAPPLE!! FALSE ADVERTISING - BAD BUSINESSI would strongly suggest not attending nor supporting this bar! They false advertised their prices on their website, and when this was brought up in a polite manner, the owner Craig was unreasonable and extremely rude! Upon realizing their falsely advertised prices, I very cordially informed him of the fact that pricing at the bar was significantly higher (over 20% more) than clearly stated on THEIR OWN website (which I verified at home later that night that I didn't miss something and i was at fault) - his reponse was to lecture me on his woes of paying his staff. keeping his bar open, and that he was not a webmaster and therefore not responsible for what was on THEIR OWN website and they would not honor what was advertisied. Too much info!! The staff was lacksadaisical, non-caring, and argumentative - they did not seem happy to be there at all. I was really looking forward to having a good meal and time here but after being offended by the owner, not served by their staff with any care, and deceived on their prices, myself and my friends will never attend this bar!   BEWARE!!! BEWARE!!!
