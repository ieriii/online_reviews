Ah, Sprout. I was so looking forward to dining at this restaurant, and I have to admit I was disappointed. The menu is prix fixe and requires interpretation. For example, one of the first course was listed as "licorice: pear - goat cheese - macadamia." I hate it when restaurants do that - it's not playful, it's not innovative, it's not even helpful. Our waiter was unable to provide much detail, so our dinner selections were mostly guesses. We forged ahead with the food and wine pairing, and I took the waiter's suggestion to kick off the meal with what was probably the largest glass of cider I've ever encountered (this will be important later). The food was okay - I found a lot of the dishes people raved about here to be somewhat hit or miss. The big disappointment was the dish labeled "corn" on the menu, a dessert akin to bread pudding that jumps on the popcorn trend as well. Spoiler alert: your meal will come with grilled cheese. It will be called a "surprise course," but by now, no one is surprised. It's a petite but average grilled cheese sandwich so I don't get the hype. This intermezzo was served with yet another glass of cider, which made me wonder why the waiter steered me toward cider as a pre-dinner cocktail in the first place. Something about me must scream "cider!" The service was not what I expected at all. Chef Dale Levitski breezed past our table, ignoring my boyfriend's nod - not once but twice - to speak with some obviously more important customers in the restaurant. That, coupled with our waiter's complete inability to notice we had moved on to the next course and would like wine pairing that accompanied it, sealed the deal for me. When you're paying well over $200 for dinner, you better love the food and receive what you ask for, when you ask for it.
