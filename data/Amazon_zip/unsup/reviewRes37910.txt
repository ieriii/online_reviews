Cool and cozy, but always busy so you might have to wait for seats. but this is the only bar that I found that sells Goose Island "Green Line" cheaper then Goose Island! I don't get it but don't really care because it's an awesome beer! Also Excellent selections on tap.... I haven't eaten there yet (just beers) but everything look pretty good, mussel & frites looks like their best seller.
