I can't find lasagna any better than this...and trust me, I have tried. This no frills itallien trattoria serves some of the best itallien food in town. The homemade pastas including the lobster filled ravioli in red cream sauce and the amazing risottos are worth the visit. The bread pudding is amazing...and I dont even like bread pudding. The chocolate cake with raspberry sauce is a good way to go too. The atmosphere is cute and simple. The prices are at the breaking point between reasonable and too high. For two with two drinks each, one appetizer, two entrees and a dessert and tip, you are looking at $90-$100.
