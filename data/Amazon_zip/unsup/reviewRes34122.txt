Read lots of great reviews on yelp before making my way over. Most of the reviews said long wait, great food. I agree. The first day we went there we only waited about 30 min. I think that's because we got there so early. the second day we called in to find out how long the wait was and it was an hour and 30 min. The menu was full of lots of choices. the place was consistently packed. more of a loud environment but all in all i strongly recommend as my food was great. strawberry orange juice was amazing too.
