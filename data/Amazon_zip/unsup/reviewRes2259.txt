Doug is my dude. He's everybody's dude, apparently. Super nice guy, and he talks with everyone. The line is around the block at his place, and I'm super happy for him because I love anybody with that much positive energy. Had a Chicago dog with a big pickle, a braut, and the Foie Gras dog. Couldn't finish the Foie Gras dog- toodecadent for me- but amazing. On Friday and Saturday he cooks the fries in duck fat, which sounds amazing. Couldn't really tell the difference between them and regular fries- it's not like they taste extra ducky... but they were awesome. thanks Doug! PS I love hot dog store names: Wiener and Still Champion, The Wieners Circle, Super Duper Weeny (in CT)... the list goes on...
