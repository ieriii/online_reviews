If you like barbque you must try q. Had the Kobe brisket and enjoyed every second of it. Although the meat was slightly dry, I greatly enjoyed the selection of sauces that come with the entrees; spicy BBQ was my fave! If you are not into bourbon try the patron margarita, it was delish. Don't be fooled by locatin and exterior of q; it's huge inside! Also reservations are strongly encourage for dinners after 7pm.
