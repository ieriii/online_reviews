Gilt bar is my favorite place to eat and drink in Chicago. It is perfect for appetizers and drinks or even a Saturday night dinner. You have to try the Steak Tartare and Bone Marrow. You have to drink a Sazerac. If you are in the mood for salad, the goat cheese and beet salad is a must. The atmophere is dark and a little mysterious with an aura that speaks sophistication. The hipster staff is everything you are looking from a hipster staff. Take your girlfriend and your friends. Make sure you make a reservation to get good seats.
