I ordered delivery and normally it would take an hour to get my food but they are quick and very accurate. I ordered a cuban sandwich and two empanadas and they were amazing. The sandwich was full of flavor with a yummy crunchy but soft bread. The empanadas were crisp and a guilty pleasure. If its your first time going i recommend the cuban sandwich and get an empanada the chorizo. You wont regret it.
