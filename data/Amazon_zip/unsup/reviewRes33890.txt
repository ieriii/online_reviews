Unlike most brunch places in the city Yolk is better for larger groups. If you come in a group of 4 you could expect to wait longer than a group of 8.  Food was decent. Get the scramblers or omelettes. You can skip on the waffles. My friend's waffle with strawberries sounded better than it looked (thawed frozen fruit). Coffee was good. Service was okay for as busy as it was but it was still a challenge to find our server most of the time.   I would go back if I was going to brunch with a large group (there is bound to be something on that menu that any person would like), but the food alone would not bring me back.  Note: They will not seat you until your entire group arrives. So, if you have one of those friends that is perpetually late you may want to tell them to come 15 mins earlier.
