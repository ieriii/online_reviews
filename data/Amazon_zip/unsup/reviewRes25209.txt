I eat out a lot and this place really needs to step up its game. I went with an old friend on a Saturday night. Fairly early, about 6pm...The atmosphere was hopping, but not over crowded. Immediately we could tell, our server was clearly too cool for school.  We explained we had not been to the space before, and he rattled off his memorized menu "explanation" so fast, we were left more confused than we started. Being adventurous, we just went with it, ordering a salad, 2 veggie dishes, and 2 "traditional" tapas.  We ordered all at once, but asked our server to please pace our dishes. Seconds later, we were staring down at our main "meal" before the complimentary breadsticks arrived!  The garlic shrimp was oily and stringy and the crab cake was so small you couldn't really share it.  Our salad came out 3rd.   Plus, the prices are just outrageous for Chicago. I understand this is South Michigan Avenue. I understand it's the Blackstone Hotel. Still, this is not worth the trip.  If you're going to spend $110 dollars for 5 plates and 2 drinks, you are better off going to any number of Chicago's fine restaurants that actually smile when you say "thank you". Our server killed it for the entire team.  The hostesses & buss people were nice.  I am not sure why everyone raves but I will not be going back.
