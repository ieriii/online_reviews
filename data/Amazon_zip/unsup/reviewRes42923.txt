In terms of FOOD, I would rate this place 4.5 stars. Everything was fantastic.  In terms of service, I would rate this place .5 stars. Our server was very short with our table, she was rude, and it took over 10 minutes to get a drink. However, the kicker came when we simply asked for a few "lemons." Our server told us that the bar was running low on lemons and that she would "see what she could do." Really? We had over a $250 tab, I think a few slices of lemon is a fair request and not one that needs to be answered with attitude.  As much as I loved the food, the service really left a bad taste in my mouth.
