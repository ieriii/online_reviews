Soooo, I saw this place from Milwaukee and almost thought that it was just a "take it to go" type place (the seating area is not visible from Milwaukee). But I walked in and was promptly attended to and taken to the seat where one of my best friends was waiting for me! I ordered the Costa Rican sandwich and she had the potato tacos. Both were delicious...and I recommend getting the Lizardo sauce on the sandwich if you are an A1 (steak sauce) fan. If not, ask for it on the side! The prices were decent and the service was excellent. Will be back for the shakes!
