We came here last night for a birthday party that was on the roof. While the party started at 8pm, we arrived fashionably late. We had to wait to go upstairs even though we were meeting people. The wait wasn't so bad. About 10-15 minutes.  The upstairs was beautiful. Plenty of seating and a great view of the buildings surrounding the place. The prices for draft beer seemed reasonable and not overpriced for a downtown location. The company was great and there was a great mix of people. We didn't eat anything here but I wouldn't be opposed to trying this place out for dinner. Based on the reviews though, I feel drinks are the only way to go. It's a great location for a party and for a night out on the town.
