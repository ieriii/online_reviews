I came back for dinner a couple of Friday's ago and was very pleased! The clientele is definitely a mixture of people, which I found interesting. Anyways, we started off with the shrimp cocktail and it was very good. The shrimp were HUGE and very fresh/tasty. The dipping sauces were excellent as well. We then had the steak tartare with poached egg on top and it was my favorite of the night! The toast it was served with were crunchy and yummy and the egg with the steak was a great combo! We then shared a pasta and it was very fresh and the sauce was super tasty. The cocktail list here is awesome as well. My friend got the Ginger beer drink and he loved it! The ice is that old school 70's ice, which we both loved! I would definitely come back for dinner/drinks again! The atmosphere is super trendy.
