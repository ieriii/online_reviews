My favorite things about the Publican were the pork rinds and the house beer, which resembled a Flemish Sour Ale. Both were amazing! After eating dinner there, my husband and I came back a few weeks later for happy hour and stood at one of the pub height tables and order both those items again. We also got some charcuterie which was good but does not stand out in my mind as being one of the best charcuterie platters I've had, and we also tried a salad with pig ears which really hit the spot. I have to say though, I am not a fan of the community seating. I know it seems to be on trend these days, but who really wants to sit so close to a stranger when you are having a nice meal?
