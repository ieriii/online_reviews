I was saving my 20th review for an awesome place! And this is it! Simply it has it all! Hands down the best Vietnamese cuisine in town! The food was absolutely outstanding and it is BYOB so you bring whatever you want to drink and pay nothing for it! The service is really good. Nice and friendly. The decoration is really nice and it's budget friendly! A must place to visit!
