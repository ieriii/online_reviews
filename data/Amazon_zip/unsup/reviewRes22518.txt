While growing up in Chicago I missed the experience of Greektown. I've since moved away and have gained a fondess for greek cuisine. On a recent visit back home, I made Greektown a priority, all research pointed to Greek Islands being the favorite. Our party of 7 had lunch on Sunday. Service was a bit hurried, but friendly. We ordered a variety of dishes. A few were hits and others were misses. Fried Eggplant - yum! BBQ Lamb - yum! Shish ka bob - tasty! Gyros tasted very gamey. Pastichio was greasy. Spinach & Feta pie was bitter, almost sour. Saganaki, usually a crowd pleaser was hardly touched because it tasted purely like alcohol not a note of the actual cheese was tasted. The free valet parking was nice. Even so there wasn't enough good about the restaurant to warrant a return visit. I'll stick to mom & pop eateries in the 'burbs, and Fat Greek in Las Vegas to satisfy my Greek food cravings.
