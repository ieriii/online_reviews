Hotel is well priced and has a good location if you're wanting to frequent the Magnificent Mile. Its a small hotel, so the amenities are limited. The beds were very comfortable and the a/c worked great. The rooms are a little cramped. Staff was friendly and were there to assist. All in all, the Whitehall is a solid choice for your stay if you are just wanting place to get a good night sleep for a decent price.
