My boyfriend and I had been dying to try Sunda for several months because we always hear amazing things about it, so we thought there was no way it could live up to the extremely high expectations that everyone set. But it did! It exceeded them, in fact. We went for his mother's birthday, and there were five of us. We ordered about 12 dishes altogether, including dessert, along with two bottles of wine. The highlights from the menu were the beef lollipops, the brussels sprout salad (which even non-brussels sprouts eaters loved), the chilean sea bass, and the "ridiculous" dessert. Everything was to die for, and every member of our party was very satisfied. The one down side, as other reviewers have mentioned, is the noise level. We were sitting in a corner at the back of the restaurant, and it was still too loud for normal conversation, especially with parents. I'd recommend patronizing this restaurant with your friends, not your parents.
