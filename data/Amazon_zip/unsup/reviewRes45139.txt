I didn't actually intend on dining here. Rather, this was second choice as when we tried to go to Spacca Napoli it was closed for Summer Holiday! I had heard solid anecdotal reviews of Anteprima, but considering the messenger(s), I filed it away as 'accurate but not entirely credible'. On the evening of Sept 3rd, the opportunity presented itself so away we went. Without a reservation on a Thursday night- around 830- we were able to be seated immediately. They didn't give us any lip about not having a reservation either. Note: I am not anti-reservation, rather quite the opposite, but sometimes spontaneity rules! My dear friend was moving away, and we wanted to have a nice little super in honour of the occasion. So we started off sampling an array of apps- zucchini, boar sausage, scallops etc- all were tasty and well prepared. The Italian red we picked stood up well to the varied flavours too. We shared a lobster ravioli and finished with a desert wine. I am hard pressed to find fault with this spot. The menu is well conceived and authentic. Should you find yourself in A'ville and desirous for a 'regional' theme I'd recommend Anteprima. Personally I'd return just for the boar sausage, but note a spot like this is ideally suited for sampling/sharing.
