This is one of my favorite restaurants and definitely my favorite tapas place! I've been there four or five times and have yet to find better tapas. This place is beautiful too! I especially love the patatas bravas, bacon wrapped dates, and the sauces that come with the cheese sampler. My boyfriend was more adventurous and ordered something with rabbit and a quail dish. I had never had either but they were really good! The sangria flight was also a hit. The prices are a bit steep so it's more for special occasions but I choose it for every birthday or anniversary dinner. When I make online reservations and mention that we're celebrating a birthday or anniversary, I've always gotten a free dessert. Service is always amazing too. Love, Love, love, this place!
