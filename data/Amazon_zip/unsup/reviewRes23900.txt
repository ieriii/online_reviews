This place is disgusting and I do NOT understand the high reviews. My husband got a combination plate of rice, steak, etc. The rice was undercooked, the steak was tough, chewy, and rubbery. I got the pepito chicken sandwich. The chicken, again tough rubbery. The bread was not even toasted, it was stale. The sandwich said it came with sauteed onions, it did not. I asked for Avacado on it, it did not come with it despite me asking waitress for it several times. I am not a picky eater, I was starving but so disgusted by the food I left almost my entire sandwich. We had 5 different empanadas. Not only did these taste like they were fried in OLD oil, the dough was not fresh, its typical commercial dough. I could have made better at home.
