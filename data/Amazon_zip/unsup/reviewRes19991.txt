Let me start by saying the churros were awesome and even though I didn't have any of the delicious beverages they looked stellar. Other than that I have to say I was a bit disappointed. My food (the Jamon Torta, which is basically a sandwich) was tasty but I thought it was pretty overpriced for a sandwich with zero sides. I was, thankfully, just picking up an order to go so I waited 10 minutes or so (seemed very reasonable to me) but for those poor folks who wanted to eat in the restaurant seemed to be waiting forever for their food. You can't blame the restaurant for its popularity, so I am using this venue as a means of warning - don't come starving you will have to wait! All in all, this hasn't deterred me from visiting any more of Rick Bayless' spots but I wish the food was a couple dollars cheaper.
