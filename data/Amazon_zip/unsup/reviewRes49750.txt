I haven't been to LT since about 2003 and have been craving it for about a year now. My husband and I went there to celebrate our six month wedding anniversary on Friday and were a little disappointed. I definitely miss the atmosphere of the old place. It looks like a Pepes now. My matrimonio didn't disappoint, but my husband was very overwhelmed by his meal. I was hoping that friends' reviews of this place were wrong, but things do seem to have gone downhill since the big move. The people are still very nice. And the mojito wasn't too bad either.
