I love food and usually review all the restaurants that I have eaten with in the last 10 years or so in Chicago and I have NEVER given a pizza place 5 stars. This pizza is the most flavorful amazing za I have ever had. They use strong, FLAVORFUL cheeses, top notch italian meats and such fresh yummy arugula you won't believe your mouth. I just can't say enough how good this place is. The wood fired ovens give the neopolitan style pizza an awesome smoky flavor. I am seriously addicted to this place. And it's no problem for me to take my 2 year old with me. So a big thanks goes out to the owners for finally surprising me with a pizza! -oh there can be a wait so don't go to starving.
