If youre going to dine in, expect a 30-45 minute wait. However, once you get the food, its all great. Most of the things tasted pretty similar to me, my favorite is the milanesa. one thing to make sure you get is the CHURROS!. they are amazing. Im from texas, and these are the best churros ive had hands down. Also, i rarely buy drinks when i go out to eat because i think it runs up the bill, but xoco's agua del dia (changes daily) is usually always worth it.
