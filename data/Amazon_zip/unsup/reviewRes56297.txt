Service was impeccable. Staff are very helpful and the owner works hard to ensure a good dining experience. Baby friendly restaurant that gave complimentary watermelon smoothies to the kids. We tried to replicate the smoothies at home but it was too watery. I have to learn the recipe. Pho was very delicious and the beef was tender. Too bad it's too far from my home but will eat here whenever we come to the zoo.
