I sincerely enjoyed my trip to Nana this weekend. I was able to get in and get a table for two right away. The menu was fantastic, it was just tough to figure out what exactly to order! I loved the pictures on the wall as well as the bright atmosphere of the place. The main dining room is kind of cramped, though. The back room seemed like the forgotten area of the restaurant. Once our food got dropped down (which was hot, yummy, and filling), we didn't see our waiter until he came to grab the check. I want to come back for lunch, and I love that there's now an organic spot right in my backyard.
