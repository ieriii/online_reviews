What a great breakfast place!! Found Meli's by searching for breakfast placed by the W hotel on Adams and decided to hike here after reading the reviews. It's only about a 15 minute walk, which is not bad, weather permitting of course,. I ordered the Chevre omelet sans pork which was absolutely fantastic!! Sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese make a match made in heaven. The island breeze smoothie was also great. The one thing to note is that it's pretty crammed and the wait at 10:30am was already 20 min. But It was definitely worth the wait.
