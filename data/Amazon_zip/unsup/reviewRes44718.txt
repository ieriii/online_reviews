Giordano's produces some seriously good pie. Double crust, TONS of cheese (seriously, if you're allergic to cheese, don't bother walking through the door), and some sauce on top. Freaking YUM. I loved the crust, but husband didn't like the whole double crust concept (he also liked the thin crust we had the next night better than this stuffed pizza, just sayin'). We kept it pretty simple with just pepperoni, and I think the pie could have benefited from a few more peps. We also had a side salad to try and balance out the artery-blocking going on. Restaurants, take note: CHILL YOUR PLATES. The plates were super warm and I hate nothing more than warm salad. Ugh. It wasn't terrible, but the salad could use some work for sure.
