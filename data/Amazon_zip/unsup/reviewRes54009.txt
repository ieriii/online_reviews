Absolutely Loved it. Very different experience from anything else I've been to in Chicago. The food is fantastic and the drinks are very well thought out. We actually left our table in order to go see our drinks be made. I would say that is a must. The mix-ologist/ bar-tenders know exactly what they are doing and they put great detail into every drink. It's almost like you are on vacation and you are getting special treatment because you are a special guest. My eyes took a little time getting use to the light because it is all candle lit. The candle light just helps make Violet hour more unique and brilliant. I love telling people about my experience there and that's the type of place you want to visit. I've never been more impressed as I was at Violet hour. I love trying new things and I appreciate places that are different from the norm.
