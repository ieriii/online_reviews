magnifico!!!! what a joint this place is its perfect! awsome atmosphere inside recomended for a first date kinda place and its cheap! and they stuff your face in there with 4 course meals i so wanted to give this place 5 stars but i cant give a place 5 stars if i can make better marinira sauce then they can but awsome service just all around a fun and enjoyable place to eat
