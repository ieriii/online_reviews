On a recent trip to Chicago, this was my home for 3 nights. I love the location of the hotel, it is in very close proximity to all the major attractions in Downtown Chicago such as Navy Pier, shopping, etc. When you drive up to this hotel and even when you walk in the lobby, you get the feeling that this is going to be a fantastic hotel with the grand entrance and the beautiful lobby. However, in terms of the rooms itself, I was kinda dissapointed especially because it is a Sheraton Hotel. We got what I believe is a standard room on the 18th floor and even walking through the hallway to get to the room, all the doors look dated and worn down. When we arrived at our room, my travel companion commented on how the lock looked as if someone broke it to it before. The room itself was also looked pretty dated with some heavy wooden closet doors, older looking bathroom and dated decor. The chair I'm sitting on even creaks like crazy every time I move. Though I have to say the most annoying part is the heavy doors to the rooms that slam shut everytime someone walks in and out of their room on the floor, so loud that I'm woke up every time...boo! But the bed itself are ok, pretty comfy. In terms of the other facilities offered by the hotel, the fitness center is equipped with some very nice treadmills (with the tv built in) and a full set of weights available for arm workouts. The pool itself, although indoor and relatively small is a nice place to relax after a hard workout as well. Since both are located on the 7th floor, you get a beautiful view of the Lake when you sit on one of the chairs around the pool. Another nice feature is the sundeck where a few sun chairs are set up and where you can soak up some sun. Unfortunately the sauna was broken or else I'd love to have used that as well. Overall, it's a great hotel in a prime location and awesome facilities. Would stay here again next time I'm in Chicago.
