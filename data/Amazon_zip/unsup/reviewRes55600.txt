I have been eating at Cafe 28 for the last 10 years and can honestly sayI have not had a bad meal here in all that time. I love their coffee at brunch with the breakfast burrito as well as the green tamales and eggs. The Cuban Chicken, Chevice, Coconut Shrimp, and Papa Rellenas are just a few of my favorites. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. I have noticed that much of the servers and bartenders have been there as long as I have been coming in. That is always a good sign as well as being greeted by the owners on occasion. Looking forward to spending some time on the patio before the weather changes. Keep up the good work...
