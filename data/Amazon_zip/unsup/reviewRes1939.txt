If there were 6 stars, I would have given it to this place. It was amazing. I waited over an hour to get to the register, but as soon as I finally had the opportunity to place my order - Doug greeted me as if I was the only person in the place. He asked me how I was, I didn't feel rushed, and he actually guaranteed me a seat despite the fact that they were (obviously) incredibly busy. Sure enough, I got my Cherry Coke and when I turned around, the staff was cleaning off a table for me and my friends. Amazing. I ordered a regular hot dog with everything plus sauerkraut, a Smoked Shrimp and Bleu Cheese dog with Remoulade Sauce, duck fat fries, and a small Cherry Coke - $14.50....and worth. every. cent. Everything was completely delicious. The dogs were flavorful and grilled to perfection. The entire staff was so friendly and relaxed, the place was clean and bright, and 80s music played in the background. It was the perfect way to spend an afternoon.
