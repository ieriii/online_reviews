I went to Chicago on vacation and tried this restaurant while waiting in line for pizza at Lou Malnatis. Food was awesome! Ingredients used were good quality and fresh. I believe we tried the beef tongue torta and it was excellent, not chewy like some places. Very flavorful. The only complaints were that the lines were long and slow. The host there was awesome. But the cashiers were rude. Initially they didn't even want to take our order cause there wasn't a table available for our group of seven after we've been standing in line for 40 minutes. Wasn't even apologetic for it, could have told us that while we were waiting in line for that 40 minutes.  We ordered to go anyway and found our own seats outside. Food good, cashiers could be nicer. Host awesome.
