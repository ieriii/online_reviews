You ever walk past a restaurant and say, "damnit, I really want to try it, can't wait to find friends and eat here". And it takes two years for you to find those friends and the opportunity to eat it? Usually you're sort of dissapointed. Well, Wishbone didn't disappoint. From the awesome interior, to the incredible sides (us four got 8 different sides in total!) to the ridiculous prices for the serving sides, to the beer selection--- what a great place. Try the specials.
