Big Jones, your name is well-deserved. The best thing about this place is the unique menu and ambiance - I have not found another place like this in Chicago. Okay, okay, I have never been to New Orleans so I can't give the genuine seal of approval, however it's very pleasant and makes you feel like you are somewhere else. After discussion with the hostess/bartender the unique menu is ever-changing due to seasonal fresh ingredients - this is down to the complimentary tasters (equivalent to bread and butter) which could include cornbread cakes with butter or spicy oil with crackers. Check this out Chicago: Pre-fix 4-course menu Monday-Friday for $25!!!!!!!!! holy, holy. I kid you not. Who likes to eat like a queen besides me? Sign yourself up for this treat.  Other specials listed on the menu and also brunch available. As a bonus, upon my first visit, coupon for free appetizer with entree purchase for next time.  Drinks are fabulous and unique to the new orleans style - pomegranate margaritas are good.  Old fashioned cherry cola (vodka) great given I'm not even a vodka drinker. Drink prices are in medium range.  Casual seating at the bar for appetizers, drinks or seating at tables available as well.  I really hope this business makes it though "these tough economic times". Prices on main menu are a bit high, but worth it. Just go and have an appetizer and drink. Make friends.
