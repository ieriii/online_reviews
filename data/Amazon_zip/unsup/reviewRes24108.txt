I went here for the first time yesterday and had a lovely lunch. My friend and I split one savory and one sweet crepe. I really thought that everything was well prepared and looked appetizing. The sweet crepe was really really decorated, which can make me a little batty, but was extremely tasty nonetheless. My latte was great, and my friend's tea latte looked fab. The cream of mushroom soup was nothing to write home about, but it was complimentary with the savory crepe, so whatever. We paid about $30 for our meal, which was a great deal for a filling and delicious lunch.
