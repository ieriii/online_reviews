As taken from: http://stuffwhitepeoplel When Loverboy wrote the song "Everybody's working for the weekend," they meant that you work all week so that you can earn a break and go to some sweet bars or concerts and rock out as hard as possible because you have 2 days for the hangover to fix itself. Well, white people work for the weekend, except their only goal is to eat breakfast on Saturday or Sunday at one of their favorite "breakfast places." These places are restaurants that specialize in breakfast food and are usually only open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and if you arrive at any time after 9:30, prepare to wait for up to an hour with white people who cannot wait to get vegan pancakes, eggs benedict, waffles, or deluxe french toast. To a white person, there is no better way to spend a saturday morning than to get up late, around 9:30 and pile into your Audi or Volvo and drive to one of these little places and eat breakfast with friends. Often times these breakfasts last for an hour or more (hence the long lines and wait times). Some white people take it to the next level and bring their dogs, newspaper or even a laptop. If you plan on dealing with white people, it would serve you well to know some local breakfast places. This will also come in handy if you pick someone up at 80s night. In white person law, if you meet someone at 80s night and then go out for breakfast the next morning, then you are automatically in a relationship. There are no exceptions. ______________________________________________________ And now, my "Real" review...... Great food at decent prices, it's very trendy now to go to this place in trendy Wicker Park. If you go on the weekends, do yourself a favor and get there right when they open or you'll be one of the idiots standing in line forever.....I admit this place is good and all, but is it THAT good to warrant the LONG waits on weekend morrnings when other good places (like Earwax) are nearby, (I honestly think this place is just slight more about image than it is quality of food)....As the pop group Soul Asylum said in the early 90s "nothing attracts a crowd, like a crowd" and at The Bongo Room those lyrics are quite apt....try to go there for breakfast/brunch on a weekday morning whenver possible...
