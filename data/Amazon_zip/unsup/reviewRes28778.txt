The epitome of what made me fall for Thai food. Reasonable prices, great portions, great food. CHeck out my pictures. TIger Cry- i think overhyped from yelp reviews. It's just marinated steak pieces to me. But good. Crab Rangoon- extra creamy, pretty delicious (i'm somehow usually disappointed whenever someone recommends crab rangoon) But these guys deliver. Of course, bigger would be better =) Fried Shumai- perfection!! the wonton wrapper wasn't too thick so it was a great light, crispy outside with heavenly filling. Love. Love. Love. I ordered beef pad thai. Gosh we were kinda full by the time our main course arrived (of course, plates come relatively quick here. Plus for that). More on the saucy side, which i like. No so peanuty. Not orange. Just delicious saucy goodness. I definitely didn't finish. It was great fresh, but here's the downfall. It didn't hold up too well to being refridgerated and reheated. Texture became almost slimy =(. not as appetizing. But still. No major disappointments here!
