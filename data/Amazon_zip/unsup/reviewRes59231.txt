I went to Sun Wah last weekend and had a horrific time. Gawh! Everything was ok at first. The table and dinnerware looked nice. Our waiter came right away and ordered our drinks. I had a dry martini. Drinks not to bad sort of stiff. Then the waiter cam back, and kept banging his knee on the table while we were ordering. Practically shaking the table. I ordered duck soup, and the waiter gave the table a big BANG with his knee. He went back in the kitchen and brought back three duck soups. The soup was really cold and smelled like diapers.
