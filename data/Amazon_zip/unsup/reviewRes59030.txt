Sunda is the spot I ALWAYS take friends for a special occasion, the "IT" spot when I have out-of-town guests, or when I just want an AMAZING meal!The Restaurant Partner & Manager; Aeron, is always there to greet me and find out how my experience is going or/ was! He is extremely thoughtful, and ensures that every dining experience is an amazing one! The concept of this Asian Fusion Restaurant is to indulge in as many types of cuisines from Korean to Filipino, while dabbling in a variety of share plates. My suggestion would be to try at least one or two types from every category on menu; in order to obtain a true experience of these delightful dishes!The service is consistently "on-point," and I have never once been disappointed by my meal. I also love to indulge in the extensive 'Specialty Cocktail' list which is very exotic and an important "pit-stop" when dining! I personally love the Lychee Martini!I also really appreciate the atmosphere which is very rich, exotic, and sexy! The crowd that also dines at this restaurant is more discerning, and very much in the "social scene" of Chicago. Always a great experience, I suggest you check it out!
