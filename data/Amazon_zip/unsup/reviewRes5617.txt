The Purple Pig is simply exquisite! It was a challenge to get a table, but we were able to sit at the bar for lunch where they serve a full menu. The bar tender/server (Natalia) was amazing! great service with a smile. Our favorite two dishes were the scallops and chickpeas as well as the sepia. Great combination of flavors and perfect size/amount. The restaurant also has an outstanding wine list. We had the Rebeiro (hard to find in the US) and a glass of Rioja red (Seis) from a small vineyard near Elciego in Alava, Spain, which was quite delicious. When in Chicago, the Purple Pig is a must!
