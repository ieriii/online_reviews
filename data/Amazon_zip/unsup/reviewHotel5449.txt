This was the hotel where we had our wedding guests and bridal party stay and everyone absolutely loved it! The rooms are new, clean, and extremely comfortable. They have great views in any direction. If you do book a party there try to get the penthouses! They are out of this world. Imagine a multilevel suite with a gigantic bathroom on the top floor and an amazing lounge area on the first level. We stayed in the penthouse the night of the wedding and I have to say it was the best room that I have ever stayed in. The hotel staff was also top notch! I really wouldn't recommend anywhere else!
