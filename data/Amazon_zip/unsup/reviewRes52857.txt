I visited 90 Miles this morning and I was Super impressed at how many vegetarian options they have on the menu. It really made my day that I could eat a papa rellena filled with soy picadillo and a guava pastelito for desert! ... Also, if you've never had a Florida avocado, you must order their side of avocado. It's the best Avocado you'll have in Chicago. It's comforting to have 90 miles around as my husband and I are from Miami and used to amazing home cooked Cuban food. I love how they serve the typical "colada" and "cafe con leche" and they even have Iron Beer which is a staple in Miami.  I have loved 90 miles for the past 3 years I've lived in Chicago, and I have taken other Miami friends there who loved it too. I'm sure you will also!
