This is a restaurant worth waiting for. If you call, you will always find it booked. Try to go to the restaurant and put your name on the waiting list to squeeze in. Best chance would be two people as larger groups you will wait longer for a table or you will need to do a reservation far in advance . There is a bar where if you find a table or bar space you can order food there. And yes, the food is that good. Anything on the menu is great so it is really about getting in. Another tactic is to try a little later to eat. Last seating at 11:00 pm so 9:30 on may be worth a shot. You can't come to Chicago without eating here!
