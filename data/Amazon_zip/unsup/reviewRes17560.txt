I love Indian food + I love Groupon = I ate like a king for a day. I got the Groupon for India house and took a couple of friends to dinner, it was awesome. The food was great, and the portions were enough for leftovers, and that was with 4 people sharing a couple entrees and a ton of awesome varieties of naan. The service was awesome, friendly, fast, and attentive.  I want to suggest some dishes because everything we got was so good, but I can't remember the names and I'm sure no matter what you get its going to be delicious. A friend of mine and I got beers with our meals and they were not only great but were like the size of a 22( I think only that one beer was that size, but if you see it try it, you won't regret it).
