Came here with my friend one Sunday morning for breakfast. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table and I was ready to split and go to IHOP or Denny's at that point, but my friend convinced me to wait.  I'm glad that she did. The food was great. The selection was decent enough that I couldn't make up my mind about what I wanted to eat.  However, no matter what, I always get heart attack inducing pancakes with syrup and butter--and they better be good.  If you are in the area and you don't mind a wait--there probably always will be one--then I'd definitely say try this place out and you'll be happy that you did.
