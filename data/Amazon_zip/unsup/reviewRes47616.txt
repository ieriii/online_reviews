Meh. I think perhaps it's a different experience if you're here for a regular meal or if you're here with a large private group. We came to a private dinner here and it was upstairs, with a mini salad bar area set up. Not surprisingly, the more expensive charcuterie and salads weren't in our area - those were only downstairs and of course we couldn't just go down there and carry up plates ourselves. The selection upstairs was ok, but it wasn't as generous and delicious-looking as downstairs.  But you come to a place like this for the carved meats, not the salad bar. When the chefs came out for the meat carvings, they all came out at once and it was nonstop - for each of the meats, one time. Each gave out very small portions, which was fine so you could try everything. However, we expected that they'd come back a second time so you could have a little more of what you loved. That didn't happen. It was a big disappointment, as I literally had two bites of some of the meats and would've really liked more than that! I might give this place another try for the downstairs dining experience, but avoid it for a large private dining situation. A big let down.
