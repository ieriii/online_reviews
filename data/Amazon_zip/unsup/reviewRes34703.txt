Is it a restaurant or a deli? Or a high school cafeteria? I'm kind of suspicious of food sitting under heat lamps. My suspicion was justified. Falafel was OK, but the jersusalem salad on top was pretty watery (probably was sitting there for a while). Ok for a quick eat but great falafel? Come on, people. You know you CAN eat at restaurants not wholly populated by hipsters. Get your asses out of the crotch and find some real food!
