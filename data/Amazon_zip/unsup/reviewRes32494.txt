Demera isn't my favorite Ethiopian place in Chicago, but there are several things that are really positive about it. 1. The lunch option. For a very reasonable price, you can get a lunch portion (which is still way too much) of two dishes.  2. The beautiful interior and full bar. It's got a nice ambiance that's not as authentic as my favorite spot but not as institutional as the most popular Ethiopian place on the North side (not naming names on purpose, seems rude to use one place's yelp page to advertise for businesses a few blocks away.) 3. The sidewalk cafe. Even though there's the dirty Uptown obnoxiousness all around, the sidewalk at Demera really separates it from the other Ethopian places I've been to. Definitely worth checking out.
