My friends and I met here on Saturday night and I am not sure where to begin.... Overall Carnivale is colorful and festive however, service is awful!!! Ambiance and food was very good. Our server came by our table after we had waited nearly 10 minutes. We were also completely ignored at the bar - which to say the least was disappointing. We placed our drink order and again, another 10 minute wait. We ordered the fish tacos to start with then placed our entree order - Wait, um excuse me, you are out of skirt steak??? FOR REAL - So, poor service and poor inventory....Carnivale you are not making me happy!!! We ordered the NY Strip steak which was tough, under cooked and not flavorful at all. We also ordered their fish special and that was delicious!!! The sole reason for the 2 star rating was the fish special and fantastic raspberry mojito (only one ordered since the waiter stopped by and dropped off our check -no dessert no after dinner drinks....yeah, very very disappointing).
