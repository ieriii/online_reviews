The Bad Apple is something of a local bar for me. I don't drink much, but I've done a few interesting things here: 1) Had a few lambics on tap 2) shared the dark beer flight with a buddy 3) eaten the charcuterie plate All of these were positive experiences, although only the lightest of the dark beers in the flight were palatable to me, and I like stouts. Wow. But the thing that entices me back every time is their totally awesome Cobb Salad. They do it up southwestern style with some black beans and what not, very generous with the avocado. Service has always been pleasant.
