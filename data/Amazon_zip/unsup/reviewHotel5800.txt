I was once told by the talent buyer at the Logan Square Auditorium that they refer bands who don't want to sleep in their vans, but can't afford a high-end hotel room to this place. I can't believe a single one of them has ever stayed there once they got in to see the place. This is pretty much a vagrant hotel. Shared bathrooms, not so much the clean, etc. I suppose if it's below freezing out and it's between this place and a park bench, it's worth paying for the heat, but if matters are that bad, wouldn't a homeless shelter be more accomodating?
