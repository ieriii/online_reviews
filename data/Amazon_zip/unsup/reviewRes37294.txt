I'm glad to make this the 500th review for Hopleaf. I'm also happy that I can walk out my door and walk to Hopleaf in less than a couple of minutes. What I liked: Beers a plentiful and if you didn't like a beer then you didn't choose the right one. I enjoyed my cider and mead offerings and my friend was happy with his beers. Food is a bit different but it comes out great. I had the brisket while my friend had the Duck reuben. Both were really tasty and came out perfect. Apple fritters for dessert ended the meal just right. Service was excellent ... the servers were friendly and always around to check on us There wasn't much to knock at with Hopleaf. Sure it can get busy and be hard to get in but that is what happens to the consistently great places. But if you need a knock on them then I'll say it isn't cheap eats and drinks!
