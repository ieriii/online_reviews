This hotel is old and is badly in need of an upgrade. You know, like walls that aren't so thin that I can hear every word of the TV show that my neighbors are watching, with their gaggle of screaming a**hole children. I can hear everything that's dropped, every time someone flushes the toilet, and the footsteps of everyone who walks by.   I should rent a porno & blast the volume. It's not like I can get any sleep with all the noise anyway. If you want to access the interwebs, it'll be $20. That's for one day... and the internet access is spotty (the connection dropped twice in the past 3 hours). Since the charge was so steep, I figured I'd hop online to tell all 3 people who are reading this how crappy this hotel is. :-) This is a grand old hotel. I don't think I'd hate this place if I only had to grab a drink or eat a meal here. But shouldn't hotel rooms be restful? Did I mention that you shouldn't stay here if you want to get some rest?
