As you might be able to tell from my other reviews, I like sushi, and I generally give sushi restaurants 4-5 stars. Wakamono, however, is only getting 2. First off, it was cold out when we went there, and they just have a front door. There's no little area in between two sets of doors, no tent-like thing covering the door, nothing. So every time someone came or left, we froze. We would have asked to move, but unless we scored one of about 3 tables unaffected by this, moving wouldn't have helped. And I know something so silly shouldn't affect a rating, but that's how bad it was. The food was good. But that's it - just good. I generally like good sushi...but not for what Wakamono charges. Based on the abundance of sushi restaurants on Broadway, I would expect a sushi restaurant that charged significantly more than average to be not just good but really good or maybe even great. But it wasn't. It seemed like what we were paying for was the dark, sexy atmosphere...that gave me a chill every 5 minutes or so. In general, not bad, but not worth the money. I guess if you wanted to get sushi on a date and didn't want to go somewhere bright with corny music, you might pick Wakamono. But if you're interested in good sushi, save your money and go to one of the 5,435 other sushi restaurants in the neighborhood.
