I was here a while ago and decided to revisit it last night. Now I remember what I don't like about it. Going directly to the pizza here's my opinion. I ordered the margherita which is my favorite at this type of pizza place. Their pizza is super soggy. The "toppings" area is soggy with blackened bottom areas and the outer edge crust, which takes up about 1/3 of the pizza is basically inedible, charred and completely lacking in flavor or character; chewy and that's about it. I love a good edge crust so the fact that I only ate the inside and discarded the edges on the plate is sacrilege! The "basil" on this model was a token 1/2 a leaf scattered randomly, I had to ask for more basil so the waiter brought me a plate of chopped basil. The mozzarella and the tomato sauce is first-rate, as to be expected. It's probably my fault, I get the idea from other Yelp reviews that you are "supposed" to like this pizza as it is authentic, etc. I must compare this to Antica in Andersonville which is similar but MUCH better. As is the value. Theirs are a few bucks less per pie, a much more pleasant, friendly experience, great bread, olive oil on the table and it's BYOB. Easy to get two pizzas there for a $25 bill, whereas our bill at SN was $40ish (with a $7 glass of wine) with 1/3 of the pizzas not edible and overall just not good. Much better choices: Antica, Apart Pizza, Great Lakes, Pizza D.O.C. Sorry!
