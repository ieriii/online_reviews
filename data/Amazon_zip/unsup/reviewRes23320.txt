Their plantains drives me insanes! The small dining space, the owner guy that always calls you buddy or pal or chief, and the fact that they don't take reservations and only put your name put on a list drives me insanes, too. However, he and the rest of the staff are friendly and the food is superb. I've been there three times and I've just been blown away with everything I've tried. Good date place. Won't break the bank (except the guac, wtf?!). They really do need to expand, though. Small might equal quaint, but it's also really annoying if you can't make a reservation and it's winter and there's no room to stand and wait inside the very small entryway. Summer isn't so bad, as you can BYO and sit in the small parking lot till they call your name. Over-all, the food is worth the wait and you'll be full and satisfied when you leave! Next time I have to try this Oatmeal Shake that everyone keeps raving about.
