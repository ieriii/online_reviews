Hey fellow New Yorkers: It may not be Rays (both Famous and Original), but it's the closest thing you'll find to awesome NYC pizza anywhere outside of the Big Apple!I stopped in on a whim one day as I was departing the very nearby Diversey train station. After talking to the owner for a few minutes, somehow his time in Philly was mentioned... I immediately asked the question that all-too-often results in blank stares here in Chicago: "Do you have white pizza?"His answer was the best thing I'd heard all day: "Of course we do!"For those of you whom may not understand my jubilation, "white pizza" is quite common in NYC and the East Coast. It's an alternative to the all-too-familiar and frankly, rather boring, red pizza sauce. It's things like butter, oil, ricotta, etc. It is delicious.After perusing the [immense] menu, I spotted two more East Coast favorites: Bocci Balls and Garlic Knots. This was shaping up to be a great meal without the hassle of Laguardia's baggage claim!I got the Bocci Balls, Garlic Knots, and the white pizza with prosciutto and arugula, all to take away and share with my wife.The Bocci Balls: an incredible meat-stuffed pizza dough. As good as, if not better than any place in Philly.The Garlic Knots: If you live garlic, this is the apex of garlicdom. Simply amazing.The Pizza (White Pizza w/ Prosciutto and Arugula): First off, let me say how excited I was to get a pizza cut like a pizza: in pie slices. I'm sorry, Midwest, but squares? Really?Any ways, the pizza was astoundingly good. The perfect amount of cheese, toppings and sauce on a crust that, from being not too crispy without being "mall-pizza soggy," folded ever-so-perfectly, making for a near-perfect pizza experience.In summation: The pinnacle of excellent pizza... and it's in Chicago!Go here, order a white pizza (or "pizza bianca") as they call it. You'll love it.
