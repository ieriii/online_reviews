Had a service problem here. Brought it to the attention of the hostess and they were on it immediately and ultimately comped us on brunch and then some. Very impressive approach to customer satisfaction and problem solving. And, not to be overlooked, nice gastropub comfort food menu with some interesting twists. Will be happy to return.
