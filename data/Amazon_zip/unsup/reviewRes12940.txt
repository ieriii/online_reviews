You really can't go wrong with all you can eat steak, right? Well Texas de Brazil is close, but not quite there. While their salad bar is excellent and the sushi is very fresh, there is something wrong with the way they marinate their meats and their service. Nevertheless, keep in mind that this was my first time at Texas, so this may have been an anomaly. The problem was that the meats were extremely salty - almost to the point where it was difficult to eat. I've been to Fogo and have never had this type of problem. There was also a point in the night where we needed refills, but we were not able to flag anyone down, even with our coins turned over to "go." Overall, I may try Texas one more time, but Fogo is definitely the front runner.
