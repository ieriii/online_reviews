Warning: these wings are HUGE. Like actually gigantic. You know how if you go to a restaurant like bdubs and order wings, each wing is really just a wing section? Like either a drumette or one of those middle pieces with the two bone? Well one wing here is a whole wing, including the drumette, middle, and tip, so an order of 10 is really the same as ordering 20 normal wings. Also factor in that the wings are deep fried and slathered in sauce to help you decide how much you would be able to eat. Our group of three ordered 10 wings with the Seoul Sassy sauce (clever clever) and a Seoul Steak bowl, all to share. I had 2 wings and a scoop from the bowl, and I was done. The other girl also ate about as much as me. My third friend (a guy) is a beast and ate the remaining 6 wings and half the bowl, what a champ. As for the food, it was okay but not my favorite. The wings were super fried, and the sauce was way too sweet for my tastes. The bowl was okay, although I wish it came with some veggies (my friends ordered for me since I was running late, so maybe it was my fault). The sauce that you can put on top was amazing but also super rich and spicy. I think it was called Angie's something something - get this and try it with your bowl! Overall, decent food, and while it's not my favorite, this is a place that I wouldn't mind revisiting with friends.
