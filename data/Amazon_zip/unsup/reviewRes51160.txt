My new favorite local place for weekend breakfast, and after last nights dinner it's on my short list of great dining choices in Andersonville! The breakfast is always amazing, awesome strong coffee, free beignets and have not found a thing I didn't love on the menu. Last night we went for dinner, we had stuffed squash blossoms for an appetizer (yeowza) a lovely wine that our knowledgeable waiter recommended and for entree... the Catfish which was sitting on a green curry sauce with rice and greens. YUM, the BF had the Pork which was also incredible. I'm afraid to have a dessert there because i'm certain I would be addicted. The service is always friendly and skilled and the prices are very much in line with the quality of the food etc. Love this place - but if ya'll start showing up there on the weekends for brunch and I have to start waiting outside like they do at M Henry then I'll have to kill you.
