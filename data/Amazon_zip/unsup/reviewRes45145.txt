Great atmosphere, excellent service and really good, authentic food. Everything we ordered was fresh and cooked to perfection. They also offer up a great wine list. When we arrived without a reservation, the host very politely told us there was a 25-30 minute wait. He also mentioned that the bar was pretty full so suggested we head next door to Acre (previously Charlie's Ale House). Once our table was ready, the host came to escort us to our table...and to that I say, "well played, sir!" The appetizers and pasta dishes were perfectly portioned and I would recommend checking out this newer addition to the lively Andersonville restaurant scene.
