I have eaten here a handful of times, and each experience has been the same...outstanding. In store, the staff is uber-friendly and the food is prepared quickly. Maggie R. and I have ordered for delivery a number of times, and they have always been SO nice! One night during a snowstorm, we called for a couple "Not So Common Crisp" sandwiches (which are amazing, btw), and the man on the phone apologized, but didn't want his delivery man driving more than five blocks in the horrible weather. When he saw our address, he said it would definitely not be problem since we lived so close to the store. We ordered, and he said it would be about 30 minutes. Not too bad! On top of that, we called 15 minutes later to add an order of fries to our meal, and he was very accommodating, whereas I feel most people would have gotten irritated. The delivery person is also always generously sweet, and thanks us for ordering! Of course I will be back...probably a million times.
