Beautiful renovation on this historic hotel. The lobby is something akin to a W hotel decorated in white and the staff has been incredibly warm and welcoming (even when I arrived at 8am wondering if I could have an early check-in). Rooms have a nod to old-hollywood with whites and creams, crystal and black accents yet retain a modern edge.Some things you need to know:1. The restaurant doesn't serve dinner, but you can get small snacks in the bar until 112. Room service stops at 11 (not so good for night owls like me)3. Free wi-fi in the bar, restaurant and lobby but $10 a day in your room4. No mini-bar in roomMy room was really, really tiny. Boston boutique hotel tiny... but stylish and comfy bed. The bathroom left quite a bit to be desired from the lighting and motel-8 quality towels to the icy marble walls, floor and shower. The best thing about the bathroom are the L'Occtaine products they provide.I did have appetizers and wine in the bar, all were extraordinary. The menu is ambitious and creative and completely delivers. Surveying other plates around me I could see lots of tempting choices! Staff in the bar/lounge were exceptional.Location is excellent for shopping mag mile - it's next door to Neiman Marcus, across the street from Saks and about half way between Macy's @ Watertower Place and Nordstrom.My job is all travel, so I spend many, many nights in hotels. This is a good value for the location and general ambiance. Not high-end luxury, but not budget either. Could work for travel or a fun getaway. Interesting bar to meet coworkers or friends for a drink, charming restaurant to meet a client for breakfast or coffee; both will leave others with the impression that you know your stuff!I'll definitely stay here again.
