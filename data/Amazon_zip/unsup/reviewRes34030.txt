I go there regularly for brunch on weekends, since it is so close to my place. Skillets are good, sandwiches are better (best BLT I have ever had), egg benedicts are a favorite, as well as huevos rancheros. But embrace for extremely long queues...come armed with a lot of patience.  The decor is not so great, but if you get a boot it is all right.
