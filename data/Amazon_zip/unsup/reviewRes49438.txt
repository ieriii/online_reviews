This place is great for a birthday celebration, but make sure you have reservations. We arrived a little before 5pm because we were told we couldn't save a spot around 6pm; however, we left close to 7pm and it wasn't anywhere near full yet. A number of people were in the front waiting to be seated, but I think letting us have a later reservation wouldn't have been a big deal. It's hard to tell. They boast "Best Mojito in Chicago." It wasn't my favorite as I prefer a little more sugar and a lot more mint. But I will say it definitely made my top 5. If it were less than $8, I'd have ordered a second, even a third to try the fresh fruit version. The strawberry one looked tasty. Megan G. and I both ordered the Combinaciones with Entrana Skirt Steak & Grilled Shrimp. We agreed that the Shrimp was cooked to perfection. I feared it would flavorless because it looked dry, but it was nicely grilled on the outside and incredibly juicy on the inside. Whatever seasoning they use complements it. The Entrana was the show stopper, though. Mine was ordered medium-rare and delivered that way. It was incredibly juicy and flavorful. You could have sliced it with a spoon, and the complimentary Chimichurri (the fresher, greener one was a group favorite) only enhanced it; however, you won't be disappointed if you eat it plain. I liked the side of Yuca Frita and Baked Potato, but it was almost too much of a good starchy thing. They were a little too similar to be served together. I could have eaten an entire platter of the Plantains. We were disappointed to find that their dessert menu was limited. It's possible it was only that evening, but they had two options on a Saturday night - Flan or Figs & Tres Leches Caramel. Most of us went with Flan and loved it. It's one of the better ones in the city. It sounded like the Figs were good too, but the Flan was best. They are BYOB Monday-Thursday, but you can only bring wine and it's an $8 corkage fee.
