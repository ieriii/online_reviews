BEST LOCATION YOUR MONEY COULD GET! We checked into the Silversmith on Yelp! and found us an upgrade to a suite. We were there at 4pm, and check-in time was 3, so that's why I think there were still suites available for upgrades. The room itself was older, but it did not have that smell of an older room. You can tell they take good care of their rooms. The staff were all friendly, and are eager to help us out with the easiest bus routes to certain places. I think I read reaviews on it could potentially be a bit noisy because the hotel is situated right next to the train line, so we requested a room away from the streets and got our peace that way. I could barely hear passing trains when I wake up in the morning. Again, I cannot rave enough on their location. It was our first time in Chicago, so of course we wanted to go everywhere, and this hotel was really smacked dabbed in the middle. It took minutes to walk to the bus stops that would take us anywhere south or north of downtown. I'm so happy we chose the Silversmith. p.s. free wifi and an in-room fridge definitely earn this hotel another half a star. This would be a 5-star review if they have a microwave in the room to heat up my delicious Chicago food leftovers.
