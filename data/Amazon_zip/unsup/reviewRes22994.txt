This place is great, I've been there two times (never through the drive-in though, I gotta try that) it's now my neighborhood hot dog joint so I had to try it out. The superdawg is a chi-town style dog (and note to that Eddie guy, Chicago style has the wedge of green tomatoe, no it isn't supposed to be like you thought). The whoopskidog is polish but I didn't get it with BBQ I thought that would be weird (I'll try it next time) crinkle cut fries, nice so complainers, stop complaining, this place is great. But yes it is over-priced but what so ya expect from a place with this much hype? Are you gonna go to Times Square or the Mag Mile and complain that the stores are to expensive?
