We decided to try this restaurant after it was recommended by Meg at the Conrad - and was further encouraged by fellow Yelpers. We went at 8 p.m. on a Saturday night and the place was buzzing. We were seated at a corner of the communal table and at first, we found the wine/beer list and menu a little overwhelming (we are foodies from San Francisco so this surprised us both). Enter our waiter Justin. He was awesome. We turned our food and beverage choices over to him and after some discussion over our basic likes and interest in certain menu items, he was off. We had a 2.5 hour small plate and multi-course meal perfectly paired with AMAZING beers that was FANTASTIC. I can't actually believe I wrote amazing beers in a sentence! But Justin knows the food, understands the nuances and flavors of each plate and delivered. The mussels were buttery AND briney, served with a hot crusty loaf of baguette. The frittes - out of this world. The halibut crudo melted on our tongues...the pickles! Try the "pickles"...the charcuterie place, the corn, the tomatoes...all delicious. I have to also mention our entire experience was helped by great support staff including Miguel. Never had to ask for water, or sit in front of a used dish. He's new to the staff there and really warm and efficient. Can't wait ti return on our next visit. My only problem now is finding a restaurant for tonite that tops this experience!
