Meli is probably my favorite brunch place in Chicago. The food is great; it's always a pleasant surprise to see the new weekly specials on that first inside page of the menu. You can tell the place really takes pride in what they produce, using fresh, seasonal ingredients and coming up with clean, unique dishes and homemade jam. lavazza coffee for those who need a pickmeup, freshly squeezed/blended juices and smoothies for anyone else. the space itself is really charming. a lot of wood and light and crafts and whatnot. it manages to be really comforting even though it is a little smaller and cozy when busy and the service has always been great. really friendly and helpful and quick. and really cute. oh man even the wait, which can be pretty long, is fine and well worth it. you get once of those vibrating things and we were able to go down to their sister restaurant down the street for complimentary coffee while we waited instead of being stuck out in the cold. really thoughtful anyhow, really a great genuine place. make sure to start your weekend/recover here!
