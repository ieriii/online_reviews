I had heard the food was really good, but I am pretty picky when I go out to dinner, so I decided to try it out first for lunch. I went on Saturday and loved my food, the atmosphere and the service. I got the Lobster Salad Sandwich, which I must admit, I was hesitant to get it (because I am really picky with my seafood), but it was great!!! My friend had the turkey burger (which I of course tried) and loved it. I will definitely be going back there for dinner :)I am going to try out the drinks tomorrow night and will give an update on the nightlife...
