Best Korean restaurant in Chicago...but that's not saying much since pretty much ALL the Korean places here pale in comparison to NYC or LA...even Atlanta. I hate the sticky greasy dark feeling of walking into this place.  At least it's cheap. Their yook gae jang is my fav soup dish. Unfortunately they don't do the popular cha dolr bae gee w/duk boe sam.
