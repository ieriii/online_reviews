I go to the location on Washington near Harpo, and I've always had a great experience there. I LOVE thier shrimp with grits, and the catfish is superb. I also love the cornbread and the black eyed peas. The service has always been superb and friendly, and the outdoor patio is the BEST in the summer. They get -1 star because I think they're overpriced for what you're getting. UPDATE- 07-28-07 I just got back from Brunch at the Lincoln location, and all I have to say is WOW!!! The service was so great here!! I really enjoyed my time, and I felt that with service this good, I don't mind paying a little bit Xtra. So, it is with pleaure, that I give my last star. 5 stars!!!!
