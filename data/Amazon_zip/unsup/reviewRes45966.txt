In reviewing the Grand Lux, there are two things that stand out more than anything else. Beyond the lovely interior, the very capable staff, and general atmosphere, the most noteworthy parts are these: The menu is frickin' enormous. Its like a novella. They have dishes from throughout the world, ranging from pizza and burgers to more exotic dishes. There are a handful of very good vegetarian options, and all my carnivore friends were quite pleased with their dishes. The coffee is great, and they have some fine beers on draft. The other thing that makes the Grand Lux what it is, are the deserts. Their creme brulee is fantastic, not to mention my absolute favorite, the red velvet cake. The desert here is so good, that I would literally go downtown and catch two trains to get here just to have a bite of cake. Yum. I went here for my wedding reception and was quite thrilled with the quality and service. Good times were had by all, and I would highly recommend the Grand Lux if you have a little bit of money to spend.
