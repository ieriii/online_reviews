I've eaten at the Diner for many years and can only recall one or two dishes when I wasn't pleased. Generally I enjoy whatever I have though. The wait staff has always been courteous and the restaurant is clean, however a bit noisy and cramped. While it's never been much of an issue when my friends and I grab a bite, the one time I took my grandparents there they were not especially pleased. The main complaint I hear most is of how expensive it is (entrees typically hit the $12 +/- mark). While it certainly won't break the bank, I think you get more bang for your buck at Karyn's which is also vegan (and I think better) while capping out at the same dollar amount. Worth checking out (especially if you live in Chicago) however I think there are better vegetarian friendly restaurants that aren't as expensive and also don't require a 20-30 wait for a table in a cramped, loud room. The outdoor seating is lovely when the weather is more favorable. Also check out their cook book and be sure to hit a dessert too. UPDATED 10/29/11 I just ate here a couple of days ago for the first time in about a year and was a little bummed out on the buffalo wings which, for $7, were slim strips of seitan with a light coating of seasoning. Maybe I'm just used to more substantial seitan strips from places like Watercourse in Denver (which SMOKE these in every category).. it was a disappointment. I won't get them again. Six slim strips of under seasoned seitan for $7 sucks. The soul bowl was quite good but a bit pricey. These guys continue to get more expensive however I don't feel the quality has increased. It'll be awhile until I return.
