What can I say, this place will whisk you away! I lived in South Florida for about 10 yrs and have to say haven't really missed it until I ate here. First time went with a friend of mine who also fell in love with the place, food and staff! Second time went with my daughter to said she found her new spot! :) And this will definitely be my pick for my group's monthly dinner! The food is so tasty, I was surprised they had Goat Cheese empanada...soooo delicious! The ropa vieja was seasoned just right and PLENTY to fill you up and then some! Mariquitas with garlic mojo? Nice touch ;) The flan was sooo creamy and rich, glad we got 1 to split between the two of us, but I could definitely have devoured it without an arm twist. Although attentive, the staff is not overbearing and so very understanding and helpful. I definitely plan on becoming a regular for Cuban food at this place! (and gotta love that it's walking distance from my new apartment!) Can't wait to bring more people to this hidden Caribbean gem!!
