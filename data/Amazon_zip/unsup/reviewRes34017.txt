This is a pretty standard Breakfast place. It has good breakfast food, but nothing really sticks out as being really spectacular.  I'm there often, and the food isn't bad. The line outside is usually long, and going in the afternoon, 1 or so usually lets me skip it.  The wait staff is pretty attentive, but they are not in your face crazy. Every time I needed something, they seemed to be right there ready to go.
