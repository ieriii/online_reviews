They really need to doctor up the lyrics of that new radicals song and have it be "90 miles inside Chicago" So this place was overall just fantastic. On the way there I really needed to use the bathroom and so I was really happy that there was a parking lot so we did not have to waste time doing the street parking thing. Then I saw the place and thought it was too small to have a public bathroom. Not to worry as they let me use their private one!  Then it was finally time to order. We walked in there with 8 and I was the last to order. I asked for a veggie sandwich. The guy asked if I like tofu and since I do, he recommended I try the tofu sandwich. I did and was happy I went with the recommendation. I also got fries, maduros, and a papaya shake. Next time I would skip the fries and go for one of the other sides.  As we were finishing up our meal, the guy asked us how everything was and he brought us all complimentary expresso shots that were STRONG! It was a good way to end dinner and start the night! Oh and make sure you look at the hours as it closes at 8.
