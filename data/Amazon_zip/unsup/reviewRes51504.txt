You can get take out which is great if you're on the run or you just don't want to sit down in a restaurant at maybe 2am. Which is what we ended up doing and there were no complaints. My boyfriend was the one who picked up our food inside and he said that the guy who handed him everything and took care of him really hooked him up with all of the normal extras kinds of things he usually asks for and was super nice. The food was awesome. I got a chicken torta (it was my first torta too so now my impression of them is two thumbs up) meal and it came with rice and beans. I swear I couldn't even finish it there was so much food. And considering how much food they give you, the prices on everything are really cheap. I most defiantly expect to be going back there one of these days, especially for the torta.
