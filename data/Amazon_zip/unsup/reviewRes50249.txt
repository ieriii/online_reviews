I say it is one of the better bar foods in the neighborhood. We had cole slaw, homemade, cut in larger pieces with sour cream. It was great. Wings were very good, but blue cheese dressing was too watery and didn't taste like blue cheese at all. Their signature pulled pork sandwich is amazing. You can get it as a slider for $3/ea, which is a very generous portion. Certainly, will be back.
