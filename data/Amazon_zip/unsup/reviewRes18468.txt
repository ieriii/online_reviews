I enjoy Mexican food and so I went with my sister and niece for lunch at XOCO. It was delicious. I had heard about the lines, was in the right mind-set to wait, but we only had to wait 15 minutes. The restaurant was busy, exciting, loud and yet all under control. Found the sandwich I wanted and ordered from the very friendly, patient cashier. My beef short rib sandwich was outstanding. My sister questioned my ordered, once she had a bite she wished she had ordered this sandwich for herself. They both talked me into ordering churros with the dipping chocolate and I am so glad I listened to them. Had a wonderful meal and can't wait to go back.
