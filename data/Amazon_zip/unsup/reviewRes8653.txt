Thankfully I do not have to visit Pizza Doc again!! This pizza is prepared perfectly. One of their specials every night is always amazing. The sausage pizza is excellent zing to it and is authentic. Waitstaff was attentive and very detailed with our order and answering questions. Plenty of parking outside and plenty of seating space.
