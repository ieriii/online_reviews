When we went last year, I thought the hype was a little outrageous for hot dogs. How good could a hot dog possibly taste? The frugal side of me wanted to order the regular dogs. The health nut in me was scared of the cheese. Instead we decided to go all out. The amount of food we ordered was enough for a tiny country in Africa. Now after moving to LA, where reviews & prices are always inflated, I'm appreciating just how good Doug's is. The line is awful but there's a reason. Plan around the rush hour. Go gourmet. Get the dog, and get it with cheese.
