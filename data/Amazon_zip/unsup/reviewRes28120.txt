Best Mexican food in town. The only hassle is parking, there is a little lot right around the corner that fills up fast so try to find street parking if you can. Hands down this is the best carne asada i have ever had. The nice sized skirt steak is tender, flavorful and perfectly grilled. The barbacoa and chicken mole are also top-notch and well worth trying. The meals come with super fresh corn or flour tortillas and the service is fast and no frills. A fun touch is the free appetiizer that they bring out. Sometimes its a flauta, meatball, soup, chicken or some other tasty treat. Wash down your meal with an horchata but don't count on ordering a beer as this place is strictly BYOB.
