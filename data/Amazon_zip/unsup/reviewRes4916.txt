We went for lunch on a Monday, and there was no wait (surprise, surprise). The communal seating was a tad too cozy, as you could hear the conversations all around the table. But the food makes up for everything! Decent portion sizes for the price, and each dish as tasty as the last. Try the tuna with lima beans, bone marrow, JLT, thigh kebabs, etc. Try everything! We kept scoping out the food from the other parties at the table, and everything just looked so good.
