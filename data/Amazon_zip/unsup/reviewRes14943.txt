Love, love, love this cool speakeasy bar. Popped in here on a Sunday night while in Chicago visiting for my boyfriend's wedding, and it was such a needed reprieve from a crazy weekend. I came with the boy (who'd been there once or twice before), and our friend, for whom it was also a first. Good thing one of us knew how to get in there, cause it's pretty hard to find. There's no sign and the door is in the middle of a giant mural on the side of a building. Makes it feel really legit! We all appreciated the nostalgic vibe. It was dark, yet welcoming and unpretentious, which was a relief, since the rest of the neighborhood is hipster central. We opted to sit at the bar so we could peek on the bartender making the drink, and check out the bar, rather than sit in the really cute, secluded, high backed booths.The velvet curtains all over split up the service area into two rooms and cut the noise pretty nicely. Our bartender was adorable in his striped shirt and suspenders, and he appeared to revel in the art of drink-making. I ordered the whiskey citrus forward "Plumb the Soul," while the others got a "Midnight Stinger" (whiskey) and a "Commis Sling" (a scotch drink). Not gonna lie, we were more than a little impressed by the giant specialty ice-cubes that fit into our glasses (apparently, I'm easily impressed). We were left alone to talk, and the bartenders came by and kept up our little glasses of water (given to us upon seating) throughout the visit. Bartender was even nice enough to leave us with the dropper bottle of tobacco bitters, with instructions on best tasting practices, when we asked to try it. All drinks are $12 and organized by liquor on the menu, and they have a fairly reasonable menu of small snacky plates (cheeses, croquettes, etc. that ranges from $5+) Overall, great, chill night spot. And Sunday night in September there was no wait to get in!
