They have a lot of choices. A LOT of them. We went for the 6 quesos pizza. One thing they should clarify on the menu is where it says "tomatos" they don't mean sliced tomato, but rather just tomato sauce. I was happy for that, but I could imagine others being a touch annoyed. That said the pizza was quite good. You could really taste the blue cheese and the contrast with the smokier cheeses was excellent. The crust was thin with a little crunch but gave easily enough. The cheese rolls were almost as good as at the big Fogo (no relation) downtown.  If I lived near there I could see myself going there on a quite regular basis. As it is I would be happy to go back and grab the food for pickup (the wait for the pizza was a bit long, but understandable as it is made from scratch) from time to time. The place is quite small, with 4 tables and a small counter, seating perhaps 15 people total. It was pleasant when we were in there with most of the business being takeout.
