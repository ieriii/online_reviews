Great food, small portions, great service. All in all this is a great place to go to try a little bit of everything. Don't go if you're starving. We ordered several apps and two entrees. Everything tasted better than it sounds, which is saying a lot- because it all sounds good. Drinks were good, but hopefully the bartenders learned how to make a few drinks, now that they've been open awhile I' thinking this will be a fun mid afternoon or light late dinner
