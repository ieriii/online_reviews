I was in Chicago this past week and had dinner here with a friend who raved about how good this place was. Given that I lived in the bay area for 6 years, I've had my fair share or vegan/veggie food...and I'm confident in saying that the food here is DELICIOUS! Definitely worth checking out if you're in the veggie/vegan/pescatarian club! :)
