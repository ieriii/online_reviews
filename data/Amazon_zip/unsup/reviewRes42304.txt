Pan pizza is usually good, but once the dough was not cooked all the way and was gross. We've never had a problem with their delivery or service. It's also a good place to stop in for pizza by the slice. It is also not expensive. The dining room is large and when I went there, quite a few people had came for a slice. I finally tried the stuffed pizza, and it was good, but nothing beats the pan pizza! That is the one you gotta try.
