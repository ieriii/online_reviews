Wow--my best birthday dinner in a long time! Didn't have the foresight to make a reservation for my large group well ahead of time, so we faced a 90 minute wait when we showed up at 7 on a Saturday (what do you expect, right?). This totally could have bummed out my birthday celebration but fortunately we were loaded with bottles of wine and directed to the "waiting room" in the house next door. After popping open the wine and taking some photos with the Nosferatu mannequin (did any other reviewers see Nosferatu in the waiting room? come on! creepy but hilarious) we were directed to our table in less time than originally stated. I would have waited two hours for this delicious food! The tostones with the garlic aioli are delicious. The puerco rostizado just could not get in my mouth fast enough. I'm still thinking about that dish. To top it off, the atmosphere is fun and lively. There are clearly regulars who must come here every week to eat comida sabrosa and have a great time. Maybe I can make myself one of them!
