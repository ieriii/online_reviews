Love this place, especially late at night. So much good food. I love the octopus, bulgogi, and galbi. Their soondooboo jigae (hot spicy tofu soup) and side dishes are great, too, especially their mook (bean jello). And the beers don't hurt the experience, either! My FAVORITE waitress is super sassy and reminds me of an aunt I wish I had. Personal anecdote: I was dining with two ladies and another guy, when she brought around our bill and asked which guy was paying. I said we were splitting it in 4 and she asked to see the guys' watches. Upon seeing my cheap watch and the other guy's nicer one, she gave the bill to him. Hilarious - we couldn't stop laughing! I understand that some people think there's bad service, partially b/c I know about enough Korean to translate "Donde esta la biblioteca," but you really should go with someone who understands the experience, because you're going to end up cooking it yourself. It's not your run-of-the-mill sit down and eat what's served to you kinda place. If you can't find someone who's done Korean BBQ before, just let the waitress know that you have no idea what you're doing and they will help you out. Also, just because you're doing the cooking doesn't mean you should skimp on tip. These ladies are serving tons of side dishes to your table, so show some respect! Newbie Tips: 1) Make sure you leave any clothes you don't want to dry clean in the car. 2) If your grill tray starts to smoke, take it off the fire and ask for a new one. Same for the charcoal pot. Otherwise, you will cry tears of pain. 3) Parking is available around the residential areas, if the lot is full 4 stars because the parking lot is like the 27-point turn scene in Austin Powers and their prices went up. Otherwise, I'd give them a 5.
