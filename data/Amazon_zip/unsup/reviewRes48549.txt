The Publican was my first foray into rustic nose to tail fine dining. It won me over like whoa. Bye bye fussy towers of thing, hello pork rinds and lard fries. The oysters are boss, and the pork belly is to die for, but it is Paul Kahan we're talking about here, so, duh. Not so much on the desserts, but the cheese board is solid. The waiters are super knowledgeable about the multitudes of beer on the menu, so don't be intimidated! Just tell your server what flavor profile you crave and they'll make the perfect beer appear on your table with a poof and a little wiggle of their adorbs checked shirt. Mostly they'll just go get it for you, but still. I would lurve a cocktail list, but that's just me. Also the decor is charming in a "are we sitting in a horse stall?" kind of way.
