I went there with friends and we ordered several dishes: chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka, chicken Mahkani and vegetable biryani. Everything was delicious but I found the chicken vindaloo pretty spicy (I can eat spicy in general). The naans were great and I had a Kingfisher beer. The service is good and so is the atmosphere. I definitely want to go back and try a lunch buffet there.
