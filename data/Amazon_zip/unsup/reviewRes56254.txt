When's the last time you had a handwritten note from the owner wondering how you are included with your delivery order? Tuan, you are such a sweetheart and I'm so sad my best friend who I always came in there with moved away and i don't get to come in as often. If only every business had such delightful customer service.It was yet another delicious meal from Simply It. The Beef Pho soup is the greatest!! Tons of tenderloin and perfect flavors and I'm on my 3rd serving of it. The bamboo duck will always be my favorite and it was awesome as always. Thank you!!
