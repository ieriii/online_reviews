Pretty good location being in 'Viagra Triangle' - closing walking distance to Red Line subway, Lake Michigan and N Michigan/Oak shopping. Hotel is pretty classy and service and decor is top-notch. There are lots of bars, restaurants and shops nearby - most importantly: it's close to a few CVS/Walgreen's. But - being in Viagra Triangle, nightlife nearby is mainly for old men and their mistresses. Then again, I suppose my group wasn't exactly their main clientele. What's hot: - powerful showerheads - good for trying to wash the sins off your filthy body... I know what you have done... - free WiFi if you ask nicely or mention you're a Sutton Club member - got a corner suite facing Lake Michigan - was surprised to find some decent speakers, an amplifier and a DVD player attached to the CRT TV - fast elevators - staff was awesome - friendly, prompt and helpful - terry cloth bath robes What blows: - WiFi connection is extremely weak (at least on the 15th floor) - connection repeatedly dropped on my smartphone and was rocky at best on a laptop - I understood why they were so easily in giving us WiFi for free. Do not even bother paying for it. - Complimentary ice delivery - there aren't ice machines on the floors, so they deliver it from downstairs. First couple of times I called front desk, no ice arrived within 15 minutes. First time, I walked down to grab my own ice... like a peasant. Second time, I complained to front desk about the '5 minute' promise. After that - all ice deliveries were at my room lickety-split. Sorry to be a bitch about this - but when you're an alcoholic, you abhor waiting for ice. Overall - a good hotel with great service overall. Just give me better WiFi and don't make me wait for ice again.
