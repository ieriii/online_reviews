We went there for their brunch and were pleasantly surprised for the price we paid, the quality of service and food. Sometimes you go to places that are typical tourist spots, you get bad service and sub par food. Not here. Make your own bloody mary bar- awesome. Every dish that came-yum. The attendant at the cheese and meat bar- hilarious and really made our morning.
