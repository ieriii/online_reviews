I stopped in India House today for carry out, because I've been craving some soul food. I have never been there before, but I will be back.. probably weekly. The buffet looks amazing! A lady at the front helped me sift through the menu to decide what would be best and most cost efficient. She was extremely helpful, organized and polite. I didn't have to wait too long for my food to be ready, which was awesome. I ordered, aloo chat, onion kulcha, chana masala, and basmati rice. I couldn't get over how good the food was. It was perfect for a cold day, and left me very relaxed and satisfied.
