Came and visited Chicago from California. I took a 45 minute taxi ride in the rain to get to this place. The dogs were very good. We tried the classic Dog, Chicago style...always a classic. We also tried the Steve Swisher chicken sausage, Sal Tessio Italian sausage, and The Norm Crosby (beef, pork, garlic). All were very good, but the classic Dog was our favorite, the others were not as impressive. Glad we came out, even though it cost us nearly $40 just to get there and back through taxi.
