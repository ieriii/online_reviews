I was craving shrimp n grits this morning so we took the train up to Lakeview to try out Wishbone. The shrimp and grits were good but I'm not used to having them in a wine and cream sauce. I think the cream masked the creamy cheesiness of the grits but all in all it was a good dish and I would order it again. We also got a single crab crake on the side which was quite good. Some places have more cake than crab in their crab cakes but not at Wishbone. Lots of crabby goodness. The atmosphere in the restaurant is also really fun. Fried egg chandeliers and flying chicken murals for the win. I might have to head back for the Jazz and Fried Chicken special some Wednesday.
