THIS PLACE ROCKS!  My husband and I went here last night (August 18, 2012). It was his second visit and my first. We sat at the bar and got to watch all the line cooks assemble the dishes. What a great treat that was! We had great wine (Esporao Private Selection 2009)! We ordered Chorizo Stuffed Olives, Foie Gras & Membrillo, Eggplant Caponata with Goat Cheese, Pork Sweetbreads with Fennel & Apricots.  Everything we ordered was AMAZING! We wanted to order more but were too stuffed after all that. The eggplant caponata was too much for just us two but I'm sure not complaining about that!! The people behind the bar that waited on us were awesome! They took really great care of us! This place was my favorite part of our trip to Chicago!!
