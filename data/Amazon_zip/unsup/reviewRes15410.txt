I went here one evening for a private party, so I'm not entirely sure how representative my experience was, but I had a lovely time. The group I was with had the whole back room, which was great, very neat exposed-brick looking. The bartender was nice. We had a family-style dinner, and everything was good - we had something parmigana (eggplant?) that was tasty, and the sauces were generally good. I wasn't as big a fan of whatever chicken we had (something less tomato-saucy and more olive-oil based, though I never heard exactly what it was). The bread, though, was AMAZING. They had a foccacia that was just absolutely delicious - lots of herbs, cheese, and other tasty seasonings I couldn't even identify. I could have just eaten the bread and drank my wine and been happy... All in all, good if pretty standard Italian. I'd definitely go back so I could order off the menu and know a bit more about the dishes I order.
