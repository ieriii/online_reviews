Why have I not gone to Gilt Bar sooner? Man have I been missing out! They have a nice beer list (yay Gumballhead!), as well as cocktails and wine, but the star of the show is definitely their food. There's a lot of good eats to try, so I recommend going with at least 2 other people and sharing a few plates, which is my favorite way to dine. Be sure to ask what specials they have that day and if cornbread is on the list, order it. Do eeet! I tried the Goat Butter & Charred Shallot Cornbread, which is served in a mini skillet, and just gets better by the minute while the butter melts. It's so addictive they should just rename it to crackbread. I've never met bone marrow I didn't like and their Roasted Bone Marrow, served with hot crusty bread and red onion jam, is lip smacking good. Their bread is delicious and perfect for dipping in their Sweet Balsamic Roasted Garlic & Olive Oil. Oh man is that good! If they bottled that up and sold it, I'd clear out their inventory for sure. Coal Fired Ribeye - wow is that good! They serve a damn good steak, nicely charred on the outside, perfectly cooked, and packed with beefy flavor. The steak salt served on the side is perfect for dipping every bite into and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. They also serve some awesome mussels and I couldn't get enough of the broth. Gilt Bar is definitely on my list of go-to places for great food & drink... can't wait to go back!
