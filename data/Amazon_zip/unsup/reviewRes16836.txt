First off, the trick to getting inside is seeing the door handle sticking out of the wall. And then to not go with a group of 10 - which we managed, but it wasn't exactly comfortable. I'd recommend going with groups of 6 or less here.  We went on a Wednesday night around 7:45 to meet some friends and there were still some open seats at the bar and tables - when we left at 11, there was a line of 15 people or so outside. I will agree with a previous commenter about the music being loud - it was a strange mix of music that ranged from folksy to middle-eastern and some of it was way too loud. Drinks wise, I was pretty impressed with what I got. I had the Piscoe Punch (smelled like tequila, tasted nothing like tequila, served in a giant bowl with a giant ice cube, hard to get the last drops!), the Sarsaparillo Slim (whiskey drink with root beer bitters) and the Riviera (lemon infused bombay + egg white + lemon + another ingredient or two). The Riviera was a nice finishing drink since it was sweeter and light, the Piscoe Punch was a pleasant starter, and the Sarsaparillo Slim was something good in the middle. We tried the sammies which were... a range. The salmon and veggie sammies were good, but the chicken wrap just got an "ok" rating. The cilantro inside was a nice surprise, but I think the wrap was a bad choice. 10 people, fair amount of boozing and some eating, bill ended up around $350 with tip. A bit pricey and a bit of a trek for me, but still something I'd come back to once in a while for the different flavors and ambiance.
