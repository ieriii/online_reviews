I'm going to say one positive thing about this before i continue with the negative, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE i ever got. The waiters were so fuken FRIENDLY, they made me feel really comfortable being here! :) N E ways, i spent many hours trying to look for a fancy to casual mexican restaurant, and i chose the mayan mexican cuisine. Why i chose it? I liked their website! But dont judge a website by its cover, : | The restaurant was small and pretty calm. I was not WoWEd about their food though, it was allright but maybe cuz i was STARVING! I'm mexican, and i've tried better tacos than that! For the price, the food amount wasn't that much, that's another thing i wasn't impressed with. Me and my friend were celebrating our senior graduation there and we wanted to eat in the patio. First of all the patio isn't outside, and i agree with someone else's comment saying that it seemed like a garage with the walls around it.
