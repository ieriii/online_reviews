This place is awesome. I'm a big fan of Brendan Sodikoff (I've loved Gilt Bar and Maude's Liquor Bar) It's dark, intimate, exciting...... Good service (we had to wait a bit for our server so they comped our first round- great). We ate a lot of food, and the bill was very reasonable given other prices in Chi. Great selection of drinks and cocktails. Excellent food. I loved the Sazerac. My gf enjoyed a vodka drink, but I can't remember the name. Awesome: 1.) caramelized brussels sprouts, pork belly, maple & parmesan 2.) Truffle Pasta. 3.) blue cheese fondue, caramelized onions & spinach I'll be coming back to try: - bone marrow - steak tartare - the downstairs lounge
