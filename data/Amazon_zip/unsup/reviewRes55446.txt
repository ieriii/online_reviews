went here on sunday, it was A-OK.had the sea bass which was on special, it was good, but felt it could use a tad bit more salt to bring out the flavors of the fish.their olive oil that they bring from Italy is nice.They had a house salad that was perfectly tossed in the dressing, not too much dressing and not too little.My wife had black pasta, and she was A-OK with hers also, but not blown away.The other couple that we were with, one of them was not happy about their meal and the other was just so-so.Perhaps we all ordered off things but I think we were expecting a little more, but you know, you hear so much hype sometimes you think angels are going to come singing from the sky or something.anyhow, will I go back . . . . .yes, I would go back; and perhaps the next time there will be some angels.
