Def a great place. Awesome staff, great burgers, and good beer selection. If ur a music buff who loves classic/rock music, ul love this place. Awesome music, and it's cool that they got concerts playing on their TVs - def a good change for bars who always play hiphop. However there r 2 things that made me reduce the rating: Drink prices: they're steep but it's the city and it's tough to find a bar that has both a good atomsphere and cheap prices. Watev thou if ur into quality beer, they'll prolly carry it, plus they do have 2 days of cheap beer specials. The location: I guess it's good it close to the Empty Bottle, being as it's a music-themed bar, but it's still a stretch for ppl out of the neighborhood. Its on the border to wicker park, but it's technically located in humboldt park - a rough neighborhood. If this bar was on the division street bars or in the heart of wicker park bars, this bar would be flawless. But I'm not a fan of the location. Overall, I would mos def recommend going here. Cool music, great staff, and solid beer selection. Cheers!
