After our initial July 4th plans fell through, the wife and I decided to go to Giordano's. Sure, that involves getting on a plane and flying there, but when you have a hankering for Chicago deep dish, you have to do what you have to do. And Giordano's held up it's end of the bargin, and then some! We got there around 10ish, pre-ordered our pizza, and headed to the bar for a few delicious 312's (on draft of course). (A side note....the pre-order system is pure genius. Although the wait for a table is 45min, the pizza is baking while you wait for the table and we got ours 5 min after sitting down. Brilliant) The pizza itself was heaven. I had a small pepporoni and sausage and my wife had a small sausage, mushroom, and spinach. Both were perfectly cooked with fresh ingredients at the perfect eating temperature. (Note - Two pies are WAY too much food for two, but when you fly all the way from NYC for a particular pizza, you get exactly what you want! After eating at both Giordano's and Geno's, I can say that the biggest difference is the freshness of the ingredients. And while I liked the service and the atmosphere at Geno's better, the food is the reason people eat places and the pizza at Giordano's was better.. Giordano's by TKO in 8th.
