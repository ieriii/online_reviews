My point and/or star rating is not to dignify a Kleiner restaurant or most of the people who frequent this particular one (seems like a futile gesture), but my girlfriend and I went in here with a strategy--and a $50 gift card, natch--and made something of it. Did we open the menu? Nyet: we were not going to validate pan-latino restaurants that take the banal American restaurant protein staples (e.g., tuna, chicken breast) and put some mango or some mojo on top. We were, however, going to have some charcuterie. And we did: jamon iberico para dos. And some Mount Enebro, aged manchego, and garroxta cheeses to boot. So that's not testing any actual cooked dish, and the restaurant didn't earn this ranking at all; we managed, nonetheless. I'll hand it to Chef Mendez: he does a good job sourcing his ingredients. The ham: silky in texture, almost grassy in taste. The cheeses: a textbook manchego, a nice creamy goat, and a harder goat (the Enebro) that was particularly elegant--and beautiful with some ham, quince jam, and cracker. The accoutrements featured some really nice and garlicky olives and some addictive marcona almonds. Yelp doesn't have an rating system for fellow customers, and I'm fine with demurring about the scene: not everyone understands or appreciates food--that's why there are restaurants like this. We, elitist snobs we are, acknowledged it...and then went for a second dinner at The Publican.
