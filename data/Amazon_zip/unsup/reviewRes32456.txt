I'm a big fan of Ethiopian and have yet to determine which Chicago resto is the best destination for my savory+spicy+injera binges. That being said, this is a convenient place for Ethiopian.  Compared to Ras Dashen, Demera has a more convenient location - super accessible to the el & bus, closer to downtown, nearby concert venues and the Green Mill... The food does not disappoint. Just as delicious as any Ethiopian restos I've tried in Chicago and the west coast. The lunch is the one of the best deals ever. $8 for four choices out of eight! Just save it for a day when you can spend your afternoon in food coma. I'm definitely going back for lunch, at least. However, I wouldn't make this my spotlight destination for the night like I would some of the others further north on Broadway. I prefer the ambiance of those better. This is perfect for lunch and to pass time before a concert or a late night at Green Mill.
