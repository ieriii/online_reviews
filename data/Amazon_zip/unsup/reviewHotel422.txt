Found this hotel online and was not far from where my son is going to school. For the money, this hotel rocks!!!! Beautiful lobby; staff was great and room was clean and very big. I am not a nit picky person so I did not find anything to nit pick about. Maybe if I was staying at a $200 a nite hotel, it would be different. But again, for the money, this hotel can't be beat. We drove from out of town, and the money we saved in parking alone is worth it. There is a bar/lounge, cafe and gift shop. They even have an free internet cafe with hot coffee 24/7.
