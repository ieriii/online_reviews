The food is WELL worth the wait in line, and actually the wait has never been terrible when I've gone. Once you've placed your order though, you'll be eating duck fat fries before you know it. If I had one complaint it's that I can't get foie gras as a topping for any dog, because foie gras makes everything better. Delicious.
