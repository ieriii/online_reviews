I had to give 3 stars because the waitstaff/employees were just too friendly/accommodating and the place was really clean/welcoming. Otherwise, the pizza is nothing special (I'd give 2 and a half if it was possible). I shared a thin-crust with a friend of mine. My side was mushrooms, black olives and spinach. Even with all those toppings, the pizza was so bland that all the oregano, parmesan and crushed red peppers in the world couldn't save this pie. The sauce looked like it was from a can and there was an overload of bland crust.  If you're local to this area and want a drink, some cheesey garlic bread (which was actually good) and to watch the game, go on. But, if you're Loop/Little Italy or further south and in the mood for some thin-crust, go to Pizano's or Aurelio's.
