What a delicious and romantic place! The interior was very elegant and beautiful and I was definitely a fan of the wait staff's uniforms. It was very classy and looked sharp. I had tom xao sate which had shrimp and asparagus in a delicious tangy/spicy sauce! It was done very well and the portions were generous. The service was great, too. We seemed to have multiple waiters/waitresses who coordinated to make sure our dining experience went smoothly and at a good pace. A great date place, I would recommend it to anyone!
