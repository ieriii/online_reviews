This place is #1. Ignore all the negative reviews, where else can you find so much top shelf high gravity Belgian goodness in one place? When all the taps are French, of course it's going to be a snooty beer snob place! But give it a chance, the servers are helpful if you need some guidance. France has wine regions, Belgium. . .beer regions. You will not regret it, and you may never look back. Recommendations on tap in no particular order: Ommegang Hennepin - Domestic, amazing. Reason to visit Cooperstown, NY. Unibrou Maudite- Tres Bien Delirium Tremens - The name says it all. Leffe- any variety Enjoy with a side of frites!
