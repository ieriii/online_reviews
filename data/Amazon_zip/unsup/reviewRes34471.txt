This place is perfect if you are looking for something fast, delicious, and inexpensive. They give you a lot of food for your money. I picked up two dinners for my brother and myself-- it was way more than we could eat, so I had lunch for the next day. It's a great place to go with friends and order a bunch of things and share.
