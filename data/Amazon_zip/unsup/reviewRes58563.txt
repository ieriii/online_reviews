Sunday night, in the midst of the first official snow storm to hit Chicago, I ventured with the Windy City Pizza Club to Piece. I easily could have stayed in and kept warm, but there was something about Piece that I had to have. When I first approached the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by how large and full the place was. It was only when I saw the menu, with drinks such as Camel Toe and the like, that made me discover why this hole in the wall is such a hit. As much as I love deep dish, the wide selection of toppings such as Mashed Potatoes and Bacon make this place distinct and unlike any other restaurant you will find. If you're a pizza lover, I highly recommend stopping by this place for their BBQ Style pizza.
