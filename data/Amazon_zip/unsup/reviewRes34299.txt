I went to this restaurant tonight and the food was good. HOWEVER, the waitstaff left something to be desired. I felt like we were annoying our waitress and hostess. The food was good, but I've had better. Actually i went to the branch in forest park and it was a completely different experience-it was pleasant. I don't recommend this place
