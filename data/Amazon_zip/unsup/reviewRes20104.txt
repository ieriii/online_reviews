One of my good friends and I came to Gage after a watching a play at the Silk Road theatre on a Sunday night. It wasn't too busy- which was expected for sunday night, so we were able to get seated immediately. We started with the Curry Fries and the Mussels in vindaloo sauce. The appetizers were HUGE and definitely enough to be a meal, and I can't forget to mention they were really yummy. The curry fries had a nice kick to them. Mussels were great too- and way more than enough for two people to share! I had the sausage for my entree- it was alright, don't think I'd order it again. We ended our meal with the french toast. When it came out it almost looked like a fancy rice crispy treat, but it didn't taste like it. It had a nice crunchy outside and soft/moist center- like french toast. It had just the right about of sweetness to it... I'm actually thinking about picking one of these pupppies up on my way home from work ones of these days.. Mmmmmm
