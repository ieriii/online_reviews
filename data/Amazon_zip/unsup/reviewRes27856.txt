Being a born-and-bred Brooklyn Boy, I am supposed to hate deep dish pizza. I'm supposed to hate it like I hate the Red Sox & the Mets. That's just plain stupid. Pequod's is incredible. Sure, it takes about 30 minutes for the food to come, but it's damn good. It's thick, but loaded with toppings, not dough. We love to go and load that sucker up with 5 to 8 toppings and it's always great. get the garlic, it's not one you'd think of, but definitely worth it.
