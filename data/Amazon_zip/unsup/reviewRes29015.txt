i've lived in chicago for like 6 years now and have wanted to go here forever without any real excuse for having not done so... i finally went. let's just say i wasn't wowed. maybe i was expecting too much? from my other food reviews, you can likely piece together that i'm the kind of guy who survives mainly on pizza, burgers, and sandwiches, which is totally true. so i've tried a lot. what i got: garlic bread, a pan cheese pizza, pitcher of beer. the garlic bread was pretty weak and bland, i could've gone to Jewel and gotten a loaf of Cole's that'd smoke this. the pizza was fine, not great, not bad. near perfect amount of cheese, tasty crust, carmelized edge as others have noted. the best part - no tomato chunks in the sauce. i hate tomato chunks and often have to pick at a pizza, esp.' deep dish' before i can really eat it. don't ask why, they just make me want to barf if i bite into one. the beer was exactly as ordered, it came in a pitcher. i'll have to go back and try again, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen...
