A group of three friends and I tried this place out for the first time, in search of some delicious Vietnamese food. We were, for the most part, not disappointed. I ordered a chicken soup, which was absolutely fantastic and well flavored. Another of my friend's soups -- a curry tofu offering -- was also great, and she also enjoyed her tea. My other two dining partners were not as successful. One had an unidentified meat as part of her dish that she wasn't aware of as part of the meal, and it was certainly lacking.. something. The other got an accidental big bite of a jalapeno in her sandwich, which destroyed her appetite from there, but that wasn't necessarily anyone else's fault but hers. The service was somewhat disappointing. It took a long time to get the check once we were done eating, and it wasn't a particularly busy time. We also received our dishes at odd times, which is awkward when you are dining with a group. The decor is also nothing too special, but the prices are very fair. That said, I would probably come back and try one of the sandwiches (sans jalapeno) or a different soup.
