I've been wanting to check out Greektown ever since I moved here and we happened to choose Greek Islands. I was surprised with how ginormous and busy the restaurant was, but it was a Friday night. The wait was about 30 minutes long. After reading that the olive oil, olives, sea bass and tons of other stuff was actually flown in from the Greek Islands, I had to order the Mediterranean sea bass. It was completely different from the Chilean Sea Bass I'm used to in southern California. I got to admit it was bit drier than I expected but it did have a lot of different flavors. We ordered the flaming saganaki which totally caught me off guard when the waiter came behind me to flambe that chunk of cheese. That appetizer was delicious! Greek cheese flambeed in alcohol and then doused out with lemon juice- wow- delish! The hubby ordered the mousaka which was equally tasty. I especially loved the olive oil- I even bought a bottle to take home. We finished the meal with tiny cups of Greek coffee which was a very bold coffee but very good- watch out for the sludge at the bottom of the cup though (bitter and gritty). This place is a great place to take the family- great service and a family friendly atmosphere.
