So, I went again. Because I can't get enough. Honestly, I think I called at the end of February, then again sometime in April maybe, finally got a call back in May and went last night. So I really have no idea what their method for call backs is, but hearing from them was the equivalent of getting Oprah tickets for me and I almost peed my pants at work. I guess I don't need to get in to too much detail, I already wrote one review. We brought three bottles, for three people and I may still be wine drunk this morning. Luckily my dining companions and I made Schwa the event of the night and had nowhere to drag our drunk asses after. They pulled out a secret quail egg course halfway through the meal. QUAIL EGGGG. I almost peed again. I pee when excited, can't help it. Try as I might to request additional delicious raviolis, in the end it was just the one. That course alone is worth the price. Seriously. I want one right now. Highlights were the peeky toe crab, maki course, pea soup, eh... everything was a highlight. The chocolate-y nib thing wasn't my favorite, but mostly that was the sauce. RAVIOLI. I love the vibe at Schwa, it's like being in your friend's basement (although oddly upscale decor), the music's on, you're drunk, and you're eating ridiculously fantastic food. Micheal's just wandering around... I'm going back to bed.
