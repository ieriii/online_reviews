This place is a fantastic brunch spot! Though there is always a line, it moves fast and you will be seated in no time! The food is quick and delicious! I had their special for the day, brown sugar french toast and it came piled high! I was shocked at the quantity of food, and it was SO GOOD! My friend had the breakfast burrito and they had no problem substituting egg whites and other dietary requests she had for them. The staff was friendly, responsive and quick. I will definitely be going back!
