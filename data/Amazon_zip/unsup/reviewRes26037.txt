I love this place and it's my new favorite Tapas restaurant. It is so cute in there and the food is just amazing. We ordered a bunch of stuff, including the flat bread and Wagyu steak which were our favorites. For dessert I ordered the Saffron rice pudding, my mouth is watering just thinking about it, it was amazing. I definitely would go there again and again and again.......
