Had a lovely brunch here this past Saturday. Ordered the turkey schnitzel & waffles, chorizo flatbread and of course the maple bacon. Our server seemed a little distracted but everything was presented beautifully. The turkey & waffle was outstanding. Unsure how I could return for a Saturday morning and not order it again. Big fan of their exclusive teas. I'm excited to return for the dinner menu and Sunday brunch menus another time. Also - what a great space! I imagine it is even better at night.
