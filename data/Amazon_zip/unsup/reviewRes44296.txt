I just had my first taste of Alliance bakery today and I'm quite impressed. You know how there's a good kind of burnt and a bad kind of burnt on cakes and brownies? Like when you make a perfect cake you have to burn the edges and corners a little for some variance in flavor, texture, and taste... I know you feel me, those are always the first pieces to go. Anyway, this place has got that glory taste down pat BUT without actually burning anything. I don't know how they do it but the cupcakes look slippery and moist... almost like fake restaurant food displayed for the daily specials except it's real and oh so edible. Anyway, it has the delicious, organically burnt taste that lingers a bit and is somehow not crusty at all. I'll defo be heading into Alliance sometime soon... PS- thanks to Laurie C. for the fabu birthday cupcake. :) I can't wait to get some "you're adopted" cakes for friends' b-days.
