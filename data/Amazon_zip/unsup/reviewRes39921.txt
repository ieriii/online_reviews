Oh hot damn this place was good. I'm not the most experienced dude in the world with the super-unique, super-rich, semi-fancy foods, but man, that pork belly kicked my ass in the best way possible. Didn't hurt that I was able to enjoy a hell of a Manhattan and a really nice couple of beers with it. I want to come here and try just about everything else on the menu. Tell my piggy bank that I'm about to break out the damn hammer. Oh yeah, and seeing that long list of $3 whiskeys made me feel at home. Veerrrryy at home.
