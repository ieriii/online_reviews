Whiskey. Reasonably priced, quality whiskey. Longman & Eagle is bringing back the casual dram and I love it. The food is off the chain good. The sweetbreads, marrow and wild boar sloppy joe are my favorites, and the deserts are absurd (in the best kind of way). If not for our knowledge of the ravages of distempers like diphtheria, scarlet fever, tuberculosis and the French Pox, Longman & Eagle is the best advertisement for growing out your handlebar mustache and time traveling back to the 1800's. Excelsior!
