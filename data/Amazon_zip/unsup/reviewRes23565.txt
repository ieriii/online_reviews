I've had hot pot here and it was very good...hard to compare it to the hot pot I've had in Guangzhou and Shanghai (obviously the style is going to be different, but one can objectively judge the flavor of the boiling liquid, the ingredients, and the sauce), but for chicagoland this place is just fine. I actually like the 'regular' menu items better than the hot pot and have had some delicious meals...both take-out and dine-in. It does get very crowded, so go at an off time if you don't want to wait.
