Awesome restaurant, though the lack of room is keeping it from a full 5 star rating. The place has a great vibe, nice lighting and pretty yet simple decor. But there isn't quite that much seating, so when it gets busy, you get pretty cramped--we were literally separated by 3 inches of space between each 2 person table. The waitstaff was really attentive and did a great job. We even got complimentary lemonade on the house! Though it's not really necessary when you've got the no fee BYOB policy--a nice touch. The food was really good, especially the pho. Since visiting Vietnam, I have been searching for a place to satisfy my pho cravings, and Simply It did a fantastic job. It's a HUGE bowl of pho, that I could hardly make a dent in after our 2 appetizers, but so delicious. I will definitely be back for some more.I love pho!
