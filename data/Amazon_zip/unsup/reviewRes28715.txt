NOT CHILD FRIENDLY - our waiter got in my 2.5 y/o son's face and asked him, "Will you be quiet already?" when he heard him laughing really loud as we were paying the check. Little did the waiter know the kid who had been screaming throughout our lunch time there was 10 months old and extremely hungry. EVEN if it had been my son who had been loud, the waiter was in no position to discipline my son. He should have spoken to the parent when he felt it was overwhelming. Unfortunately, when I asked the waiter if this is the way he typically directed himself at children, he said, "usually, parents thank me for making their kids stop screaming." This was said WHILE my son was crying for being yelled at in his face. the waiter (which i'm pretty sure was the MANAGER) showed no remorse until I told him we were never coming back. Seriously, this place should get their act together!
