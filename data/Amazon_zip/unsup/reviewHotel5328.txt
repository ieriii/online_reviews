This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at! Anything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong. We checked in and immediately found peeling paint and mold in our shower which is unacceptable. We changed rooms and later that night I tried to take a shower. I couldn't shower because the whole handle came off the shower, not to mention we had trouble getting hot water a couple of times. Also most of the hotel staff was incredibly rude and not helpful. The russian doorman were incredibly lazy and I had to tell them what to do. The only two people that were helpful at all were Pablo at the front desk and Rasheed the bell man. Before checking out, we checked the room for anything we might have forgotten. We found a glass under the bed filled with mold. I had been sick all week because I am allergic to mold, and it now makes sense because the Hotel seems to be covered in mold.I will never stay at this hotel again. We were treated like crap, and that is not what we expected when we drop THOUSANDS of dollars to stay there.
