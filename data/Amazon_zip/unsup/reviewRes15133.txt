I thought this place was great! I would agree that 'old school italian' is clearly the label to put on Sabatino's... The front bar area has female bartenders that can tell the best stories. I bet they have been working there for 30+ years and we chatted away when we arrived early for our reservation. As she checked my ID she said "hon, I graduated high school before you were born". We were having a great time just talking to them drinking and nibbling on trail mix. Dinner was great too! The cheesey bread they bring you when you sit down was delicious. We wanted to get more but someone at our table informed us that we had soup, salad, and dinner coming and there was no way we would finish everything if we kept eating bread. Reluctantly, we agreed. We were clearly the youngest people in there being in our 20s. That definitely added to the 'old school italian' place theme. Don't go if you are looking for the trendy new moden italian restaurant. I prefer classic italian dishes when my italian tastes are going and Sabatino's did not disappoint. I'm also a sucker for apple desserts and the one I had was amazing. The caramel sauce used makes me drool to this day. I would love to go back sometime soon...
