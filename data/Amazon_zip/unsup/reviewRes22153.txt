Yes yes yes yes! I took all of my ordering tips off yelp and they were spot on. Potato tacos with this great slaw side? Check. Empanadas of all sorts? Crispy, yummy check. Oatmeal shake? ohhhhhh yeeeaaaah. Check. Good value? CHEEEECK. AND they're on grub hub, so I've had it delivered too. My one qualm... during the winter, the door to the patio SLAMS anytime anyone walks into or out of the restaurant. Sit far as far from that patio door as possible!!!
