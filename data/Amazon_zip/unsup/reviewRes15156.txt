suspend 21st century reality. seriously, esp. now that como inn has closed, eating here is the closest i come to memories of dining out italian with my family in the "old days"; lotsa dining space, white tablecloths, intimate cubby holes, kind of like italian village, but cozier. strolling violin and guitarist, and a waitress with a scar on her cheek that begs of a back story. and sooooo much food; gratis pizza bread, huge loaf of crusty bread, soup, and salad, and entree. prosecco for 6.50, affordable reds and whites. for some reason i've always come here alone, so i've never tried the appetizers. last night's special was a mini pumpkin stuffed with scallops, they also list an artichoke heart/seafood combo, plus my old standby, escargots. i'm figuring the only way to do it is to go and order only appetizers so i can sample, tapas style. and oh yeah, dessert, since i'm too full for that also. the maitre'd and the desk greeter both came by mid meal to smile and greet me again, and my server was attentive and just the right amount of friendly. spinach gnocchi with asparagus for an entree, with a glass of pinot noir, and i exited once more into the attached parking lot in a food stupor, with a shopping bag full of memories.
