I've been here quite a few times with people from work and it's always just ok. I like how the deep dish pizza has a lot of cheese but it's not the best cheese, the sauce is pretty bland, and the crust isn't very good. I've had the veggie deep dish twice and both times I really disliked it beause the veggies did not taste fresh at all. The pepperoni deep dish is probably the best bet. And the appetizers are pretty standard. If you live in Chicago I think you should definitely go there once or twice but there's much better deep dish pizza out there that is less bland. If you really like deep dish check out Lou Malnati's -- their crust is amazing and their cheese & sauce is much better.
