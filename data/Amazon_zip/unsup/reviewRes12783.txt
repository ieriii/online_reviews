I went there on a Sat nite. The wait was about an hour, no complaints and it was expected. My buddy and I waited at the bar and had a Mojito. The Mojito was pretty watered down and flat. Sugar water doesn't quite impress me. For the appetizer we had the cuban pork on polenta, I forget the name but that pretty much sum it up. For dinner I had the blackened duck and my buddy had the pistachio crusted chicken breast. Both dishes weren't anything to write home about and left me somewhat unsatisfied. I've been there long ago, 6 yrs maybe, and thought the place was great. Either my palate has changed or the place as become more generic it's probably a place I won't return to. There are better cuban places out there for the same buck.
