Perfect place to stay while hitting up the museum scene in downtown Chicago. The accomadations were clean and very chic and the staff was polite and friendly. The hotel itself was HUGE. Ate at one of the restaurants one night and was very pleased. Would definitely plan a second trip to this South Loop hotel.
