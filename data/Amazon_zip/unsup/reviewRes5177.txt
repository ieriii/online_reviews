I actually ate here last month but it completely slipped my mind to write a review about how great the food was! We went there around 6pm on a Monday and the wait wasn't too long for a table for two. We had our choice of where to sit but I thought sitting at the "chef's table" right next to where they cook would be interesting. It was nice seeing everything being prepared but I DO think you get a bit more of the food smell on your clothes so that might be something to think about. We ordered a bottle of red wine and now onto the food... It's great that they serve small dishes. I love trying a bit of everything so this is perfect! Some dishes that stuck in my mind after all this time are the Prosciutto Bread Balls, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs smear, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and the Wagyu Sirloin Tip. They also have a nice selection of cured meats and cheese (which I'll just have to try next time). I will DEFINITELY be going back again, although this might be a restaurant I visit only once in awhile as a indulgent treat. Eating there too often might affect your waistline ;) I would recommend smaller groups and going earlier in the evening if you don't want to wait too long.
