This place used to be my go to lunch place. But the quality of food as well as the quality of customer service seems to have really gone down hill. The customer service isn't horrible, the people aren't mean, they just aren't knowledgeable of their own restaurant. The one girl that had her shit together must not work here anymore, haven't seen her. Guess I'll stick to potbelly for lunch.
