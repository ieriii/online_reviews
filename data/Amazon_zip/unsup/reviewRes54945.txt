Bonsoiree is absolutely the most delicious place to eat in the city, hands-down! Every dish is absolutely delectable, unique and put forth with the most beautiful presentation. The atmosphere is wonderfully intimate, the best place for a romantic evening for two. The staff is warm and friendly, and the service is impeccable. And to top it all off, the desserts are absolutely mindblowing! (The green pistachio pyramids are the most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my life.) If you want an unquestionably perfect meal, then Bonsoiree is the place to go.
