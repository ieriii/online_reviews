Atmosphere was nice, the tile murals on the wall are a nice touch. The food lacked any flavor, the meat was cooked well, not at all aromatized. We used a http://restaurant.com certificate; it seemed like once the server knew she had the 18% tip in the pocket, she forgot about us. She was not rude, but she was not attentive at all. We had to keep getting other servers to get her for us. She kept forgetting parts of our order, not replenishing drinks and never once checked in on us. I wouldn't go back again because the food was not what I expect from a Persian place. Otherwise I do believe the service experience would have been better if we had a different server. Others seemed to be doing a good job. There is a large staff at the restaurant.
