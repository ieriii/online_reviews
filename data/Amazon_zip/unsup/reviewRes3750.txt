This food is super addictive. The Seoul Sassy is my favorite; it's sweet and has just the right amount of sauce. Also, the BBQ is good if you're looking for a little heat. I also tried the Baby Buddha which which I like because it fills you up, but doesn't leave you feeling uncomfortably full. My only complaint about Crisp, and the reason they got 4 instead of 5 stars, is that the people who take orders are pretty unhelpful and rude. They try to rush you off the phone and they aren't too happy about answering simple questions, but besides that I love their food.
