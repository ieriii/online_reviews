Lovely place for a summer lunch while on the river terrace. It was busy and the service kept up reasonably well, but they forgot to bring us more of the little toasts with one small dish (which should have had more of the toasts in the first place) and after two attempts we gave up. They apologized but did nothing to compensate for that lapse. Yet overall, we loved the food and atmosphere and shall return.
