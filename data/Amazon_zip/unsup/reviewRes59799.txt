The pizza is good. I will concede that. My issue is with the delivery - we have waited an exceedingly long time for delivery on more than one occasion. The first instance, we were quoted a hour - it took 3 hours to get our pizza. Three hours. Several months later, we tried again. Again, a quote of one hour. The delivery took 2 hours. After calling several times and getting the run around, our pizza did arrive, cold. Not a fan.
