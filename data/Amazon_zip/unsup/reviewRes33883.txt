I'm a fan! I never enjoyed breakfast like this. Great food and service. No way could be compared to denny's or IHOP. I'm not a fan of vegetarian breakfast but the Cajun "Shroom Scrambler" is the Best. It has grilled portabello shroom and some mixed veggies on it. You'll be suprised for this breakfast dish. It's AMAZING! I recommend for everybody if you want a GREAT reasonably prized breakfast or even BRUNCH. Just be ready to line up the door because the place gets really packed specially if it falls on a weekend.
