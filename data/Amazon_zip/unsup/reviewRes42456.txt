I would have to say I come to this spot monthly w/my husband & 2 kids and the pho never disappoints. We always order the pho special, which is my husbands favorite, and its a huge bowl of noodles filled w/meaty goodness. But the pho isn't the only good thing on the menu, I also enjoy the bung bo hue (not sure how to spell it) which is a spicy soup served w/big chunks of pork meat (and the really tasty fatty part), it comes w/spaghetti type rice noodles and also blood pork but you can always order it without (I love it and grew up w/it =). The pork w/rice dish is also a good choice, it comes w/a side of soup and fish sauce which you can use to dip the meat in and it comes w/various delicious combos you can choose from. If you like fish sauce there is a dry vermecilli (noodle) dish which comes in different combos(beef, pork, shrimp, etc) which is served w/sliced cucumbers, bean sprout, lettuce and etc. and you eat it by pouring the sauce over it and mixing it, its delicious in my opinion but might be an acquired taste if you don't like fish sauce. Its not a hole in the wall or even upscale, overall its just a place you go to have good, fresh tasting vietnamese cuisine.
