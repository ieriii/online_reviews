I'd say this was a 4 star restaurant though I had a 3.5 star experience. Good wine selection and good food selection, but I'd recommend tryin some of the stuff others have recommended. We went a little off the beaten track and didn't like all of the stuff we ordered. Some were GREAT. Others were just Meh. I can't remember now what we got but it's an uber trendy joint, and I'd recommend to try. Does get a little loud. Very unique dishes and some are executed very well. Can't go wrong with that!
