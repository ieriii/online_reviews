davanti enoteca let me count the ways i love you! 1.) affordable wine selection 2.) truffle egg toast 3.) roasted corn & arugula salad 4.) risotto with egg yolks 5.) gelato my husband and i went here in mid November and had a great dining experience! ended up eating at the bar as there was a 1.5 hr wait & my husband snagged some seats for us. eating at the bar ended up being a blast. chatted with strangers waiting for tables and got to take in the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. our service was very pleasant and the food...WOW! as mentioned above. i cannot wait to go back!!
