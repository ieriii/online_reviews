Disclaimer--I don't drink beer. But I have friends who drink beer. Hence my presence at Revolution. A solid 3-star choice for me. The service was okay. The atmosphere was okay. The food was okay. Let's start with the atmosphere. I loved the creative use of materials and the light fixtures. Very attractive. But the booths are a little odd. I felt like we were the only ones in the restaurant. We couldn't see anyone else. Great if you're on a date but kinda not so great if you like to people watch. It was a little isolated. Then there's the food. I agree with the other reviewers, don't come here thinking you're going to be ordering anything low-cal or low-fat. You are going to leave here feeling like a bloated, bloated mess. Like "ugh, what have I done to my body." Bacon fat and shredded cheese on popcorn...need I say more? Actually, there are a few healthier choices on the menu but the choices everyone seems to rave about are the more indulgent ones. My recommendation? If you're going to have something fatty, balance it out with some of the less artery-clogging items on the menu like the mussels or a salad and you'll be a lot happier. (And healthier.)
