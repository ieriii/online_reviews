I've eaten my share of Ethiopian food, and Demera is among my personal favorites. My mother was recently visiting from Los Angeles, so I took her and a friend down to this Uptown gem for dinner. While lunch is a better value, dinner was reasonably priced, the wine was surprisingly palatable and affordable, and the service (per usual) was delightful. I recommend getting the messob sampler so that you get to try a little of everything. My favorites are the ye-mesir wot (spicy red lentils), shiro (lentils with ginger and other spices), ye-dnichena carrot alicha (spiced potatoes and carrots), and doro wot (spicy chicken drummettes) (**and yes, I had to look up the names on their website**). The food is consistently fresh and the spices from the food and tea dance on your tongue. Their injera is among the best I've had; it is moist and spongy without too much sourness (which can ruin injera for me). Overall, a lovely dining experience, one not to be missed by Chicagoans and visitors, alike.
