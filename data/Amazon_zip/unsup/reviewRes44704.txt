Oh baby, thinking about the deep dish makes me hungry right now. I can still taste the tomato sauce, the cheese and the yummy delicious crust. My friend and I made a point to stop here after doing the museum and shopping...it takes about 35 minutes to cook a small deep dish and we waited patiently. Our server in the bar was super cool and was kind enough to take pictures for us. The pizza totally lives up to the hype. It's damn good. We ate here around 445pm....but we only ate one slice each because we had 930 reservations at Charlie Trotters....such good pizza to go to waste. So, knowing that we wouldn't eat the rest in our hotel later, we boxed that baby to go, just to give it to a bum outside somewhere. Sure enough, as we walked out and walked towards Michigan Ave a bum asked "do you have any food to spare" - not "do you have spare change"! What a smart bum!!
