I too went to the Mayan Palace as recommended by Yelpers. I wasn't disappointed at all. It didn't hurt that it was around 3pm, it was beautiful day and the sun was beaming in on us making us all warm and fuzzy. All that aside, yes, the margaritas will curl your toes! I came home after eating a marvelous chicken chimichanga with a heavy duty buzz still on. (In the middle of the day, yikes, I know...) I will go there again. The drinks, food and service were above par. Like with many places you pay WAY more for the drink (i.e. margarita $9, chimichanga $6.75) The patio is open for the summer if you that tickles your fancy.
