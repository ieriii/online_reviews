Went here to celebrate a birthday on Saturday. Arrived at 5:45, granted only half our party was there, but we still had to wait.... OVER 2 HOURS! Eek! So finally sometime after 8 the people at the table they had decided was the only one for the 8 of us.... (geese, give us some other table that opens up!) we got sat in the oyster bar.  2 free apps was so nice! Much needed after that kind of wait. There was a hot and cold platter and while everything went flying off of it as there were 8 of us, it was good. Crabcakes: very good Calamari: very nicely done Mini chunks of lobster and king crab: cant screw up cold seafood... Spring roll: nah... Oyster Rockefeller: didn't snag one, looked good! Lobster Bisque: salt fest, no lobster chunks, skip it! Lobster roll: Pretty small which Im thinkin is par for the course, but had a funky taste I couldn't put my finger on and didnt care for....spoiled mayo? $22 bucks?? Skip it
