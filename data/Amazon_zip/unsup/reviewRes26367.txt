The pineapple mojito was off the chain!!! The best I ever had. The lamb chops were out of this world!! Our waitress (african american lady) was very nice and helpful, but the hostess was very snobby and rude! If I ever go back it would be for the mojito and the lamb chops. Everything was so expensive and so small. The salad was a few twigs of tumble weed with nasty cheese. If you can find another place to eat its only worth their lampchops and mojitos.
