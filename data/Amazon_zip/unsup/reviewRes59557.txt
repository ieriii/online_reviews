i was here earlier with my family and the food was delicious! the service was good too. the waitresses were not rude. they greeted us when we got in and said goodbye when we left. i will be coming here again with the rest of my family and friends.my first time coming and eating korean food. gotta say it was pretty good!con: don't like their parking lot. its so tight! this lady couldn't get her car out so i had to move my car so she could eventually leave. she scraped someone's truck and just left. my sis and i had to navigate her so she wouldn't do too much damage to other peoples cars
