Great dinner last night at Frontera Grill. From the food to the service, everything was terrific. The drink list is inviting and the drinks live up to the hype. We opted for a number of the small plates that gave us the opportunity to experience more of the food. Our favorites were the Frontera Guacamole, the Classic Queso Fundido, and the Pork Tinga. No room for dessert but there were interesting options. I have been a fan of Rick Bayless for years from his tv appearances. Happy to finally be able to enjoy one of his restaurants.
