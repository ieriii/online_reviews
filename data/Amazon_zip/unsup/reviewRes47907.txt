zed 451...o zed...o i remember when you use to be sal and cavarro...and i remember when you were the hype of all the land with all you can eat meat...and then i remember when no one wanted to go to your restaurant anymore because everyone got a stomach ache from eating 15 cows in sitting for $60+.....well zed you really overdid yourself this time.. skylounge at zed...awesome..this is the place to be seen in the summer...hence you wont see me there..but the one time i did go..it was pretty cool...a little pretentious for my liking but still very cool... food...very culinary here..i dont have to worry about eating 15 cows anymore...i can have fish, chicken, an unreal salad bar, a whole bunch of sides on my table..and a great wine selection and even some creative drinks...i came here for fathers day and they even had specials being passed around...i mean who doesnt want the zed verison of chicken wings and waffles...and you can even ask for my main main devin who cooks it up here...he is top of the line...devin a big shout out to you working at zed.. not sure how long this place will be around though..i guess we are in some sort of recession or something..whoops...but hey...check this place out and you will be in for a great time..the bar even has pretty awesome apps....if you need a ride the zed bus will come and pick you up wherever you are at and then take you wherever you want to go..so feel free to get hammered drunk on that bottle of bordeaux and fill up on all those great dishes on the bar..its worth your last $60 in your pocket
