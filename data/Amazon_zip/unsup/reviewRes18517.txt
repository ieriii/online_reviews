I ordered the Cubana torta, which I was very excited about since the ingredients looked so good. Unfortunately, even though it came with sauce on the side, there was way too much of the chipotle mustard in it, to where I couldn't really taste anything else. Still, it was a good sandwich... I just would have liked to taste the other ingredients more. Also, the pork was a bit tougher than I would have liked. For desserts we shared the churros with chocolate and soft-serve with fruit, both of which were very good.
