Burger-licious is the word that comes to mind when I reflect on my recent visit to Lockdown Bar & Grill - and me-oh-my, the mac & cheese was terrific! Everyone's burger (there were 4 of us) was cooked perfectly to order (medium rare is really medium rare), the service was fast, even on a busy night, and our server (Katie) was entertaining, friendly and very knowledgeable about beer - fermentation & flavoring methods, the different taste notes, ales vs lagers vs stouts...you name it. Seriously, a sweet, attractive girl who know & loves beer - that alone is a reason to make this place a regular haunt, but add in the best burgers in town, good music, tv's.... and Lockdown is our new favorite "guy" spot (goodbye Kuma's). p.s. the "Warden" and "Fat Elvis" burgers blew our socks off - go hungry and you still may need a take-home box.
