My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights last month while we were in town for a wedding. He is a Starwood Preferred Guest, which is a great loyalty program and ensured we had a great room even though we had booked it using hotel points. The rooms and bathrooms were nice and clean and spacious, albeit very standard in the business hotel sense. The staff were helpful and efficient, and it was a great location that allowed us to walk or take a short cab anywhere we wanted to go. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Chicago for work or play. It doesn't exactly burst with personality, but it had everything one could need.
