I don't know why it took me so long to discover this place, but it's wonderful! I've had catering to host several parties from Artopolis, and the guests are always impressed. Lately we've been going there for coffee and dessert late-night, or to grab a quick lunch. Every employee there is very kind as well. Some of my family's favorites include the spinach pie, the salads, and the yogurt mousse cakes from the pastry section.
