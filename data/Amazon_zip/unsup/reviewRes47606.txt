I've been here twice in the last week for a wedding and my roommate's birthday. I must say, it's not bad, but it's not amazing. The service is good initially, but there were many times during the 2nd half of the meal when nobody had any food on their plates. And yes, we had our little rocks out in front of us to let the staff know we are still hungry. The buffet portion where you get your own food is just okay. I think I prefer Texas de Brazil and Brazzaz more. The chef's selection of meats were very delicious, but for some reason, I felt every time they came around to me, all the meat was gone. The crab cakes were below average though. It was a bit too soggy for my preference. Ambiance is great. Go upstairs to hang out on the rooftop for some drinks. The entire staff is very friendly. Expect to pay $48 plus tax, tip, and drinks.
