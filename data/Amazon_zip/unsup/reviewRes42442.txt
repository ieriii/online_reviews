this is my daddy's noodle soup! (my dad can eat this stuff day and night, every day). first time i went here, service was horrendous. i'm a seasoned asian cheap-eats person with low service expectations and was still very frustratied. it must have been a fluke thing cause the good beef noodle soup had me coming back and the service is actually par to above-par for cheap-eats. i'm a very discriminating avocado shakes person and it made the grade.....tied with hai yen....or possibly better....? vietnamese iced coffee is not so good here though. hai yen and most others make it better.
