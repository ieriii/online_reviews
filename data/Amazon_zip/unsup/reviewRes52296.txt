Okay, so here is the deal. If you don't like deep dish, this place isn't for you. For the non-natives out there....I like it when we get out-of-town guests that want to eat here. This is what separates Gino's from the rest of the deep-dish joints.............the sausage patty pizza...............I don't care about the rest....My suggestion..go during off-peak times. Waiting for a couple of hours for any pizza will piss you off.  But yeah, the sausage patty.....no one else has it. And it is the best. Period.
