Deep thoughts are better but is deep pizza dish really better? Alas may be ill equipped or unwilling to submit my answer to this, but Pequod's really helps promote the case for deep-dish. Walk in and it is what one expects a bar, booth tables and a bit dim so one could try to pass it as romantic. Deep dish pizza's come in Small Medium and Large. A Large cheese starts at 15.99 and toppings are a bit steep at $2.50 each. After a decent wait it came, caramelized cheese at the ends, sauce on top and laden with cheese and toppings. What impressed me was the use of spinach as a moisture barrier between the crust and the sauce and cheese. However the sauce was a bit bland, luckily the red pepper, oregano and cheese on the table helped remedy this issue. Garlic powder would have been nice. Overall for Chi town pizza this is my choice.
