At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. I think in general Westins are the best value for your dollar. The Westin Michigan Ave is no different. Its a solid hotel. If you enjoy your heavanly beds and showers, this is a good hotel for you. Be advised though, this hotel has some of the same problems many older hotels have in Chicago. While this property has definately gone through a facelift to renovate both the public spaces and the rooms, you still have some rooms that are very oversized and not furnished with enough furniture. Our room was no exception. However, they attempted to fill the space by marketing it as a Westin Workout room with a stationary bike and some workout equipment in the room. Overall, this hotel is pretty good. Its not as nice as a the four seasons but not as bad as the Palmer House Hilton.
