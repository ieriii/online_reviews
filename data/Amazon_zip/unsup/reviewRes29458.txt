Going to Thailand destroyed my ability to enjoy Thai food in the midwest. This includes Thai Lagoon which use to be my favorite. Until I discovered Opart. O.K. they can't replicate the hot red chili squid pan fried on the ground off the alley of a crowded Bangkok street on a 100 degree day. But their red chili squid is a hot damn good substitute! And being in the midwest slowly drains the adventurousness out of my soul so even if Opart did have those amazing fried in oil, lime, and chili powdered grass hoppers and scorpions-add black pepper that I had in Chiang Mai, I might not even try them! And while their Tom Yum Goong is not as good as the stuff I brought( and ate )along side Thai soldiers on the Thai/Myanmar jungle boarder, served in half coconut shells with a wooden spoons( you had to give them back when done) by an ancient women who ladled it from a kettle on her donkey pulled cart. But again they have a great substitute, and do try the ground spicy chili chicken. Yes, this is the closest you're gonna get to the real deal! And for you lame midwesterners, yes they have cashew chicken and pad thai for your bland, budlite, timid unimaginative taste buds. But here's a better suggestion, why go at all? Go to the Thai place next door because If I hear you order that at Opart then I'm gonna make fun of you and those that I dine with are of the same mind so they will too! p.s. Its BYOB but the coolest bar/ liquor store is right next door
