Yea! A wonderful evening and food made up for last night's disappointment, and was a perfect meal to celebrate my dad's birthday. We had a wonderful assortment of dishes, from the cheese, to the short ribs, and arroz. Some yummy sangria to start things off and wonderful desserts (sorbet and ice cream with a candle for dad's birthday and the croquettas) to finish everything off.
