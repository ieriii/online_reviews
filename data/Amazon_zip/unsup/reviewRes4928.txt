Worst service ever! We were on waiting list on Monday nite, told it would take about 40min to get a table but ended up waiting an hour and twenty minute!!! While we were waiting outside patio, I found other ppl who came later than us were called to get in earlier....I was suspecting something is not right after waiting over an hour...walked in front desk and asked how long should we wait then a waitress said they are cleaning up our table so one more min...but apparently they didn't call us another 15min. Walked in and asked one more time...at the moment I saw the lady who's hiding waiting list from me...I have asked to see the list who gets the table and who are still waiting and found they served people came behind our list first and lie to us. She made lame excuse over and over.... Figured they intentionally served other ppl first and push us later...messy, rude freaking 'PIG' restaurant waitresses. Such an unpleasant experiences. In the end of the day, food wasn't worth for and hour and half waiting time outside of cold. Definitely over rated place...if you believe long line up guarantee better taste, rethink one more time. Seems like this place just abuse line up for showing off...
