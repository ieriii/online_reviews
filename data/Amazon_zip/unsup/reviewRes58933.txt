I received some promo card that Sunda is now open for lunch. Hey, any new river north lunch area is great, so I tried it out with some colleagues yesterday. When we walked in, we were greated by a friendly hostess at an awkard host stand, told her we were three people to become four. We were seated at a hard to get to table, but hey, its lunch, whatever goes goes. The decor was great, but they needed more noise reduction material, I had to shout accross my 2 foot table to talk to everyone, and the place was only half full. Our server was very lax. It took him about 10 minutes to get our drinks, and another 15 to take our order - not good in a business district lunch spot. We ordered sushi to not waste any more time. When the fourth member of our party joined, it took 8 minutes (timed) to just get water...no menu...I had to walk to the front after 20 minutes to get her a menu, and then our server (who was leaning against the wall for most of the time) finally came over and took her order. LAME. There were plenty of staff, but most weren't doing anything - busser, food runner, server...and more. Why did it take so long to get served?on the other hand, the sushi was amazing. I had 'the golden child' mango and other good stuff in there, very good. A bit over priced, but its all about location, right? In generaly, not pleased, maybe I'd go back for take out, but never to be served by these people again (or not be served as the case may be). I can get sushi of only slightly less quality at tokyo lunch box, and don't have to deal with the terrible service.
