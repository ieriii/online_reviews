The food? Pretty great. I had an out-of-this-world salad with chicken, mint leaves, couscous, pistachios, and other delectable ingredients that just completely hit the spot. My dining companion had the duck confit pizza and had wonderful things to say about it. The beer? Eh. I've had better - and more original - microbrews. But it was tasty enough. The wait? Outrageous. We showed up at 6 pm on a Saturday, thinking we had cleverly beat the crazy 7-10 Chicago dinner rush. We could not have been more wrong. We waited almost an hour (which, I'll hand it to them, is exactly what they said the wait would be). But we could hardly hear our own thoughts being thunk over the loud music and the roar of the crowd. The verdict? Try it, but be prepared for ambivalence.
