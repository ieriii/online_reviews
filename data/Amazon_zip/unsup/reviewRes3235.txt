A friend told me about this place but I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant. Not sure why.. I like wings and I like Korean food so you would think that it would be a win win. I started with the Buddha Bowls, lots of fresh veggies and yummy sauces. I always add the steak and wish that it came in bigger pieces but it is still really good. After ordering with them a few times I finally decided to try the chicken and OMG! It was absolutely amazing. I got 10 wings in 2 different flavors. The wings were huge and the order of 10 wings lasted me for 3 meals. The flavors were really amazing.  I have used both pick up and delivery and both are really fast. The few time that I had them deliver the drivers were always super nice and they ride their bike to my house! Extra props to Crisp for that!
