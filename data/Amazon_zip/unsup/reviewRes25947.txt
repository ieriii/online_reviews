Ok, so I lied -- this is now my final update. Pequod's, we Love your pizza, both thin crust and pan, with a capital L. Pequod's, we Hate that you screw up our order every single damn time.  We stopped ordering for a long while since my last update, but gave in because we missed your pizza so much. Damned if you didn't go and screw it all up again tonight, now for maybe the last time. Seriously -- pizza is not like building the space shuttle, nor should be running your business after all this time, but apparently it is. We're back up to 5 or so times in a row of the order being wrong, so it looks like we're going to have to find a new place for pizza. Thanks. Some tips: make adjustments in your POS so the notes are clear to the kitchen; if the kitchen can't read tickets make sure you teach them; have your phone order takers read the order back to us to clarify; and lastly, don't even try to argue with us or blame us if the order is incorrect. We know what we ordered because we know what we like to eat. Jeez, Pequod's, really. Get it together.
