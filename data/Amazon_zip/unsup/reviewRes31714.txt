I'd been here a couple of times and thought the food, atmosphere and service were great. Fast forward to my most recent time: I'd recently developed a full blown intolerance to gluten. Eating out is a challenge, and I keep things very simple which means I feel good but am bored. Then I went to Sunda a couple of weeks ago for a group dinner - meaning all of the food was pre-set. I asked the waiter (English guy - fabulous) to alert me to which of the dishes we'd be eating had gluten. He went all out - letting me know what I could or couldn't eat, bringing me special things - unasked for/uncharged - to supplement when there was a course I couldn't eat. This was above and beyond since there was plenty I could eat, but he made sure they made a special salad and dessert for me. Most importantly, the food was fabulous. The rest of the table loved their experience too - fantastic food, service and fun ambiance.
