I've gone to India House about 6-8 times so far. The prices are high but typical of any indian restaurant. I usually get the chicken makhani and it is very good. What I don't like about this restaurant is the poor service. Even though it seems like they are over-staffed, no one would come over and see if we needed anything or refill our water. I found that very odd!  I have gone there twice for the lunch buffet. I believe it's about $14. The selection is decent and it is always crowded.  You might want to try Klay Oven, which is on Franklin/Hubbard. I like that place better
