Though neither of us is vegan or even vegetarian, my husband and I have wanted to try this place for months. Everything on the menu sounds pretty delicious, so it took a while to decide.  We ended up with Nachos- Even with vegan everything, they're fantastic. I didn't know how I'd feel about vegan "cheese," but it was really tasty. We both devoured everything. Even the sour cream is very convincing-- my husband asked how it's made and our server found out the brand and ingredients for him. BBQ "Bacon" Cheezeburger- This is where they lost a few points. The sandwich was really yummy.. for the first few bites. Then, it started tasting too sweet. The portions are pretty huge and it got overwhelming pretty quickly. Also, the burger, as is common with any vegetable based burger, fell apart as soon as I took a bite. I gave up on eating it as a burger and ate it with a fork. The "bacon" was interesting--tasty, but not bacon. (I admit, pork keeps me an omnivore.) Mashed potatoes and gravy- yummy. Heavy for lunch, but that was my mistake. Reuben- Husband loved it.. and he's a reuben purist. He said the texture was pretty spot on to be an imitation. He also said the sauerkraut wasn't as sour as he likes, but that's probably because he's German. (His works, not mine. ) Mac and Cheeze- We both liked it. It was really good. The pickles they serve are pretty yummy, too. Overall, it was a really good meal.  It was a little heavy for lunch, but that's because we chose heavy items. We'll definitely go back-- we want to try some pastries and the shakes. All of the burgers were really tempting. You should go try it-- especially if you're not vegan/vegetarian. Honestly, the "chorizo" from the nachos is convincing enough that you probably wouldn't know it wasn't meat without being told.
