OVER RATED. am i getting old, cuz i don't see why this place is so trendy. the kalbi portions are TINY. yes, there are a lot of side dishes, but why pay a premium for a tablespoon of different sides, when you can go to a korean restaurant along bryn mawr (near kimball) and get double the amount of meat - and better service?! korean bbq is korean bbq guys - this place is not that great, full of douchebagy yuppies who never experienced cooking at the table before, waxing poetic about meat. i'll give them credit - their venting system is better than most places. and yes, the million little sides are great. but this place is over priced for their quality. try other korean bbq places, and you'll know what i'm talking about!
