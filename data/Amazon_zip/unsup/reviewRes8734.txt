The food is good. I mean average good. Hummus was a little too cumin(y) but that is fine. Pita's are absolutely fresh. Kebob entree's are extremely large. Big, midwestern portion large. Dill rice is not what I expected but was good. Everything we had was good. When our entree's arrived we asked for tahini or cucumber sauce for the kebob which is customary with these dishes (at least to my knowledge as I have always been served some variation of this sauce with this type of entree) and the waitress said they did not have tahini but a cucumber yogurt sauce? No problem, I am always up for a variation on a good idea. Their version of the sauce was actually pretty good, it came out in a bowl about the size of what I would eat oatmeal out of. (This is actually an important detail even though it seems irrelevant). Eating, eating. Yummy, yummy. Box up the rest, too much, want to eat later. Check please.....WTF???? $5.95 for something with a name in what I assume to be Farsi and I cannot pronounce it so we ask the waitress and she says it was a charge for the yogurt sauce that was considered a 'salad' and NOT a condiment that came with the entree. Really? That could not have been 6 bucks worth of yogurt sauce. Seriously. Outrageous. Of course we asked her to remove the charge as she did not tell us it was an appetizer or even something we would be charged for. I can chock this up as a miscommunication but will never make that mistake again. May or may not come back. It was good. Again, good.
