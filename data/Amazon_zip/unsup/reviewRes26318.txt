I'm surprised at how crowded this place was for a weekday night, i think it was a wednesday night. PACKED PACKED PACKED! I was craving some good Pho (coming from los angeles, where i can get the best pho ever) and was excited by the location and the promises of good pho. Okay, the pho was decent not good. the ban mi sandwich was average...it wasn't made in the traditional way. also, i got the veggie spring rolls and it wasn't served in the traditional way with lettuce to wrap up the egg rolls.  Overall, i'd say it is above average. It is good in a pinch if you are just craving some vietnamese food. but i have to say that i don't understand what the hype is about.
