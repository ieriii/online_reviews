Fondue requires a patient patron, and Geja's is no exception. The atmosphere is dark and the booths are private, great for dates. If you're willing to drop some dough, you can really get the full experience of what is possible with fondue. Each piece of fondue tastes different than the one before it. The first time I ate here, we were seated instantly for a work Christmas party, but in times i've been since, the waits can be long on busy nights. Their alcohol selection is great, and reasonably priced.  A great combo for a Park West concert and a tasty meal!
