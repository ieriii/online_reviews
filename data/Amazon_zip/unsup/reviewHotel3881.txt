Beautiful hotel coupled with unprofessional and inattentive staff equals pretty vacant experience. We stayed in the standard room which still afforded ceiling to floor glass windows, beautiful glass showers, and city views in this newer high rise hotel in downtown Chicago. Really the only negative was the unprofessional staff. Several times during the stay there was no hot water. Apparently they were having a hot water problem and the engineering staff had no clue what they were doing. He came into the room, tested out the shower and said, "you're right there is no hot water and I have no idea why but it should be fixed in a few hours." The manager who sounded like he was in his 20s, very inarticulate and unhelpful promised a discount for a future stay which never came into fruition. A frustrating experience not having hot water, not being able to shower at your convenience, showering in different hotel rooms and empty promises from unprofessional, incompetent, juvenile staff put a damper on what could have been a perfect experience. Additionally, skip the mediocre over-priced food in their restaurant and room service.
