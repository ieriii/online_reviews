Easily the best brunch I've had in a LONG time. $29 dollars seems a little steep, until you taste the level of food being served here. Favorites were: the cajun bacon, cinnamon buns, duck confit hashbrowns and the braised turkey breast. Food is served like the Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, type restaurants, so be prepared to get stuffed! Love it, ZED451, don't change a THING.
