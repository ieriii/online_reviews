So, here's the thing- sometimes I feel like the Chicago Diner is too hyped up and that there are other great vegetarian/vegan restaurants that are overshadowed by the Diner. But then I go there and remember why they're so hyped up. Yes, sometimes I feel like their food is a little bland, and many times, I feel like I can't justify spending the money (I'm a cheap twenty-something), but in the end, these guys know what they're doing. The fact that they've been around for 25+ years is proof enough that they're worth the hype. Some highlights: * Fantastic staff- really fun, super nice, great people. I got take out yesterday and saw two of the servers dancing along to Amy Winehouse behind the counter. Good times. * THE BEST VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES EVER.  Buy them here fresh instead of at Whole Foods. * Along the same lines- Chocolate chip cookie dough peanut butter milkshake. 'Nuff said. Yesterday I tried a salad for the first time (I usually go for a more traditional entree), and feel head over heals for their Green Machine salad. Seriously, everyone should try it. So, in the end- this place still rocks the house, even if they are sometimes over-hyped and I feel like sometimes other vegan/vegetarian joints in the city do things better. These guys are one of the original places, and I think that alone grants them the respect and hype they deserve.
