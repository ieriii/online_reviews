My sister had been going on and on about this place. So when I arrived in Chicago we made a point of swinging by and grabbing a couple of dogs and some fries. I only eat hot dogs in Chicago and these were as good as any I have had. I love the different combinations. However the highlight was the duck fat fries. They were almost good enough to tempt me into moving back to Chicago (almost). If in town or just in the neighborhood, swing by. You can't beat the price and they won't disappoint.
