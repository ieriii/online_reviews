I went for the first time yesterday. I was sort of apprehensive because I was dining by myself (I felt like it was time to treat myself out to a good meal). However, the minute I stepped inside, I was greeted warmly, seated right away, and generally felt welcome. That is really important for any solo diner. I ordered oyster on the 1/2 shell with bin 4 (nv brut). The combination was marvelous. Granted, I've had better oysters, but the ones bin 36 served were still fresh and flavorful (despite being really small). For my second course, I had blini lentil crepes with candied veggies? Well, the combination was amazing and the bin 23 (a riesling) went really well with the meal. For dessert, I had the caramel creme brulee with the 2005 dark muscat quady electra. The meal totaled $60 including tax and tip. Not expensive considering the fantastic three course meal, and three different wines to accompany it.
