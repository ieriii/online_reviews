We came here late one Friday night, so obviously there was a wait. Having been a hostess myself for a long time, I took their host's estimate of a 30 minute wait with a grain of salt. To my terrific surprise, we were seated in about 30 minutes! We were even seated outside! Our server was fast and friendly. The food was fresh and simple, the fried plantains are a must. I had the Vegetarian salad which is splashed with olive oil, vinegar and lime juice. I feared it would be bland but it was actually delicious. I loved their prices, they fit right into my measly budget. They had great music and lots of Latino fabulousity. The only thing was they are cash only, but they have an ATM right inside to the rescue!!!
