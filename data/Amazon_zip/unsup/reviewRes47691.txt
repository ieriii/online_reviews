I have no idea about the food, but wow this is a great rooftop. The party I was at had sliders and small plates, but I don't think (and I hope) this isn't the normal Zed451 fare. None of it was bad, but very bland and forgetful. The best of the sliders was a veggie burger, which is odd for a steakhouse. But who cares when you've got that great patio. It's modern-rustic, if that's even a thing. If there was a Paul Bunyan-themed Vegas resort, this would be the pool cabana area.
