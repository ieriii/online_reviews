You lose a star--and should probably lose 2--for the rude host. Stopped by last night for dinner at about 6:50 & a server said "Hi" as he passed & let us know the host would be with us in a moment. It was very busy, and a minute later when the host approached he simply said "Name?" Too busy for pleasantries, I guess. "Gina. How long is the wait for 2?" "45 minutes." "Wow! I was hoping to miss the rush--guess not." "(Scoff) Then you'd have had to come at 5." "I just didn't expect it to be so busy." "Well EVERYBODY ELSE is HUNGRY like YOU." It wasn't yelling...it was just rude. I'd use italics if I could. Anyway, I turned & just walked out. What a turn from from the normal stellar service I'm accustomed to receiving there. I haven't been there in maybe 3 months & I've never seen that guy before, so maybe he's new, but if he's gone next time I'm there, you may get your 5th star back.
