You'd think the place would be full of slack jawed hipsters waiting to make fun of your Dockers all-weather jacket. You might be right, but you'd never notice because this "speakeasy" never lets itself get too crowded. Even better, you can hold a conversation without screaming. The drinks are great! Food is so-so, service is alright, ambiance is a little heavy-handed (but it works). Go on a weeknight for maximum enjoyment.
