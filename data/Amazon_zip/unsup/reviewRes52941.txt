I've been here a couple of times so far. Maybe it's me, but nothing has ever really stood out as being "omgicantbelievehowamazinglydeliciousthisis" good. Don't misunderstand, the food is good, but not amazing, and by no means is it the best cuban food ever. I like the space well enough, and it's nice to have a patio feel even in the dead cold of winter. The staff has always been polite bordering on pleasant. Basically this is not my favorite place but not a bad choice for the neighborhood. Oh, and a can of coke, a CAN, should never be over $1.00, much less closer to $2. And if you are going to charge that much, at least bring me a glass of ice to go with.
