Chicago is lucky to have such a yummy veggie diner. I wish this place was a nationwide chain, even though that would probably diminish the charm. It's just not fair that a place this good is so far away! I had the Philly Cheeze Steak and the seitan, vegan cheese, and bread were delicious. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food as much as me with compliments going to the tempeh based BLT sammy and good soy sausage and biscuits with gravy. Awesome food, but a kind of small location so it can be difficult to get into since it tends to be so popular. I would recommend it to anyone vegan, vegetarian, or carnivore.
