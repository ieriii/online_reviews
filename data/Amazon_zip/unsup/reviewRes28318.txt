*********** 3.5 BUT THERE'S NO HALF STARS **************** WEIRD NIGHT! The food was great let me get that out of the way. The chicken was tender and juicy. It wasn't dried out or reheated in the microwave. The scallops were EXCELLENT! I am not a big seafood person, but these were actually delicious. I enjoyed the presentation of the dishes, including the desert that looked as if it was balancing itself on the plate! The beer list was different- which is a good thing. It also included a couple regular staples. Wines here are plenty, but by the glass, your selection is limited.  As for the place, we went on a weird night. The crowd was weird! We sat by a couple that was groping each other, that at one point, I thought the dude was about to "finish" with the help of his date. Next up, there was a couple hipsters that were in the joint too that would have made someone with a weak stomach squirm. At one point, the female goes FULL FRONTAL into a nose pick with no remorse! The whole time, the dude sitting with her keeps on going with his conversation! After she realized that people were looking, she paused... AND CONTINUED GOING TO TOWN WITH THE RESTAURANT NAPKIN! To add to the weird events of the night, my companion and I were both kinda sick in the stomach the next day. IN NO WAY am I saying it was Graham Elliot's fault, but I rarely eat seafood and I rarely get sick in the stomach... This is a place to pop into again in the near future for a drink or when you're not really hungry. It makes a great place to sit at the bar, especially since the noise level is the same in the dining area or the bar. Keep in mind; fill up on the popcorn since the portions are TINY.
