I have no complains whatsoever about this hotel. I wished we were able to do a late check out but that was the only thing they were not able to accommodate us with since they had other tenants coming in that sunday.  They were kind enough to change our reservations from 3 nights to 2 nights since our flight was canceled the night of in Vegas at no additional fee. This hotel is AWESOME on location! What more can you ask for since its right at the corner of Wabash and the riverwalk! You are only about a block away from the bar/lounges area across the river, towards the Trump tower also! The hotel is also about 1.5 blocks away from CTA, if you are thinking about going to the airport. Very do-able for someone that doesn't like walking either! We upgraded to a river view deluxe king room, which was totally worth it. The view was gorgeous and our bed... omg our bed made us not want to go out since it was so COMFORTABLE! That is the most important thing in a hotel for me, the bed and hotel 71 won me over there. Our room was more than spacious.. more than we could ask for at the rate that we got through travelzoo. I was quite pleased. The hotel itself is a large boutique hotel, with very nice and trendy decor. They have a large office area for customers to use for internet/printing, large gym, and a restaurant/bar named Hoyt's that is open until about 1am everyday. When it comes to reading all about the cons from other yelpers, those cons mean nothing to me since we were mainly outside, discovering Chicago, instead of trying to stay in our room.  We were accommodated with VIP Shedd Aquarium tickets, which saved us so much time with no lines from the hotel.. There's another plus. I am more than happy that I stayed at this hotel on my trip to Chicago and I wouldn't mind coming back with its perfect location of the river and magnificent mile.
