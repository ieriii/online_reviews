My boyfriend demanded I attend a performance by one of his buddies here. It was unspeakable. Offkey Acoustic Singing+ Casio Keyboard+ Thoroughly Serious Demeanor+ Bad Grunge Covers= Boy, you owe me AT LEAST two pairs of shoes to civilly sit thru this... Heck, At least the coffee was good. And I got the cutest pair of pink Coach heels... that blatant bribery is worth an additional star, no?
