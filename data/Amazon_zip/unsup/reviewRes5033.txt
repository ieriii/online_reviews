What a ridiculously amazing place! This has to be the best find for me of 2011 so far. We had wanted to come here for a long time, but finally decided to walk over after Lollapalooza 2011. A huge huge bonus is that the kitchen is open til 12 on weekdays and 1 am Friday and Saturday. I know of no other restaurant in Chicago with this quality of food open this late. This will easily be my go-to restaurant for late-night food. Ambiance and service are both amazing. The place could easily be at home in New York or even Paris. No TV's to be found anywhere thank God! We had an assortment of dishes, and I won't bore you with the details, but everything from the charcuterie to the entrees to the cheeses and desserts were all terrific and well-presented. Portions are perfect too. None of this crazy stuff that's as big as your head! Already can't wait for the next visit!
