Motel 6 quality at Hyatt prices. This Westin has the worst rooms I've ever experienced in a Westin. The bedding hasn't been replaced in 5 years and is beat to heck, the rooms are Tokyo-tiny, and half the rooms in the hotel seem to be located behind the elevator. Sound insulation is also nonexistant. I don't think I got more than 4 hours of sleep any of the 3 nights I was there. Overall, I get the sense that this Westin is around a decade past a need for a general upgrade. The only reasons they get two stars are: the staff was extremely nice and personable, and the conference facilities and catering are quite good.  Overall: attend a conference at the Westin, just don't sleep there.
