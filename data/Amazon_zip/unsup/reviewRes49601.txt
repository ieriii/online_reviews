Nothing special. Really! Went here with my wife after an event at the neighboring hotel. The hostess lead us to the dining room when we requested to sit at the cafe. She said there was only a cheese bar (she was mistaken). Told us the menus were the same (which was a lie as we found out after dinner). I had the steak and it was mediocre at best and slightly overdone. The cheese was good (we had the spanish flight) but it was served on a ceramic floor tile which was a bit freaky... toe jam anyone?
