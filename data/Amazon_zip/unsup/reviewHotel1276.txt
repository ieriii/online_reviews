Service- great! Location-great! Sleeping rooms-great! Bathrooms in sleeping rooms- cramped and outdated. Overall hotel lobby and feel of the property- stone age. Refresh your common space!! My husband and I stay here on his comapny's dime from time to time and we call it "Ritz the pitz" compared to other hotels we've stayed at in the city. Get with the times guys!!!
