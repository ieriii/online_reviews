I was there last week, let me tell you that the food and the service were both exceptional. Really nice restaurant with good food, and as I said before...exceptional service. You need to be red meat eater to truely appreciate this restaurant. They are good for large parties and I recommend that you have reservations, we did and we were seated immediately. The salad bar was ample but seemed to be missing some small things, sorry if mentally I sometimes compare salad bars to Zed's Harvest bar. The service was extremely attentive and friendly, but the meats, poultry and sausage were why I was there, and they were great, and filling which is nice because there were people in our party obviously had they different preferences between the beef, chicken, and pork. I'll be back.
