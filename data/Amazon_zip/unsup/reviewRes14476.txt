I am Cuban. I came to embrace my heritage when I was in school in Miami and I learned a lot (and gained a lot of weight) eating really excellent Cuban food. Chicago has some excellent Cuban food; better than any big city outside of Miami for my opinion. 90 Miles is worthy of your trouble to get there. IT IS FANTASTIC. Their Lechon sandwich will make you cry with joy. Their Congri is fantastic and perfectly seasoned with the beans just the right texture. Their Cafe Cubano is flavored just like the street cafe I used to hit in South Beach. Everything I've eaten there is excellent so far and their shakes are fantastic -- the Guanabana is my favorite. I'll be going there for lunches as long as I have money to spend on lunch.
