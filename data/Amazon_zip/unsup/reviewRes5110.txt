LOVE the Purple Pig. They should open at 11!!! It was fantastic and filled out the door only 20 minutes after opening for the day. I thoroughly enjoyed the Butternut Squash Arancini, and the fresh salad with sunchokes. The 4 of us sat at a group high-top table that had 12 chairs. They sat other people there as well, but we had plenty of space. The fast paced, trendy environment really solidified our downtown, big-city experience. Try the purple pig if you enjoy an eclectic menu and have an interest in gourmet cheeses & intricate piggy dishes.
