Went for dinner last Saturday night with no reservation, and got a table easily. Not a bad restaurant...kind of strip mall-y though. It's in the first floor of a new condo building.  Service was slow as hell, and they apparently lost our order ticket in the kitchen so it took over an hour to get our food. Of course the server did not tell us this because he didn't speak to us or get my second glass of sangria for over 30 minutes.  The food was pretty good when it finally came out, I should say, the meat was good. The sides were eh. Sangria was good and not a bad deal ($4/glass), but I probably won't be back after that service.
