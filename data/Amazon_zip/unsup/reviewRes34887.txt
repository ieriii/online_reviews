There isn't much to say that everyone else hasn't already said but I was very disappointed in Sushi X. I actually enjoyed all the rolls that I ordered, although they were extremely spicy and I love spicy foods but a couple of times I did have to take a break and soothe my mouth with ice water. The seating was eh, we were sat so close to the another party and a sofa against the wall. When we were given the table it was actually missing a chair and I had to stand a good five minutes before I had to ask for a chair myself. Did I mention that two servers walked past me a couple of times while I was standing? And that brings me to the service. Just awful! Ordering our food wasn't the problem nor was the time it took to get our food but it took forever for someone to aknowledge us and bring us drinks. I ended up not leaving the best tip for our waitress and I don't believe she was very happy about that. Oh well. I would go back here again for the half priced rolls that I didn't know about until I read the yelp reviews but it would not be my first choice for dinner if I was craving sushi.
