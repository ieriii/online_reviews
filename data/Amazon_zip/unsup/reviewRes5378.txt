Love this place... everytime I am in Chicago... it is a must go! The atmosphere is infectious, great vibe. Love watching the kitchen do their thing. Wine list is good... food is the highlight. Must have the crispy pig's ear appetizer, as well as the shrimp, goat cheese and pea tendrils appetizer. Really a quaint find just off Michigan Ave. If you get a chance, sit outside if the weather is nice!!!
