Why did I never see you before, Longman and Eagle? Came here for brunch with a friend this morning--and i will definitely be going back. The food is good. and fresh, they go for the farm to table kind of experience. love it. and they have an adorable outdoor patio. the atmosphere is quaint with an upscale vibe. instead of having waiters refill your water, they provide you with a glass bottle with a cork stopper and it's full of cold water so you can refill your cup at your leisure. and they come and switch out the bottles too! if i ever open a restaurant i'm stealing that idea. (shh) Since it was brunch, and we both wanted a little sweet and salty, we split the monte cristo (ham, Gruyere, french toast w/ syrup) and their burger with BEEF FAT FRIES. goodness. The monte cristo's french toast was a little soggy & smushy on the inside, but they provided the perfect amount of maple syrup to go with the saltiness of the ham and the deliciousness of the cheese and the oh so crisp delicate outside of the french toast. delish. plus a side salad of that fancy pretty lettuce. now the burger. ohhh the burger. absolutely delicious aged cheddar, 2 strips of thick bacon, and it all had the awesome charred taste that only comes from being grilled. and the fries had so much flavor! i'm sure that beef fat is making its home in my arteries, but hey, every once in a while, yeah? My friend's in culinary school and he loved this place too. We couldn't decide which dish we liked better, and for a total of $15 a person, I don't think we'll ever have to chose.
