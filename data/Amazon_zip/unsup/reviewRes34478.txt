I live down the street and frequent Yolk pretty often. In the summer the wait can get pretty long, so I recommend getting there early. I've never had lunch here but have had breakfast. It's good, not great, pretty consistent. I usually have the Omelet,, I've also tried their Egg Benedict and it was okay. The portions are pretty big , so make sure you're really hungry! On days that I feel like eating healthy I order their South Beach Delight with a fresh baked muffin, so good! although, I don't think a muffin is healthy, but whatever! They seem to be doing pretty good, they've opened up another location and have added flat screen TVs to the waiting areas...thanks to all of us that eat there :)
