Horrible!!! Do not stay here!I got the hotel on priceline for a good price and had nothing but problems from the beginning. First of all, I called after getting the hotel on priceline to request a non-smoking, king sized bed room. She told me they did not have any king beds, but could give me a non smoking room and negatively refered to the fact i got the room off priceline several times. When we got to the hotel, we asked the man who was helping us at the front desk if there were any king beds and he said he had plenty and switched us. We got into the room, it was VERY small, there was a red stain on the wallpaper on one wall and on the other wall the wallpaper was coming off the wall. The carpet was dirty and we both slipped on the very slippery bathroom floor. I wanted to use the gym, but was told it was $18.00 a day to use it and the internet was another $ 14.00. On top of that, you are charged for parking (either valet or in the garage) by the day (between $40 and $51 dollars a day)!!! They do not validate. This hotel is WAY, WAY overrated!! They nickle and dime you for everything and the rooms are NOT nice or clean. We drove across cou try and stayed in several different hotels during our trip and I have to say this hotel was by far the WORST! My husband and I are both doctors who travel a lot and we will definately not be coming back to this hotel nor will we be recommending it to anyone.
