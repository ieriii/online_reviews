We were lucky to only have to wait 10 min this fathers day! Its usually a long wait since all the tourist like to eat on Michigan. My friend got the eggs Benedict since they said they were known for them, but I've had better... I got the big skillet and they give you a healthy portion of sausages! Every dish is so large! Mine came with pancakes or toast. Pancakes dusted with some powdered sugar was the way to go. You absolutely need too get the feedbag squeezed orange strawberry juice! I wish they gave free refills BC it was so nice and refreshing!! Next time I'll try the omelette!
