My wife and I got married here. Three words: Worth every penny. I can't say enough about the Hotel Allegro staff. Kerry, our events coordinator, made it seems like planning a wedding was a walk in the park. The wait staff had things ready and gave all 150 of our guests the proper food they ordered. The chef was very accommodating to special requests. The wife and I, instead of giving crappy candles or other little trinkets to our guests a favors, decided to give them churros and Jarritos. The kitchen staff had the Jarritos on ice and they made the churros for a marginal price.  My rave review isn't because I'm still high from having an awesome wedding, it's because Hotel Allegro helped us have an awesome wedding.
