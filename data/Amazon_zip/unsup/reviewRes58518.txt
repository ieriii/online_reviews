This may have been my worst experience at a restaurant thus far. For some time I had been dying to go to Frontera with my girlfreind and when the opportunity presented itself I was eager to visit the establishment, having heard so many great things about it. Plus, I love Rick Bayless, his interpretations on some classic dishes which I have found in his cook book are delicious. I also visited his newest eatery, XOCO, and while I enjoyed my food, figured better things were to come from Frontera. So last saturday, five friends and myself went there at 5:30 pm. We put our names down on the seating list and were told to expect a 3 hour wait! We said, hey we are here and we wanna try this place so we spent the time walking around downtown and grabbing drinks. We returned to the restaurant at 7:30pm. The clock stroke 8:30, then 9:00 pm and we had still not been seated; approaching over four hours later we had still not been seated. All that the hostess would say is Sorry we are a little backed up.' Needless to say we were exhausted and very hungry from standing oustide because there is no seating or courteously offered water for those enduring the wait. It didnt help that I was further enraged by people clearly done eating, sitting at tables for over an hour and half while there were many more people still waiting to be seated. Having had enough of the waiting we left at 9:10pm and vowed never to waste 4 hours waiting for food again. WORST SERVICE EVER AND EXPERIENCE. Atleast Rick has a good TV show. No reservation, don't bother. And lets face it, if you are deicated enough to wait 3 hours you better get seated. Thats just as much dedication as making a reservation 3 months in advance. Sorry if Im not sure where I'll be three months from now.
