Once you find the door and get past the curtains, you feel absolutley transported-- there's something a little magical about this place. I love how intimate the tables are-- you feel like you have a private room full of gossip, and secrets, and some of the best drinks ever made.  I tried the Pimm's cup and Hemingway's Daquiri. The Pimm's cup was traditional-- with cucumber, strawberry, and mint. The taste was great-- I just wish 1/3 of the cup wasn't an ice cube. But, I didn't have that problem with Hemingway's Daquiri-- it was like no daquiri I've ever had, and even came with an extra carafe of booze. Yes, these drinks are pricey, but after finishing 2, I was pretty much done for the night. Why not five stars? Well, the food is ok. But, the lighting is so bad, it's kind of hard to enjoy it. If you order food, you should get a couple of extra lights, so that you can actually see what you're eating or that you're up to your elbows in honey after devouring the fried peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwich.
