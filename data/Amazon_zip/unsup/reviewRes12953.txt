Well, we've been to Cafe 28 a few times and always had good experiences, but it only takes one bad experience to ruin it for you. We went there on a Wednesday night a couple weeks back and it was a terrible experience. Everything we had was poorly cooked. To start with everything on our appetizer plate was over-cooked. Their saffron sauce tasted burnt. I had the pork chops and they were tough and the sweet potatoes were cold. My mother had the roast pork and it was flavorless. My wife ordered the halibut and it was over-cooked and by that point she didn't want to try anything else they had to offer. She took one bite of it and was done. The service was poor and at no point did a manager ever come over to check on the problem.  I always heard Monday was the day to avoid at restaurants but apparently it's Wednesday at Cafe 28. We've always had good experiences here but not this time. I doubt we will ever go there again.
