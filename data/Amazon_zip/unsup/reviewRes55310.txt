I took a date to Fogo de Chao for dinner and we had a great time. This is such a unique restaurant, from the amazing salad bar to their coaster signals, which are awesome and fun, to the waiters running around cutting meat right before your eyes. Meat. Mmmm.I think I definitely want to go back here again because the food is so good and the service is awesome. They did mention that lunch is a little less pricey, but who cares? It was an awesome experience, lots of fun, and we left feeling nice and full.
