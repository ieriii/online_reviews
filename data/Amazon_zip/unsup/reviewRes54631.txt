i live just a couple blocks away from this place, and i love it so much i've actually had to make an effort to go there less. i just started yelping today, and this is the first place i could think of. the people who work at sultan's are cool and nice and super quick (though there's one lady there who likes to talk on the phone and take her time which gives me the impression that she's in charge or something---still not bad, just not as responsive as the others). i work nights, so i usually go in a post-work daze pretty soon after they open at 10.their falafel is fantastic and very well priced. their salad bar is so good and, again, well priced. their baklava is super tasty. their meat stuff looks good, but i never get it for some reason---my friends say it's good, too. then, when you go to throw away your trash, you end up sorting it into recycling and compost and don't actually ever put anything into the garbage which feels really great in itself.this all leads me to say... IF YOU ARE EVER HUNGRY IN WICKER PARK, GO TO SULTAN'S!
