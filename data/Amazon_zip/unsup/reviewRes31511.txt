We ate here six months ago, and I had no desire to return. Nothing terrible, but nothing really striking to make me want to return. The others in our party seemed to feel otherwise, and so when they wanted to return, I said, why not. I wish I hadn't. The waiter, very pleased with his future as a sommelier, managed to let an off by-the-glass pour make it to the table. The porterhouse was nicely presented, a true medium rare (more cooked than I like, but at the end of our companions' threshold), but my slices ruined by the scalding plate atop which I placed them. I burnt my mouth on a spoonful of creamed spinach I let sit on my plate for a few minutes. Our waiter's answer was, "Next time ask for cool plates." Cold comfort, to be sure. The others at the table were displeased enough with the steak that they ended up comping it. Is it a silly question to ask that if you're supposed to be not only a top-tier steak place, but the kind of place that charges $22 for cocktails, the kind of place from which few emerge without spending a couple hundred, that you should kind of feel guilty, if not downright negligent, to have to comp a steak, your raison d'etre? I found the waiter's "advice" obnoxious. There won't be a next time to ask for a plate that doesn't fry the steak I ordered at a temperature I expected to be able to have hold long enough to consume. No reason to spend that kind of money in a place like that, just because it's part of a big restaurant group. Their $5 Rosebud burger has more dignity and enjoyment potential..
