Went there this past Saturday and had a blast. The good: The microbrews were excellent! I couldn't stay away from them. Then came the food. We had the goat cheese, which was good. My friend had a really great, fresh tasting salad. We ordered two pizza's one white and one red. Both were equally delicious and both got tumbs up by my 12 picky friends! The live band kareoke was awesome and lots of fun. Also the price to feed and get 12 people drunk was VERY reasonable. So a definate bang for your buck! Oh and finally our waiter was very attentive and kick ass! He was super cool and did an awesome job! (He deserves a waiter of the week award!!!) The bad: The wait for a table. On the phone that day we were told it would probably be a 1 hour wait. However, once we got there we were told 3 hours! We decided to wait being that we had already had our hears set on this place. After about 2.5 hours I went to check with the hostess about our table and she told me that they were looking for our party but couldnt find us and so they moved on! We were at the bar the entire time and made it clear that we would be there, but she said that no one seen us and so she moved on. When she seen that I was mad...she said that I would be the next big table seated. So then we got seated and 6 people from our party still hadnt arrived and the hostess was having a bitch attack over it. I explained to her that they were in the area and would be arriving soon, which is when she informed that she would be seating another party there if company didnt arrive within the next 10mins. I didn't like that at all but luckly everyone arrived and she got off our backs about it. So go for the great beer, food and entertainment. Excuss the bitch ass hostess who has her head up her ass, and expect a long wait on the weekends. Is it worth it you ask....Oh yeah!
