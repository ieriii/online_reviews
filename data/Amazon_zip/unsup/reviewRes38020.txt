I resisted stuffed pizza for nearly three years before I finally tried it. WHAT WAS I THINKING??? When i saw it on tv..... all i could think was HEARTBURN. soooo wrong. I get heartburn everytime I eat spaghetti... chili... you've got the jist. The cheese is sooo good.... perfect amount... hot.... stringy.... ooey gooey deliciousness. the sauce tastes more fresh than any other pizza place I've tried around here. First bite, I thought it was going to be an overload of pepperoni but I guess it was just that one spot cause the rest was a perfect amount of pepperoni. the crust was perfect all around... no soggy bottom. crisp, crusty... not too heavy or "airy" but juuuuuust right. YUM. Thank goodness the boyfriend underestimated the size of these things & how full we'd be after 2 slices.... I get stuffed crust for lunch tomorrow :D yayyyy me. didn't get dessert cause we over did it with the two slices.... soda is free refills service was good we didnt wait too long for a table... great dinner!
