I had no idea this place existed - I'm so glad I found it! I had a croquette sandwich (ham, cheese, and onion), and it was amazing. I got a side of fried sweet plantains, which were as good as any plantains I've ever had. Topping off my meal was a Guanabana shake, which I'd never heard of, but which was amazing. Oh, and I couldn't leave without a shot of Cafe Cubano - delicious, as expected! (My friend ordered the goat cheese empanada, which was out of this world. So amazingly delicious!) Even though the inside eating area is quite small, the outdoor patio area is great. Clybourn isn't very busy at that intersection, so traffic is not distracting.  If you're in the mood for Cuban food, definitely head to 90 Miles. It's absolutely delicious and the price is right! Note - they close fairly early at 8 p.m.
