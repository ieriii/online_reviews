I had a hard time decediding on the rating. It is SUCH a beautiful place...I walked around loving the decor and feeling there. Yet... I was there with a group. We got one of the semi-circle booths and it was so loud next to the open kitchen and with the dining room noise we literally could not hear each other. So, that was disappointing. Then, the food. LOVED the appetizers. So, based on that I almost gave it a four star. We got the hushpuppies - a must! Fried green tomatoes - great!  I ordered the competition ribs wanting to experience their "best" ribs. I have to say, maybe it was just an off day, but they were the worst ribs I have had. I LOVE ribs and my local Bartlett "Papa Pacino's" has this fancy goumet restuarant beat by a long shot. No comparison. So, I guess because Chicago Q is supposed to be "THE" place for good ribs I had my taste buds so anticipating that. Hugely disappointed! With all the choice places to dine in the city I was bummed that we went there. They were dry. I also did not find any of the four sauces to be very good. Either too spicy, too tangy, too strange, or just plain bad. (AND I am NOT someone who is so hard on places!! I just really did not like this!) My friends also did not enjoy their meal. The server was not friendly, I actually wondered if she was new and nervous because she did have to ask others the answers a few times.  With all the reviews and I had watched the "Check Please" episode I was shocked to not have had a 5 star experience!
