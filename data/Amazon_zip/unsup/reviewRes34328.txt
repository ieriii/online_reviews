Just hopping on the bus here. Best falafel in Chicago, at least as far as I can tell. The hummus, spinach pies, and lentil soup are also great. This is one of those standard late night foods that you can so easily get in NYC or Montreal but seem to be elusive in sausage and grease-obsessed Chicago. It's a shame Sultan's Market has so little competition, but I'm thankful it exists.
