OMG go here right now! Awesome rolls with crazy combinations. Not your traditional sushi place. You must try the Godzilla at least once - its bigger, tastier and more satisfying than any other roll you have ever had. Other favs are the white tiger and spicy scallop if you are looking to make your mouth burn. Order the honey for a sweet, crunchy dessert. This place is BYOB so leave the car at home, take a cab and have some fun :)
