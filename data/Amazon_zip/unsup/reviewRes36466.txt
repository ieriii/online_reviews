I've eaten in a few times and my ranking stands for Indie. I'm happy to report the soggy edamame issue appears to be a take-out only problem. The sushi, sashimi, and maki continue to be impressively fresh and tasty.  Both Japanese and Thai appetizers have been delicious. Less delicious -- the Thai dishes. Oily noodles, flavorless rice, scarce vegetables. Stick to the sushi. The interior is dark and artsy, but in a cute way. Good for either a date or friends. The service varies between very good and spacey.
