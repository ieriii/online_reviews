I was looking for somewhere new to go. I love Asian food but never had Vietnamese before. SIMPLY IT had good reviews and prices so we went. It was perfect. I have not one negative thing to say about it. The second I walked through the door I knew the food was going to be great because the scent said it all, "authentic" is the word that comes to mind. We received a warm, cheerful, and genuine greeting by the owner. Our server was extremely helpful, patient, and friendly with us. The food came out quick and fresh and was phenomenal, PHENOMENAL! And the check was easy on the eyes and the wallet. This place is truly as good as it gets. Oh, and there was a birthday a few tables down from ours, a bunch of staff came out to sing her Happy Birthday. It's just a really great vibe in this place. SIMPLY IT is definitely a new favorite.
