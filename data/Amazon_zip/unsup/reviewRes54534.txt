One of the most wonderful things about this restaurant are the options, many, many options. I have yet to have something at this restaurant that I didn't enjoy. The menu has over 20 items from which to choose. My absolute favorite is the Reuben sandwich. It truly tastes as though it is the real thing. (but it has been a long time since I have had meat). I always recommend this restaurant to meat and non-meat eaters as a great option for something different or for those of us vegetarians who enjoy being able choose from more than one item on the menu or without having to modify an existing item..
