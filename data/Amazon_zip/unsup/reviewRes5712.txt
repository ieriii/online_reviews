3.5 stars. It was very good, but not awesome. Our server was helpful with the crazy extensive wine list but didn't seem very warm or engaging- possibly because it was packed to the gills with customers- some of whom were ScreaminG in that "i'm a woman who has had too many cocktails, and forgot how to use my inside voice" sort of way. But he did drop a free dessert at our table- pistachio soft serve- that was topped with little candied pistachio bits- yum. The bone marrow was yummy, especially topped with the herbs and capers. The tuna cured in olive oil with lima beans was also quite good. my boyfriend really loved the milk-braised pork shoulder and so did I, I just wish it had come with more potatoes, or that the potatoes and the milky country gravy were a little more separate; it sort of seemed like potato gravy. I'd go back with 2 more people to try more dishes, as soon as I lose the 7 pounds I gained from all that delicious delicious little pig.
