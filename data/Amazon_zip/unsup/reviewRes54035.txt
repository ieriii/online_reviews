If I could give this less than one star, I would.This used to be my favorite bar in Chicago, but I'm sadly going to have to revise my review. After being faithful customers since the place opened, we actually got KICKED OUT. They claimed we'd been overserved, and that's the only explanation we got. We were left shocked and bewildered, with no clue as to what we'd actually done wrong. I'm not sure when they decided to define 2 rounds of drinks as overservice, but I don't care to ever go back if that's how they're treating loyal patrons. When I asked what we'd done to deserve such treatment, I was called combative (anyone who has ever met me will know that this is a laughably, absurdly inaccurate characterization).I'm not going to pretend the drinks aren't delicious, but as I've found it's pretty easy to take a run to the liquor store and make close approximations of them at home, for a lot less money, without mean people calling you names and kicking you out for no reason.
