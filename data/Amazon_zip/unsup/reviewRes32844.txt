I like this place so much, I've been here about 4 times in the past 6 months. Everything looks so good, but I pretty much stick to the same things each time: the signature spicy tuna with the crispy rice, the jalapeno yellowtail, the summer roll, and the roll with the lobster, kobe sashimi and foie gras (how can you go wrong, really??). I've gotten the miso crusted cod before and that was perfect! Ahhhh, so yummy! The drinks are unique. The place is huge. It seems like they have a little less than half the restaurant for reservations while the rest of the areas (sushi bar, communal tables, lounge area) are first come, first served.
