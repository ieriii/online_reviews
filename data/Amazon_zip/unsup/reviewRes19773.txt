The service was great. From the hostess to the server to the busser and the manager. Everyone was friendly and transitions between them were seamless. My friend and I sat down for a couple of drinks on the patio (and were told we had to order food to sit out there) to enjoy maybe the last nice day this year. The menu was surprisingly nice (I hadn't checked it out before hand). four course setup. We settled in for a couple apps and a few drinks. The Scottish egg was good, a bit dry, but adding the coarse mustard helped a lot. The Antelope tartar was great, lots of fixings to help yourself to and create your own master piece. The last thing we had was the fried chicken liver. It was good, but also dry and the texture was off, very mushy on the inside, not as firm as I'd hoped. Oh, I almost forgot the bread was hot, fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to going back for a full dinner experience.
