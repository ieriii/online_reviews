We'd been wanting to try this place for weeks, but it's always completely packed after 7:00 on weekends. We were finally able to get in without waiting at 5:30 on a Friday, and were blown away. The food was simple; I ordered the skirt steak with corn, but the flavors were fresh, unique, and delicious. The cocktails were fantastic too. I'm not ordinarily a huge whiskey fan, but was impressed by the Longman Manhattan. The last time I walked out of a restaurant raving about the food was a few months ago at Bonsoiree, but I can't spend hundreds of dollars every time I go out. Longman and Eagle's food rivals that of high-end restaurants, but is laid-back and affordable enough to visit often.
