I come here a couple times a month specifically for the short stack of blueberry pancakes, good coffee, and real bacon - the thick, chewy, meaty, non-greasy kind. Yummy. I like the fact they're open late and let you linger over your coffee, instead of rushing you out the door as soon as you set down your fork like some other places do.
