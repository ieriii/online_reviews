I think it's always a good sign when a restaurant has a half-hour wait at 9 p.m. on a weekday. We waited our half hour at the bar while watching the Galaxy play and chowing down on some chips and salsa. I was already sold on this place because 1) they showed US soccer on TV, and 2) their chips were eerily reminiscent of the highly addictive Hav' a chips.  Pizza arrived on a baking sheet that was easily two feet long. That's a lot of pizza. We went basic -- red sauce, half cheese, half pepperoni, but it totally hit the spot.  Jennifer H. is right about it being really loud -- definitely not some place to go if you're actually interested in what the rest of the people in your party have to say.
