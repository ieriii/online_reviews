Ever been to Edisto Beach ( an island) outside of Charleston S.C.?  Really? No? Well, I am not surprised. It is kind of a well kept secret. However, to me- it is a close version of my heaven here on earth (well- that is really the Galapagos- but those islands are far away). Tropical air, beautiful salt water, dolphins breaching in the water, mannered southern gentlemen, strong tequila drinks, hot sun and.... great cooking. Big Jones has the kind of food that I am accustomed to having when I visit this wonderful part of the world.  If you have not been to Edisto- think Charleston- that might help you!  We went for brunch. I had the Crab Cakes Benedict. They had just the right amount of sauce, and were HUGE!! I could eat only one. The potatoes were just right. One of my boys had the Eggs Romero- Poached eggs, pulled pork, potato cakes and awesome BBQ sauce. My other guy had the Eggs Rochambeau- which included poached eggs, a great looking sirloin, bernaise sauce and potatoes. I tried both of their dishes- and they were awesome!  We had no potent drinks- just sweet lemonade (highly recommended) and pomegranate iced tea.  It was rather busy- but- hey- it was a Sunday in Andersonville. We loved it!
