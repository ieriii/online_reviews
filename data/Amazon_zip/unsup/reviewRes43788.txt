KInzie Chophouse is a respectable River North restaurant with a very old school vibe. I came here on a Sunday evening and had the impression that locals favor this family friendly steakhouse. The service is decent and friendly. I ordered meatloaf and my dining companion had the smoked pork chop. The meatloaf was okay; nothing special. The pork chop, on the other hand, was very tasty! The prices here are very reasonable. The restaurant has two dining rooms. The decor is very traditional steakhouse: dark wood, glass bottles, etc. All in all, this is a neighborhood steakhouse. I would recommend for those looking to avoid the glam and expense of Kinzie Chophouse's peers.
