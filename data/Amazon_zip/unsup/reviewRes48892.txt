I've been to Publican a couple of times now. It's always worth a visit because the menu is constantly changing. Yay for new things to try! The downside is that favorite things can also disappear off the menu from visit to visit (I still miss the hangar steak). I keep coming back for the great, unusual beer selection - on a side note all of the servers are at least level one certified in the cicerone program, so they can offer great recommendations. Also, do NOT miss the fries with the egg on top. Nothing better than breaking the yolk with the first fry and dipping it into the yummy goodness.
