I was in the area for a business meeting and had an hour to kill before it started, so I went to Alliance Bakery without every hearing of it before, bought a heated-up ham and cheese quiche and a vanilla latte. Not only were both items oh so tasty, but the comfort and ambiance of the study room next door was fantastic! I don't go to this neighborhood that often, but I may make excuses down the road to revisit!
