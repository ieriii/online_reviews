Service: 1 starFood: 3 starsWe had done carry-out from India House a few times and thought the food was pretty good, and the portions pretty big. So even though the menu was pricey compared to our favorite Indian places up north on Devon, it was worth it if you just gotta have some naan in spicy sauce.The food is not as good as Klay Oven, the meat was not as tender and the sauces not as smooth and flavorful, but if you like Indian food and you don't want to make the hike up north, it'll do in a pinch.So when the Groupon came around, we thought we'd try dining in. Big mistake. A busy Friday night, they kind of forgot about us for 15 minutes, twice. When we did finally get to our check, they wanted the balance after Groupon to be paid in cash and we just happened to be low on cash, short by a few dollars.So, what should a restaurant do? Make an exception and allow us to pay with a credit card or force me to try to locate a cash machine? You guessed it, the female manager that night chose to send me out into the cold. I would have gladly paid their precious little credit card fee (min 50 cents I believe?), but was told a resounding No.Unfortunately, Groupon sometimes has this effect, the restaurant gets too busy, food quality and service suffers, defeating the purpose of the Groupon in the first place, which is to introduce people to your restaurant and get them to come back.Ruined our night, we'll never go back. Better to pay a bit more for smaller portions at Klay Oven if you have an Indian itch and you're downtown.
