I am biased to Chicago Diner because I am a Chicago native. It was a savior to me back when I became a vegetarian back around 20 years ago when no restaurant in Chicago knew what the word vegetarian meant. I would go there and feel like I finally had a place where I "belonged" (wow, I could have anything on the menu). It was veg and it was hip. The people who worked there were hip back than too!  So I have been eating there a long time - there have been lots of menu changes both good and bad. Even 20 years later, it is still great! Even though I don't live in Chi-Town at the moment, a trip down there always means a stop at Chicago Diner. I just gotta go and check out my old haunt. :) Back when I first started eating there I wasn't vegan and it wasn't as vegan friendly as it is now and I remember some totally awesome Nachoes that I used to have back then. It is still great but a bit different than it used to be. I can't say everything I order is to my liking and there are things I would do differently than they do to the dishes (now that I am a more seasoned veggie than I was back in the olden times and know how to cook!) but the choices and the selections that Chicago Diner are always great and, imho, always will be. The vegan cookie dough milkshakes - OMIGOD, could I just die now drinking them?:) I have notice a few new additions lately and I can't wait to go back to try them. I like the fact that they are now offering raw dishes (esp the Raw Nachoes!)and I must say the raw dishes I have had there are very good! :)
