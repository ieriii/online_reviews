Deep dish pizza was a must try on list of things to eat at Chicago. My friends and I came here during weekday lunch hour, around 11ish and the restaurant was pretty empty. I think we ordered the small special. The pizza was only luke warm and the mozzarella cheese had already started to turn hard. I like my pizza on the warmer side with the cheese still being gooey. The crust was good though and not thick and doughy.
