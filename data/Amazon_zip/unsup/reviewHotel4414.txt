BEAUTIFUL!!! I was amazed by the lobby and all the history that went with it. I loved my stay there. All the staff were awesome. The only complaint is that there wasn't a flat screen TV, but that is a small complaint. The peacock theme in the newly-remodeled rooms is well-done and I loved it. I would definitely stay there again.
