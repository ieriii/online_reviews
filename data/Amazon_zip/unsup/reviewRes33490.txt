(4.5*) At $4, a big falafel sandwich does a meal make. The falafel itself is the best I've ever had - perfectly spiced, crispy on the outside but not greasy - and includes a soft, warm pita, hummus spread, and misc veggies such as cucumbers. The flavors are well-balanced yet surprisingly complex. Really, I'd easily give S.M. five stars if they'd stay open later than 10, accept plastic, and get a soda fountain ($1 for a 12 oz. can = no me gusta).
