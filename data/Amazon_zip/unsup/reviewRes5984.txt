I felt like Fat Bastard's fat ass wife after a meal at one of my all-time favorite restaurants. I had a Lettuce Entertain gift certificate and was dying to use it, so after debating between Wildfire and Ben Pao, I decided on Wildfire. I called up my homegirl to see if she wanted to come along and because she had never been before, she said sure. A former co-worker introduced me to the wonderful Martini Flight at a birthday lunch at the Oakbrook location--and because I have my priorities together, that was the first thing I ordered. This delicious teaser includes the Cosmo, Apple Martini, Raspberry Martini and my favorite, the Stormy NIght. Next up was the small chopped salad which is big enough to share and good enough to devour in 2 minutes flat. For an entree I had the cedar planked salmon with a baked sweet potato; my homegirl had the ribs and we shared the creamed spinach. The molten chocolate cake was really just overkill and we could barely move at this point. It was delicious, nonetheless. Gluttony at its finest. I love, love, love Wildfire. I've been many times to the downtown location and twice to the Oakbrook location and I always have a great meal. This place stays packed no matter what time of day or year it is, service is on point and the food is exceptional.
