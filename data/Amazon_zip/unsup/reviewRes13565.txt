I had been anticipating trying Revolution for awhile now, but just finally made it there last week. If I was giving a rating for beer alone, I would have given four stars. The Mr. Crowley was by far my favorite selection. The citrusy notes really made the beer shine. i also had the mild ale, which was also a really great beer. I was not as excited about the food. My party ordered the bacon fat popcorn. It was kind of squishy...in a not so fresh sort of way. Maybe we just had a bad batch, but it wasn't that good. I wound up eating the bacon chunks out of it and kind of poking the rest around in the bowl. On to the burger. Generally, it is my experience that places have a tendency to cook your burger more than you want them to. Revolution did the opposite. I ordered my burger medium rare. It came out RARE. The burger patty itself was underseasoned and lacking flavor. The beer onions on the burger were good. My boyfriend's burger was properly cooked to a medium rare, so not sure what transpired here. As for the sides, my boyfriend opted for a salad. The salad came with no dressing, nor at the time of ordering was he asked what kind of dressing he might want. Weird. Blue cheese potato salad was good, if not a bit lacking in the blue cheese department. I really wanted to like this place after all the good reviews I've read, but I think if I go back, it will definitely be for the superb beers only, and maybe grabbing a cheese steak down the street at Philly's Best afterward.
