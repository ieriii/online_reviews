I went to XOCO yesterday and was seriously underwhelmed. We waited in line for about 30 minutes having arrived at about 7pm or so. They will not take your order until there is a table available for you, fair enough. We had chips and salsa, the milanesa, cubana, a lemonade and a bohemia beer, and a few churros, total came to $40. A little steep for a Corner Bakery type experience. We got seats at a little bar on high chairs and tucked into the chips and salsa. Ok, nothing special, can get the same at Jewel. The sandwiches were tasty, but not special, about the level of a Corner Bakery club panini :) The churros were super gross, greasy and hard, I totally have no clue why people are raving. It looks like they were under the heat lamp for a long time because the minute they were pulled out from under it and put on a plate in front of me they hardened right up and could have chipped a tooth. All in all I will definitely will not be coming back for this marginally tasty yet greasy and definitely ridiculousy overpriced fast Food. Also, smell in place was reminiscent of rancid burning pig fat, appetizing..........
