Before dining here, particularly on weekends, you must accept that the odds are in favor of a wait for a table. It's a tiny little space, and they don't take reservations, so that's to be expected. I assure you, it is worth the wait. The food is great, they make kick ass shakes, and you will leave disgustingly stuffed. I usually get the Casado, which can be steak, chicken, fish or veggie. It comes with plantains, black beans, rice, cabbage salad, and an over-easy egg. So good. The vegetarian menu is great too- potato tacos and heart of palm salad in particular.
