If the customer service here is as great as typical Westin Starwood properties, I would have kicked in one more star. However, the mediocre service is a let down for this hotel that has a lot more potential. Pros: -It is at a GREAT location, next to Macy's Water Tower, in the heart of Michigan Ave -Sometimes they have promos in the lobby like free massages or free beverages -The lobby is very well decorated and has a very nice classy feel to it -Rooms are nice and clean, though on the smaller end -The gym has new machines and is well ventilated with dim mood lighting Cons: -netural, uninterested staff who look like they are forced to be there and is waiting for their shift to be over
