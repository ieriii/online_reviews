Favorite restaurant in Chicago. MUST EAT: Pork belly (which everyone knows) but also the Chicken - amazing flavor because it's spice-rubbed... and with those frites! Mmm. I've been a few times, and have always had great service, despite the fact that it's always packed. And the food is consistently GREAT. And, I think, very reasonably priced for the high quality. The ham trio appetizer is also very tasty, the fish (perch maybe?) was good, and they have a great beer selection, of course. Oh, and finally, the atmosphere! So fun and open, so different, so buzzing with those cute communal tables! You'll love this place as long as you love food and people.
