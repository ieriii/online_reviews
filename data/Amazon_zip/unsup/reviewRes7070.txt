This place lives up to the hype. Delicious food, great outdoor seating, and great service, but prices are a bit high!!!! I arrived early around 5:30pm and there were plenty of seating inside and out. It was such a beautiful night though so outdoor seating made the most sense!!! They have about 10-12 tables outside. I was surprised at how many they had lined up on the sidewalk! Even before we ordered our meal they served us bread (warm), olive oil, and parmesan cheese (my favorite!). We ordered the lobster ravioli and the pumpkin ravioli. I am not a huge pumpkin person, but this dish was DELICIOUS! I was really quite impressed it was so flavorful. It came with roasted pine nuts and sweet potatoes (cooked like home fries). I had asked the waiter whether I should have gotten the clam linguine or the pumpkin ravioli. He told me to go with the pumpkin ravioli. I'm so glad I listened to him!!! They have an extensive wine menu for the wine connoisseurs. The food arrives on huge dishes, but the portions are a good size. I couldnt finish all my food. Definitely a great place for dinner!
