Look for the single yellow light bulb outside, otherwise you'll miss it completely. Really relaxing, mellow, classy atmosphere. The bouncer was extremely cool, and helpful, even when I left my cellphone behind, and had to get back in. The price makes it a once in a while type place, but recommended for a romantic date.
