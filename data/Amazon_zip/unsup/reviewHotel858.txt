Besides the wall paper and that's not really important, I can't think of anything bad to say. Staying over the New Years holiday I picked this hotel and the "L' is really about 20 feet to the left of the front door. You're only seconds from going anywhere you want in town. My room was at the front of the hotel and I didn't find the noise of the train to bother me at all. The staff was very friendly, and the room was extremely clean (I cleaned rooms in a former life so I'm picky). I plan on using this hotel again when I come back and the price was such a bargain for the room and the parking, that it makes it hard for me not to use them again. If you like older hotels with charm then I suggest this one, but if you looking for water parks with in room electronic activities then this is not your hotel.
