This place is amazing. Go here. The atmosphere is fantastic. The service is great. The owner is hilarious. The food is uncommonly delicious. The picture of the owner with Rod Blago is priceless. The mystery tube is unforgettable. And the borscht is to die for. To spare you from reading the two bad reviews of this place, I'll summarize them here: Too slow. Too authentic (What?). Not American enough. Not enough English. I'm not sure how they managed to get that far up Elston when all they were looking for was a McDonald's. If I'm looking for a Romanian restaurant, I'm going to expect it to be authentic, hope it's not American, and expect English to be the second language. So those would not be things I would complain about. As for the speed, sure, it's no TGI Friday's - they won't hand you your check with your meal, expect you to scarf down your food so they can kick you out and get someone else in your seat. I thought the timing was perfect - we had time to enjoy our food and converse before the next course came, and we could get the check when we wanted it. My group of 11 friends loved this place and we'll be back again and again. I tried a sample of every dish we ordered, by the way, and they were all unbelievably delicious!
