I'm only a visitor to Chicago but this is a place I asked to go back to. I love the laid back atmosphere of the large communal tables. The patio is excellent on nice days as well. But the food, omg the food is delicious. All small plates and so many kinds of delicious, decadent choices that change seasonally.... And the waitress was kind enough to bring out a new salad when she found out my friend couldn't eat cheese. This place definitely gets my seal of approval!
