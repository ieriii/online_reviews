Okay, so you'll have to forgive me.... it's been 2 years since I went here but I am STILL talking about it. When my husband and I travel we like to eat at places of highly acclaimed chefs. We went here for our last night on vacation in Chicago and definitely were not disappointed. It was probably the most expensive meal I've ever had but we ordered the full tasting menu (which is think is 12 small dishes per person) along with the full wine & spirits pairings. Each plate was a completely different experience. One thing I appreciate is when A. the waitstaff is very well informed about what they are serving and B. the chef is completely innovative. Each thing we had was something we would have never thought of, for example, the split pea soup with marshmallow cream. It was a dining experience to say the least. I think when you go somewhere like this you need to make it about who you are with and the time you have to just sit and dine together. Graham Elliot makes this experience exactly that. It was so fun to try new things and talk about it and just share that moment. Downside, the wine and spirits pairings....while everything complimented what we were eating, due to the small food portions we were completely wasted by the time we left. I do say "downside" in a good way though. I am already begging my husband to take me back even if it's just for one night to Chicago!
