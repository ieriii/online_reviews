Wow, just wow. Despite the ridiculous line, even for a theme park ride, the food creations here at Hot Doug's are so sublime, that you forget all about it. Though I suppose you could consider what goes on at this otherwise ordinary street corner a ride through encased meat-land. It really is that impressive. Fortunately, I had the company of about 15 of my best friends to wait out the line, and descend upon Doug like the hungry maniacs we were. Thank goodness the food came out only 2-3 minutes after we each placed our orders. Many sausages and trays of duck fat fries later, our group of non-Chicagolanders could leave the city knowing that, if for no other reason, we'd have to come back to town again. Not that it hasn't been said, but the incredible and unique flavor and texture combinations that are the hallmark of Doug's encased meat creations must be tasted to be believed. My personal favorite, of the many I tried was the Atomic Ribeye, with a complex meaty taste, spicy back end, obscenely juicy texture, and lovely goat cheese topping. Unless you are a naziesque vegan, or cannot stand still in one place for more than a few moments, you owe it to yourself to eat at Hot Doug's, at least once. Yes, it will take up most of your morning or afternoon. Yes, if done properly, it will leave you so full you won't think about food for at least 24. But yes, it is a great food experience absolutely worth the trouble. Just bring a bunch of your friends, and you will leave better friends than ever. Hot Dogs? Schmot dogs.
