We have eaten there twice. The first time was awful; when the tomato soup was brought out by the chef he spilled the whole thing on my lap. While he was sorry, it was supposed to be our little secret, I guess. I was wearing black pants, so it was not obvious to anyone else. If I had been wearing white, I'm betting that they would've comped by meal--they made no adjustment other than offering me another bowl of soup. Really? As we thought this was a lightening-doesn't strike-twice event, we tried it one more time. The food was very good, but neither it nor the service was life-changing considering the hefty price.
