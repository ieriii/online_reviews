Great, great, great beer selection!  Even greater? The ham sandwich. I have dreams about this sandwich. Actually, I have never had anything here that was less than delicious. Not often do you find a place that has both an impressive beer list and an impressive kitchen.  Yes, it gets crowded, but I have only ever had to go elsewhere once because I couldn't find a spot within a few minutes. You just can't plan on going with a group unless you are going at an off time.
