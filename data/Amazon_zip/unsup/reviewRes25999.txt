My face hurt from too much deliciousness, that's what Pequod's does to you. Deep Dish pizza that no other place in the city can touch. Well, they can touch it, they just have to pay like the rest of us schmucks.  First off, the crust in caramelized not burnt. They douse your pizza with toppings, like a sea of peperoni or mountains of sausage. The cheese is stringy and the sauce phenomenal. Best pizza in the city.
