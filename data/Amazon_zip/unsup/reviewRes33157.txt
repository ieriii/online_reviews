Let me start off by saying - delicious! We arrived with a group of 15 people (we had made the reservation earlier in the week) and they treated us wonderfully! The waitress was sweet and handled our boisterous, large party very well. The food was nothing short of amazing! The mamaliga was to die for, the stuffed cabbage was great, the schnitzel was was fried to perfection with tasty spaetzel to boot and the red sangria was the true highlight! Mmmmmm. And there was live music - very fun! They were very accommodating and sweet and I would recommend this little gem to anyone! Go...now!
