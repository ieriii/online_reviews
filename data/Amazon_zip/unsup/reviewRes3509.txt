Bird, bird, bird Bird is the word! I was in Chicago for a week and I was staying near by Crisp. I would pass this place and there was always a line. I thought they were giving out free golden chickens! Oh boy, these were better than the free golden chickens. They were so delicious and crispy! Writing this review makes me want to fly over to Chicago and get some bird.
