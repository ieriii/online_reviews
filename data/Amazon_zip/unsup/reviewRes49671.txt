If you like meat and seafood on a hot wooden slab, then this is the place for you! My girlfriend and I went on a Friday night and it was packed, but we only had to wait five minutes to be seated, which was nice because we were starving. We had ordered the empanada combination plate which was fantastic. The sauce was hot, but tolerable and the empanadas were great. However, the main course was my favorite. We both ordered the $20 skirt steak combination and the calamari. I loved the fact that the calamari was not cut, so you actually got to see the squid head! and it was extra tentacley which is my favorite. It was grilled to perfection. The steak was phenomenal, it was juicy, savory, and cooked to perfection, We were both too full to see what the dessert menu was, but I would definitely come back here again. The total bill ended up being about sixty bucks which included appetizer, two skirt steak dinners with calamari and a sangria...not bad at all.
