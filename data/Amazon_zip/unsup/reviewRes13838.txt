I was here twice in a two-week period and I left happy each time. On the first visit, I was here with a group of 7 around 2pm on a Saturday. When we arrived, the place was full and we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait. We got drinks from the bar, had a seat in the lounge area, and were seated within about 35 minutes. The only drawback to their seating is that it is easiest to accommodate groups of 4 or less. On the second visit, we arrived as a group of 4 around 6pm on a Thursday and were seated within 5 minutes. On both visits, we received good service and the food arrived quickly. I have had the Workingman Burger and the Forest Burger and they were both delicious. Friends have had and enjoyed the Goat Cheese Croquette Salad, Fish & Chips, Cherry Bourbon Cake, and Applewood Smoked Wings. The only item that did not receive rave reviews was the Bacon Fat Popcorn: super greasy and not a whole lot of bacon flavor.  The beer is great! Their Belgian Wit is light bodied with a lot of flavor and the English ale is tasty and well balanced. I am excited to go back and try the rest.  The decor is simple, comfortable, and creative, using strips cut from old wooden barrels to cover one wall. The space is very open and large, yet it was not loud and overly boisterous as some places of this size can be.  *Kudos on playing the entire La Roux album while I was there on Saturday.* **Double kudos on cooking both of my burgers to a true medium-rare!**
