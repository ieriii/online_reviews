I've eaten at the Diner countless times and it's exceptional. I always go for the sandwiches and either the french onion soup or the sweet potato fries as a side. The gyro is excellent and the chikn caesar wrap is great. I really haven't tried the entrees because most of the those dishes are similar to dishes that I make at home. I think it's nice for non-vegetarians and non-vegans to try some of our staples like BBQ seitan and panko fried tofu. The shakes are amazing and their raw desserts are truly delicious. So, I guess I would urge people to get a shake with the gyro and sweet potato fries and share a raw dessert. Enjoy!
