I love it here..my favorite farfalle pollo Im going to be super mad if this place gets super popular and i wont be able to get a table! JK i love this place...to me personally it beats the super fancy italian places downtown.  Food is always fresh and served up pretty fast. If you want you can sit at the bar and watch the chef cook up your meal while you wait.  Fettucine, gnocchi, farfelle pollo and garlic cheese bread are routinely ordered by me or someone in my group. There are other things on the menu that sound very appetizing but i dont know anyone else who makes the farfelle pollo so it is a must have for me everytime i eat here!! Portions are very generous! Staff is friendly and pleasant.
