So delicious. What a romantic evening. The place is dinky but luckily it was beautiful night and my boyfriend and I got to sit outside. The soup was delicious. The shrimp appetizer was good but nothing special. I got the braised shortribs and my boyfriend got the pork tenderloin. Both so delicious, savory and tender. Just really great dishes. The dessert was amazing. The bill came out to be $53 for two people!! So cheap. On a side note, we got a bottle of red wine as a gift and a bottle of champagne at an event, so overall it was a really cheap night! Love Bonsoiree!!!
