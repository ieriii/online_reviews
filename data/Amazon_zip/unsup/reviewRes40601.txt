Went to L and E and had the bone marrow, the sweet bread and the duo of foie gras and hot choc with the funel cake small plates. And are they small plates. The bone marrow was just fatty goodness on a sourdough bread. Nothing that blows our minds since we are used to eating bone marrow whatever we way it can be cooked, being Asians. The sweet bread had a weird consistency, maybe bec it was medium rare or raw. Can't tell by the looks bec the place is dark. And the foie gras with a mini hot choc cup and mini funnel cake didn't work for me either. It's just richness after richness. Plus the funnel cake was really oily. Then for main we had the grilled venison and the Fluke and crab cannelloni. The venison was really chewy. I had to spit mine out coz, it just won't disintegrate after chewing it for a long time. It had that minerally, iron taste. the sauce that went with it was good. The Fluke with the crab was really good A++, tasted like it had saffron sauce although it was not mentioned on the menu. Ended the night with the gruyere donuts and banana toffee pudding. The donuts worked really well. It was the highlight of the night. With all that food and a bill of 150 I still ended up hungry. Don't know if we'll go back.
