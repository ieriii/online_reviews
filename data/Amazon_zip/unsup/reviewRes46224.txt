Very vegetarian-friendly, although it may not appear that way. They do honor requests to make dishes vegetarian. They didn't add the bacon to the incredible double stuffed potato spring rolls, which are mashed potatoes and green onion rolled in asian wrappers and topped with melted cheese. The Manhattan salad, with romaine lettuce, asparagus, tomatoes, white beans, beets, red onion and lentils was fabulous. I've also enjoyed the Pasta Fresca here. They should have a larger lobby because the waits can be so long. Service is fantastic.
