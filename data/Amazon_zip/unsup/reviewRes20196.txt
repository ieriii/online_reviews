I was pretty disappointed with the sushi here. Although, I have to admit, I live on the west coast and realize that sushi in the midwest isn't going to be the same. My biggest complaint with this place is that is was hard to find a roll on their menu that didn't have some sort of mayo on it! It's hard to enjoy the real taste of sushi when it's covered in a mayo based sauce. Things I liked: BYOB was cool and both the rainbow roll and the crunchy spicy tuna rolls were pretty good! I won't be back to Coast.
