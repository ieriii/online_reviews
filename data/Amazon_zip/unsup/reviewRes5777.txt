It was my roommate birthday so me her and her friend all decided to italian tapas it out over at Davanti. I'm relatively new to Chicago and hadn't made it over to University Village yet. After going to Davanti... I think I'll be making it over that way a little more often. The food was great, major stars were the baby octopus, and the mushroom pizza. Now I've had a lot of truffle oil before, but that mushroom pizza was soo good it made me go out and spend $40 dollars on my own little bottle of truffle oil. Now I try to "Davanti" at home by drizzling truffle oil on my own crap pizza's. I haven't made it back over to Davanti yet, but if you do... MUSHROOM PIZZA!
