I worked in a high end sushi restaurant in Detroit (dinner + 1 cocktail each = $125 on average). I'm kind of hard to impress. But Wakamono swept me off of my feet. Went while n town on the advice of not one, not two, but THREE friends. Great ambiance. Very modern, very Asian, but upscale without feeling stuffy. For starters, we tried melt in your mouth baked scallops, plus tuna three ways. The scallops were literally TO DIE FOR. Can't even single out a roll...but Kani Chung might take the cake for me. I can't even tell you anything else, except GO.
