Garcia's is a staple of the Ravenswood/Lincoln Square neigbourhoods. It's a multi-site restaurant that doesn't lack in it's feel of being a local, drop in, taqueria. I've been to the location on Western on a number of occasions and now having moved within walking distance of the Lawrence establishment I've visited at least 4 or 5 times already. Garcia's delivers on good eats at a reasonable price with a quick turnaround. Other than one bizarre case of food "disagreement" when I ordered fish tacos a few weeks back (never ever had that happen here before) they have consistently provided delicious meals perfectly complimented by the steady flow of chips & salsa. The margarita's are quite tasty as well, a decent balance between tasting the tequila and the other flavours in equal measure. The servings are substantial as well so you really get two meals out of the one that you pay for which is something I can always appreciate.
