I went to RJ Grunts for lunch the other day. It is a great lunch place. Its a total throw back kind of place. 70's themed with wood paneling. Small bar area with good beer selection. I was suprised to see beer such as Magic Hat which was awesome! It was pretty crowded but we only waited about 20 min at peak lunch hour. It is a bit noisy if that bugs you. The tables are close together and many families dining after a day at the zoo. This did not bother me at all...but if you are prone to these things bothering you stay away. Bottom line the food was awesome. I had burger and it probably was the 2nd best burger I have ever had (next to Kuma's of course). The burger was big, juicy and did not disappoint. We also had some nachos that were really good too. We did not do the Salad bar which everyone raves about but from the looks it did not blow me away however a lot of people I saw ordered it. Its a no frills burger and beer place that is great for lunch or a casual dinner. Service was good and the price right. I will for sure be back
