AMAZING!!!! I love this restaurant! If I weren't afraid of getting completely fat I would go here every night. I came here on a Tuesday night with my daughters for dinner. They are 13 and 7 years old. I wanted them to try something unique...and unique it was!  Service was the best you could want for the price that you pay. We were seated immediately and the waiter was at our table within 30 seconds of us being seated. He explained the process of how service works and pointed us in the direction of the salad bar. The salad bar is all you can eat, it didn't have a great assortment. I think it was just to have something to eat besides just meat. I had the fresh mozzarella, red and yellow peppers, some type of greenish colored mint salad, artichoke hearts and salmon. Upon returning to our table the waiter raced over and pulled my chair out for me to have a seat. (WOW!) We ate some of our salad plate then flipped our cards for the MEAT!! Amazing how they keep rotating around with different meats! Filet Mignon, Top Sirloin, Garlic Beef, Some type of Chicken bacon wrap thingy, sausages, pork ribs, beef ribs, and it's non stop!!!! But on the other hand we did forget to flip our card to make it stop! The wine selection was awesome and before you know it the waiter returns when your glass is almost empty to ask if you would like more...I LOVE HIM!!! The sides that they bring to the table were great! I loved the cheese potatoes! My youngest daughter killed the fried bananas (2 plates of them to be exact). The polenta was just ehh. All in all...we had a wonderful time. Had some bonding and just a good laugh at how my youngest kept sneaking and flipping our cards to green. She is so playful and loved the game until we flipped her card to green. I would definitely be bcak here soon. Meat was flavorful and cooked to perfection.
