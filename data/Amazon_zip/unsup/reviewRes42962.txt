After a bit of research I decided to give gilt bar a try on my visit to Chicago. The reason why I'm giving this place a 3 star is because they ran out of the rib eye steak which I was very much looking forward to eating, and their limited entree list on the menu didn't really provide many alternative options. I heard that the rib eye was one of their signature dishes, so I find it a bit puzzling why they wouldn't get enough to last the night (had a 10pm reservation). We ended sharing a few appetizers and the truffle pasta which was simply amazing. The atmosphere was hip but felt my surroundings to be a bit dull. The service was okay.
