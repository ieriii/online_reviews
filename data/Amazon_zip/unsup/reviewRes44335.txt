Not only does Wakamono have fabulous martinis, they also deliver sushi straight to my front porch! It's a little pricey, but worth it. I'm a huge fan of the miniature to-go soy sauce bottles. The spicy tuna roll was really outstanding, usually not one of my favorites. Godzilla roll was good... zilla. Awesome awesome awesome miso soup, some of the best I've had. Wakamono, I wakawill be calling you again soon!
