To walk into this establishment is to be in awe! When you first unveil the sheer elegance of the velvet curtains and the great decor/atmosphere from behind the non-descript, graffiti-laden, boarded up wall entrance you truly feel like you are walking into a "diamond in the rough." The servers are great, the bartenders mix drinks with such precision and skill you'd think they had traveled to a far away land to learn the skills of ancient Tibetan Monk bartenders. $11.00 per drink? I'd gladly pay that for the best drink i've ever consumed, and the ambiance of a secret, hidden ballroom.
