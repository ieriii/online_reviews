Decent food but really over priced for what you are getting. The worst part about my meal here was that we were sat in the back by the kitchen and where (I assume) the servers hang out because all I heard were people yelling in the back, dropping dishes and at one point (I am NOT making this up) I heard someone yell out a description of his bang last night.For a place that is on Michigan Ave, it should be better managed. Take a look around for your servers hiding themselves in the back because once I heard that, I got up and walked to the front where I found my server standing there watching tv and thanked him for the horrible time.And to top it all off, he smirked and said, Any time Sir. If that isn't snotty service downtown, I don't know what is.This is why I eat at laid back places where this attitude is not permitted and the staff don't talk about themselves getting laid.
