I wish I could give this place ZERO stars! The first time my boyfriend and I went here we sat at our table for a good ten minutes before even being greeted or receiving water and because of this we decided to leave. After our first experience dining in we decided the next time we would just order food for take out. I kept hearing raves about this place from a bunch of people I worked with, so today we decided to take my boyfriends family here when they came in to town. Again, worst service I have probably ever experienced. There were only about three or four other people in the restaurant and it still took a long time for us to get our drinks and water put on the table. Whatever, its just drinks we were still excited to try the food that we heard so many good things about. I guess we let our hopes get too high because this food was horrible. I got the egg noodles with chicken and it smelled and tasted like cat food. Not that I eat cat food...I mean I try it every now and then. Who cares? But honestly, everything but the appetizers were bad. Save yourself the time and money, the poor service and food is not worth it. Go down a few doors to one of the other Thai places where you can get good service and good food.
