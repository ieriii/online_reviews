I loved my veggie burger(the Strange Famous!!) & devoured the fries. Also, the back room away from the bar is great for families. Definitely kid-friendly, with all sorts of games (board games & a few arcade games) and comfortable space for the kids to move around. Our service was smooth, and we were there at 7 pm on a Friday night. Our waitress & servers were very friendly & attentive as was one of the owners. We look forward to visiting again soon!
