I'd probably come here more often if it weren't packed all the time. One of the few places I've found that has roasted red peppers for a topping (note: red pepps, extra sauce, pepperoni and onions make for a kind of soggy pizza- i think it's meant to be a bit more sparce on the toppings). People have always been nice & the beer is good. Loved the Full Frontal Brew I had there recently!
