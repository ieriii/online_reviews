I thought the breakfast was great! I had the Red Eggs with asparagus. I didn't go in expecting much, since it was just eggs, but the food was fantastic.Service was a little slow, but you have to cut them some slack since they were busy.I also, like mentioned below, that they offer a discount for bringing in your helmet!
