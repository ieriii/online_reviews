Dined at Glenn's last night after hearing about it from our friends. "Delicious dinner and breakfast," they said. Sold. We made reservations earlier in the day, and when we arrived were seated immediately. I highly recommend getting your name on their list before arriving. A few night before we walked in without calling ahead and the wait was over an hour. We didn't stay that night. Our table was on the far side of the restaurant at a cozy two-top near the blackboard. Great spot. Could see all the action. I didn't catch our server's name, but he offered great menu suggestions, including the Shrimp Cargo (a buttery, cheesy, warm plate of shrimp goodness), sea scallops (served with bacon, mushrooms, potatoes and asparagus) and the jambalaya (served over cornbread, spicy!). We ordered all three and ate until we could eat no more. The food was fabulous. For dessert, we tried the Banana Foster. The ice cream came out half-melted. I've had others that were a bit less soupy. Nonetheless, still tasty. Two things that weren't so great: 1. Fruit flies all over our table. I'm not sure if it was where we were sitting or if something had recently spilled, but they were swarming. It was super annoying and unclean. We were batting them away as we ate. 2. The prices are a little high for diner food. For the two of us, with a tip we paid over $100. We'll definitely go back again, but maybe for a special occasion rather than a Thursday night out for dinner. Overall, a great place to enjoy delicious seafood and a casual atmosphere.
