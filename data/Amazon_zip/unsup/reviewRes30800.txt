I love sushi here. My faves are the lobster roll, the shakin beef, the tom kha gai soup and the beef tempura. They have managed to combine great flavours and textures into the sushi , however, dont ask them to recommend a sake that goes with it- one of the servers recommended one to me and it totally killed the palate. The sushi itself has delicate flavours, and you can pick out the individual efforts. Each is an amazing dish by itself. The ambience is rather trendy, not really for people who come for the love of food. Personally, I love all the wood work, they have beautiful blue doors against the wall. Oh and you can get a drink at the bar while you wait for your table, and if you are peckish, its a sushi bar, so nibble away :)
