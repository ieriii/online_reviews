Yum, yum, yum and may I say YUM! Baba ghannoush to die for, great tabouli, and probably some of the best falafel I have ever eaten. When I lived closer it was a weekly treat to visit here, but now I am lucky to get there once a month, where I indulge in my veggie delights to the point of getting sick! LOL!! Oh yes, their soups rock also!!!
