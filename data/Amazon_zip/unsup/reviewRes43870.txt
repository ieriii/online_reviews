River North. $20 set 3 course dinner menu. Need I say more? I do? Ok. The salmon was delectable.. a putanesca worth every single bite I took. The "decadent chocolate cake" was one of those time stopping cakes, where you simply must wait for every single drop to melt in your mouth.  The server was friendly and accommodating.  I look forward to coming back... if I hesitate please remind me of the cake. Oh, the cake.
