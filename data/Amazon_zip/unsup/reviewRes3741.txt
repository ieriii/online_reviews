Let's start by saying that I would recommend this place to everyone and I would definitely go back. I ordered the bibimbop, burrito and wings (their popular item). Bibimbop wasn't quite the same as what you would get at a regular Korean restaurant, but comes close enough. Wings were huge and delicious -- finger licking good literally. There were a lot of flavors to choose from as well. I was skeptical about the burrito but turned out to be pretty delcious. It was basically the bibimbop in a tortilla. The dining experience was a lot of fun since it's communal seating, but beware because it fills up quickly during prime dining hours. It's kinda operates like a fast food joint, but the food tastes so much healthier. Owners were so nice! Oh...if you don't know the area, parking is a huge pain in the you know what.
