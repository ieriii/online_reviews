I have only been here once, but I fell in love with Le Colonial immediately. It's the perfect place for a date or grabbing dinner/drinks with friends. Sitting beneath the leaves on their balcony, I felt as though I wasn't even in Chicago! It has such a foreign feel- It is so unique and cozy. I definitely will be going back!
