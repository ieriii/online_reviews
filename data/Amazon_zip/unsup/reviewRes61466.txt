Best tacos on Taylor Street. The steak and chicken are of the highest quality, and you can taste the lime in the steak as they squeeze it on during the char-grill process. Tostadas are exceptional and do not fall apart. The burritos don't seem that big to me so I always ask for extra meat (charge for that). They have fries if you ask for them - fresh cut potatoes. Worth the wait. I tend to eat here for lunch almost daily. They will also make things for you that are not on the menu. Family run business, and they tell me they are related to the family that operates Zacas Tacos. Their char grilling recipe is very similar. The only downside is it is very small, seating is limited. They get very busy very quickly. If you can grab a seat and it's not over 95 degrees outside, it's the perfect place to grab a quick high quality lunch. I actually get disappointed when it's too busy because there's really no place better than this in the area without getting in the car and driving away...
