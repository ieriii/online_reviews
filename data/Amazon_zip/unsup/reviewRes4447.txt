This is the place to go for jazz in Chicago. Get there before the show starts if you want to get a seat. The cocktails are all right, but definitely not the draw. They're reasonably priced, definitely strong, but there's no creativity or love put into the drinks. But that's ok, you're there for the jazz. And the jazz is spectacular. If you're looking for a place to have jazz playing in the background this ain't it, but if you want to hear world-class jazz in a captivating setting, it doesn't get better than the Green Mill.
