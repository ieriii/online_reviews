Not going to lie, I was very surprised at how much i like this place. I walked by many times putting it off as just another large italian restaurant (like a neighborhood magianos or something). Eventually I got stuck going due to some very picky/non-experimental eaters in my group, and i had a GREAT time! good drink menu, full but not over the top food menu, and a fun atmosphere. The bartenders were entertaining and poured some good drinks - always a plus - and the patrons seem like regulars up at the bar. I tend to get the same thing when i go there - buffallo calamari (YUM and a huge serving!) and one of their thin crust signature pizzas. they make a good pizza. This place is definitely worth a stop if you're in the mood for reasonably priced good italian food in a fun, chill environment.
