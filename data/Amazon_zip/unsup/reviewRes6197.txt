Went there for the first time last night with a small group of friends. I was shocked at how crowded this place was, but it was a Saturday night.... It was a little overwhelming at first, but after sitting and getting into dinner it was fine. I ordered a spinach salad minus the bacon, a cup of crab and (some other seafood) bisque, and for dinner had an appetizer, the chicken and portabello skewers. EVERYTHING was awesome. I was full and didn't spend a lot of money either. With tax and tip I paid $25.00. Not bad. But I will definitely be going back to this place again!
