Just got a chance to come back here for brunch...excellent dishes and wasn't disappointed, though I think the dinner menu was a bit more interesting and creative. I had the peeky toe crab benedicts, which had the most perfect poached and gigantic eggs i have ever had. if you don't like runny egg/egg whites, this is probably not for you. What made this benedicts different from other places' was the semi-translucent, runny egg whites, sorta surrounding the brightly orange and gigantic egg yolks, which sat on top of the crab meat on two thick slices of english muffins i have ever seen at any brunch place. Very well made benedicts! I saw the "house potatoes" my friend had at his PBR breakfast...had i known this is how L&E does their house potatoes, i would have asked for it instead of my mixed greens with my benedicts! The weekend punch was really refreshing as well, and went really well with our food choices :)
