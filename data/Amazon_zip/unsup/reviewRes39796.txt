Can I give it less than 1 star? Gross as hell! My friends and I decided to try this place one night around 10pm. We had all heard good things about it before and I'm always up for trying new food. The parking lot is too small and weird - it looks like a bunch of 5-year-olds parked in all different directions. We parked on a side street and I recommend anyone brave enough to eat here to also park on the side street unless you don't care about your car. Well, I had never had Korean food so I asked my friend what to get and she made some suggestions. I don't remember the food at all. All I remember is the extremely rude waitress and the DISGUSTING smoke all over! I literally got up before the check came and left some money and waited outside. I couldn't breathe and was about to throw up. I wasn't aware that you were supposed to be smoked along with your food at Korean BBQ. I hated it and will never go back! A nasty, rude, little smokehouse! Enjoy!
