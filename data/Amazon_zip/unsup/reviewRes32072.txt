With over 700 reviews, doubtful mine will matter much. This place was recommended to us from the hotel concierge on a recent visit to Chicago. Coming from LA. I'm not exactly in need of a recommendation that is accompanied by " the place where the most celebs are seen".. so we were just looking for a nice place to dine that was within walking distance to our hotel.. Is this place trendy looking? Yes. Are there lots of good looking people sitting around here waiting to be "seen"? Yes. It's a cute place and if by looks alone will certainly impress those you'll want to impress.. sadly, can't say much for the food though. And at these prices, I kinda wanna be impressed.  We tried the beef lollipops and a few other appetizers, however the lollipops were a huge disappointment. The quality of meat = not there. The meat was tough and you can't really enjoy chewy meat can ya? Pretty bland as well. The Malay bass was probably the best dish.  Sashimi was a very light pale in color.. (looked more like salmon) not the usual deep red melt in your mouth tuna I'm used to.. not sure what it was after all.?? All in all, not a lot of "substance" here food wise. I felt like the ingredients were not the high quality that the menu prices command here..  Not gonna be a repeater...
