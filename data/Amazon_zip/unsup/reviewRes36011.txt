Such a great selection of menu items here, it's hard to decide what to eat for breakfast... they all sound so good! We ended up deciding on the caramel banana pancakes, stuffed strawberry french toast, pear juice, and the orange/banana/strawberry with honey juice. The pancakes were amazing. Light and fluffy texture with a great balance of flavors- just enough banana, nuttiness from the pecans, and a little bit of sweetness from the caramel... excellent! I actually was more excited to try the stuffed strawberry french toast, but the flavors were a little too strong for me. Definitely too sweet and maybe I got a lump of butter or something, but it was so buttery I had trouble eating my third of the plate. The idea of this french toast sounds great, but it just wasn't put together right for my taste (and I've got a real sweet tooth!). Pear juice was great but we weren't fans of the orange/banana/strawberry with honey. A little too many flavors going on for us and a little strong on the honey taste. Overall, a pleasant experience. We'd definitely come back again and recommend this place as a great spot for breakfast. Good, friendly, quick service and the place was nice, clean, and cozy as well.
