loved this place! the tortas are so delicious. i had the cubana and it was sooo good. it had a very light and fresh taste despite having all the pork and cheese and everything else that was in it. the chips and salsa were really good as well. i could eat a whole basket of those chips by itself. can't wait to come back and try some of the other things on the menu. =)
