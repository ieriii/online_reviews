Classic Italian at its very best. It reminded me of some of the places back home in NJ. Dated but timeless decor that makes you feel like you are in a mob movie. Staff is friendly and you can tell that the waitresses have been there forever. Food was excellent! and portions generous. This is the kind of place that you go time after time because you always know exactly what you'll get. And the price is fair! Worth the trip.
