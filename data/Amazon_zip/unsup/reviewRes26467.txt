We came in here based on a friend's recommendation. For the price, it tastes decent and the portion is generous. Soon after we were seated we were given free appetizers besides the usual salsa and chips. The staff here was also friendly. Though there were some feelings of unease due to the fact they were cleaning out the second part of the restaurant around 10pm. Kind of felt rushed to finish... Things went well. I might come back if I ever have cravings.
