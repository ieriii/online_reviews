This place loses starts for stupid reasons really, but I have to be honest. Food: GREAT. This is some yummy different pizza from the norm. They have different sauces you can put on it and the type of cheese they put on it is what they are known for. Beers: Hello! Who's got a brewery?! Yeah they do. So they have fabulous microbrews that you can't have elsewhere and what goes better with pizza. Service: BLOWS. First off there were empty tables with no one sitting at them, because they "weren't seating there." Hi understaffed-ness on a saturday afternoon? Seriously come on? And its very confusing in general about seating at different times of day. Atmosphere: So its got this sorta sports bar thing goin' on which is ok... however sometimes its get very loud, very rowdy and not the place you want to eat dinner at. Also I think they allow children here, but don't quote me on that it was a while ago when I went. Karaoke: Oh yeah they have "Live Band" karaoke. But if you don't get your name on that list and sit around at the beginning of the night don't expect to get on the last later in the eve and make it on stage by last call.
