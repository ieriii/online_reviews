I go here about once every other week and I'm hooked on their food! Love their seoul steak bowl, as well as their burritos. Of course, the wings rock as well. Just great flavors...have never been disappointed with a meal there. Sometimes, the place gets packed and just one person is working the register and phones while trying to get food out - service may get slow at that point, but I'm willing wait to a bit. The food makes any delays totally worth it!
