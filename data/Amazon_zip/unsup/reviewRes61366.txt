I stopped in for lunch with a coworker this week. I had this desire for Brazilian food, after having been to a new Brazilian style pizzeria called Fogo 2 Go last week. I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses, but not to this one yet.  I must say that this is now my favorite, but there is still one, Texas of Brazil, that I haven't tried yet...The service was excellent, and the food was awesome. I had this like Risoto Mushroom thing that was just out of this world. We didn't fill up to much on the salad bar, but did have some delicious parm cheese and light veggies. The steaks were awesome, and I luved the sausage and chicken. The best part was the $19 something price..We took a long,,long..long lunch, maybe almost 2 hours, just kicked back and enjoyed ourselves. Made my day a bit longer, but was well worth it..  Awesome food, great lunch price..Go check it out...
