Rock Star! I cant beleve I lived in the area and just looked at Superdawg as a cute nostalgic place that I never went too. The best non Vienna Beef Hot Dog anywhere, juicy and very flavorful. Love the SuperFries even though there not fresh cut and the little thing like the Pickled Tomato. The SuperOnion Chips, it really is a unique and wonderful place very different from the other top of the line Hot Dog stands. Dont miss the great shakes!
