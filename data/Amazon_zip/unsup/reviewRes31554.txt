Husband and I are on a Vegan-ish diet ... don't ask. Anyways, we wanted to find a place that we could actually eat out at and the Chicago Diner was the best thing that we could have ever found!! I had an amazing Black Bean Burger, which was the special for the night, husband had the enchiladas with soy cheese and we both walked away impressed. Maybe going Vegan for awhile doesn't have to be that bad!  There was a small wait when we got there, but we were seated within 15 minutes. Our server was super friendly and very accommodating when it came to our questions and requests. The food came out very quick and as I said before it was great!! We can't wait to go back - there are so many things that I want to try.
