Garcia's Restaurant isn't bad, it's just...I can't put my finger on it. I heard from some people who've been there before the renovations that they were more customer-oriented than they are now. I think because they expanded the restaurant and they have more room now, they're more focused on higher turnovers than individual customer satisfaction, which is understandable, considering how big it is now compared to before and they need to fill more seats. I just don't want them to focus more on being a franchise restaurant like TGI Friday's or Olive Garden rather than an individual restaurant. I will say this. Every time I go there, I always get at least one horchata (rice water for those who don't know) for myself. Those things are delicious. Most of the time, I don't deviate from what I know when I order there. I usually get the beef quesadilla, which is a very large portion in itself. It comes complete with rice, beans, and a little lettuce and tomatoes, which I'm assuming is more of a garnish but I gobble those up too. :) In any case, there's still hope for this restaurant in being a staple of Lincoln Square rather than just having robot employees serve me tacos. Break the habit, Garcia's!...and you'll see more of me soon.
