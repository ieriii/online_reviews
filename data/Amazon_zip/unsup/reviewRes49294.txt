i've been here a few times and i've never really been disappointed, nor have i been blown away. the place is huge and for a friday night, we got in within 15 minutes. i sat at the bar to wait for my friend, and then we sat near a window behind the bar. i ordered a wine flight and the mussels, which were pretty good. my friend ordered the burger, and devoured the entire thing. this is definitely a go-to place if you're not looking for something too fancy, a just a bit low key. and if you love wine, of course it's a great place to go!
