I know everyone likes the scene - that's nice - I am not knocking the crowd - they are cute. The staff are soldiers - this place is too corporate for me = they are blatantly turning tables as ordered . Simply put Sushi Samba did this 10 years ago - and it was better /fresher/hipper... Come on Billy you can do better. And next time does the place have to be so big - something very corporate and unsatisfying about a place as big as a commissary.
