At my job I deal with a lot of people who are new to Chicago. Often, we talk about the things that make this city an awesome place to live...and of course, food is right up there at the top of my list. This place is just the best, and I always go out of my way to recommend it to recent Chicago transplants. Maybe not the textbook "Chicago-style" pizza (for that how could you not recommend Lou Malnati's?), but from the large chunks of sausage to the carmelized crust, I've never had a Pequod's pizza that was less than delicious. I've eaten at Pequod's for years & years-first up in Morton Grove, and now in Lincoln Park-and never get tired of it. Can't go too long without getting my Pequod's fix. Yum!
