Yum. That's not all that can be said about Crisp, but that's how I'm starting. It was good. I like wings. I ordered a half order and couldn't finish. They were in seoul sassy sauce, which was tasty. And the chicken-super crisp (duh) and delicious. Very good hot. I'm struggling to describe my meal, as it was really good. I didn't finish all of my wings, which made me sad. The rest of my party got the bulgogi rice bowl, which I tried some of, which was also excellent-a little sweet for my taste, but I can deal with it. Plus, there's sirracha on the table, so putting that to good use on everything is always a plus. Boyfriend got chicken tenders in the hot sauce. He didn't like them, but I say he was probably expecting something else. I think the meat on the bone is the real winner here, friends. Fries were excellent, not a soggy one in sight. Pop selection was legit but pricey and I guess I didn't realize that water was free right away or else I would have just done that to begin with. I'll be back for sure.
