I've been meaning to write a review on them for a while, went again to GE last night and said to myself "Dammit Cassie, you need to get yourself on the interwebs and review GE!". So here I am! Here's what I love about this place: 1. Fun atmosphere-yes they make fancy pants things like balsamic foams and pistachio panna cotta ribbons (this might be an inaccurate name but if you ask for this, the staff will probably know what you're saying) but they manage to do it in a way that doesn't feel stuffy or snooty. I pantomimed strapping the basket of truffled popcorn to my face and no one blinked an eye. I like that. 2. Interesting, unique and really yummy wine list and cocktail list. I have never heard of most of these winemakers, which I really appreciate. I want to try new things, not just order the same wine everywhere I go. The sommelier and the bartenders are helpful and give great advice about what to drink. I've actually never made it to a table at GE, just always had drinks and nibbies at the bar-which I highly recommend doing!  3. Inventive, complex food-again, somehow they manage to combine lots of flavors and textures without getting crazy. The fig appetizer with fresh cheese, prosciutto and micro greens melts in your mouth (then you have a little crunch from the crisped prosciutto). The butternut squash soup with ginger and a marshmallow is rich and creamy. The scallops were buttery and wonderful. The "indoor s'more" is not to be missed! 4. Great service-I've seen on other reviews that people haven't liked the service but my experience (have been here several times to date) has always been really good! From the hostesses, bartenders and the people who brought our food , everyone was friendly, enthusiastic and quick to explain what we were eating and drinking.
