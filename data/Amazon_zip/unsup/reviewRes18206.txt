Luckily, I was able to try XOCO the weekend before I went to Frontera Grill. You're probably wondering what's with the three measly stars? I don't know, it wasn't all that i was expecting it to be. Don't get me wrong, it was good and definitely not bad. Not only that, they got this awesome system going on with shuffling customers in and out without clogging up the lines. That doesn't stop the line from building up though. This is based solely off of whatever sandwiches I had. Anyway, I got the carne asada sandwich which was a little on the expensive side for what you get. I also ordered the chorizo sandwich for the girlfriend. Now, if you take a step back and look at exactly what you ordered, what you got, and how much you paid...it doesn't quite add up. It's literally just a sandwich with sauce to dip. *dont get me wrong, its still good* Then, when you eat it, you'll notice that the bread is awesome; a lovely crust with a soft inside. The contents are full of flavor but just isn't satisfying. I'm not sure if its this notion that I have with sandwiches - they better be full of ingredients. Then you take a look at your sauce...which may be more on the creative side due to the fact that you're pairing the two. But thats all it is... But do try the churros!! I wish I could do 3.5 stars. Seriously fresh and crispyslashcrunchy with this chocolate dipping sauce. Try taking a shot of that and it'll put you out for the rest of the night. Amen.
