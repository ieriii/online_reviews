A great new addition to the North Center neighborhood. They have an excellent beer list and many of them are local and on tap. Some haterz say that the bad apple is trying to be the next Kumas, but I don't think so. They are just making great food that you don't have to wait for 2hrs for. They also run daily specials. 3.50 for a craft brew.....not a bad deal at all....
