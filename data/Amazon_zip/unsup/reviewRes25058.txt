This was one of the best dining experiences I have had in a while.  We were looking for late dining on a Saturday night and decided on Mercat. We couldn't have made a better decision. The restaurant was lively but not obnoxious, the service was great and the food was absolutely fantastic. A few recommendations, although I don't think you can go wrong with anything here: cheese: cana de cabra - goat cheese with strawberry balsamic tapas: pimientos de padron, bacon wrapped dates, spanish octopus, flatbread: short rib (sounds strange, tastes unbelievable) We are fairly picky eaters (one of us, very) and we did not have a single complaint during this meal. Not one. Nothing but great things at Mercat. I can't wait to go back.
