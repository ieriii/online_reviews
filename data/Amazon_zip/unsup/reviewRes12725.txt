I first went to this restaurant for my birthday with a group of friends, and we were all drooling over our plates. Every dish had a unique flavor, and the plantains were the best. I enjoyed the selection of drinks, including the frozen mojito. I also went back a few weeks later for brunch...and that blew me away even more than the dinner! I had the crabcake benedict, and it was the best eggs benedict-style dish I've ever had! And, that's my favorite brunch plate, so I've tried a lot of places. They add just a hint of spice to the hollandaise sauce that makes it unbearably good. My friend had something like stuffed waffles...heavenly! Yeah, this place is amazing.
