I love this place! My friend and I stopped in here for some coffee one afternoon. The coffee was boldly-flavored and strong, just like I like it.  We sat at the coffee bar, and chatted with one of the servers throughout the time we were there. Very friendly and attentive. Both my friend and I ordered a salad. I had the Southwestern salad. So yummy and it had the perfect amount of dressing. Tasted very fresh. I am looking forward to coming here again.  The server also mentioned that they are trying to add dinner to the menu. Looking forward to it!
