I was expecting Calo to be sub-par compared to the many great Italian restaurants in Anersonville/Edgewater, but was surprised to find that it was very nice. The crowd is older, dressed nicely. I expected the menu to be pricey (based on the fancy dress), but was in the $13-$25 range per person (a lot of pasta dishes were around $14). Full stocked bar. Live Jazz Trio playing standards and Sinatra. Fancy decor and low lighting. The pizza bread that they give you before the meal is 5 star. I had the vegetable lasagna, which was stuffed with ricotta and fresh spinach. Yum. I would recommend this place as a good date spot.
