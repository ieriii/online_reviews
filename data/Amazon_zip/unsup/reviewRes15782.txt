I would give this place a 4.5 stars if that was an option. The food was excellent; some of the best I've ever had, and everyone in our party was very satisfied with the food. Our waitress was great, and the food came quickly. The atmosphere is great, and even the bathrooms and the corridor to the bathrooms is cool. The only down side is waiting even when you have a reservation. We made reservations, showed-up on time, and waited 45 min. to be seated. One of my friends who lives in Chicago, and had been there before said that the wait was typical even if you had a reservation. The meals & drinks are also expensive, but expected at a place like this. When you get there, check-in with the hostess, get a drink, and chill-out until they buzz you because it could be a while. Great food, drinks, and service (besides the wait).
