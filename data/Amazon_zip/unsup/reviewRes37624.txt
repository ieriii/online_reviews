You can never go wrong with anything on the menu at Fox and Obel's Cafe. Whether you're here for brunch or lunch, everything is super tasty and prepared fast and fresh. Picks are the black bean burger with sweet potato fries, any of the specialty cafe drinks (brewed with inteligentsia coffee beans!!), and the fruit/yogurt/granola parfait.
