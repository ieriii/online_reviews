When I saw this place being built down the street and read the reviews on yelp of the other location, I was excited to try it. While it did not disappoint, I was not blown away either. We'll start with the setup. The inside is very crowded, like they tried to cram as many tables into the seating area as possible, but didn't leave enough room between tables to maneuver. They have a nice outdoor patio in the back, but seeing as how it was hot we ate inside. They left the door to the patio open, however, so despite the constantly running A/C, it was still rather warm in the restaurant. I got the cubano sandwich which I found quite delectable. The bread was delicious and the meat was very fresh. My wife got the croqueta sandwich, which I thought was good, but she wasn't a very big fan. The french fries were very good, nice breading and good texture. Overall a good experience and I would probably come back.
