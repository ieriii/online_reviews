ONLY EXPECT TO LOVE IT IF YOU LIKE PORK AND BEER. This place is so good that it has converted me on lots of things I never expected to like, such as sweetbreads (wikipedia says its thymus glands and pancreas... in this case of cows). Really, be adventurous there because you'll never find a better restaurant in which to do so. The dinner is great, the beer list is great, but I really think they shine at brunch. And really it seems like an amazing deal, like $8 to $11 for meals, and I think extra sides like their special bacon are $4. That bacon is amazing, its not even right to call it bacon. Its like a half an inch thick and the maple syrup on it caramelizes when they cook it and the meat pretty much falls apart when you touch it. It is so good its not even funny.  Their bloody marys are really good too and when you order them you get a little 4 or 5 ounce cup of beer of your choice among three. I think this place is really fantastic for any occasion including just meeting for drinks and small snacks. Some people don't like the communal tables thing, others do - just beware that that's the way it is there. If you are a group of 3 or 4 you can probably request to be in the pigsties (these little closed pens with tables for four inside).  The decor is pretty cool; it looks like its all custom made wood, like the bathroom doors which are probably 10 feet tall. Unique at least !
