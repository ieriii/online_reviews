Yes! Yes! Yes! The menu changes often, so if you read it online, don't except the same when you go. It is a good price for a prix fix menu. I had foie gras with beets and Wild Striped Bass with octopus, apple and curry sauce. For desert, I had a goat cheese cake that tasted kind of like a margarita. The dishes are inventive, they taste amazing, and there are two mini courses included in between. I was very full at the end of the meal.
