I haven't been to many top-notch dining establishments, but this was definitely an experience. I'd say the service is superb - came here for a surprise birthday and while the staff ruined my not-so-complete surprise by wishing the birthday girl "Happy Birthday" I thought it was very cool that all our servers were aware of it and greeted her that way. The menu was customized to include the birthday girl's name...later on, there was the tiniest piece of cake I've ever seen, but it was all done very tastefully and artistically. They also saved a copy of the menu with her name on it and included the menu of what we ate along with it as a parting gift. The decor at Tru was very cool, seemed like an art gallery, me being my simple self was in awe at some weird neon light fixture which had an amazing depth to it. I also really liked, what appeared to be a painting of shadows of Tinkerbells. I was a bit surprised that the dining population did not include many old dudes with young knockouts, but maybe it was an off night =p Did notice that over half of the clientele were bald/balding.  The food itself I had mixed thoughts on - had the Market 6 course tasting. The main courses were both very good, particularly the squab. Other dishes were very interesting and culinary creations, but not so dear to my palette. There were so many items I documented with pictures but I can't recall them all. The candy cart at the end on the pushcart was quite fun. Oddly enough, I came away quite satisfied and not hungry as I would have thought about a tasting menu going in. Again though, I thought the service was fantastic, did not experience the pompousness expressed by some yelpers - in fact, did not really get any weird treatment at all, which I might have expected since both my companion and I look like young kids. Thoroughly enjoyed the evening.
