I've only had the pleasure to dine here twice though I pass it every time I go to work. On both occasions, I had the pho which was amazing and very filling and for a good price. The service was not spectacular, but tolerable. I also decided to try out a boba freeze while I was there. It was good and came with a nice bit of fresh fruits on top. However, it was a bit pricey for such a small amount. I would definitely come back sometime in the future and get a taste of something different.
