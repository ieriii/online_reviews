Not for the easily claustrophobic.  I'm 5'4" (okay 5'3.5") and I'm pretty sure I could touch the ceilings.  In fact, I'm certain of it in the "romantic" little booth we got.  There are also no windows, so that really didn't help.  I wanted to love it here since I know my grandparents did, but I just wasn't feeling it.   Portions were huge, and very few places still offer soup and salad with entrees.  Nice bonus. Be warned if you're a vegetarian: the free pizza bread that looks so inviting has meat sauce on it.   It's a charge if you want it meatless. I did really like the Special Salad.  Artichokes and Avocados, yum. Our waitress was also very nice.  My dad might've been a little tipsy and not that funny, but she was really good at pretending to laugh.
