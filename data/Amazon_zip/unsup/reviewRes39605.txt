First of all, honestly, people who DO NOT KNOW KOREAN FOOD should not comment about the way the food is prepared or brought out. I just read an idiot who wrote that if you order one order of BBQ, they will cook old kalbi in the kitchen instead of table service to "scam non-Koreans and to make sale". What an idiotic thing to say!!! Go to ANY KOREAN RESTAURANT, and they will all do the same thing!!! All Korean BBQs tabletop are 2 orders minimum! It's NOT to sell old kalbi or to push for sales! I bet this idiot will complain at any other restaurant if they say "two orders minimum." There is a reason they do this, and if you do not know, then maybe you should just be quiet. Okay. now that the hostility I was feeling towards that stupid yelper has subsided, I would like to say SSGS has been pointed out more than once for their poor service. I have been going to SSGS for 15 years or so since college...and it has been getting worse over time, it seems. It doesn't matter if you have a language barrier or not. I've been here with Koreans, non-Koreans, family, friends, co-workers....and no matter who I'm there with, it's poor service.  I can see that the manager has been leaving messages about improving their service, and I do know that it is harder to get older Korean women to be nicer and more attentive. They can be quite stubborn and angry at times..... But this isn't some Korean market in some province of jeon-lado. This is U.S., meaning, you have to EARN those tips, not expect it. And language barrier is NO EXCUSE for bad service. Honestly, those ladies really must hate themselves and their work, because it shows on their tired, angry faces. The food is okay, the side dishes are good, the prices are moderate. But you lose 2 stars for bad service...which I hope will improve over time.
