We have been going to Cara Mio for 5 or 6 years now, at least once or twice a month. Living only a few blocks away, it had always been a favorite. The last few times, however, things changed. The quality, friendly service that we always enjoyed has gone completely downhill. The level of food has been a bit spotty also, but given that we have always loved this place, we were willing to overlook these things as a minor speedbump. This changed last night when we phoned in a delivery order. The service was relatively quick, which was nice. When we opened our bags of food, however, we were stunned. Not only was it not what we ordered, the look and smell left a lot to be desired. We called the restaurant and told them that we were delivered someone elses order. We asked that they pick it up and deliver the correct order and that we were willing to wait. We were treated extremely rudely and told we could PAY for a new order and that it would be 90 minutes before they would deliver again. We were stunned and told them no thanks and that they had lost two very loyal customers.
