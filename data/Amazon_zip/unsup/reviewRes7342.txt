Great experience all around.  Host was engaged and helpful. Bread is special, really fresh. Waiter was attentive, helpful and gave great recommendations. Outside seating is not over the top but lovely. The dish I could not stop thinking about was the pumpkin filled ravioli which is a main course we ordered for an app. Fresh pasta but sauted to a crunch on the outside, pine nuts and fried sage. 5 star dish, really special. Wife had veal which had pounds of cheese. Mother in law had stuffed chicken. They both enjoyed but comments on how heavy. The waiter did not suggest either dish and pointed out that there is a ton of cheese in the veal. Man it is rough owning a restaurant. Their comments had no effect on my rating of this restaurant but did have an effect on my rating of their ability to make choices. My pasta was excellent.  3 reasons I did not give 5 stars: reserving my first 5 star rating for absolute perfection ... thought my pasta should have been cooked for 2 minutes less and the mussels were good but not outstanding. Happy to go back anytime.
