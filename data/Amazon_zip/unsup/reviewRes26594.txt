this dainty food was very tasty. i went there for lunch w/ a friend for their "Catalan express menu" and thought i was going to be starving after my plates were served (portions are small). it's not quantity but quality here - kudos to the chef. the service was good and although i dined at their outdoor patio, i snuck a peek at the main dining room and was impressed. i'll make sure to go with fatter pockets to get the full dining experience at dinner time in their main dining room. it'll be worth it for that special occasion.
