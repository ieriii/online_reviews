Food: YES! Service: On the cusp of terrible We had a reservation but they weren't quite ready to seat us. So the host showed us to the "bar" which is a pub height table that looks like cattle should be tied to it. While we were waiting for the others, I ordered (and pointed to it on the menu) a regular "bottomless cup" of coffee and my friend ordered a bloody mary. Ten minutes later, the rest of our party arrived and my coffee was still MIA. A different waitress came over and asked if we wanted any drinks so we told her that we had ordered coffee and a bloody mary. Eventually I get a french press coffee and my friend gets nothing. Ok...this is starting of great. After a few minutes we realize that they still have yet to come get us for our table. After asking the hostess about the ETA on our table she says, "oh yes, we've been ready for you." Ok...and when were you going to tell us that? We sit outside where all of the people who like to "be seen" are eating. Ten minutes later, our waiter shows up to take our order. When we do finally get our food, I must say, its delicious. They have the best french toast! I mean it is d-lish. The lox dish was really good too. The food is the only element worth rating. Unfortunately, its not enough for me to go back. I just couldn't believe how unorganized this place was.
