One drunken night, around the halfway point in a sordid send-off of a former temp at my office, I went to get some beer down the street from this intoxicating little chicken hut. As I was purchasing said beer it hit me that I was in the vicinity of that magical Korean taste-palace, Crisp. I coerced my compatriots to take the hike for some off-the-beaten-path flavor and the El Dorado of taste was to be found at road's end. The chicken was moist, the breading crisp and the sauces flavorful and not cloying. We devoured the first two orders and were able to crack the beers we had just purchased as well. Well, me...I was drinking a can of Aloe Water, since my love for that little jelly-drink runs deep.
