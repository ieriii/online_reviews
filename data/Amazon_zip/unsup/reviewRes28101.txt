My favorite Mexican Restaurant in Chicago so authentic. The BEST steak tacos, nachos chorizo, tacos sabinas with carne asada everything Ive had has been the best ive ever had. The atmosphere is just soso but the food makes up for it. Gets very crowded at lunch time from about 1130-130. If you go go before 1130 or later afternoon otherwise you will be waiting in an uncomfortable line that forms thru the restaurant right next to people eating.
