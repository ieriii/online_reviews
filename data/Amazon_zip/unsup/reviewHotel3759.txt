I tried HOTELS TONIGHT, an iPad app for the first time. Imagine me (if you knew me) going to a city without a hotel reservation. Well, I gave it a try and came across the Dana Hotel and Spa. My thoughts. . . Very well located. Very hip but not in an exclusive way that makes you feel like you shouldn't be there. Kind of awkward going in because you go into their restaurant, Aja, then take the elevator to the second floor. You can check in via kiosk or sit down at one of their desks. Lobby is a bit cozy but they make good use of the space. The rooms. . .comfortable, modern, clean, very well laid out. And not that I use the mini bar and snack bar but nice to see it filled with creative snacks. And the service is VERY friendly. Like "let me get you a cab" before you ask friendly. Like "did you have a good day" and really mean it friendly. A word of warning, the higher up the floor, the louder it will be as there is a hip nightclub on the top floor. Overall. . .I would head back here and pay the $100 more per night that it would cost with a normal reservation. YELP OBSERVATION: I have seen a couple of reviewers that don't post a fifth star for a place until they have visited more than once. I think I like that practice. Any thoughts?
