I came to this place before I knew Jose Garces was on Iron Chef and wish I paid more attention now. I went here with someone who knew the menu pretty well, and another person who didn't. We were at the mercy of her choices and she nailed it. We picked a bottle of wine at random and didn't do the pairing. This is a highly stylized tapas restaurant - it's not like Ba Ba Reeba, which I think of as more traditionally tapas-like. We did a modified tasting that they changed to accomodate an allergy for me. Braised rabbit ravioli, cocas, patatas bravas, mushrooms, ahi, and some really damn good iberico ham. Meat a la planxa is the big finish and it is delicious but the portions are small and there's a lot of sharing/interacting going on. It's well presented but nothing too weird. This is the second of two places I would ever bother taking the train to Harrison for (Custom House is the other), as I'm not a fan of traveling this area these days - hang out for a half hour on the platform underground or on some of the corners after 11pm or so, and you'll start to see why. It is weird that this place is inside of a hotel, too. I feel like it needs its own spot to really work. In a narrow cool tapas bar setting I feel like it'd be a major winner. I had a very flirty waiter here who I wish I remembered. Oops.
