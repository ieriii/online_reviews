I used to be a regular at Glenn's. Every weekend, my girlfriend and I would go there for brunch. The last several visits have been a big disappointment though. After the reconfiguration, the seating became tight and uncomfortable. Secondly the service went from being friendly to surly. Finally the quality of the food and service has taken a huge nose dive! Three times I had made advanced reservations, for a moderate-sized group (six people) and two out of three times a table wasn't ready for us, in fact, we had to wait more than a half hour for our table! On one such occasion, when we had an advanced reservation, there was an open table reserved for a same sized group behind us, yet they didn't make any adjustments to sit us and give the group behind us the table. We were forced to wait for a full hour, while those who had reservations behind us got seated ahead of us! Then another time my girlfriend and I went there, and the service was so poor, the waitress never checked if we needed more coffee or water, or to see if the food was OK. We only got one cup of coffee, no extra water and the order was incomplete! We decided not to go back for a while. When we did, they had Mrs. Butterworth's on the table. I asked the waitress if Glenn's had Maple Syrup, even for an additional charge (which I gladly would have paid). She pointed at the bottle and said 'dat's all we got. Well, DAT'S DA LAST TIME I EVAH GO DEAH! For the prices they charge, I could do better cooking for myself at home. Yeah I make it better too!
