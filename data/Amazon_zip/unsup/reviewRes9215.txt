This restaurant is absolutely amazing. Excellent food and service. The atmosphere is casual and simple. They serve a variety of excellent dishes and have plenty of vegetarian options. I recommend ordering several appetizers on a first visit and splitting an entre in order to try more flavors. The hummus, baba ghannouj, and dolmeh (vegetarian grape leaves) are all great starters. Noon-O-Kabab is one of the best restaurants in Chicago.
