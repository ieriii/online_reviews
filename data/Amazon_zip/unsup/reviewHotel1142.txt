Love this place! Spent my birthday weekend with my friends here. They gave us a really nice room on the 31st floor with a really rad view. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. The staff was outstanding. They gave us an empty mini fridge to store our drinks and food in for the weekend. The valet even told us a cheaper garage to park at for the weekend that was very close to the hotel. The bathroom was perfect for 4 girls to share it. Lots of mirrors, separate shower and bath and lots of lighting. Very close to Millennium Park which was great for the St. Patrick's Day parade. Great hotel!
