Yummy! Waited over a year to try this place that I heard raves about and it was worth the wait. A friend and I shared 10 delicious gigantic seoul sassy chicken wings and a baby buddha bowl. Didn't notice the option for organic brown rice until after we had finished, but I'll definitely be back. Only challenge was seating. At 7:45 on a Tuesday night, the place was packed, so we sat at stools in the window.
