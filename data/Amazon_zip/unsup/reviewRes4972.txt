OMG meatfest. Meatfest party in my mouth. Makes me so happy. Things to prepare yourself and make the most of your Purple Pig experience: * No reservations--get over it. Get there earlier than you'd want to eat and have a drink or nine. And if you're lucky, they'll bring you these roasted pig-fat almonds (not the correct name) * There may be a few drunken tourists there. Just give them dirty looks and move on with eating your meat. * You're likely going to get bumped. Again--get over it and eat your meat. * A few of the must haves (likely not the right names): fried olives, cucumber feta frappe, milk-braised pork shoulder, pigs ear. Most of all--enjoy the fried goodness.
