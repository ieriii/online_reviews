All the food I've had here has been very yummy but the standouts are definitely the avocado sandwich (the creaminess and heartiness has made it my hangover staple, I call ahead and pick one up to avoid the wait) and their home-made granola. The wait for brunch can vary a lot, but it's almost always 10 minutes at the very least. I would say milk and honey has the second-best brunch in bucktown after toast (bongo room is not on my list just because I can't stomach the wait).
