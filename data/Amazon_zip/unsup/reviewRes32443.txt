I had the black Bean Burger & I can't wait to go back and have it again. Add the avocado, it's a must. It was my 1st time trying the sweet potato fries and I love them.  I ordered them at another restaurant & it wasn't the same, so they make them just right. The Vegan chocolate shake is a must, even if you are full share it with your table!  It can get packed in there, so if you have to wait for a table it will be well worth it!
