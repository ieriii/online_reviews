Do steakhouses in Chicago always have an incredibly long wait? My friend and I reserved our table at 9:15 and were seated approximately at that time (i don't remember when it actually was). They offer a pretty tasty onion/cheese loaf, but some tables had 2 types of bread so i was a little confused. The waiter was helpful in explaining the different wines. I ordered the medallions with parmesan, mushroom, and double potato crusts, and my friend ordered the lamb chops. both of us wanted our meat medium. The medallion crusts were good. i particularly loved the mushroom crust. The lambchop was kind of all over the place. Some areas were very tough and hard to cut through. Having ordered a medium, i was expecting to cut through the meat with ease. Also, it took a very long time to chew both the medallions and the lamb chops. 2 of my medallions were medium-well, with slight pink and mostly cooked, and the mushroom medallion was the only one that was at a medium with a hint of red (no wonder it tasted so good). Plus, to ruin the mood, idk if the waitress was glaring at me, or a table in back, but man..... way to make the atmosphere uncomfortable. Not the most enjoyable moment when you see someone death-glaring at you. I think going to a mexican restaurant and getting carne adobada would've been better (for my wallet too). Overall, Service - 4, Food - 3, but minus points for the waitress glaring at my direction.
