We came to Gilt to celebrate a surprise engagement of 2 close friends. I called at 9:30 on a saturday night and we were able to be seated at 10:15. The one snag in our dinner was one of the bone marrow pieces was a little skimpy. When I asked the waitress if we could get another piece, she surpassed our expectations and brought an entirely new order over! Gilt has the best bone marrow of all the GP's so we were obviously very happy with their solution (though we wish the sea salt was still separate). Besides the marrow, we also ordered the pork belly and corn bread, both excellent. For dessert, we had the banana split and it was AMAZING!!!!! It's not their most popular and we have NO idea why. Between 4 people we basically licked ye plate clean and drank the leftover caramel and hot fudge. Thank you Gilt for being a key part of a special night amongst good friends!
