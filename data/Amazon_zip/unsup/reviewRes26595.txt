Never again! It's been 1hr 40m that I've waited, haven't even had my dinner and I'm writing this place off. Absolutely ridiculous service. I've been on hold three times now--the first time I called after an hour lapsed and they confirmed that a driver had already left. Fast forward 30m, still no pizza and they put me on hold twice, waiting a total of 10 min. and I just hung up out of frustration and generally feeling pissed off. I hope this pizza is worth the $0.00 I will be paying in total!!
