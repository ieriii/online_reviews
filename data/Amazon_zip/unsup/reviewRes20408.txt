great food at michigan avenue prices. we stopped in for dinner after seeing a concert at millenium park. great beer selection for george and a lovely glass of champagne for me. the service was friendly and attentive and i liked the atmosphere. we split the caesar salad which was really really good. then i went with the classic fish and chips (yum!) and george had the big eye tuna, which was fresh and delicious. i particularly liked that the manager was walking around to all the tables helping clear and making sure that everyone was happy. he even got me another glass of champagne when our waitress was busy with another table. we will definitely come back if we are in the area and hungry.
