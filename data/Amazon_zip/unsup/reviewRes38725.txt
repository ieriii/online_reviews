Admittedly I'm not quite a beer drinker, but considering they carry at a minimum 100+ different imports ranging in price from 3-100 bucks I always find one I want to try, or just order a martini. Very friendly and unpretentious vibe, the menu is great, the mussels are a must. Yes it does get packed quick, stand and relax with a beer while you wait for a seat.
