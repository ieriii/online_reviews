went here for lunch and sat outside on the patio, which was lovely...we couldn't decide what to get, so we asked our server to just bring a bunch of dishes that we could share, all delicious! rainbow roll, spicy tuna, kobe beef roll, pork buns, chicken w/ walnuts, summer salad, noodles etc. quite the feast! highly recommend this place!
