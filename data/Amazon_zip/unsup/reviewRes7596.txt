I found this restaraunt on Yelp and decided to give it a try and found it to be well deserving of its reviews. It was a Monday night, so we ate off the family night menu. With the family night special, a glass of wine each, and the tip, it ended up costing us roughly $75 for the two of us.  The bread came out right away was delicious. Always a plus when the bread is warm, right out of the oven. Appetizers: - The Bruschetta was good, but nothing more memorable than any other italian restaraunt - The Avocado Crostini was not only amazing, but a great change in what you usually see. I would definitely recommend this appetizer to everyone Soup/Salad; - The Caprese Salad was light and fresh an ranked up there wth some of the better ones I've had. The presentation, seen in th pictures, just adds that much more to it. - The Butternut Squash Soup was great for me, but a little on the sweeter side. Definitely not for someone who doesn't like brown sugar flavor, but I loved it. Entrees: - Chicken & Gnochhi w/ pesto, Rigattoni Caprese, and Pumpkin Stuffed Noodles were all fantastic. If the rest of their food is this good, I look forward to returning on another monday night. Desert: - This was where my only complaint came in. Their desert option were very limited on the family night. We ended up ordering bread pudding, but I just think I am not a huge fan of bread pudding, so I don't want to pass judgement on it. Just not the right desert for me. In the end, table service was great (my water never went empty & more bread was offered immediately), the hosts were friendly, and while eating outside you still felt secluded from the streets. I would highly recommend this restaraunt and can't wait to go back.
