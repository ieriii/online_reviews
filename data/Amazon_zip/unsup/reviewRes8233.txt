I thought this place was pretty good. Service was okay. Spacca uses good fresh ingredients on the pizza, like the basil on the Margarita pizza takes center stage in your mouth in flavor. But here's why the 3 stars, granted they use fresh ingredients, but those wonderful flavors were overshadowed by the charred and burned taste of the crust, then to justify that with $13-17 price tag, it was insult to injury. If not for the overwhelming charred taste, the crust is good and chewy (in a good way). I heard many good things about this place, I wish I would have experienced the same.
