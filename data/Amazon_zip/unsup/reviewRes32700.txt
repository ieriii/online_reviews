We had never had Ethiopian food before. They provided a very positive experience. The food was very good and the waitstaff was very helpful. They answered all of our questions and walked us through the menu helping us pick a sampling of items. It It's a white tablecloth sort of place, so it's suitable for a date, but still casual. It's also in an interesting neighborhood with the Aragon and Riviera just down the street. It took us a bit to get some parking, but that was our only hiccup.
