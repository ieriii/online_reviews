Tried this the other night with some friends visiting. The wait was long, but it was a Friday night, so to be expected. The pizza was fantastic - we went for classic red sauce with spinach, tomatoes, garlic, olives and sausage. Yummy! Perfect combo. I gave it 4 stars because the house brews are not good.
