I live in Arizona now and CRAVE Superdawg!!! BEST HOTDOGS IN CHICAGO!!!! It's always the first stop I make back home...I get a hotdog with all the fixins....all the Chicago fixins that is.....onions, mustard, tomato, relish, celery salt, and peppers.....and don't expect the red tomato because it comes with it's signature green tomatoes!! I order and extra order of the oh so greasy, delicious, crinkle cut fries.....I love it so much and make time to visit this landmark on Devon/Milwaukee!! YUM YUM!!! GET YOU SOME!
