What can I say that hasn't already been said ... This is one of my favorite spots in Chicago. I think the food is great, but what I most impressed with is the atmosphere. I wouldn't say style over substance, because I think the food and drinks at GB are good enough on their own. But IMO it's the environment that sets GB apart. I did have an issue with a reservation on the last visit. I made an on-line reservation 3 weeks in advance for a special anniversary dinner with my girlfriend, got a confirmation the night before ... and then the hostess tells me it was cancelled. Staff blamed it on Opentable. I was a little worried, as it was a Saturday night, place was packed, etc. I explained to the hostess my sitch ... and she was super apologetic, got us some champagne and assured us they would find a spot for us. Random tidbit: They actually seated us at the same table we had our first date at. Total coincidence, but worked out. I was very impressed with how they handled. Though, the fact that my reservation was cancelled hours before we showed up is bit concerning. I've been to Gilt Bar four times, and never have been disappointed with what I ordered. The triple creme dlice de bourgogne with apricot jam has become a staple of every visit. Loves it. I almost typed "for realz" because ... I am for real: it's good. Pot roast, ribeye, white fish, ricotta gnocchi ... all superb.  Love the drink list. A lot of people like the Pimms Cub, I like the Martinez, myself. Outstanding beer, wine and cocktail list. Dessert options aren't extensive, but what I've tried has been above average. Sidenote, everyone has their own taste in music. But I've got to say, every time I'm here the music is incredible. It's like my playlist on shuffle (Arcade Fire, Cure, Joy Division, Talking Heads, Shins, Al Green ...). Positives: Awesome atmosphere, fantastic food Negatives: Double check your reservation. Gilt Bar, I like you more than friends.
