I went here for lunch on a weekday and sat at one of the high-tops (tables were all reserved). The interior is nice but nothing too far removed from some of the older pub / restaurants in the loop area. I ordered the spicy black bean soup to start. It tasted like Campbell's black bean soup with a little hot sauce... no meat or texture to it at all.  I ordered the "Gage Burger" as my main thinking signature dish would change my mind. It was a regular burger with some sauted onions on top. The burger was boring and the fries were average. Everything from start to finish was just OK - maybe dinner is a better experience but I don't understand the hoopla. I could go to any bar in Chicago and get an equal dish for cheaper.
