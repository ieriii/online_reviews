I have been there for dinner 3 separate times.  In the beginning I was enamored with the food and feel of it.  Unfortunately my love for the place has gone down.  I always get the petite fillet Mignon.  It was perfectly cooked and everything I wanted it to be the first time.  The second time my cut of meat was less then awesome and more fatty.  We got the crab cake appetizer which wasn't anything special. The 3rd experience is what takes the cake in making me think otherwise before returning.  Our service was horrible.  Female server who's name I do not recall but would never sit in her section again.  My steak was fine, but my boyfriend who ordered his Medium came back truly well done. We are not usually the type to complain or send back food, but this time it felt like a worthy time. We alerted the server about it and she took it back to be replaced.  Never once saying "Oh I'm sorry about that, I'll get you a new one right away".  Or come over to give us a tentative time when his new food would be out.  So that left me feeling awkward about continuing to eat while he couldn't.  Communication is a wonderful thing.  Her service was not.  I'm not saying it was her fault or want her to take blame, but a little "heads-up" would've been much appreciated while we just waited.  I didn't expect it, but no comp or free dessert after all was said and done.  I may give it another go and hope she didn't ruin it for me because it definitely has good points! TIP: Definitely ask to be seated up off the main floor. Unless you like the hustle and bustle of people and servers and noise all around in tightly spaced tables.
