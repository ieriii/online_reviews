ok anyone who is rating this above 2 stars is crazy the sushi was horrible not to mention we ordered a chef selection and it came out with the most bland boring things you could think of. also the "chef" put not all the way un frozen bad tuna on the plate as well. The place was what it was but anything above 2 stars is so over the top.
