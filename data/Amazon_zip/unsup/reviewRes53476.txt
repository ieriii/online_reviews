Oui! This is ultimate high end comfort food. if you go, do the grand collection with a wine pairing which is a great value. You get to enjoy (2 oz pours) of some very special wines like 1985 vouvray moelleux le mont domaine huet . It is an $85 retail price chenin blanc that I could sip all day..I agree the dated and muted ambiance leaves something to be desired but the food and staff quality speak for themselves.
