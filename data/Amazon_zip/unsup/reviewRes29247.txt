I am basing this review entirely off of dining experiences that occured in 2004 to 2005. So things may have changed. But as far as I'm concerned, The Pasta Bowl is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I think this is partially because this was my first grown up staying in Chicago dining experience that struck me as awesome. A few years ago, a friend of mine lived relatively close to the restaurant, and we stopped in for a meal. I'm an Italian food enthusiast and I was wholly satisfied by my meal. I came back for the caesar salad the next day. Whatever it was I ate, it was the dish with gorgonzola, I loved it. I had it a few times since then and it always took me back.
