Got a great rate for $90 ($110 after fees/taxes) on Priceline. Very beautiful lobby, and you can't beat the location. The room, although minuscule, was clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly. They manage to keep prices low by charging for everything that isn't basic. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in the loop, you simply can't beat this place. Do your self a favor, though, and only sleep there. The city awaits!
