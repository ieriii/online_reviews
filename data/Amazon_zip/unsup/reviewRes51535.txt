Personally you guys would get 2 stars in my book because of you atrocious service. You get a whole extra star for being my husbands favorite Mexican restaurant on the North Side, lucky you. There is always something wrong whenever we are here, service wise. Not refilling waiter, taking forever to take our order, not bring the check, and at times forgetting us completely. Too bad you have such good food. Oh and Mark A. is correct, totally worse after remodeling.
