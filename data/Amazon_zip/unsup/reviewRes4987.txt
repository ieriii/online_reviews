Came here for a friends birthday on a Saturday....the place wasn't too packed and we got seats after a 10-15 min wait. I was actually expecting it to be more then that. I came with 3 other friends and we order a total of 5 dishes to share. My favorite dish was the fried pig ears. They were crispy and favorful. Loved it! The bone marrow was also very good. The oil from the bone marrow was amazing on the bread that came with the dish. If you like wine this place has a huge selection, but I'm not a huge fan of wine...i'm sure that the selection is good enough that most people will find something that they'll like. I would love to come back if i'm around the area for a quick snack = )
