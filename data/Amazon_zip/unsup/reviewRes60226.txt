I found these places on YELP, and they are all my favorite in the area. Thanks YELP and YELPERS for sharing your views..I don't go anywhere without at least checking YELP 1st to see what others are saying. I don't always agree, good or bad, but the reviews are more on, than off. Here's my top picks:Best Mexican: Mi Tierra on Belmont--great MargaritasBest Pizza: Fogo 2 Go on Diversey--60 Types..Brick Oven..AwesomeBest Chinese: Marks on Halstead--Never had a bad meal..FreshBest Coffee: Caribou on Clark/Wellington--Great coffee and serviceBest Chicken: Tie between Fogo 2 Go and Chicken Hut(Broadway)             Both are great..just different flavorsBest Sandwich: Philly's Best on Belmont--No one comes close on              the Cheesesteaks
