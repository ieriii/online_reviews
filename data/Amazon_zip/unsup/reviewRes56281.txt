Lincoln Park greatness. The service is immaculate, and the food is greatI went here a lot of times to order Pho soup and their great lunch specials (Salmon Noodle). After a yelper recommended Chicken Clay Pot, I definitely am sold on this place as one of the best in Chicago. I even took my parents here when they came to visit. The main manager/owner is a very nice gentleman who usually adds something to your meals wether its an unexpected lemonade , or just casual conversation.
