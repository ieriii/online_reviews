My fellow Yelpers have written great reviews on this place so all I will say is that my experience at Alinea was the highlight of my trip in Chicago. The food was amazing and I was wowed with the presentation and flavors. Truly an unforgettable dining experience. If I could give it more stars, I would. You expect greatness from a restaurant that's listed as #7 on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list (up a few notches from last year) but it still exceeds any preconceived expectations.
