Ok, I'm upping my review to 5 because I think this place either has improved, or I temporarily lost my mind last time. I have visited quite a few times since my first review. While I will say that the pork rinds aren't as good as the Publican (sorry guys - the Publican has the best pork rinds in the city...), this spot is super!  The burgers are great - I tried the Smokehouse burger for the first time during my last visit. How can you go wrong with a burger AND pulled pork (that's right...you can't!). We also tried the pork entree (yum, yum, yum with molasses, watermelon, tomato...delish) and the workingman burger (you definitely can't go wrong with this one). And yes, I know I'm a slob, but I made them leave me the cheese sauce from the pretzel (you must order this...) to dip fries in (gross, perhaps, but don't judge!).  The beer is good, though I'm a wine girl, so I had a glass of wine (small, yet solid list) and I hear they make a good cocktail as well... So.. Food - 5 Service - 5 (friendly, attentive (thanks for the 3 tastes of beer) and didn't (seem to) think we were nuts for all of our questions). Bathrooms - 5 Value - 5 Atmosphere - 4 (very cute, just a bit loud)
