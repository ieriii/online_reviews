Went here w/ our friends who highly recommended it. Nice location in Andersonville that stands out foodwise despite all the surrounding competition. We had the Roasted Pork Shoulder (excellent), Gumbo Ya-Ya (ok, too strong of a flavor, not sure what it was...) and the side of sweet potato hash ( amazing, cooked with bacon and I think my wife said she would eat "like 5 plates of these"). Great beer and drink list.
