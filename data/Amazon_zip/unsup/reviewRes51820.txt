I went with my mum and little sister on vacation. I was ecstatic to have deep-dish again since once a friend brought a piece to me from Chicago and for a year I have had a YEARNING for some legit deep-dish. I was a little disappointed. . the pizza sauce was bland and I didn't care for the cornbread crust. I am all for corn meal crusts but this was too hard and tasted of cardboard. The toppings were good though. The wait wasn't long to me since I had my family to talk to/ had just eaten gelato before I went. I think it would be excruciating if you were starving like my mum and sister though. :,) Kinda sad I didn't find my deep-dish soul mate. I will have to try again next visit to Chicago!
