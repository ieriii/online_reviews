This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area. It is very inexpensive and the quantity of food you get is ridiculous - you'll probably have to take some home. It's casual so don't expect hipster digs. It's located close to the brown line and in the heart of Lincoln Square. Have the veggie burrito with avocado!!
