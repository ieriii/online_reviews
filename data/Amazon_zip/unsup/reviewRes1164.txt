This was my first review in May of 2007. Oh my, now i have Michael Jackson's "Remember the Time" in my head. I've been going here since 2003 and alot has changed. Since then -- * His original Roscoe and Western location caught fire and he was closed for 9 months while looking for another place. He had a little clock teaser on his website counting down to when he would reopen. The longest 9 months of my life. * His dogs have gone through many name changes. Britney Spears is now Jennifer Garner. Ann Margaret became Madonna which became Salma Hayek (i think). Please let me know if i'm wrong. * I came straight here with my parents after i had a colonoscopy...that morning.  * There are now a billion more reviews for this place. * I got a missed connection here a couple years ago when i went with my sister! It was very cute. I love the andouille. After surfing through most of the menu, i've settled on this (well, along with a large fries and a corndog). Doug always asks how i'm doing regarding my health which is nice of him. I've become well-versed in when to show up and have never waited more than 30 min. 15 min on average. I can't quit you!
