Got here for the first time last weekend. I was super nervous about the wait, but on a Friday around noon, it was only five minutes. FIVE. Yes! Way to use that vacation day. My friend was in from out of town and wanted to have a Rick Bayless birthday. I'm sorry but seeing Rick behind the counter was a tiny thrill. I'm boring and often go with chicken, but lived a little and ordered the Pepito (braised shortrib). Very very good, with the jalapenos giving it a kick. My friend got the choriqueso, which she also enjoyed. For desserts we had the churros, which they brought to us nice and hot after our meal. So.delicious. I hadn't had a churro probably since a White Sox game when I was 9 or so, and it didn't disappoint. Sweet with extra sugary goodness falling off. The staff were all very welcoming and easily explained the process without me, the newcomer, prompting them, which I appreciated. Overall I will be back! I haven't had the richie rich hot chocolate, which I am eagerly anticipating. As well as the chicken.
