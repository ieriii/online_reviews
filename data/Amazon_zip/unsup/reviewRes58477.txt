If you live in Chicago, If you Work in Chicago, If you visit Chicago the only Hotdog is a Superdawg! Sure everyone clams their dogs are best BUT don't be fooled! I've lived in Chicago for 30+ years and tried everyone's best hot dog However I have found that a Superdawg is truly the BEST!! Big fat juicy pure beef (much bigger than other dawgs), steamed S. Rosen's poppy seed buns, mustard, onions, florescent green relish, pickled tomato, Kosher pickle, sport peppers, celery salt! I would bet that no other place has better fries as well! There is no other dawg like it! Sick of dawgs? for a special treat try their grilled cheese on dark rye gooey yummy goodness Awesome!
