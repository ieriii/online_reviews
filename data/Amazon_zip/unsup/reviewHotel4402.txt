Gorgeous hotel, holy crap. I was pretty in awe when I walked in the doors. The location is truly wonderful and central. The staff was very professional and helpful. I've stayed in quite a few hotels while in Chicago, both upscale and not-so-much, and this one has been my favorite.  My only complaint is the layout is a bit confusing and took me about 1.5 days to figure out.
