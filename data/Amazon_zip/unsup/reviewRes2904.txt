you know how sometimes you meet people who are attractive, smart, successful, funny, etc. but no matter what, no matter how many times you tell yourself "JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH THEM AND BE DONE WITH IT!" - something just doesn't click? this is how i feel about tru. the service is, without a doubt, exceptional. the food, unfortunately, did not blow me away as i expected it to. halfway through the 3 hour meal i was ready to be done. and the desserts did not make me happy. i hate giving tru only 3 stars because i see how it could be a truly exceptional experience. unfortunately, it wasn't - and i still feel a little peeved that this potential epicurean dinner left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
