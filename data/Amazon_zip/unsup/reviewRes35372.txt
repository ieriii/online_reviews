I love Shaw's. The Food is absolutley amazing. Fresh and delicious. the lobster thermador is to die for and the crab is always succulent and delicious. My only complaints:  the tables are on top of each other - so much so you can hear every word of the conversation the people next to you are having. while the service is fast and attentive - I've found some of the servers to be a little snotty.
