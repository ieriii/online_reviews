Very nice restaurant all you could want in a chop house. I had family in town and we all had dinner here, everyone was very happy with the food quality, service, and ambiance. The waiter even came by with a platter of all the cuts they offered that night and explained each one in detail to us. Very informative even for someone who is knowledgeable about meats. What I also liked was you can order shrimp cocktail and oysters by the singles! Both were very tasty even for me being from the East Coast! Best quality seafood I've found here in the Midwest except for......Hugo's Frog Bar....Opps had to say it! Sorry Kinzie Love ya I did give you 5 stars!
