Service was fantastic, great selection of food, everything seemed very fresh. The only thing is that the gumbo I had the night we went tasted like it had too much molasses in it (if that's an ingredient). I'm by no means an expert or have even been to LA to try the real thing. It was just too syrupy and sweet for my palate. Everything else was awesome. I think they have a kids eat free from 4-6 as well...
