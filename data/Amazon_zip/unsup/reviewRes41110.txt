This is more of a review for all Ruth's Chris, opposed to this specific location. As far as chains go, I like to steer clear, but this one breaks my theory. They universally deliver consistent service and quality food. It's traditional, nothing crazy, but you will not be left unsatisfied. Or with money in your wallet. I don't order filet's that much (cowboy steak man personally), but when I do (Most Interesting Man in the World voice), I order that sucka rare. Ruth's Chris has always cooked it to perfection. The menu is a la' carte, so your gonna have to spend to get your and yours a full out meal. I suppose that's to be expected when you go into a place like this, so you'll likely know that going in. When I'm on business, this is a go to spot. They never fail to deliver me a consistent and delicious meal. P.S. Their crab cakes in sizzling butter are on FIYYYYYAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
