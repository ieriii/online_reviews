Coming to Frontera Grill, just weeks after a Top Chef: Masters victory for Rick Bayless and the associated press coverage, I assumed the wait would be as long as many of my fellow Yelpers had mentioned.  With this being said, this is not a complaint. This is more of an accepted right of passage for premier cuisine. My girlfriend arrived a bit before me - at least early enough to get started on the Summertime Margarita :) - and put our name in. About 80-90 minutes later we were sitting outside on a chilly September night. Our waiter could not have been friendlier, well-versed and honest about the menu. We started with 6 oysters - 2 each of the varied selection offered - and pork empanadas. Two of the three oysters served as some of the best I've had, and the accompanying sauce of orange, lime, onion, cilantro and more was one of the best sauces I've ever had - on oysters or otherwise. As an entree, I went with the Falda Asada Brava - farm-fresh flank steak and hand-made salsa that matches and beats the same from tacos in Mexico - while my girlfriend had the Puerco. Both served with fluffy, warm corn tortillas we traded bites and compliments for aspects of each others meals. I complimented the fresh (from the roof) tomatoes and tender pork while she (rightly) complimented the tamales and even the smokey salsa. For dessert, we sided with a simple Mexican hot chocolate, a welcome reprieve from the standard after-dinner coffee and perfect for a chilly night on the patio on Clark. With several Bohemias, nice weather, a friendly waiter and good company, the (average) wait was more than worth it, and the flavors we'll remember are more than evidence of that.
