We gave Gejas a try again, this time on a week night. I made a very last-minute reservation (only about an hour or two ahead) and requested a booth. They said they couldn't guarantee a booth but would try to honor the request. After a brief wait, which was useful because my friend hadn't yet arrived anyway, we were seated at a lovely booth. The service was outstanding, and the food was quite good. In addition, the food somehow seemed to be a better quality. We weren't upset to our stomachs like we had been last time. We're not sure if this is because we were a bit more careful with how much we were eating, or whether the food was a bit fresher, but at any rate, my husband, my friend and I all had a good time and a good meal. Now I know *how* to get the best out of Gejas... Like requesting a booth ahead of time and being willing to wait for it, and perhaps avoiding heavy-volume evenings. It's likely we'll return.
