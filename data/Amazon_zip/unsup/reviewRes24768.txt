I consistently dream about the chicken/lemon/rice soup from Artopolis. But darn you Artopolis for being a treck from my apartment that I barely get to see you often. But when I do, it's like reuniting with a long lost best friend. This place is quick, consistent delicious food. -Love the soup (obviously) -Spinach salad is to die for- I know you wonder, what's the big deal w/spinach salad, but try it...YUMMMM -Potatoe salad: stellar -And I always get one of their meat sandwiches. I only can eat half but it makes for great left-overs. The desserts are to die for and I love they are all behind a glass case that you can browse. I've tried a bunch of them and the mango mousse is my fave. Oh Artopolis, hope we can see ea. other again soon. Sigh.
