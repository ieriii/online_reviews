Milk and Honey deserves four stars for food and one star for service. I had brunch there a few days ago and I still cannot get over the lack of hospitality by the counter staff. I asked a few questions about the menu and was treated as if I was a huge inconvenience! I could possibly understand this if it was busy, but it was a slow weekday morning and there was no line! I absolutely adore the food, but I don't know if I can justify supporting an establishment that allows their staff to speak rudely to guests. It actually spoiled my otherwise delicious meal. Note to management: Please hire staff that can at least appear to enjoy their jobs. A smile or even a pleasant expression goes a long way in conveying hospitality. Grimaces, frowns and glares should be 86'ed when dealing with the average guest.
