I was wowwed by this place - great food, great atmosphere -it was an overall great eating experience at Gilt Bar. Just some amazing things to note: 1. It is RIGHT by Merchandise Mart brown line stop which makes it extremely convenient to take public transportation. There's nothing like saving a little money on transportation to pay for more food/drinks at dinner! 2. The atmosphere is just right. It has great decor, not too loud yet definitely a happening place without being way too scene. This place draws a great mix of people! 3. The food is AMAZING. There are all kinds of different things to try and you can share food or get your own dish. We shared a whole bunch of different dishes (too much really) and EVERYTHING was excellent. There was not a single dish I thought wasn't delicious (ok the bone marrow was just OK but it was as good as I think bone marrow can be). We ordered: -Bone Marrow (we all wanted to try it). It is literally served in a bone for you to scoop out and spread on some bread and top with some pickled jelly. If you can get over that you are eating the inside of a bone, the picked jelly will rock your world! -Mussels - holy crap it's a lot of mussels, and the way they prepare it is different (in my opinion more unique) than most places. It is sort of curry-flavored. Overall, DELICIOUS however a HUGE portion, so order only with a bigger group -Steak Tar Tar toast - a true stand out. It was delicious -Cauliflower - surprisingly blew me away -Pork belly - yum, my friend said it best at dinner...it pretty much melts in your mouth.. -Apple dessert along with the ice cream and hot fudge....perfect way to close out the meal I cannot wait to make my way back, however I will definitely order a little less since we pretty much had to be rolled out of there.
