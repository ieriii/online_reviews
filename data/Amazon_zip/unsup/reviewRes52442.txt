Gross! But good at the same time. I was with the other yelps with the two-for-one coupons. After tax, tip, and two slightly dirty martinis with bleu cheese olives, I walked out having been relieved of 60 American dollars. Throw another $25 on there if I was paying regular price and that's a good 85 bones dog. And I didn't even have dessert. Not that I physically would have been able to, but I'm just saying. That's the problem with these places. You try to get your money's worth, and you end up checking into the hospital with a case of meat poisoning. Then you get flowers sent to your room and junk, and you have to write all these thank you letters. Sucks. P.S. Disregard my friend Vamsi's sentiment on the chicken up there. Despite his medical and public health background, he apparently isn't aware that chicken tartar is not considered a safe consumable.
