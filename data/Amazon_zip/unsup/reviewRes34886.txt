Had I ordered a falafel sandwich for myself, this place would had gotten 5 stars. However, I ordered the lamb schwarma, though great but I thought the lamb was a little too tough to chew on and the lamb could had been a little bit more tender in my opinion. At first I was only going to take just one bite of my boyfriend's falafel sandwich, but I ended up eating almost half of it because it really is that good. In college, I had a roommate who was an avid cook in ethnic cuisines, and I thought her falafels were the best, but Sultan's Market is possibly just as dynamite. I was tempted to go to the salad bar, but I think I'll save it for next time which by the way I'm determined to go back soon. The selection of beverages isn't vast, and there's a lot of ethnic drinks which I've tried many before during my childhood. I was so happy to see some of my favorites here such as the Lychee drink and Thai Iced Tea drinks. Price is reasonable. $3.75 for the best falafel sandwich you'll ever taste in the city?! I was skeptic at first due to the hype, but it really does live up to its rave. Highly recommend this place. They don't accept plastic but there's an atm machine inside.
