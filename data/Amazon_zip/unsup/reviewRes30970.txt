My friend and I went here for dinner and their service was terrible at every step. Their food is good, but is way too expensive for the area, ambience, and service. A lot of their entrees are in the $25-$30 with no sides included. The food is good, but not good enough to ignore everything else. The hostess ignored us for 15 minutes before seating at us in a congested area of the restaurant. We had to flag her down after another 20 minutes to get a server just to get a drink order in. When we finally got a server, she didn't seem like she wanted to wait on us. Not sure if it was too far from her other tables, or she didn't want to take a party of 2 or whatever. I got my salad and entree at the same time, which was not a big deal except usually salad is served first. My friend's sandwich never arrived. My food was cold by the time the server came to check on our meal and informed that we never got the other entree. She then tried to fix our experience, but by then it was too late. Her sandwich came almost 45 minutes after the original order was placed (how long does it take to make a sandwich??). I still left a standard tip, because I'm not sure whose fault it was exactly (the hostess, the server, the kitchen, or just a miscommunication between all three). The place was not busy at all, and I don't know why we weren't able to get a good table and our food at a reasonable time.
