The food is amazing!!! Great atmosphere and good service as well. Like my 3 year said "This is our new favorite restronaut!" We had an array of meat, seafood, and vegetarian dishes on our injera and every last one was incredible. Service was great even though it was quite busy! We arrived with no reservation, the place was full, and we were sat in about 10 minutes. is is a must stop place for me and my kids from now on everytime we go to Chicago!!
