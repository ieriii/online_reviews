This is my to-go place for Brazilian steaks. It's better than Fogo de Chao in my opinion.Everything is always perfectly seasoned (not too salty like Fogo sometimes is) and service is always great as well. Go there on certain days and you'll meet a regular, Alfonzo Soriano eating at his favorite place.
