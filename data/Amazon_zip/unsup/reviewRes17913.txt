NYC has been on a speakeasy trip for a while now that's finally dying down. If I was in the birthplace of the speakeasy, I knew I should check out Violet Hour based on the numerous yelp recommendations. In some ways it was identical to my favorite speakeasies of NYC, PDT and Death & Co. Extensive and creative cocktail menu? Check. Knowledgeable bar and wait staff? Check. The ways in which it differed from those familiar speakeasies were pretty much all positive. When the waitress asked if we'd been there before and I said it was my first time she started to explain the menu to me and some of the idiosyncrasies of Violet Hour. This would never happen at Death & Co or PDT for 2 main reasons. 1. The awesome drinks and atmosphere come with a healthy side of pretentiousness. 2. Nobody would ever show up there and ask for a PBR. The other main difference was that in spite of it's nondescript exterior, Violet Hour is a pretty large lounge space, which contrasts with the small, dark spaces I'm used to in NYC. There was no wait for 3 of us on a Monday night, but the long line as we were leaving told me a weekend visit here might be a bit too much to handle.
