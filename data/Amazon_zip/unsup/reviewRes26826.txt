Honestly, this place is a bit overrated. When I go to a mexican restaurant in the heart of pilsen, I want some damn dirty ass mexican food. Too bad the only thing dirty I found was the fly in my cup of water - which was promptly replaced by the water boy with no apology. With that said, the food is average at best as I have been here numerous times. However I am a fan of their homemade chips and salsa. Their free appetizer of soup or beef/tortilla also taste better than most of the offerings on the menu. The carne asada is good, but I can't say the same about much else on the menu. It's a shame that the entrees are not that great since their appetizers are excellent. It's like a premature ending to what could have been a great dinner, and nobody likes premature endings.
