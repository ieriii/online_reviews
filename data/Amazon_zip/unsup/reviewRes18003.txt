My new favorite place, and in the neighborhood too. Great beer selection and excellent burgers. I try a new burger every time I go there and have not been upset with any of them yet. Meat is seasoned perfectly and when you ask for a medium burger they cook it medium. Also the cheese curds are just amazing, buttery goodness. Sure is nice to not have to go through the hassle of waiting an hour or so to eat a good burger and then having to deal with awful heavy metal music once you are finally seated. Im talking to you Kumas. Check it out, you wont be disappointed!
