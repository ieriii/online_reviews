We had been to Bonsoiree (sic) once before for the vegetarian tasting menu, which was good but not as memorable as the spectacularly rude service from our waiter. Still, with a foodie friend visiting from out of town, we decided to give it another try. This time, we had a different waiter and an outstanding meal. In fact, I had only one complaint: we went on a Tuesday night intending to have the $30 prix fixe. When we sat down, the waiter came over and said something vague like Can we just cook for you tonight? No other explanation. I assumed this meant they wanted to bring us the chef's selections instead of choosing items for the prix fixe off the menu. But what we ended up with was the $70 Ultimate 7 Course Experience. As it turned out, this gave us a chance to sample many excellent courses that really showed off the restaurant's range. Most everything was very impressive: the sashimi and scallop ceviche, the oxtail, the pastry version of the veal dish. It was just not at all what I was expecting. The staff needs to do a better job of presenting options--for one thing, no mention was made of the $30 menu. Again, I couldn't have been happier with my meal, and I got to try things I never would have ordered, like the banana bread pudding, which sounds gross to me but was really good.So, we will go back very happily, just armed with the knowledge that we might have to specially request the menu option we want.
