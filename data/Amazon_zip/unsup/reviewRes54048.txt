i love this place! the cocktails are so original. i thought the ice specific drinks were a bit pretentious at first, but after a chat and sample with the owner i realize my first inclination was completely wrong. also: the water is the best water ive ever had. i know its ridiculous. but honestly. best. water. ever. the interior is way chic, super speakeasy like. must try peanut-butter-banana-whatever-they're-called.
