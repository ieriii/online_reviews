Spectacular! Best BBQ place I've been in Chicago. No doubt!3 friends and I where there last night and had an amazing dining experience. We were first greeted by the Busser who we thought it was our server, who brought us some chips and house made pickles. That were delicious.Jay our server was helpful explaining the menu. We had so much food the table was so small for the many dishes we got. Everything was incredible. I had the sliced brisket and fries! And a side of Mac & Cheese! Best I've had! Corn bread is perfect!The place is beautiful and cozy, specially sitting right by the fireplace! We felt so comfortable we were the last people in the restaurant (bar).Amazing service to be the last people in the restaurant. Busser kept checking on us to make sure we were doing ok. Great food amazing service and beautiful place. Keep up the good work Q!
