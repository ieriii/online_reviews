Went for a birthday a few weeks ago, as much as i tried to get out of it I'm glad I didn't. Your service has gotten better for sure - our server was a guy with super curly hair whose name I've forgotten and he was awesome. I only saw one of the faces I'd remembered for being unaccomodating in the past so that was nice that some of them seemed to be gone. And as usual, Derek is the best bartender in the entire city. I don't really care about the food here, just the whiskey.
