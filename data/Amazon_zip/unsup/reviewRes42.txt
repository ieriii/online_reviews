Alinea was a slam dunk. The food was everything I imagined, and I loved every bite. Even a month after my meal, I still have memories of the taste of many of the dishes. Our hand-down favorite dish: Burnt Morels. We opted to not do the wine pairing, as my wife had a half-bottle of wine, and I had 3 different types of beers.
