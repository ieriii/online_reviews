Carnivale was amazing!! It's a great atmosphere with lots of energy. I highly recommend the tuna ceviche as a light appetizer. For entrees, we ordered the beef tenderloin and the short rib and both were phenomenal! Also, we had an incredible piece of coconut cake for dessert, which we loved! It seems like this would be a great spot for a first date or a group. My only complaint is that our waiter seemed to rush us a bit with placing our orders. However, I still considered it a positive experience overall.
