More like a 3.5 stars. Food was good, but pricey for my pairings on this type of cuisine which I believe I've had better. Realistically I've been there twice and of the times I've gone there it's been so busy, crazy, and packed and overly loud that I found myself screaming to talk to my guest. lol I didn't think it was the best spot to go if you're looking for a romantic getaway. However, I would recommend, I have bias opinions.
