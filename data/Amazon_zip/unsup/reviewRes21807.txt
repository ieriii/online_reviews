On Sunday, I had the Superburger, comes with fries, and a Coke. The Superburger was one of the Bottom 10 (Worst) Burgers i've eaten in 30 years in Chicago. And the fries were below average. All for $8.00. Way Over-Rated. Nice atmosphere, I love drive-ins with curb service. To be fair, Mary loved her Superdawg. $4.99 for a hot dog is for the atmosphere, not the dog, though. There are better places, though. Try Suzie's on Montrose.
