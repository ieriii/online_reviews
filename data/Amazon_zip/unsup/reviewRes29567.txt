Went here for lunch during restaurant week and i loved it! To start, the tortilla soup had this absolutely wonderful broth that was a little sweet, a little salty, It was so good that I almost licked the bowl dry. My main meal was the pork tacos. It came with guacomole and beans and 3 different salsas. The pork seasoning was great! I said, "mmm, yum" after almost every single bite. We ended with the pecan chocolate cake. It was dark chocolate, which was too rich for me. I can't wait to come back and try another dessert.
