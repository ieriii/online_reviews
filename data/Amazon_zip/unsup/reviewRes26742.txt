I was expecting Americanized Vietnamese food here - lots of sugar added and scaled back pungency - but was pleasantly surprised by how authentic and yet refreshing the food here was. As an appetizer we orderd the lemongrass tofu. The tofu was grilled with finely crushed lemongrass and came with a soy-based dipping sauce. A delectable take on on of my favorite Vietnamese dishes! Next, my date and I had the crab and seafood soup. Lots of seafood - calamari, mussels, shrimp, fish cake and some real crab meat - in this classic Vietnamese soup. The shrimp and tomato based broth was light yet flavorful - a perfect complement for seafood. Our second entree was the shrimp sauteed with pumpkin. I've never seen this dish anywhere (nor have I seen pumpkin served at a Vietnamese restaurant or home). I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the dish; the sweet pumpkin and shrimp go quite well together. The service was friendly and attentive. In summary, it's not completely authentic Vietnamese food, but sometimes a little less bold and pungent is not a bad thing.
