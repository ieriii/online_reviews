Really enjoyed the meal...I sort of expected the whole thing to be a very generic experience. And while the atmosphere and decor were very similar to cheesecake factory, I didn't feel like it was a chain experience. My sandwich (BLT) was huge and very bacon filled and delicious. The dessert was super decadent and delicious. I had a molten chocolate cake (and it was up there with Roy's deliciousness). My companion ordered beignets and they were delicious. Fried dough. With dipping sauces.
