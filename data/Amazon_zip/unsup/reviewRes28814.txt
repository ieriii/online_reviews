We went to the Western location right under the brown line stop. The restaurant is pretty big and the staff are friendly. To be honest, I was a bit disappointing with the taste and the quality of the food.  We ordered the Chicken Curry Satay, Tom Yum Koong, Basil Chicken, Pork Curry Rice, Red Curry and Pad Thai. The Tom Yum Koong wasn't spicy at all, it tasted like i just ordered some lime soup with cilantro. Not much flavor or kick..... Pad Thai tasted like the one from Big Bowl. Way too sweet. We asked for medium hot and all i could taste was the sweet sauce. There were so much sauce on my plate that I could hardly taste the veggies. the noodles were clumped together so it didn't seem like the cook prepared my meal with quality. Very disappointing.... Chicken Curry tasted the best. It had just the right amount of curry powder and charred flavor from the grill. With the cold cucumbers and raw onions it burst with thai flavor; what thai food should taste like. Basil Duck and Pork Curry Rice was just ok. Too much hype for this restaurant. I would recommend this place for first time thai virgins or large groups... it's friendly atmosphere, cheap dining and you get to bring your own booze! Dinner for five was less than 60 dollars. Although its cheap, I prob wouldn't head back. Too many great restaurants in Chicago to choose from.
