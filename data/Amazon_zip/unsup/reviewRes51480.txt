Not worth the wait. Go to Los Nopales or walk to Taqueria El Asadero. This place is so overrated. I don't understand it. It is so far from the Los Angeles Mexican food that I grew up with and the service is always a disappointment.  I have eaten here 4 times over 4 years and always asked myself why I bothered!?! Right now Garcia's is under construction and I hope when it re-opens the food and service improve.
