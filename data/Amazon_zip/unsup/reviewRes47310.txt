I've recently purged most carbs from my diet and ordered the Possession of Shrooms burger with no bun and a salad as a side. Let me tell you I think I enjoyed the burger even more without the soft buttery distraction of the pretzel bun they are served on. The buns are amazing, don't get me wrong but having just the burger last night let me taste it alone for the first time and it was even more amazing. It tasted like steak, juicy, tender, savory steak. We frequent Lockdown as we live just 2 blocks away and I was concerned we'd have to cut this favourite out of our dinner line up. I coudn't have been more wrong! Dieters don't have to pass up this tasty treat!
