The food is above average, service excellent, but the chairs were uncomfortable, atmosphere a little stuffy (picture lots of 50 yr old men with 24 yr old blonds), and the valet staff make a comment to us when we tiped them only $2. Parking is pretty much valet parking only in this Northwestern Hospital neighborhood and Jacket required.
