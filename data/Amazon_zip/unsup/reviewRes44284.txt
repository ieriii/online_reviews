What a following! I heard this place was pretty well known but 100 + reviews! We had to buy the only cake left for my Mom's friend who was having a birthday and I just honestly wasn't impressed. I also bought two cupcakes to try them (hoped they would be better than Magnolia in NYC) and was all but let down by the taste. Cake was slightly moist frosting was toooooooo sweet. Not my bag. I'm posting the photos now from the cakes in the window. Unbelievable! Love the purse cake and the ice age cake! Great little sitting area outside and all of the pastries looks really great but I didn't have a chance to try them. Let's just say I think this place is the cooler hipper "Magnolia" of Chicago. Face it everybody the cake wouldn't impress a sweet tooth. Try Billy's in Manhattan or head on back home to your Mamma's kitchen.
