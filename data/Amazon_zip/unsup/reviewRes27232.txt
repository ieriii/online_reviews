Overall, the food wasn't memorable. On the tasting menu, only one or two dishes out of the 10 we ate left us wanting more. Everything was beautifully plated, but the taste wasn't anything special. Presentation, ambiance, service, etc ... all the "other stuff" ... was solid. But the food left a lot to be desired
