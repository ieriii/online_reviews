A much more relaxed environment than Alinea or Moto, and perhaps its unfair to compare the three, but they are the only resaurants in the city that I would place in their own categories of dining experiences. Schwa had hip hop blasting from the kitchen with chefs who looked like they lived in the neighborhood they work. No waiters here, the chefs all explained their presentations well. I certainly liked the BYO as I was able to pick up some great bottles and not get killed by the surcharge that most restaurants of this caliber charge. I've never seen so many uses for raw quail egg. We had raw quail egg on kobe beef tartare and raw egg in our oxtail ravioli. While an interesting flavor, we both felt a little queezy after our dinner.  I may not be cut out for a tasting judge on Iron Chef, afterall. One of the chefs explained that they were going to close down for the spring to do some culinary research in California and a few western European countries. I have not been back since it reopened, but I imagine the menu has changed quite a bit.
