This is the best La Quinta we have stayed at so far in the USA! The rooms are brand new, the staff is so friendly and accomodating and they are PET FRIENDLY! We appreciate clean rooms and great service and are LOYAL La Quinta guests, but this location is exceptional! Great value and great location!
