One. Amazing. Patio. Large, mature trees in the middle of a sea of tables really helped to dampen the noise of a big outdoor crowd. This is a great reason to check this place out in the warm months...so pretty. The service is also shockingly good, much better than expected. The food is solid, delicious, very, very fresh. Caprese salad (mozzarella not long from the cow), calamari, veal ragu (outstanding), duck and sea bass (impressive and very delicate). A good value for great food and terrific service.
