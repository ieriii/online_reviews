One of the most important stops on any culinary tour of Chicago. Ignore the white suburban kids who criticize this place. The food here is terrific and the place packed with locals, creating a high turnover, meaning always-fresh food. Their chorizo con queso is just about the most decadent appetizer I've had in years. Layers and layers of cheese, peppers, onions, and chorizo on fresh-made tortillas. And it's humongous, easily enough for 3 cheese-crazy snackers. Their tacos are good; they have the whole thing down where they heat the tortillas in the steak grease on the griddle. There's really no other way to have an authentic taco. The only curious thing was that they didn't put in onion and cilantro, and the side serving of the two ingredients was minimal. I'm sure I could have got more if I asked. Their enchiladas with mole sauce was great: cheesy, earthy, sweet, smoky, everything a good mole provides to such a dish. The real star, though, was the refried beans. How the heck did they make refried beans so delicious? All that said, I'd also like to point out that nothing mentioned here cost more than $6. Outstanding value and a must-visit for any Chicagoin.
