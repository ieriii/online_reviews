Service was great: very fast, efficient and polite. I had the ravioli piccolo sogno and it was amazing. Not a big portion, but delicious. I had some kind of petit gateau for dessert (sorry, I don't remember the italian name in the menu) and it was also delicious. Everything with some good wine. I just didn't like the coffee, coffee beans too roasted for my taste, but I will not deduct a star only for that.
