Being in the area, I've been here several times. Most notably I've eaten here with my husband 3 days during the week of 11/22. Most of the platters are huge, they shower you with a daily special sample - chicken soup, meatball soup, stewed meat, just about anything. The service is quick and effecient. The bowl of chips is never ending. That week I had the tampicquena, pollo ranchero and carne asada, all delicious.
