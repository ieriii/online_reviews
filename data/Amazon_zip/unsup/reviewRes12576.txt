Texas de Brazil is pricey. Get over it. But be aware. First they have an agenda to up-sell you on everything from water to cocktails. See it coming and you'll be prepared. Second, non-imbibers guzzling that Sprite? Over $3.00. Just sayin'. Third, it's a great group experience and you may go with 6 or more. They add in the gratuity so look at your bill before you double their mandatory tip. Fourth, come in armed with some kind of coupon. Birthday people are free with prior registration, 10% coupons abound. Plan ahead and save a little. This is, of course, a meat eaters paradise whose premise is gluttony. So don't whine about no veggie options. The salad bar is great and will trick you into filling up before you get to the featured protein. Arguably, some could justify the entire visit by eating from the salad bar which includes main course items like seared tuna and sushi as well as more common salad bar offerings. Service was attentive and accommodating on this less than filled Sunday night dinner. We were surprised when they dropped the ball and left us hanging for over 10 minutes waiting for tea after they'd already brought dessert. We suspect boiling water was a challenge for them. Don't be reluctant to let the attentive floor manager know of any shortcomings. This review sounds negative but overall it was a good experience. Just thinking you have to know what you're getting into.
