The small size of the restaurant makes this feel like an intimate dining experience, yet they can cater to groups of 6-12 really well. My favorite part is that you can get real burgers, not the nasty pre-packed patty kind, but real, hand-packed fresh beef kind. in the mood for a milkshake or other decadent beverage, try the oreo or peanut butter milkshake. We'll definitely do a repeat visit here for post-flag football brunch.
