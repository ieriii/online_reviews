We stayed here for a couple days and if I wanted to be centered in this area again, I'd do it again. But super touristy is not my thing. I'd rather not dodge suitcases with children sitting on them while trying to get outside. You look at other reviews on here and think the bathrooms must be small. If you've ever lived in a one bedroom apartment, you'll enter your room and then laugh. Seriously no different than any bathrooms I've ever had in an apartment, why would you expect anything more in a hotel room? The room itself was great, we had a view over Michigan Avenue on the 36th floor. The bed was so comfortable, and we had plenty of space. Also pretty sure any reviews complaining about elevators are VERY outdated. There are 6 "low-rise" elevators that go to the 28th floor and then 6 for the higher level floors. There was almost always one sitting in the lobby to head up, and if there wasn't, you barely had to wait...unless you were the idiots who weren't aware you had to press the button and not just stare at it because you don't have elevator buttons on your farm in Iowa. If you're logical enough not to bring a car here, there are so many buses that come right nearby and it's an easy walk to many different places. Concierge lounge was pretty meh. The drinks were hardly discounted like they are elsewhere (wow, a whole $11 for a cocktail instead of $13 down at the regular bar!). The breakfast wasn't that impressive either and we ended up going elsewhere for it after morning #1. The bar was always pretty busy, we only went there on Christmas for a drink before dinner. They have a couple local beers on tap, which is awesome and they really want you to know they make their blue cheese stuffed olives for martinis.
