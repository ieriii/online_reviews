This place was a total surprise for me. The food was super creative and tasty, to boot. The popcorn (w/ pepper, truffle, parm) rocks as a starter. We even ventured into the fois gras lollipop with pop rocks as an amuse bouche. And, amuse, it did. We couldn't stop smiling. But on to the serious part. I had figs with curiously whipped balsamic, marzipan powder, light ricotta as a starter. Potent flavors, but in a gentle portion, sweetly laid out in a crescent on the plate. My honey got the deconstructed caesar salad, also tasty, and the waygu beef w/ potatoes and parsnips, covered with a truffle consommee. I had scallops (mmmm) with salsify gnocchi, and maybe a squash or pumpkin puree smear. Very tasty. Also got a good wine recommendation that worked with both courses. I loved this place, it was on the casual side for atmosphere, but I like effort placed in food first, service then focus on the atmosphere. I felt comfortable and think you could go fancy or in dressed-up jeans, with anything in between. I would definitely go for drinks here. Just know (if you have hearing problems), the music is a little loud, and the room a little echo-y, so I won't be taking my in-laws here. For my fun-loving friends, willing to compromise on portion size for flavor, I'd take them in a heart beat. (BTW: with an appetizer & entree, we couldn't even order dessert we were so full, but the portions aren't for those who want an abundance of food). Anyway, I hope to go back, and will recommend this as a fun Chicago food stop.
