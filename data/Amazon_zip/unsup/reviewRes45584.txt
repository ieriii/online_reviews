Wilde, you pleasantly surprised me. I have never come here before because of the pretentious look of it from the outside, and I wasn't sure what they were really going for. We decided to try it out last Saturday and it was awesome! The beer selection is decent, the artichoke cheddar dip is excellent, and the Blue Cheese burger is to die for. The atmosphere is the best part - bookshelves, a fireplace, and a bar. What more can you really ask for?
