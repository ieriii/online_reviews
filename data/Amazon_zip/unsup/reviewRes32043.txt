Chicago Diner is the place all of your vegan and vegetarian friends from out of town want to eat at when they come to visit. And really, those few times a year are enough for me because I've rarely been bowled over by the food here. The Veggie Philly Cheesesteak is good, the nacho mama is good and the shakes are good. That's really all I've been psyched on here. I really want to try their raw cheesecake, but my desire to try it is outweighed by the annoying process involved in actually going here. I'm sure if you're a vegan traveler type, you'll def want to hit this place up. AND they serve beer so you and your punk friends can still get ripped.
