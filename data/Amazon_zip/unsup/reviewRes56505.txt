I was very excited to eat at Frontera Grill, but I thought the food and service fell short. I knew going there that we would have to wait a couple hours, but I thought that the food would be far worth the wait. Not so much. We started out with the Ceviche Yucateca, which contained shrimp and calamari. The shrimp was mushy and fishy - I couldn't eat it. I ordered the Falda Asada Brava for my main course, which was ok - but I have had better. Our waitress never came back to see how we were doing or to ask if our food was good. After we had finished our meals, a member of the waitstaff came to clear our dishes. Mind you - I had more than half of my dish leftover, so I thought he was going to box it up. But instead, he piled all of the dishes on top of the food I wanted to take home and took it away. I would not go back. I would much rather eat at Los Napoles or Fonda del Mar. They have much better food, their service is great, and you don't wait two hours. Sorry Rick Bayless - I was psyched for your food and I was underwhelmed to say the least.
