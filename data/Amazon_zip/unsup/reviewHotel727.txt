This was the absolute worst hotel experience I have ever had in my entire life. I was in town with friends for a bachelorette party and arrived at the hotel at 1245pm. They said our room wouldn't be ready until 3 (completely understandable) so we asked if we could drop off our bags. The bellboy told us to "drop our stuff and not touch it" because he thought it was disorganized and didn't want us helping him put it up - okay, that's fine. We went and had lunch and came back at 3pm and were told the person in our room was staying until 5pm. I asked if another room was available and he said he would call my cell to get us one as soon as possible. At 6pm there was still NO ROOM and NO CALL. Eventually I tracked down a manager and she said she would get us a room soon. At 720pm I we were able to put our bags in the room, but were late to our 7pm dinner, not to mention unshowered after a 6 hour drive and had to change clothes in the soon-to-be bride's room since ours wasn't ready. We were given NO discount even though our room was 4+ hours late. It was a horrible experience, every person I talked to was unfriendly and was not able to help, and it put a damper on what was suppose to be a special night. I have not heard from management despite trying to contact them. I will NEVER stay in a Westin again and will alert all my friends and family to never stay there as well. Simply unacceptable for a huge pricetag.
