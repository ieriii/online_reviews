What can I say.....We went for the Duck and it was OUTSTANDING! Mouths were watering as the perfectly roasted Duck was carved, tableside, into thin Slices and laid out on a platter. They brought some pickled vegetagles, sliced carrots and green onions along with a bowl of Hosin Sauce and the Buns. Shortly after we had begun eating the perfect slices of Duck, they came with the platter of Duck Fried Rice an Duck Soup. All were excellent! We ordered some extra buns as well. The skin was perfectly crisp, with that unctuousness from the fat of the duck. The buns are perfectly suited for absobing the natural juices and Hosin Sauce from the duck. I have not tried anyting else other than the duck, but from the selection of roast meats in front window, it looks like they do an excellent job of roasting meats of all types. I would highly recommed making a reservation an reserving a duck so you dont get there and be dissapointed when they are out of ducks. it is a several day process in making Peking Duck, so they can't just "make a few more" when they are run out.......
