Fabulous! From the sexy ambience with the red walls and dim lighting to the delicate rangoons stuffed with real crab (no "crab stick" here folks), this place knocked my socks off. Located on a fairly inconspicuous area of Broadway just north of the Thorndale red line stop, Indie surprised me. I'd read all the raves of the crab rangoon, so instead of my usual order of edamame and miso soup, we splurged and went for the 'goons. And what a good decision that turned out to be. Perfectly sized with just the right proportion of crab, creamy, and scallion-y goodness, I was in heaven. Could've eaten two orders, but hey, I'm no glutton (hehe). An order of super-white tuna nigiri went down like butter as did the scrumptious sunny crunchy roll and the spicy blue crab roll. Next time, I'm bringing a few more peeps so I can try more of the beautifully presented maki rolls. You'd think we'd be done, but no sir, there was cheesecake on the menu and my handsome date couldn't say no. And neither could I, to some perfect, not-too-sweet green tea ice cream. Oh sh*t, looks like I am a glutton! One tip, make a reservation, as this place is tiny and the word appears to be out as to the fabulosity that is Indie. Great for a date, or for the start of a night out with the ladies.
