Oh I absolutely love their white pizza.. yum yum yum! The slightly charred thin crust from their pizza oven make my mouth water. Their salads are gigantic, good enough for two to share while waiting for pizza. Their chocolate fudge filled ball dessert with coco is awesome! If you are looking for something different - try Spacca! You wont be disappointed. Also, they do have outdoor seating but its slightly crammed in there.
