I'll probably give it a 3 star but the extra star is for the value for money lunch special. We went on Labor Day, around 145 p.m. and the restaurant was not crowded. There were 3 tables of 2 persons each, already tucking into their meal. Two four-persons table ordered food before we did, and we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive, after we ordered it. Since we ordered everything from the Lunch Special menu, we were puzzled by the long wait. So if you do want to try this place for lunch, make sure you have a leisure afternoon off from work and isn't too hungry to begin with. The lunch special is extremely valuable at $7.95 per person. You can choose 4 out of the 8 dishes available on the Lunch menu. The only down side is that they only have beef available for the lunch menu. Before I went to Demera's I was keen to try the lamb dishes, since they all look very yum. The beef cubes that came with the lunch menu was very good. They are very generous with the portion. Although it was a lunch special, they did not stinge on the meat/veggies at all. Once I get over the idea that I have to wait almost an hour plus (seating + getting the waiter's attention + waiting for kitchen to prepare food) for the food arrive, I might be brave to try out the lamb at Demera's =p
