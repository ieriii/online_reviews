I have no idea where to start on this place, but here goes... First off, what an absolutely wonderful experience it was to dine at this establishment. I cannot say enough about Alberto and his wife for taking good care of my girlfriend and I. I was on vacation with my girlfriend in early September and we searched high and low for an authentic Cuban restaurant in Chicago. She is from Miami so pastelitos de guayaba, medianoche Cuban sandwichs, and croquetas were in order. We traveled all the way from our hotel on the Magnificent Mile to get to this place. We entered and liked what we saw. The decor was beautiful and very Cuba/Miami-esque because of the pictures, music, and smells. We order our food and decided to take it to the patio since it was a beautiful day. I will NEVER forget the first bite of my medianoche. Coooooo, que rico, meng! And the croquetas, don't even get me started! The food here is truly amazing, no lie. During our meal we ended up chatting with the owners of this place for almost 2 hours. Alberto and his wife Christine were awesome company. If it wasn't because we had to get to a White Sox game I think we would still be there "comiendo mierda" with them. At the end of our meal, Alberto was nice enough to give us a flan on the house. Man, even the desserts here are good! That flan was amazing. I could go on and on and on about our wonderful experiences here, but I say just go and you'll see for yourself. My girlfriend and I were there almost 2 months ago to the day and I remember that afternoon like it was yesterday. Sorry for the delay in my post, Alberto!
