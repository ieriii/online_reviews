I am new to this vegan thing and am trying some new restaurants.  I guess the best way to classify this place is vegan meets good ol American diner. It has a fun and urban feel and the staff was very pleasant. The food was good but it wasn't what I expected. When I hear "vegan" I think healthy and that is what I was expecting. There are healthy dishes on the menu but this is what I would consider vegan junk food. It's good, it's animal free, and it's yummy. What am I getting at? Be prepared for burgers and frys and not salads. Yes, you can get a salad but thats the main dishes.  Will I go back? You bet! I do try to be healthy most days but I always need a good fake burger now and again.  I totally tricked my son and he at the kids burger and had no clue there was no meat. That just shows how good the food really is.
