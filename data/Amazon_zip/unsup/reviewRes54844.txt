This restaurant is packed with people who think it's great because they were told by someone else how good it is. I recommend avoiding this place because it is too crowded and honestly the service was pretty bad. There are too many good restaurants in this city with great people working there, but if you want a place with big crowds, decent food and shitty service check it out.
