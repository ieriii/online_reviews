I've had breakfast here twice and both were very different experiences. My very first time, we waited for about 30 minutes which seemed reasonable. When we were finally seated, the waitress was quick to get our orders. We honestly waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out. Once it did, everything was so rushed. The waitress kept coming by, which was great but once we were done she kept coming by as if she wanted it us gone. Not a pleasant first experience. The second time was a little different, (Note: First time was a Saturday, Second time was a Tuesday). Breakfast was a lot more enjoyable since the food came out pretty quickly and I did not feel rushed. The waitress was a lot nicer this time too. Lesson learned, if I want to enjoy the place then go during the week. If I don't mind waiting and feel like being rushed, go on a Saturday morning.
