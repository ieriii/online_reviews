I had an amazing chicken chipotle hot dog with kiwi-mango salsa. Absolutely amazing and terrifying at the same time - it was spicy and a lot of flavors all at once. But it was definitely more manageable than I thought, and the duck fat fries are a MUST - don't listen to the haters! Come here early, and come here not in the middle of the day over the weekend. It sucks that the duck fat fries are only available Friday and Saturday, but maybe it's a crowd control measure... Being inside this place was surreal after I had seen it on TV. Doug is a sweet dude, and everyone wants to be BFFs with him so don't mind the little ladies who try to talk to him for 10 minutes in front of you.
