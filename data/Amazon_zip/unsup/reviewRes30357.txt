after finishing with an interview in chicago, i had time to kill before my flight. I figured why not join the top chef masters hype and come to this place! meanwhile, there was a line for rick bayless' new restaurant next door which was pretty intimidating. anyways, i went inside and after sorting out the seating rules/wait for a friday lunch, the hostess told me it would be an hour wait for a friday lunch. so i waited in line with the pager they gave me for bar seating. made friends with a random local who happened to be in the same profession i'm in and then my pager went off so we had lunch together! I tried the steak which was like 30 dollars and it came with the most delicous guac and plantains ever! The steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce was phenomenal as well. I'm not gonna ding this place for the long wait because of all the hype especially since i'm an outsider infringing on what was a popular local place to being with. I would definitely recommend outsiders to flood this place and try the hype!!!!
