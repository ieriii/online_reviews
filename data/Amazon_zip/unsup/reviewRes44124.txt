After oohing & ahhing for months over Alliance's window display that showcases a cute Panda cake & a Nightmare before Christmas cake I had to finally stop by and see what all the fuss was about. Normally I stray away from bakeries because all they do is tease me with their non-vegan goodies, but I was pleasantly surprised to find they had a vegan apple streusel, chocolate chip cookies, and vegan cupcakes! Their ice coffee was also equally as amazing & they didn't charge me extra for soy as they had it out w/ all of the other creamers. My boyfriend had a cinnamon roll which he said was one of the best he's ever had. Always on the lookout for new study spots I checked out the Alliance lounge next door and saw that they have free Wifi & lots of seating. Will definitely be back soon to study here & try some new vegan baked goods.
