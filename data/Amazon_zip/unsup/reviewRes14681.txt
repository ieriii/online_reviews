This place is great and I am very excited to only be about 5 min. away. Tried all the home brews and have no complaints about any of them, they even come in the proper glass ware. I think the one that stood out the most for me was the Eugene porter. Also had the Working Man Burger comes on a house made bun which is great and also the burger came out a perfect medium rare as ordered. It seems anymore its almost impossible to find a burger that comes out the way you order it!!! Living so close had to join the Mug Club which comes with several benefits, especially if you like crafted beers you can enjoy them at home this way. Gave 5 stars due to the perfectly cooked burger, great atmosphere, and having a mug club in which I am always a sucker for.
