I woke up on this snowy Sunday morning and I could not decide whether I wanted sushi or Thai. I the remembered a friend mentioning Indie cafe having both, and doing them very well. I have to say I loved everything about my experience here. First off they have a great lunch deal, that is good even on the weekends. $7 for an entree, appetizer, and choice of soup. The best Thai style crab rangoon I have ever had! I had the pad se eew too which was excellent. In addition to the lunch special I got a spicy tuna roll which was also a delight. Fresh, spicy, and also had cucumber in it which I love. All in all I am an Indie Cafe fan and I will be back to sample many more of the sushi creations that they offer. Side note, I love the funky wooden chopsticks, more places need to have these instead of those splintery pieces of crap that you have to pull apart!
