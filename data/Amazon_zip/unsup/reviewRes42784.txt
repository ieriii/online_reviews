Great deep dish and excellent thin crust. I haven't tried their Pan style pizza yet but every pizza parlor has a different interpretation of what Pan style pizza means, so I have no idea how it would turn out. Either way, the cheese is usually perfectly browned and the dough doesn't get too doughy. As for other items on the menu, I've had their deep-fried mushrooms once and their garlic bread...which is just a toasted six inch slice of Italian bread. The mushrooms were decent. They're honest about delivery times and while they missed my request for a liter of diet pepsi, the bottle of MOUNTAIN DEW CODE RED that showed up instead was like winning the lottery.
