Mastro's is great. I had anticipated this from what friends who had dined in before told me. It s top end steakhouse with a piano bar and waiters dressed in formal attire. I went there with my family & girlfriend to celebrate my Dad's birthday this past Friday evening and it was terrific. The service was great and the wine list had affordable choices. $$$ isn't something to consider when walking in the doors as your bill will be expensive, I promise. You get what you pay for and the bone-in filets we all got were cooked perfectly. The sides I would recommend would be the lobster mashed potatoes...unreal. As for the sweet potato fries, not so much...they were double breaded and although you get a TON we had a lot leftover. One problem I had was with the lobster, which i ordered ala carte. It was tough and not up to par however after telling the waiter I was displeased she quickly removed it from bill. Last but not least is the desserts...we had the chocolate cake and the butter cake, both very good but the butter cake was the winner. Try it no matter how full you may be...def worth it. Hope this helps you make a reservation.
