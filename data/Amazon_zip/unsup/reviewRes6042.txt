I went to Wildfire with my boyfriend and another couple. The place is set up great for a party like ours- along with plenty of big tables for big groups and a section at the bar for small parties (like 2). Everything on the menu looked tasty, and I loved the extensive drink portion. I started with the sangriatini, which was good but I would have been just as happy with sangria. It didn't seem strong enough to be either sangria or a martini...I shared the chopped salad for a starter, which was very good. We ordered the dressing on the side but it arrived drenched- which was ok because it wasn't a cream dressing, but I was still a little shocked considering Lettuce Entertain You restaurants pride themselves on high service standards. Our waitress was nice, and everyone makes mistakes. She realized after we'd been in our salad and offered an apology. For dinner I had the scallops- they were small scallops and there were so many. I couldn't eat all of them. The lemon butter sauce was very good, but a little salty. I didn't feel like I could take my leftovers home- how would re-heated scallops taste? I shudder at the thought. Other orders we had were chicken breasts in some sort of lemon sauce, surf and turf, and a steak salad. They all looked good and were huge. So note to self, next time return ready to share entree or get an entree you can take with you in a doggy bag. I also had a wine flight which is definitely the way to go. You get four glasses of wine to try. Wildfire is a place I picture bringing out of towners that don't want to travel too far out of their food comfort zone.
