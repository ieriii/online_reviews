Well, it certainly is upscale bbq--if you're talking about the room and location.....and the prices!. Beyond the veneer of fine dining, there's not a lot to recommend this place. The food is no match for Lem's or Honey 1, and neither are the Gold Coast/tourist prices. Twelve dollars for a pulled pork sandwich? C'mon.The wine list was an uninspiring collection of corporate supermarket standards with a couple of overpriced cliches (Veuve and Dom anyone?) thrown in from the local mega-wholesaler. Sadly for a bbq restaurant, the beer list was even worse and comprised mostly of Miller and Bud products with Heineken and Corona passing for interesting imports.
