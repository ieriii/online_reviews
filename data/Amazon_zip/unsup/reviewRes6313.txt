I must say the atmosphere is amazing. Classy but can be casual. I loved the bar area and lighting. They recommend ordering food in tapas style, which is interesting for an Italian restaurant. So my boyfriend and I decided we'd be a little adventurous in our menu items. However, the food was kind of disappointing. I've heard so many good things about it but maybe my boyfriend and I just ordered all the wrong things. Here's what we got: 1. Truffle egg toast + fontina + asparagus- Simply an egg yoke on top of a really buttery texas toast with asparagus chunks on the side. It almost tasted sour to me.I took two bites and tapped out. Nothing special. 2. Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini- This was a sausage pizza. It was real good but nothing special to rave at home to mom. Served with a side dish of red crushed pepper, salt, and basil (or maybe it was oregano- not sure). 3.. Risotto Carbonara- A simple dish of rice, peas, pancetta, and again an egg yolk. The egg yolk made the dish actually have some flavor. It sort of tasted like a bland soup. My boyfriend and i actually used the red crushed pepper to add some kick to it. I was extremely disappointed about this dish. 4. Bistecca alla Griglia- This is the strip steak with arugula. This was good but once again nothing special. We ordered it medium, and good thing because it gets served on a hot skillet so it cooks quickly. 5. Honestly the dessert is where they truly shined: We ordered the cheesecake/fruit of the day-(which was raspberry)/ crumbled graham cracker served in a jar. This my friend was amazing, we practically licked the jar clean. I have a friend that said the burgers there are really good. Because I love the atmosphere so much, I will give this place another try. Maybe a casual weeknight to grab a burger and drink at the bar.
