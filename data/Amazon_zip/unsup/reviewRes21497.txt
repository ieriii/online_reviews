Was here on a Wed and Fri night, and both nights it was packed - I dont think they're ever not busy. Got carrryout and ordered the churro (good), milanesa (not that great), shortrib red chile soup (pretty good but oily), xoco salad w/ pork (excellent), chips and guac (the usualy) and I think the Ahogada (amazing) - BUT the hot chile sauce may be the hottest thing I've ever tasted and it comes on the side. I'd compare one finger dip into the sauce to 5 table spoons of Siracha rooster sauce, so watch out. Otherwise the sandwich was AMAZING. Great food, great prices, only wish we would have been able to get a tabel in a reasonable amount of time. Expect to wait 45 minutes for 2 people on a Friday night.
