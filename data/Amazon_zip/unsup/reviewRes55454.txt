Upon our on-time arrival we were informed that our party of four could be seated in fifteen minutes. After twenty minutes had passed (during which several later-arriving parties of four had been ushered to their seats), we inquired as to our status and were informed that we were next to be seated. Another twenty minutes and a few more seatings of other parties later, I finally got the message I should have gotten sooner: Don't choose hot. see-and-be-seen restaurants-of-the-month where favored clients are permitted to leapfrog those who precede them. (Especially when it's your wife's birthday dinner.)Instead, a short drive north took us to the venerable Kiki's Bistro, where we had--as usual--a graciously served, wonderfully prepared dinner. No wannabe airs, no panicky, whispered conferences at the hostess's station and no phony promises. Just real class.
