This place is awesome. I've only had pho twice in my life but I can tell that this place is doing it right. Their menu is huge but I went with the beef pho and did not regret it. Their mix-ins are plentiful, there are tons of noodles all bathed in a great broth. I would love to bring back friends, family, anyone.
