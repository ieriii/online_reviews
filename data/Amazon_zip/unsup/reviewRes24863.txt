We stopped here for coffee "and" with our Norwegian relatives. It was a great end to a wonderful night in Greektown. They have a very nice selection of pastries, coffees and teas. Everything we tried was very good and the atmosphere was conducive to easy conversation. We did not get a chance to try any of the food on their non dessert menu, but what I saw on other people's tables looked mighty good. If you go to Greektown, this is a great place to finish off a wonderful dining experience,
