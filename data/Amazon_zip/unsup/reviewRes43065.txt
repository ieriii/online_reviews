Surprised to notice I never wrote this place a review as it was one of my go to spots in Chicago before I moved. Its a great place both to grab a cocktail with friends after work, not too loud, cool atmosphere...but its also a great place to eat dinner. Try the Roasted Beet salad and the roasted brussel sprouts are my favs. Go early to get a table or make a reservation, def. gets crowded.
