My favorite beer bar in the city. I've heard complaints that the staff can be a little snooty, but that's just because they are busy. Since they have been on Check Please they have been too busy for my taste on the weekends, but I don't hold that against them. The food (mussells!) is fantastic, but the reason to come here is for the beer. An enormous list of beers focusing on Belgian ales and Belgian style Americans make this a must stop in Chicago. Probably one of the best beer bars in the country.
