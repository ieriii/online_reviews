The press on Nana is all over. I am slightly embarrassed to say that it took me a long time to get here. Why embarrassed ... because I grew up in this neighborhood and was really excited when I saw the owners getting ready to open. The problem is that when I go back I am usually visiting my parents and not eating out. The second problem is that my husband and I are not really big on eating breakfast out and even less big on waiting in line for it. Luckily, the day we went there was no line.  How cute is this place on the inside? So perfectly simple yet modern looking. So fun! My husband was intrigued by the fresh squeezed juice and ordered a large. My family had warned me that the prices were high so I wasn't shocked to find out it was $7.00. I guess if you put it into perspective, (oranges aren't in season, they are organic, etc) this price makes sense. He raved about it so the price wasn't a huge concern. It was a treat! He had some amazing looking breakfast with a homemade tortilla on the bottom, scrambled eggs, guacamole and all sorts of other goodness. I opted for the breakfast sandwich. The waitress thought my order seemed boring so she suggested I try their biscuit in lieu of an english muffin. I am so glad she made that suggest. Best breakfast biscuit ever!! It tasted like it garlic butter on it - so awesome, such a huge portion, so tasty and completely filling. I couldn't even finish it. I am really impressed with Nana. Yes, the prices are a little high compared to a standard breakfast place but they are on par with any organic eatery you will find in LP, WP, Bucktown, etc. Can't wait to see more new things popping up in this area.
