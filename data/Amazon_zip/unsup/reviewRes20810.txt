I have mixed feelings about The Gage. I've been there about 10 times and I'm sure I'll be back, but mostly because of the location. I've always had friendly service, well except for interactions with the hostess. I've never had a pleasant experience entering this restaurant. The hostess has always been snotty, unaccomodating and basically rude. I'm sure this restaurant has lost customers due to her alone! Anyways, if I ignore her I'm usually able to enjoy the rest of my visit. I've been there a few times just for drinks (overpriced but generous), a few private parties (very nice) and a few times for dinner. The food is tasty and the atmosphere is comfortable. Those are the main reasons I go back.  Bottom line: good food, good atmosphere, but there are better places to go if you want to spend that kind of money.
