i'm going to preface this review with this little nugget of information: i'm vietnamese. my dad, obviously, makes the best pho i've ever had in my life. with that said, i am making an effort to make my review objective, but i'm sure my biases will come through. i've been here on a couple of occasions, and the food is pretty inconsistent. when i went here a few months back, they used fresh noodles and the broth was okay. i went here a few weeks ago, and i definitely could tell that they used dry noodles. there's a huge difference between the two, with fresh noodles being the better choice. i don't know if they had run out of fresh noodles or what, but that was a big strike against them. another issue is that the broth is usually very heavy on the cinnamon, which most people wouldn't notice unless they've had a really good bowl of pho.  when you order pho, they bring out a huge plate of bean sprouts, thai basil, and limes. someone needs to tell the staff how to cut a lime. they always cut it sideways, which makes it difficult to squeeze out any juice. boo. the service is consistently terrible. if you ask for a minute to look at the menu, which is quite extensive, they give you attitude and may not come back for a while. the servers never seem happy to be there, which reflects on how they treat you.  so with all of the negative aspects of this place, why have i gone so many times? it's honestly one of the better places to get pho in viet town. that's not saying a whole lot...but when i'm in a bind and need pho...it'll do the job, quick and dirty.
