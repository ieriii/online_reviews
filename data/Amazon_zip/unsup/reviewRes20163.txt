While the atmosphere is pretty cool and very Irish, the menu is confusing. I had to get our waitress to explain every single thing to me, and even when I ordered, I was still unsure... until I tasted it. Very yummy! Really expensive, if you ask me. I went with 4 friends and our bill cleared $250.  If you try nothing else there, try the fondue.
