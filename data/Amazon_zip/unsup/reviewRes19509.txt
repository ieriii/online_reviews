It just doesn't seem right foofyfying a pub. It works though. I grudgingly admit it. I left feeling like a snob - a $17 corned beef and rye sandwich? That was the best corned beef, rye and combination of corned beef and rye, I've ever had. It was really, really good. Almost great. If not for the guilt noted above, I'd say great.  Hefe Wesen was more Krystal Wesen to me - tasty. The brew and sandwich were happy together.  I'll go again on the company dime - not my own. However good/great the sandwich was, its still $17.
