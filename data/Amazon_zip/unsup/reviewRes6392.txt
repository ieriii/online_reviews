Okay, well I have been to the one in Oakbrook and I know they have the same menu soooo... not reviews on the service for this one. But Wildfire is another great steakhouse Chicago has to offer. They have a great wine list and an impressive menu that will satisfy any food craving you have. Whether it be there popular steaks or a sandwich and fries, this place can please on any angle. Little pricey, but you should already know that before going in.
