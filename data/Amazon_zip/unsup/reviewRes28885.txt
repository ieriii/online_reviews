Opart sorta fell off my radar after a few mediocre meals there in the past, but I gave it another try last night to meet up with a couple of friends who love this place. Sometimes said friends and I agree ( M Henry) and sometimes I just have to question their tastebuds (Orange Garden). Opart has been in this same spot for years. It actually reminds me of the old days when I didn't have a life and I would get takeout from here and go next door and rent a movie from BP Video on a Saturday night. Thankfully times have changed. Opart has expanded their space quite a bit and the decor is downright upscale compared to its former self. I was pleasantly surprised at the surroundings. The menu is still as expansive as it was, with plenty of options for the neophyte Thai eater, or someone with a more advanced palate. We started with Tiger Cry, which is a marinated beef appetizer. The last time I had it, the meat was gross so I never ordered it again. It turns out that Opart change their meat supplier so my friends ordered it and I was curious if it had improved. It blew me away. It was so tender and flavorful; I couldn't believe this was the same dish from years ago. To that we also ordered a cucumber salad and crab rangoon, both of which were good, and on par with any better-than-average Thai restaurant. For entrees we chose pad prik (I firmly believe my friend ordered this just so she could say "prik" loudly) with beef, curry fried rice with pork, and pad si ew with chicken. Of the three, the pad prik was the best. We ordered it medium spicy and I was downing water like no other. Good stuff. The others were fine; I've had better, but I've certainly had worse. Service was good; this has also improved from what I experienced in the past. It's always nice to see a place that has made changes for the better. I'm glad my friends got me to give Opart another try. I will definitely be going back.
