Its ok, but VERY over priced. I don't think any of what I have tried (buddha bowl and sassy wings) are anywhere near the great, traditional Korean recipes you'll find all along Lawrence or Bryn Mawr (Korea town.) I don't plan to go back for anything else. They take only CASH (huge inconvenience unless you want to pay an additional $3 for their ATM plus your own bank fee,) and they don't even include RICE!!! Unbelievable. Go instead to a "mom & pop" restaurant in Koreatown and try REAL Korean food, along with the included many wonderful side dishes, rice and barley tea - yes included in the price of an entree! You are cheating yourself by eating at Crisp. Go and get some traditional Korean food. It is my favorite!
