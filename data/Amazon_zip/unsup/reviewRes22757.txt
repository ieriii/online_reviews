I don't think it's a stretch to say this is the best restaurant in Greek town. Their menu is diverse and has plenty to chose from and the prices are perfectly matched with how much you get.  For dinner, I decided on the Family Style meal which was $19.95 per person. This was a great way to try many thing, and get a huge bang for your buck. All appetizers were full portions including gyros meat, saganaki, and a choice of a few types of dips (we chose Melitzanosalata which is an eggplant and potato spread). Then we had a Greek salad, which had authentic feta and Greek olives. Yum! Next came the main meal, by which time I was stuffed. I ended up taking home a combination plate of pork off the spit, vegetarian moussaka, and spanakotiropita. The pork was to die for!!! I don't think you can go wrong with any of their meat dishes. They are huge and delicious! Lastly they gave us two desserts (baklava and Galaktoburiko) with coffee.  This place is amazing if you are looking for wonderful service, a great deal, and a new experience into the world of Grecian food. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that wants to experience a new culture at a great price, and food that I don't think will disappoint. OPA!
