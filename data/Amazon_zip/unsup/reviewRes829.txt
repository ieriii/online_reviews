If you could only eat at one place in Chicago, then this is the place that I'd tell you to go.  It was certainly the most memorable. But if you want to come here, I'd recommend that you come early or prepare to wait a long time. The line always goes around the corner and it can go really far.  Their most popular items are their Foie Gras Hot Dog and their Duck Fat Fries. The fries fried in duck fat are only available on Fri and Sat. The Foie Gras Hot Dog is surprisingly rich and creamy. They top the hot dog with generous portions of foie gras and a foie gras mousse. You can't miss the flavors. It has nice texture and it's a tasty dog. I can see why it is the most popular item. Hot Doug's also specializes in sausages featuring exotic meats. They've stuffed antelope, game, rabbit, alligator, corned beef, and even bacon into their casings. And they're all pretty solid. Their hot dogs are full of flavors...It's really hard to go wrong. I'd recommend choosing the dog with the flavors you're craving (eg: sweet, spicy, salty, savory, etc..).  I'd also recommend that you get one of their regular Chicago dogs. It's only $2 and it's the best "Chicago dog" that i've had in the city. The sausage had a nice snap, the ingredients were fresh, and it was just a damn good hot dog.  The duck fat fries were good fries, but I don't think that you're missing anything if you skip them. If you are only going to have one opportunity to come here in your life (as was the case for me), then I'd recommend that you get a Chicago Dog for $2, try their foie gras dog, and get one more exotic hot dog. If you have friends with you, then you can split more. I believe that if you're willing to brave the long lines, then you might as well make the most of your experience by coming with a respectable appetite. Bon Appetit.
