Cheap as chips, but I think I too must have visited them on an off day, because the carne asada tacos, although tasty, were so greasy I had to eat them with a fork and knife...also I would have assumed that it came topped with onions and cilantro but instead you get a meager offering of both on the side along with a heap of lettuce and a few tomatoes. The salsa and chips were good and so was the starter they give to you (not sure what it was called).
