I visited this popular establishment shortly after the city banned Foie Gras from Chicago restaurants. And what was on the menu that day but a hot dog featuring the very contraband itself. It sounded like it couldn't possibly be good, so of course I ordered it. I wouldn't recommend it -- it tasted like fat. Melt-in-your-mouth, top grade buttery tastelessness. Though the foie gras didn't do it for me, the hot dog itself was rabbit and was delicious. I appreciate being able to choose unusual and exotic selections from a menu, even if my choices don't work out in my favor. The other day, my nearest comedor was offering banana soup. Who would have thought to boil chicken in blended banana? Delicious! Hot Doug's is a place for people who appreciate fine food in a fast food setting. Or, gourmets wishing to spend a lazy Saturday in sweatpants. Or, seekers of unusual foods in a cheap and unpretentious atmosphere. Caramba, I almost forgot about the duck fat fries! What toothsome morsels!
