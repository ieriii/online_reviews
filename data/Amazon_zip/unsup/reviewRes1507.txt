Made my first visit to Hot Doug's this week. Couldn't believe the line. Unfortunately, I came unprepared, the joint is a cash only establishment and I was not able to order a specialty hot dog because I couldn't afford one with the little cash I had with me (they run $7 -$8 and yes I had less than that). I was able to purchase the Keira Knightley, a spicy hot dog and it was pretty good. I'll have to come back some other time and try something exotic.  What's cool is the Doug himself takes your order; he's patient and helps you figure out what you want.
