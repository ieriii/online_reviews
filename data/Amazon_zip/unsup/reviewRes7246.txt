This food was not healthy at all but absolutely delicious. I had the brisket sandwich which was not too fatty and full of flavor. Luckily you do not have to decide between sauces as they bring you a little bit of all of them. The mustard and spicy bbq sauce were my favorites. Prices were very reasonable and service was attentive and friendly.
