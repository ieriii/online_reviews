Man, I'm surprised how many "nasty attitude" comments there are. I come here a lot and never once been met with anything other than super helpful people. This is one of those places that I have a hard time venturing outside of the box, because inside the box is filled with insanely delish macarons. I know there are sticklers for these little gems, but even a bad macaron isn't really bad. But, when they're good, its sort of mind blowing.The rose flavor. OH SWEET HEAVENS! Floral notes in pastry can often be overwhelming and perfumey, but this one teeters on the edge. Its SO fragrant in your mouth, its hard to explain.I wish I lived closer so I could sample more of their creations. So far just macarons, those domes that look like boobs, and a few others that escape my mind but not my taste buds.
