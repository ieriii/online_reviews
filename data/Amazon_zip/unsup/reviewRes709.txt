ate at Alinea last year, at one year anniversary. of course everything was great, sometimes even tasty. the whole science and food thing is weird to me, but Alinea is great for chicago and for that i will respectfully cast each of the available 5 stars. but i would rather eat at blackbird, trotter, or hot doug's.
