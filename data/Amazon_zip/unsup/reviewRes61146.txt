Wow.. had a "sausage" pizza delivered to my hotel.. I was told it was a "sheet" of sausage across the top of the pizza.. silly me.. I imagined it was generously crumbled or layer sausage-lets.. no no.. it was one solid piece of meat across the top of the pizza.. Sauce was cold and tasted undercooked.. I ate 3 slices because it took 50 minutes and I was starving.. threw the rest away.. be warned.. I have to get out of the midwest.. ick..
