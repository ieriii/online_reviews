YUM YUM YUM After giving up cheese for Lent, pizza was one of the first things I wanted to eat. We ordered a small sausage/pepperoni deep-dish pizza from Art of Pizza and it was absolute HEAVEN. The sauce has such a good taste-a small kick so you don't even have to use crushed red pepper (i did anyway though). The crust is really tasty too - nice an crisp and super salty. Perfect Chicago Pizza! If it wasn't so bad for me, I would get it all the time! The only downfall is that I'm pretty sure I gained 5 lbs after having 2 slices!
