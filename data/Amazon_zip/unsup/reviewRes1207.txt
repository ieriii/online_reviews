Worth the 1-hr wait and I enjoyed the folks I was in line with. Service inside was pretty quick and there's a steady rotation of folks sitting down so that nobody was left without a seat at any given time. Definitely a unique hot dog experience. I enjoyed the rabbit sausage and duck fat fries. Yum!
