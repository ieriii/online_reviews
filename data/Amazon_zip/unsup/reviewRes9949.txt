It's hard to find good New Haven style pizza outside of New Haven, especially in the land of the thick crust. Piece, however, does a great job of coming pretty close. I was extremely pleased with their red pizza. They also have a great beer selection that is reasonably priced. The tables are crammed together and it was a little hard to hear my friend, but I would definitely go back.
