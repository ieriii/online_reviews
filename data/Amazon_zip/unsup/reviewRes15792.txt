I was expecting more based on all the positive reviews this place got. But to my disappointment, our experience was very very average. We had an 8:00 reservation, yet had to wait at the bar until 8:40 to be seated. The 3 ladies bar-tending all had attitude problems, and acted as if they were doing us a favor by taking our drink orders. Our waitress was nice, but not too attentive since they were packed. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. We tried the thin crust pizza, and like I said, solid, but not good enough to make me come back for it. I'd much rather have the thin crust pizza from Piazza Bella in Roscoe Village. The restaurant itself had a nice ambiance to it, and you can park across the street for free. Both pluses. Perhaps I'll give this place one more try and go with a pasta dish....
