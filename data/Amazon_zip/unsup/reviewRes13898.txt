I was eating at 90 Miles for the first time on Tuesday as the blizzard was upon us. I didn't want to leave in hopes that I would be trapped there forced to dine on empanadas until the storm passed. Definitely the best empanadas in the city - I tried the goat cheese, beef and chorizo. All were equally delicious and perfect in everyway. I topped those off with some sweet plantains and a couple bites of my friend's steak sandwich - the bread was perfection. I just moved to Roscoe Village and I now anticipate a major weight gain in my future. Fml.
