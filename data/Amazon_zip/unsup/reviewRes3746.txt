Amazing chicken! It was a while ago that I was here, however, I did try two sauces which I cannot remember, but I definitely plan to return the next time I am in the neighborhood. I used to live in the neighborhood, so it was much more convenient. Until then, I will hope that a Crisp opens in Bucktown/Wicker Park!
