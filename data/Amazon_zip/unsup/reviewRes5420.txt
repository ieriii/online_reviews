This was recommended as a tremendous place. We were able to cruise right in on a Friday afternoon around 1600, though we had to sit outside. No problem, there was a tent and a heater. The style is small plates to share: we tried roasted almonds with garlics, Italian sausage with broccoli and grapes, lardo iberico, hamon, and something else that escapes me, along with a bottle of cava. It was good, but for around eighty bucks it would have to be marvelous to get four stars, and it was just good.
