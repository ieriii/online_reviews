PERFECTION! Where do I start?? If nothing else.. the staff is perfect. If you spill something.. or something falls off your table.. all is fixed almost before anyone notices. They are always giving you a new plate.. they are on top of your whole experience from the second you walk in the door. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly. They will explain interesting drinks to you and are very service oriented. The Meats... OMG.. Yes! The cuts are cooked and seasoned to perfection. Just tell your server (or anyone cause they work as a team), what your favorite meat is and they will have it out to you asap... and they will keep it coming until you cant move! Most people dont know.. but in addition to the polenta, mashed potatoes, and friend banannas they give you, you can have rice and beans brought to the table. The Salad Bar... Even if you arent into the whole meat thing you can just go for the unlimited salad bar at a reduced rate. Listen people.. this isnt a regular salad bar. You have to see it to believe it. It like someone took fresh everything out of their garden and put it out for you. Try to fresh mozzarella and the apple salad... WOW. If you have room.... Try the dessert.. the papaya cream. Its supposed to help with the meat digestion.  Even if it didnt.. Id still order it.. its that good. Its a good price.... about $60/person which is pretty good for the quality and amount of food you get. Mon-Fri they have a reduced rate during lunch.
