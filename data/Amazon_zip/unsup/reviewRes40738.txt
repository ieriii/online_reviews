Dined in late February. The small, clean dining room is always welcoming. Even though the room was less than half full when we arrived, the music & staff gave it an upbeat feel. We picked a table & our waiter came by to open the wine I'd brought (Lallement Champagne & an 08 Rivers-Marie Summa Old Vines Pinot Noir, both were delicious). Courses started coming: "Consumer Advisory" sashimi, a seafood stew, and a wagyu short rib all brought "oh, wow" with their presentations & smiles with their flavor. Three of the next four courses were plates of multiple components, built from a focus ingredient (shellfish, duck, lamb). The scallop & crab motoyaki, duck roulade with pork belly, and lamb loin were highlights--all were among some of the best dishes of the week--and almost everything was great (one exception: a lamb sausage that was a bit dry). While each plate centered on a single ingredient type, it seemed a bit odd to have both warm and cool pieces on the shellfish plate; similarly, the duck roulade & tongues could have justified separate plates. Shin could have easily stretched this menu to 15+ courses. Not a negative, but at minimum, interesting that so many unique bites were worked into the meal. The last couple of courses were both fantastic. Cheese with a "candied gooseberry ornament" was a delicious contrast of textures, bitterness, and sweetness. Then came dessert: "8 presentations of chocolate." A perfect, fun plate that took us a bit of time to work through and discuss--it was interactive and educational to compare the various forms & flavors. Chocolate spaghetti was my favorite, but all were delicious & fun. Stood up as a great meal in a week of 12 Michelin stars. Full context here: http://fillc.blogspot.co
