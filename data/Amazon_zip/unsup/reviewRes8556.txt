This place is cute and so neighborly. The antipasto platter and the sausage pizza was the way to go for me! Yum and relatively inexpensive. My hub had the rapini pizza, which he didn't care for too much, but he loved my pizza and will be sure to get that next time. The only negative is the pizza does NOT reheat well - sooo eat up!
