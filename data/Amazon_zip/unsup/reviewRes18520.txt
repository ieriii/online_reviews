I came here a few months back expecting something amazing. The soups are really good. The sandwiches were just ok. They were really, really, greasy and heavy. I know that is how they are supposed to be-- but what bothered me was the lack of bright flavor. It seemed very bland. The wait was around an hour, at an "off time" at 3pm.
