I'd give this place 4 stars for their pizza delivered/take out and 3 stars for the dine-in experience. I've gotten pizza delivered from here on multiple occasions and eaten in once. I've only ever gotten their thin crust pizza and have gotten it for take out on multiple occasions because I like it so much. I am not sure what sort of cheese they use, but it is greasy as hell and totally awesome. Their garlic thin crust pizza is simply fantastic (If you are into large pieces of garlic). Probably my favorite delivered or take out pizza.  It's rather unfortunate that I haven't found anything like that closer to where I live. I've also eaten there once and I wasn't a huge fan of that experience. It wasn't that there was anything bad that happened, but it was just rather plain and ordinary.  The food (some pasta dish) wasn't anything extraordinary (very similar to what you would find at say Maggianos). Service was also average, nothing special. Everything was just so very average. There are plenty of places I'd rather go to first (or even try) before I go back and dine-in. I will continue to get their pizza either delivered or take out, but will be skipping the dine-in.
