I really don't understand all the hype about this place...the food is average and too expensive for what it is - not to mention wayyyy too heavy and ALL pork and beef. The service is meh. I went in for lunch a couple of weeks ago and practically had to beg the bartender to pay attention to me. Next time I'll wear ironic glasses and a plaid shirt, that should help.
