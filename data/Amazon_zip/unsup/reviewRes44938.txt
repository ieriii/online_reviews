The reason why I gave this rating during my trip to Chicago: After a late evening flight, arrived here hungry for some great pizza. Waited 40 minutes for an order messed up by the waitress. I wanted to try the pizza, but only got to have the garlic bread. No manager that night attempted to make it right but gladly took the money for the bread. I will find another place to experience deep dish. Will they make it right? Let's see if they reply...
