Best deep dish pizza-ever. Plain and simple. Deciding factor? I MICROWAVED (Eeek!) the leftovers the next day........and still loved it! This isn't a freebie award either. I have high deep dish expectations that I beleive both Lou Malnati's and Edwardo's meet, however Pequod's exceeds! Most obvious is the crust, blah blah blah. You've heard it all. BUT-too good not to mention! You see the charred crust and swear it must taste burnt, but it just doesn't. It's a chewy, cheesy, crispy piece of heaven. The best part of this pizza however is NOT the crust, but the SAUCE! My mouth is akwardly watering right now just thinking about it. It is quite sweet-but not really sweet? I dunno, I do not like sweet sauces, but I LOVE this sauce. The savory/saltiness of it is a perfect balance. Other notables: nice atmosphere, decent beer list, fair price YUM!
