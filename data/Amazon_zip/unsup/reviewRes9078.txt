I've been living around the neighborhood for more than 4 years and I have never been to this place until last year when I started going out with a half Persian guy. On our first "date" we passed by it on our way to the brown line and he wouldn't stop raving about the place and how he would take me there someday. Apparently, he's been going there since he was a kid with his dad. Way before the place got all fancy and big, when Noon O Kabab was very small and cheap according to him. Finally, he took me and my parents there and I we were blow away. I've never had dill rice before and it is my favorite part of going there. The chicken kababs are my favorite and free feta bread and cheese during the appetizers are very good. I also had their shrimp once and I loved it! The waiters are very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. Also, me and my boyfriend ordered for a delivery on their lunch special and the guy on the phone misheard our order and called us a few minutes later and said he gave us extra food free of charge! It was an accident of course but he was very apologetic about it and sincere so plus on the customer service! I definitely recommend Noon O Kabab if you're around the neighborhood looking for something filling and tasty =D.
