Talk about a sausage fest! If I could give this joint 15 stars, I would. After waiting for 45 minutes outside on a blustery February day, we waited another 15 minutes inside the cramped storefront. And, trust me, there were no complaints from me. Heck, I would've waited another half hour at least to taste the pork sausage with pear creme fraiche, toasted almonds and Gorgonzola cheese again. I actually have dreams about that life-changing encased meat. So my good friend Jake was in town from Indy. And he's one of those people who usually eat dogs with 'ketchup only.' After all of my pontificating about the wonder of Chicago dogs, he finally agreed to try one. And I thought, what better place than Hot Dougs? Well, call me a matchmaker, because it was love at first bite. He's hooked. Mr. Ketchup Only is now singing the praises of everything that is a Chicago dog. Sans the ketchup, of course. Hot Dougs couldn't have been better. And with all the hype surrounding this little place, my only letdown were the duck fat fries. Maybe I was paying too much attention to my main entree, but they didn't really do it for me. Ah well, next time I'll skip the fries and order another dog.
