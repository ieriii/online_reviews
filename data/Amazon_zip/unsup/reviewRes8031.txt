Head north on Ravenswood Avenue and when you hit the Sunnyside of the street, you will find Spacca Napoli. My boyfriend runs up and down Ravenswood and he was so excited about "this little neighborhood pizza place." He thought it would be a cool place to check out and maybe I would be the "first to Yelp it." Oh man. How little does he know this Yelp crowd. . . Still, I was pumped to try Spacca Napoli and to formulate my own opinion. When we arrived here Wednesday night around 6:30PM, the place was just heating up. We opted to sit outside on the sidewalk patio. The hostess was super friendly and totally picked up on the "don't you dare sit me near those bratty kids" vibe I was throwing down. Our waitress was flawless - she knew the menu inside and out (she even had the Italian accent down. Impressive). I saw the owner scooting around with free slices and Prosecco samples. All in all, service was 5 star. As for the food. . . .not as exciting. The salads we ordered to start were tasty - excellent balsamic dressing! Loved the bread drizzled in olive oil. Also loved my $5 glass of Shiraz-ish wine. However, when it came to the main event, my buzz fizzled. We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pie and another "special" pizza with mozzarella, olives, salami, and red sauce.  Did I love them? No. I actually walked away from the meal somewhat unsatisfied. The ingredients were fresh but the pizza was really chewy and dry. The arugula pizza had a great flavor combination but the consistency (aka leaves on dry, chewy bread) didn't do it for me.  I guess I am more of a floppy NY Slice girl - red sauce and greasy roni will steal my heart any day of the week. Spacca Napoli left me a little empty inside. It's kind of like Medieval Times - definitely a place to try once, but I will not regularly incorporate baby dragon into my diet.
