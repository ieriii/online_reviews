Lets break it down here, I was drawn to this place for their relaxed hours. They're open all through the night. Oh, and they're BYOB. That's pretty badass to me, as a Denverite, I've never experienced BYOB restaurants before.  But damn, the food was a mere average to me, I've had much better Korean BBQ, on top of that, the service was crap, just like everyone says. When servers get angry at you and you can tell, is when you have some pretty poor service. And to top it all off with a nice little cherry, for six people, we racked up a bill of $160! And I wasn't even full yet! That's almost $27 a person. I'd rather take my money and go to sushi, rather than this average Korean BBQ. If you go there, you should ask your amazing server for a side of WeakSauce to dip your kalbee.
