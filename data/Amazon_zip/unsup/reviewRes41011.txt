I live around the corner from here but it took me awhile to get myself to go since its website seemed a bit overly swanky for my bank account, but I am so glad that I finally did cuz it was gooood. Its super small but has a very cozy romantic feel to it. Perfect for a date or you and a friend in the mood to dish over a bottle of wine. The prices are a bit steep, we chose the pre fix menu at $60 a pop, I was in the mood to splurge. This was a while ago so i dont remember everything I had but i do remember delicious frogs legs and a not so great beef stew. the beef was super dry (hence 4 instead of 5 stars) but if i'm gonna pay $60 for a meal i'm gonna lick the plate clean damn it. Our waiter was very nice and kept asking for feed back on the courses, I believe the chefs were the ones wanting the feed back, and although the beef stew wasn't all that great I had a hard time saying so. Definitely a great place to check out! My friend and I walked in on a weekday night with no reservations and it wasn't crowded at all. But I"ve walked by on weekends and it's looked like a full house. UPDATE: 3/17/08 went back again with a few newbies and even though we had no reservations and they were expecting a full house, they accommodated us, by the chef's request. everyone that works there is from the logan square area and they will do all they can do to hookup a fellow neighbor. Good people work here, they get an xtra star.
