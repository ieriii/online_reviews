A portion of the seating is community style which is what we did to reduce our wait time. Overall the food was delicious and very elegantly prepared. We also enjoyed some great champagne (celebrating a promotion). I didn't mind sitting next to strangers, but we did find it to be a bit cramped. The plates are designed for sharing and we ordered several different things from pasta to pizza. All of which were excellent.
