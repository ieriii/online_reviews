I loved this place when I went about 8 or 9 years ago. I went again recently and it's better than I remembered! Granted, I could probably live on cheese and chocolate but even those not as dairy obsessed should give it a try. Definitely a romantic spot, but not so much that you wouldn't enjoy it with family members or friends instead of a significant other. It's a much better atmosphere than Melting Pot. If you give them your email address they'll send you $25 off coupons after your visit and another one for your birthday. Then it becomes affordable as well as delicious!
