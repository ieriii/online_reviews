c28, some advice from an old fan: please try a little harder. We usually get the delicious Bistec a la Cubana but tonight I went with a special, Paella Mixta, and my wife switched to Carne a la Parilla. Paella issues: I didn't like the pork (too tough, bland flavor) or chicken in the Paella recipe. Isn't it more typical to put fish and sausage in this? Thought the rice was a little mushy and lacked flavor as well. I didn't taste any saffron at all. Also, the mussels were small and two of them did not open. Disappointing. The Carne a la Parilla had a great smoky flavor but my wife felt the meat was too chewy. I tried a bite and liked it a lot, and I could live with the texture. Slightly skimpy on the rice here but the vegetables were crisp and perfect. I ordered the drink special, el Antiguo. This was a creative drink recipe that was executed well. If I had ordered a second one I would have asked for it a little less sweet. My wife's Mojito tasted a little too much like Sprite. Our server did a good job, and if he had waited just a few minutes on his last table check until I had tasted my paella I would have shared this info face to face instead of posting this mildly douchey yelp review. Also I can't believe I'm writing this, since in real life I talk like your typical fucking Chicagoan, but some of the waitstaff was a little too potty-mouthed within earshot of the customers. The experience wasn't SO bad that I'll be strapping on a manpurse and going to LM or Chalkboard instead, but it might take a groupon or http://restaurant.com certificate to get us back for our next visit.
