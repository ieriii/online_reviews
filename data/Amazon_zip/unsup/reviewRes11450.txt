Ok, the pizza is fantastic. Im not the HUGST fan of thin crust, but it's pretty damn good. Now, lets get to what i KNOW you all want to talk about Beer... ...and how it all has the flavor and smell (some more than other) of the stankiest yum yum marijuana you could put your face in. Add this with he fact that you can put 64 delicious ounces onto a glass bottle and leave with it and you have the equation for one of the BEST establishments in this whole city... bar none! and that is all i have to say about piece pizza!
