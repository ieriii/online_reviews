This was an amazing restaurant that I'll likely go back to everytime I am in Chicago! At first, I thought the open wood-burning kitchen would take the BBQ smell too far but I'm happy to report it was perfectly ventilated & I didn't leave smelling like I had been in s smoker for an hour. The ambience was great for the birthday celebration we had last night. We were promptly seated (made reservations) & the service throughout the night was very attentive & QUICK-which was awesome! Their filet trio allowed us to try 3 of their crusts, which were all great, (Parmesan was my fave). The s'more cake dessert was great, too. An all-around fantastic restaurant :)
