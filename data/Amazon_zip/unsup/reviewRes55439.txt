I personally feel that when someone goes on a TV show with synapse cooking, they should not feel entitled to open up a restaurant. The service was HORRIBLE. There is no coat check, so my giant poofy coat was trapped between my chair and the chair that was resting against it. We were basically sitting in the fucking walkway. The decor looked like someone spent $40 at a Pier One outlet mall. Right as we sat doesn't at 8, I ordered a vodka tonic..... It arrived at 8:20. The waitress was so busy, that she actually only came over twice during the whole meal. Now the menu- ahhhhhh. It's one thing to Be complex, but this guy obviously felt he needed to make the dishes complicated to seem gourmet. Farro risotto with RAW celery root, duck(which was the only edible thing) and cherries? See, if any of that crap was delicious, it could've had it's own legs. And then the main course came. The sauces were beautful but had not one iota of flavor. The dishes were covered in nuts, lettuce, stacks of crap and less than three bites of meat. Again, trying to be beautiful and gourmet and French. Honestly, I feel Americans are so drawn to fame, that they will lower their standards and accept less than mediocre crap as delicious, 5 star food. People want to be close enough to a tv star that they will schlep to an undesirable location, just to be in the same building, so they have a cool story for their friends and an unrelevant chef go couldn't even WIN the show(seriously, 3rd place out of 10 isn't that great). Don't bother. Go somewhere else
