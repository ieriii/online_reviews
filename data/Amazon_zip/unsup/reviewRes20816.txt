The mussels vindaloo are UNBELIEVABLE....Go to the gage, and order those with a cold beer. We did have a few raw ones, and sent them back to get resteamed, no big dea. The waiter got a little nervous about it and sent the equally nervous manager, who insisted that they were cooked. we just wanted them cooked longer. anyway, they comped our mussels, which was nice....because we could then afford an uneccessary jameson at the bar on our way out, and drunkenly stumbled through the tiny cartier-bresson exhibit at ARTIC 2 pm. on a weekday.
