I've only been here for lunch, but both times I have been here I have had to send the steak kabobs back to be cooked through because it was way too rare. Like, scary red. It's frustrating on a lunch break having to wait for a do-over while your coworker eats. The rice and veggies are phenomenally tasty though. Next time I'll stick to Semiramis or get the chicken.
