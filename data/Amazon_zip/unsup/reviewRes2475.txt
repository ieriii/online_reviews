Let me be review number six-hundred-whatever... Economically, it makes no sense waiting two hours for a hot dog. You could go to Target, Jewel, Catch a movie, eat a hot dog at another place, and maybe write the great American novel in the same time span. Yet this is Hot Dougs and waiting is part of the experience, but not for me. Economically, you should only go there for the specialty dogs. You can get a Chicago dog just as good waiting at some other place just five minutes. And when you go, go early. On a Tuesday at 11a.m. Take a day off and make it a mystical journey that only happens every few months. No duck fat fries can shed a couple minutes off the line. When you do sit down with your elk dog or alligator sausage it's great. But be nice: eat, then leave. There's people behind you.
