Whenever I come here, I always end up eating WAY TOO MUCH! The portion sizes are pretty big, and with all of the gems on the menu, I usually order more than one thing, at least an app and an entree (tubs-mcgee over here). If you are craving salty comfort food, Hopleaf is perfect to get your fix. I always get the mussels, which comes with a large cone of frites and the best aioli EVER!!! Never a disappointment. The CB&J and Duck Reuban are worth trying (delicious), but due to their heaviness/saltiness, I haven't ordered them more than once. It will give you that -itis for sure. I would recommend trying any of the entrees. My boyfriend is a big fan of the Montreal-style brisket platter. The first time he got it, it was unreal! So juicy and tender. I was a bit disappointed with the stilton mac and cheese side, since it was a little bland. The entrees change with the seasons, but if you see any kind of fish on the menu, go for it. I had trout one time and it was insanely good, well-seasoned, perfectly cooked. It's always a good idea to get here early if you want a seat in the bar. I don't mind the dining room at all though. It's cozy and warm, and you get to peak into the kitchen if you are in the right spot. I have never had any issues with the service. The busboys are really on their game and I've always had great servers. If I were more of a beer head and still lived in the neighborhood, I would come here much more often. Now it's more of a once-in-a-great-while kind of place.
