I do not understand the rave reviews of this place. I just don't. First time here my experience was okay, nothing 5-star or anything but somewhere I wouldn't mind dining at again. We went with a lot of safe choices from the volcano roll to the white dragon to the spicy miso, so I expected to come here again because they have an overall appealing menu. The atmosphere is super sleek, just a tad darker than I'd like but cool nonetheless. I thought I finally found another decent sushi spot to regular. Boy, was I wrong. Round #2 was horrible. Compare it to the feeling of having a stellar first date only to find out the asswipe is married, or something of the sort. I really thought I could like this place, and I want to say maybe it was just an off night for them. But that second trip is enough for me not to return. Out of our group, no one enjoyed their meal. NO ONE. Their yakisoba was nothing but salt. Their miso soup came out lukewarm. They had a special Japan roll as support to those affected by the tsunami which was great, but the roll was nothing to brag about. Too much rice, mushy and tiny. I usually don't kick sushi joints for having small rolls because when I've run into that before, they load up on the fish. But they don't. Salmon skin rolls were stale-like instead of cripsy. And our server? All over the place... on a near empty weeknight. It's important to note I rarely complain about servers because I give them the benefit of the doubt, but we were ticked. I know this place is going for more fusion rather than authentic, but it's not winning me. Overpriced for subpar sushi and crap service? I'm over it.
