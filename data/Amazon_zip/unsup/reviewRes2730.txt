It's so over priced, and none of the dishes are really memorable. Maybe due to the fact that we just had Daniel and Jean Georges in NYC, and Salts in Cambridge, Tru really was a bad finale for my graduation gastronomic trip. The service was slow, probably because there were two large tables of corporate clients, but still... 5 courses for 3.5 hours? Alinea does 17 courses for 3.5 hours... Water glasses were left empty from time to time. Out of the 5 course tasting menu, the worst thing was the pork belly. It was just a piece of fat meet, fried in Oliver oil... It was an one bite dish, really, not even an appetizer. Beef was bad, too. Overcooked and flavorless. The fish course was OK, but it's just a piece of cheap Salmon, and as long as you do not over cook it, it's gonna be OK anyway. I know it's only an one star restaurant, but the 5 course tasting menu is 110 bucks, and Daniel's three course pre fix is the same price. Daniel's three courses and complimentary pastry items completely filled us up, and Tru's five "courses" left us in hungry. Daniel gave me a very very nice complimentary dessert for my graduation, and Tru gave me a tiny piece of butter cake for my birthday and graduation celebration. The decor was not as good as some people described, either. We had seared foie gras, wagyu beef, and a nice bottle of 2009 Beaujolais Cruz at Daniel, for less than 800. We paid almost 700 bucks at Tru, with a cheaper bottle of wine, worse service, and definitely worse food. Do yourself a favor and go to Alinea!!!
