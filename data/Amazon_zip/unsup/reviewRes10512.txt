Very nice patio. Foccacia and bread were great. Had the two specials, a pappardelle with rabbit ragu and a beef tenderloin with black truffle butter, both of which were excellent. Pasta texture was perfect. Dinner for two including a $30 bottle of wine, appetizers, dessert was around $125. (I'm surprised at the service complaints -- we ate there around 6 PM on a Friday night and they were very attentive...)
