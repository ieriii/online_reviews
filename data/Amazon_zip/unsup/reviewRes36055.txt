Meli Cafe has all the right recipes for an amazing brunch date with your loved ones. I decided to go here when I watched the show "Check Please". Everyone raved about how good the food was and how much they enjoyed the atmosphere. My mom, BF and I went Christmas weekend. Since it's located on a busy intersection, at Jackson and Halsted, my mom and were dropped off. My bf had to drive around to find a park. Once inside, the popularity of the place was obvious, because the doorway and the tables were crowded. It only took maybe 10 min before our table was ready. Although the BF was still out looking for a park, the owner came out and seated my mom and I.  All in all, the people were extremely patient with us first timers. We all ordered different things, and everything was delish! Both the mango and oatmeal smoothies were very tasty. Be warned though not to have a the "Big eyes syndrome" and ordered more than one entree, because the plates are huge. I will definitely be back here. As a matter of a fact, I'm getting hungry now...
