So maybe Chef Levitski isn't at his best when given a quick fire or elimination challenge, but give the man time to compose a menu and you'll be in for an excellent meal. Favorites for me include a perfectly cooked octopus spiked with chorizo, and a surprise cheese course that just might be the most decadent grilled cheese sammich you've ever had. I'll admit, it was a little heavy that late in the meal, but it's certainly memorable and the accompanying glass of Scrumpy Cider (came with the drink pairings) proved to be the perfect chaser. Overall, I would best describe the meal as rustic and comforting, but with a refined edge. Each course gives you several options from which to choose, and our waiter made some very helpful recommendations. The dishes were also well portioned, as both the wifey and I were quite full by the end of our meal. Service overall was friendly and attentive, and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening for two. In the end, it was a solid 4.5 star dinner in my book and definitely worth another visit in the future.
