I have been wanting to try Anteprima for several months now and finally had the money and friend to do so. Stepped in here without reservations and were seated in under a minute in the front window 2 top. The kitchen brought out 2 complimentary zucchini/cheese amuse bouche for us to try and they were delicious. I ordered one of the red wines to go with my ravioli entree from the extensive wine list. The ravioli were spectacular and my friend had the New York strip seasoned and cooked to perfection. Only downside is the prices. $17 for a plate of 8 to 10 small homemade ravioli with a touch of sauce. That's almost $2 per ravioli. The breads brought to the table were amazing as well. Thanks Anteprima, I will be back for this truly authentic Italian again.
