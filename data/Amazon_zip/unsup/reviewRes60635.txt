Good atmosphere and prices. A bit of a wait to get a table, so you may want to call ahead. Wait staff was friendly. Above average food and solid portions. They have little glasses, and black and white photos of all the waitresses who have worked there hanging on the wall. Other than that, teo thumbs up!
