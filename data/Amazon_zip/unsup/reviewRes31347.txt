Nana, Eek! Methinks not. Just like Yelp says. Acronym for "Never Again, Never Again" I don't know why my boyfriend's review is blocked so I'm going to reiterate, this is a waste of money, time, and space. Go to somewhere else less pretentious where people know how to serve you with courtesy, don't over charge you and ask you how much you're going to leave them tip. I'm sure the other waitresses may be great, but the one we had made us feel like we were taking care of her and the hostess was a "dumbo" as in she ignored my boyfriend, and pretended to fiddle with the phone until he went back to sit with me, she was ignoring that he had had a question. The food we ate was on a Friday night and it was "duck confit" without duck, go figure, if you want duck you have to pay more. The oh so famous pablano sauce was was "put away" who the hell puts away a good selling condiment. Dumb business, dumb service. I liked the decor, but not going to give this place a second chance. I'm sad to see this place is very drab, and I was expecting more even for Bridgeport, my old hometown which I missed. Waitress lacked courtesy and just a sense of humor...oh and the biggie "common sense" the biscuits with the duck confit was nasty, too dang sweet with a salty sauce. If you want great Duck go to Chinatown at least restaurants there are not pretentious. If this place cut their prices in half or more, I think I would tolerate the poor service, and food standards. Po Boy was a bunch of fried shrimp on a huge chunk of gluten filling bread to make you full, take that away and all you have are 6-8 pieces of fried shrimp, some lettuce and tomato. You can get that on Archer/Canal... Save your $60 and enjoy some GREAT FOOD SOMEWHERE ELSE! Money is not everything but service is, and the value of food is... We are the type of people to spend $250 per person on Motto and have, or $75 per person at Arun's if the service and food is worth it. Save the $60!!!
