This place was amazing! My partner and I came here for our first time ever, and the waitress totally gave us the run down on everything. My gf tried the steak which was done to perfection, better then any steak I've tasted so far. I tried the BBQ platter which had ribs sooo tender they fell off the bone. Drinks were just as great, very reasonable and although we spent a nice penny it was worth every cent. The atmosphere was very low key, very private and the booths are great one on one time. Parking was not bad at all, then again we went during the week. Defintely will be coming back here very soon!!
