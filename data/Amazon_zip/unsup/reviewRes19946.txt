I mostly love little neighborhood places, but it is federal law that you love every Rick Bayless place, so what could I do?? I am so glad I did, just like I love Topolo and Frontera.  I suggest avoiding the lunch craziness and go for breakfast. Maybe the best ever chiliquiles, even though the serving size seems small since I think I could eat four or fourteen of them. The empanadas are wonderful. As is the breakfast torta with chorizo and egg. You also have to try the chocolate bean to cup variations (I like the Aztec) , with a limonada chaser. Yum! And a churro for desert. And one to go. And one for your left pocket, just in case the bus gets stranded.
