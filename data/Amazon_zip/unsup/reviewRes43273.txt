EVERYONE has their own opinion of what good pizza is, and everyone is entitled to be different. For me, this place has great deep dish. Lots of everything, crust, cheese, sauce, toppings; yet well-balanced. Not too much of any one thing. The sauce had a great flavor, not just a bottle of marinara. I would definitely order again.
