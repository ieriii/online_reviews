Used to work just around the corner from La Pasadita so I fell in love with this place. Would always go for some tacos or burritos for lunch, after working late or while out in wicker park. That was about a year ago. Rewind to a few weeks ago. The place is different. Steak is still good but greasy. No chips and pico de gallo while I waited for my meal. It just wasn't as good as I remembered. Not really bad, just not good enough to justify 5 stars. If I could I would give another half star for being open really late and taking credit cards. I would say best late night tacos in wicker park (La Pasadita does blow away Flash Taco). Tip: Skip the chicken, its always dry. Stick with the steak. Get the super burrito, it weighs as much as a puppy but all the rice and beans soak up the steak grease and marinates itself. Yum.
