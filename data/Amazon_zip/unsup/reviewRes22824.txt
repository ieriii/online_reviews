If you are going to be eating a hot dog in Chicago, this place is a famous place to try. I've only been here once, but it is a unique experience. I do not recall how the food tasted, but I remember us parking in their lot and eating in our cars, which is uncomfortable. I should definitely try to go back and have another hot dog though. Not too many other drive in places that I'm aware of around that area, but Superdawg is one of those places you see on TV that you should try.
