First: This is probably the best sushi you'll find in Chicago.However: Now that happy hour is over (which was half off most rolls two days a week), it's pretty expensive--up to around $15/roll for the good ones. They are huge, though--two of these would fill up almost anyone.That being said, if this is in your price range, go! The music is good, it's BYOB, and there's anime projected on the main wall. Oh, and order at least one "godzilla" and one "red dragon". They are absolute staples.EDIT: the music has become a little less awesome lately. bring back the tall guy's ipod!
