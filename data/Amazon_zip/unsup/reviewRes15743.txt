Okay, so I realize that everyone and their mother has reviewed Violet Hour, but my friends and I tried a bunch of items off the food menu, so I thought reviews of those items and the specific cocktails I tried could be kind of helpful: - "Hush and Wonder" - this was the first drink I had; rum with grapefruit bitters, creme de violette, lime. It was simply fantastic; highly recommended. I'm definitely getting this when I go back. - "Dark and Stormy" - rum, lime and ginger syrup. I didn't really like this cocktail; I thought the ginger was very overpowering (even though it's a flavor I normally like). - Don't be freaked out by the fact that some of the drinks have egg whites as an ingredient! They're yummy. - Fried peanut butter/banana/bacon sandwich, drizzled with honey - definitely something to share with a friend, but surprisingly not as greasy or heavy as I was imagining! Pretty freaking delicious. - Tempura green beans - again, light and not very greasy - you could taste the green beans instead of just the tempura coating; big portion too. - Duck meatballs with a green apple dip - very delicious - Trio of candied nuts, curry Rice Krispies squares, cheddar crackers - I could have eaten all 3 plates by myself, but I was forced to share with my friends :( Boo. Definitely going back! Yes, it's more expensive than having a few Miller Lites and chicken wings in Wrigleyville...but you get what you pay for: ambiance, quality, quality and QUALITY!
