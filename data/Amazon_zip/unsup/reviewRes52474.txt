Three words Bomb steak joint! Great food (for meat eaters) and service is unlike any other. We have recently visited here in a group of 7 people, and everyone enjoyed everything. Although Fago is also a great place, Brazzaz's had a few more optionals that put itself above and beyond Fago. For instance, there shrimp is one and the other would be the fresh oysters available on the salad bar. We all know salad bar sounds like a famine way to go, but this salad bars is not the typical lettuce and tomato setup. Pasta, seafood, and everything else flows with it. Expect to pay lots $$ to check it out, but to help look for a buy one get one coupons in the Chicago mail. Its save us $150, with a total of six people on it. Also, if you're looking to save a few more $$, pass on the after dinner fruit drink, its not the best. Deserts are great! Good luck and enjoy!
