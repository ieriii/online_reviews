Graham Elliot has the claim to being Chicago's first 'bistronomic' restaurant in the city. It serves up food with a sense of humor and a whole lot of surprising combinations and flavor profiles. A great recommendation fit for any foodies. The place can get very lively at times, and frequently attracts large groups contributing to the noise level. We always enjoy ourselves here and look forward to some of the staples on the menu like the 'foie-pops' and the 'caesar salad'. The popcorn can sometimes be a little soggy when it is humid out or if it has not just been made, but the new popcorn maker on this trip seems to have hit it out of the park. The kitchen tour is a nice touch, were they invite tables to head into the kitchen to see behind the scenes and sample one more little bite. Always inventive and never dull, but sometime challenging, and in our books that is a good thing. You can see photos here on my blog - http://wp.me/p13q2t-1zh.
