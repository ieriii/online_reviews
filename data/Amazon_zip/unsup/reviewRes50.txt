I had been excited for Alinea for months, but I have to say that my experience was ruined by the waitstaff -- and I left disappointed. The biggest flaw in the evening was how rudely the wait staff treated us when we opted not to get the wine pairings. They attempted to talk us out of it, then pushed a champagne cocktail on to us that we didn't really want. Later, when we each just wanted one glass of wine, the staff lectured us about how difficult it would be to have just one glass of wine since each glass only goes with one dish, and how they could really only properly serve us if we would get the entire wine pairing. I did not get the wine pairing because I wanted to enjoy the experience without getting too tipsy, but the waitstaff made me feel as though I was being cheap. Additionally, when my tablemate did not eat all of the first course because he did not care for roe, the waitstaff loudly made a big scene about asking him why he didn't like it and if there was anything else that he didn't want them to bother bringing out. It embarassed him and, after that interaction, we couldn't help but feel awkward and judged during the meal. Of course, some of the dishes were amazing, such as the taffy balloon and hot potato/cold potato. However, we just couldn't enjoy them in that environment.
