GREAT barbecue! I love the fact that they give you 4 different bbq style sauces, it gives you automatic variety to your meal. The portion sizes are huge! Those hush puppies are TO.DIE.FOR. Make sure you order them. It's also good to find good Sweet Tea at a restaurant up North, so kudos to Chicago Q. I highly recommend it.
