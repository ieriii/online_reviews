I'm a big Avec fan and I generally hold Madia et. al's. places in high regard. I think the reviews I've seen on this place have been a bit harsh. The Publican looks pretty cool. The space is voluminous and open, with communal dining and a dine-at bar. Dishes are made to share, and the wine list is affordable (I counted roundly four bottles for less than $30. I need to mention that complimentary sparkling water is offered with is a huge deal for me. Still is available as well. **THE SERVICE** - A bit scripted, I will agree, but the menu is elaborate and there is alot to learn. The place is new. Both the servers and hosts were very friendly and the place seemed customer-centric, unlike Avec which often throws off the take-it-or-leave-it vibe. The staff was happy to call a cab for me and answer all of my questions. As a caveat I was there on Monday and I was maybe one of 25 in the restaurant. **THE FOOD** - Pork centric, which plays into the whole Fulton Street hog Mecca thing. Impressive seafood selection - 9 dishes plus 6 types of oysters. I had the smoked fish and the quercia rossa aged ham, with a side of wood roasted sunchokes with chanterelle mushrooms. The smoked fish (smoked eel, mackerel, and trout) dish was very rich and came with a piece of bread smothered in fromage blanc, which was secretly glutinous but delicious. The ham portion was generous - too much for one person after the fish - and came with bread and goat butter (interesting). The sunchokes added the one-two Avec slathered-in-butter punch, culminating in me needing a doggie bag. I think the sunchokes were my favorite of all three. **THE BOOZE** - I had a martini made with Juniper gin. It was $9, which is more than reasonable for good place. As mentioned before they offer several affordable bottles of wine and a great beer list but to be honest don't rush here for the beer list. It's more interesting than about 80% of the places out there but not the end-all-be-all in beer joints. Avec has almost an equally interesting beer selection. **THE PRICE** - Certainly put a hurt on for a meal for one. I could have easily shared all of my dishes and shared a $24 bottle of wine, so come here with a group. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars is the price, plus the place isn't breaking new ground in terms of food. It's basically Avec v2.0 but a little more expensive. But, when you have a good formula go with it. I will be back with a group.
