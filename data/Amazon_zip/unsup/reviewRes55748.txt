I'm thrilled to hear about the pizza here because time after time, I get no further than the eggplant rollatini. Joyfully in a rut with this dish. Love this place and its fresh everything. All the textures and tastes are right on from bread, to salad, to cheeses and on and on. One of my favorite go-to spots for a notch above Italian meal in a neighborhood that's utterly charming and stroll-able day or night.
