In my book, Hopleaf is a unique Chicago venue because of its fine selection of Belgian-style ales and its terrific mussels. I only wish I could get there more often. On this visit, we brought out-of-town guests, and everyone had a good time. As always, the draft ales put a smile on my face and the mussels were terrific. Roasted cauliflower was also very good. I wish the frites were double-fried to a crispier texture, and I wish it were just a bit quieter and a bit more brightly lit. Still, I'll be back, for sure!
