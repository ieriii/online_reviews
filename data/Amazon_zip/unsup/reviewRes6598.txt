You will not leave Chicago q hungry, that's for sure. You will probably leave happily stuffed and needing to face-plant on your bed immediately after. It's not the best or most authentic BBQ I've ever had, but it gets the job done. The portions are nuts. I recommend the appetizer sampler, where you get 3 samples of meat and a heap of cornbread (thus freeing up your sides options for the entree; I got the coleslaw and didn't regret it). The cheddar-bacon hush puppies were just okay -- skippable, in my opinion. Pulled pork was yummy and both the baby back ribs and St. Louis style were tasty. I like that the ribs don't come wet and you can add the sauce yourself -- definitely less messy that way. The hot mustard sauce is good as a alternative to BBQ.  The service was good, though it was a little odd that our server referred to both me (I'm 31) and my stepmom (she's in her late 40s) as "sweetie" repeatedly. We are grown women, sir, no need to call us sweetie. But that's not a huge deal, more like an odd quirk. The food came out at a good pace and water and napkins were replenished as needed. The Malbec we ordered was not bad for $35 (one of the cheapest wines on the list). I'll definitely come back, I just need to make sure to clear my schedule after in anticipation of the food coma.
