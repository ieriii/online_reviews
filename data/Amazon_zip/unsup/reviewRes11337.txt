I have eaten at many breakfast places in Chicago... and I'll take public transpo on a Saturday morning to wait in line here. Hands down, my favorite "food" breakfast place in Chicago. I'm definitely not a fan of the line... but it ends up being worth it! The menu is always the best part of the anticipation of breakfast! The group I weekend brunch it up with, we always order one of the specials for the whole table to share, along with our own special entrees. We love the veggie/egg combos, but the pancakes and french toasts - that are sweet and have bold interesting flavors are always top of our list to share and love (but we couldn't handle a whole meal of it)! Mimosas & Bloody Mary's are great... stay away from the Bailey's - as they only have mint to put in the coffee and it didn't go over very well.
