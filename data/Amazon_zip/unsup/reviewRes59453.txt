Ok, this is THE BEST pizza in the world! I fell in love with this pizza a long time ago, but fell in love again when I recently visited. The pizza does take a long time(about 45 minutes) to actually get to your table, but well worth the wait. The tomato sauce is on top of the thick layer of cheese that covers the amazing buttery crust underneath. The slices are pretty big and thick, so keep that in mind when ordering a large pizza for just two. The service is generally pretty good, but once you get your pizza you will forget about anything else. There are a lot of locations in Illinois and then a few in Orlando, so if you are going to Disney make sure you check this scrumptious pizza joint out.
