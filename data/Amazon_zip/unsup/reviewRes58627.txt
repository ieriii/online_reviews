What a shame.1. Salad was absolutely drowned in dressing. The greens were floating in dressing. Also, the greens were nothing spectacular: generic salad mix.2. The cheese fondue is like Gruyere nacho cheese. By the time we were finished it was congealing on the sides of the pot. It is awfully thick, and seems as though it must have been prepared hours earlier and sat in a pot waiting. The cheese, if it truly is Gruyere, is obviously low quality. By the end I was eating plain pretzel bread (pretty good) to try to get the taste out of my mouth. 3. Chocolate was fine. The pound cake was pretty burnt.We skipped any sort of meat, noting that they advertised grain-fed USDA Choice beef, as if that were something to be proud of. In an age when many restaurants are offering grass-fed options beef (and even charging extra for it), bragging about grain-fed seems very dated. For over $40/person and not huge serving sizes of meat, I would think they wouldn't brag unless it were USDA Prime. I suppose it wouldn't really bother me if they had just said beef tenderloin without all of the extra features.Everything is just behind the times and seems careless. Each course comes out in only a couple minutes after ordering, indicating that most likely almost nothing is made to order. None of the ingredients seem high quality. $40-$50/person would be much better spent at countless fantastic Chicago restaurants.
