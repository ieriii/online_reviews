Greek Islands is a staple for our family gatherings, large or small. Great food, service, large portions, and not too expensive. Free Valet is awesome in Chicago. There are not a lot of places that have this although most of the other Greek town restaurants offer the same service. The atmosphere is more dress casual I guess, you don't have to be dressed up, but a lot of people are. Its a great place for a date too because while its a big place, it has a personal, and intimate feel to it. The food is great, but you really need to know what you are ordering. There are a lot of menu items and specials and while I like almost everything, I have been there a few times with someone who was new to greek food that ordered something that was not really what they had wanted. I suggest sticking with something basic if you are a picky eater. If not, go crazy! There are a ton of great items that you won't find anywhere except a Greek restaurant and they are cooked extremely well here. Also huge portions!!! plan on not finishing or bringing home left overs. I would say the best thing they make is lamb, cooked however you want it, but I prefer the lamb chops. Dolmades are also a must order. Overall I would say if you like greek food, this is one of the top 2 places in geek town and its great for a lot of reasons, and not very expensive.
