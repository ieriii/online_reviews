For such an overpriced market that boasts such high self-delusion, I am always disappointed when I go to F&O. The food is good and selection is interesting, clean. However, all the servers and people who work there are so grouchy and unfriendly and unhelpful. I've had to wait 10 min at the prepared food section AND the bread section, even though the market was not busy at all. Everyone takes their jolly ol time and no one has a smile on. It must be an awful place to work and the boss must suck. I always leave with a distasteful feeling. I'd rather go to Goddess and the Grocer or even Trader Joe's.
