Sultan's, Get off your butt and start getting competitive! Falafel could use a little salt and its a bit too crumbly. Lamb shawerma is delicious, I wonder if the sandwiches should be treated differently, I want to love Sultan's but it's just okay. It's just okay. Which is why I haven't been back in 6-12 months! You lean too heavily on the 20 year old hipsters that just moved in to town and think it's cool to eat you. You make me sad.
