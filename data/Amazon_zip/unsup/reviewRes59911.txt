I was really disappointed with my child's birthday cake which was commissioned from this bakery. After paying over $100, I felt that it was totally devoid of inspiration, color and creativity, not to mention that the texture was pretty dry. The service also left much to be desired, as they forgot to write "Happy Birthday."
