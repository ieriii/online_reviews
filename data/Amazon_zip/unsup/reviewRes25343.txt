Love this place. I've been going there for about 20 years and just love it. they ran a wonderful deal for dinners of $20.12 in January to celebrate the new year and we took our son for his 16th birthday. The staff was gracious and attentive to him but didn't treat him like a child. I will keep going as long as it is open.
