I'm not trying to be rude here...but scan the negative reviews here and look for two things: 1) slow service or 2) disappointment in price or portion size. Ignore any reviews containing either. Not only was the service respectful, quick, and everything I could have asked for (frequent without being pushy, personal and personable, etc) but this restaurant JUST opened a few weeks ago and they're still working out the kinks. Expecting them to work perfectly right out of the box is unreasonable and if you expect perfect service, wait a little while longer to let the gears get greasy, or show up a little earlier in the day when they are less busy. As for the price/portion size: you are not going to Denny's or IHOP here. You are going to a beautiful, friendly place that serves delicious local, organic foods. Yes, those foods are more expensive, but organic also means less chemicals that are unhealthy and bad for you, and local means you're supporting not only the environment but also your neighbors (albeit some of them a little far flung). And the portion sizes are perfectly reasonable: filling without feeling bloated and stuffed, delicious without being overly seasoned. I had a wonderful time at Nana and plan to make it something of a Sunday tradition from now on. I think the problem is that some people walk in expecting a "traditional" diner-style brunch. If you aren't concerned with organic or natural foods, this is probably not the best brunch place for you, but I agree with what some of the other reviewers have been saying: this is a great addition to Bridgeport, and I really want to see it succeed.
