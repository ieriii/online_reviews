This place is really cool. I love the speakeasy style, just wish it had more history to it other than "We modeled it after the prohibition era"... oh well. Went on a monday night at 11 and had no problem being seated. It was after I'd been to dinner elsewhere, so maybe that's the key - using this bar as a digestif? Although the food did look interesting... The drinks were amazing and the service was excellent. My friend couldn't decide so the waitress asked her several questions about her tastes and picked out a drink for her that she ended up absolutely loving. Not pretentious at all, but I wouldn't come here to meet people - definitely a bring your own friend/date sort of place. All in all a great place to impress a date or anyone who hasn't heard of it before.
