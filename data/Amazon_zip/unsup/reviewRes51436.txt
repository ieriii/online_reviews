I used to like this place - really I did. I went all the time for cheap tacos and mediocre drinks that really satisfied my margarita cravings, but tonight made me want to never go back. Ever. First, we were seated in the very very back - even though there were open tables that weren't in a cave. Great. The table was dirty when we got there and there were stacks of extra chairs around us and lots of rice on the floor. Okay, I can over look this - maybe - except the rice? Gross. I don't even want the bottoms of my shoes to touch that.  Next, our waitress was abhorrent. She didn't show up for ever, finally took our order (and don't worry, we ordered dinner and drinks at the same time, it is Wednesday night, yo.) and then didn't bring us our drinks until AFTER we had our food.  Our water was not readily replenished and when she asked if we wanted more salsa and I said "YES" she never brought us more.  I don't know about you, but I don't want to eat a dry taco without some salsa. The food was also less than good - my tacos were boring and dry. My bf's taco salad looked wretched, though I cannot comment on the taste. And, I SAW my margarita sitting at the bar for 10 minutes before it was brought to my table. So, when I got it, it was watery and terrible. 30 bucks for this totally crappy dinner and service. I don't think so. I will not be spending money there again. I'm totally disappointed and this is a place that I have been to at least a dozen times. Fail, Garcia's, total Fail.
