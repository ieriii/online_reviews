We decided to stop over one night in Chicago on our way from MI to CA. Didn't know anyone here... wandering around on a Sunday afternoon, hungry, and randomly stumbled into this place... what luck!! Delicious buffet, nice dining room, great service, and a decent price! In fact, while eating, we wondered how much our meal was going to cost, and it was a lot less than we had expected!
