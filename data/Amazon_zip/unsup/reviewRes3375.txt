AMAZING. Just came back from Crisp with my Korean roommate who wanted to go. I was blown away by the food! Both of us got the Original Bad Boy Buddha expecting it to be a decently sized bibimbop bowl... THE THING IS HUGE. Plenty of tasty vegetables and the egg was cooked perfectly. They only give you a small amount of gochujang (Korean pepper sauce), but you can ask for more. Two small containers was perfect for me. We also ordered a plate of 10 Seoul Sassy wings expecting them to be average size full wings... You pretty much get 10 drumsticks and 10 regular wings. They're fried crispy, but not too crispy, and the sauce was very savory and sweet. They really believe in big portions at Crisp, but I'm not complaining! =] Large selection of bottled and canned beverages was a plus. They also have MILKIS - a milky, carbonated, soda - similar to Sprite Remix with a hint of dairy. It sounds weird, but it's definitely my favorite Korean beverage - brings me back to my PC Bang gaming days of Starcraft and Counter Strike. The vibe of the restaurant was very casual with large picnic style tables (enough for a party of 8) and some stools w/ counters. It's an order & pick up joint so don't go in expecting full service. Strangely, I didn't see a single Korean employee working when I went. This is another case of a restaurant that I wish I had known about sooner, seeing as how I live (and lived last year) about 5-10 minutes on foot from it. Knowing they deliver could be very dangerous to my diet. Everything is fairly priced, and I will definitely visit again.
