I was looking forward to this for a long time and almost never does something so anticipated live up to expectations. This time , expectations were exceeded. It was like Cirque de Soleil on our plates. Plus almost everything was delectable. The staff were only slightly snooty. My recommendation: get the earliest reservation possible , or wear blinders or try to look down if other diners get their courses before you. The surprise of each dish is at least half the fun. It was the most we've ever spent for dinner by far ($775 including one wine pairing but I say it was worth it!)
