This place has a wide variety of vegetarian and vegan options, but based on my experience, felt very much like it was aimed at former meat-eaters given most of the menu items are imitations of dishes that would typically contain beef or chicken. It's pretty amazing what they can come up with, and I'd definitely suggest this to someone who's new to the vegetarian/vegan thing - especially to sate meat cravings. This well-known spot generally has a pretty long wait, so make sure you're not in a rush.
