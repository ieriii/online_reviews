Was taken here by friends for my birthday because they know I am a super carnivore! I have been wanting to go here for quite some time and was excited. Upon entering the joint we found the hostess on the phone. She then stayed on the phone for a couple of minutes, taking a reservation, without making eye contact. After a few minutes she looked up, motioned an index finger, and continued the call. After finishing the call she informed us that it would be a couple of minutes and asked us to wait in the sitting area. After a couple of minutes she sat us in an almost empty restaurant (?). After the rough start the evening turned around....the waitstaff was extremely friendly, professional, accommodating and attentive. The salad bar was exceptional!! The meat selection was abundant and delicious. I would return with no second thought!
