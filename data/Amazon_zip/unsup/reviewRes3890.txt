We have decided to stop coming to Crisp as often as we do. It has simply become too expensive to eat there. $10 for 6-piece chicken strips, and pretty measley strips at that? $10 really?? Crisp, you can do better. Your food is great, but the service and prices are outrageous. I should note that the owner did contact me about the service. It's good to see that someone cares about bettering their business. Still, by now, you can't honestly NOT have known that your employees give terrible service.
