OK W seriously...I had two trips back to back...Chicago then LA. I stayed at the W in chicago and then stayed at the Fairmont in LA.... I'm thinking about exclusively staying at W's I absolutely love the W Everything was great my friend got an upgrade in her room because it was her birthday...the food was amazing...they take the Whatever/Whenever seriously...sure it's pricey...but I'm going to argue at the W you really get what you paid for...
