I make a point of stopping by Hot Doug's every time I'm in Chicago. I've never had much of a wait here and I'm chalking that up to my townie friends knowing the best times to visit. Always a stellar culinary experience with exotic meats. There's been a lot of to-do about the duck fat fries; I tried them when a friend ordered some and would rather spend the money on another hot dog. Encased meats all the way! Bring on the alligator/antelope/boar!
