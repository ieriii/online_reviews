Violet hour has the best drinks I have ever had hands down. The Drinks: The drinks here are of the new mixology trend that is going on and I hope it is here to stay. The drinks are handmade and intricately crafted and tasted along the way by the bartender (request a seat at the bar if you can) so the drinks taste excellent every time. These are cocktails you won't be finding anywhere else. There are 4 or 5 cocktails types, separated by base liquor and an extensive collection of tequila and whiskey I haven't touched yet. I have had maybe 1/2 of the vodka or gin drinks and have liked all of them excepted for maybe one. The drinks might be $12 a piece but they pro bably have twice the alcohol of a $6 well drink at another bar so you're actually getting a great deal. The Atmosphere: The interior is a darkish blue atmosphere just nice and dark enough to create a good ambiance. The music selection is great enough to be in the background but you do not have to raise your voice to have a conversation. There are no cell phones and no baseball hats allowed so that also greatly helps out the atmosphere. The chairs are tall and comfy like something out of Alice in Wonderland. There are four bathrooms that are same sex so you have been warned ladies. The Getting In: So apparently the waits here can be bad. The first time I went it was during the week I think so we got in with no problem with seats at the bar. The last time we went we put our names on the list and they called us a little over an hour later to come get our seats. There are plenty of bars in the area so the wait wasn't bad at all. Look for the single yellow light above an unmarked door go through the curtains and you will be soon drinking the best cocktails you've ever had.
