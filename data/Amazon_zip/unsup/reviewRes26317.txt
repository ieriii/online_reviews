The location caught our attention (very close to the Chicago Auditorium) and the venue sealed the deal. Spanish tapas is a treat when it is done right -- and this is done right - for the most part. The gambas al ajillo - garlic shrimp was excellent. Sauce was bubbling on delivery and plenty of it soak up with the excellent bread that was served (ask for More bread - they accommodated us) The wine selection is good - but expect to pay over $60/bottle for something other than "cheap red wine" but maybe that is the wine snob in me talking. The beef short rib flatbread was disappointing in that it tasted like ordinary BBQ sauce - we were expecting something unusual. The shaved cauliflower salad was excellent - as were the bacon wrapped dates. The cheese was good - but they brought us the wrong selection -- we were trying to figure out how the walnuts turned to jelly - until wee realized we had jelly - no walnuts. We sat in the upper section which miffed us at first - no view - but the noise was less and we could talk easily. We made our show - but were hungary later that night - such is the nature of tapas. I'll go back for drinks at the bar to get the full atmosphere.
