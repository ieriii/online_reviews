My boyfriend heard raving reviews about this place, so we decided to check it out. The 2 stars that I gave clearly display my disappointment. I had the taste for chorizo and queso, so thats what I ordered. However, when the dish came out, it was a pool of grease covered with cheese with a small amount of chorizo sprinkled on top. Literally a pool of grease. Granted - chorizo is greasy. I know this. When Ive had queso y chorizo from other restaurants, they at least attempt to get rid of most of the grease. I couldnt even eat it. To top it all off, the waitress NEVER came to check on our table to give me any more water, so I was just sitting the with a grease-clot in my throat and no water to wash it down. They also were cash only which is a turn off. Makes me feel like maybe theyre not reporting all of their income. The place was packed! They make more than enough money to invest in a credit card service.
