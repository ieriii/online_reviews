I had lunch at Sunda yesterday with two co-workers and had a great experience. The ambiance is great, wonderful decor, cool long communal tables in the bar, a bit of outdoor seating, very nice appointments overall. Our food was delicious. Two of us opted for the "combo" which is either miso soup or salad, three pieces of spicy tuna or california roll, and then an entree. I had the very tasty pork & chicken adobo. A nice interpretation of a Filipino favorite. While an earlier review balked at the $7 soda, I would suggest the mango iced tea. You get a pitcher-like carafe of tea and a small glass of mango-infused sweet syrup to sweeten your tea. They had some interesting adult beverages on the menu so I think an evening visit is in store. Trendy place without being overly pretentious. Our waiter was very courteous without being cloying.
