I love this place but I was shocked when they asked me if I made a reservation the last few times I went A I walked right in B. They told me parties under 6 were first come first served. I waited 30 min and I would have waited longer, however they are also now having a corking fee... and are for whatever reason crazy busy so call ahead and enjoy I love it there but these changes are new so heads up and call ahead!
