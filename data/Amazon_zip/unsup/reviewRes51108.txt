This place is about 10 steps from my apartment. It's good, but not amaaaaaazing. I liked their french toast and veggie burger. Oh, and the first time we came here they put out hush puppies and rolls, but the next time we didn't get them, I was kind of upset. Either way, because it's so close we'll probably end up here a lot, but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
