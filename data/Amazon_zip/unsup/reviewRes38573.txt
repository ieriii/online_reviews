Hopleaf is our go-to place for a low-key drink and dinner.  We get annoyed sometimes because they don't take reservations and the wait is usually longer than what they estimate. However, the crazy catalogue of beers and their intimate, dark upstairs bar area makes the wait painless. I usually go for the CB & J and my husband gets the neusky (sp?) ham. Their mussels are really delicious and my favorite is dipping the bread to soak up all the buttery, wine, mussely goodness.
