It's almost too hard to write this review because there aren't enough positive words in the english language to describe my love for this restaurant. It is refined and playful at the same time. Each bite is designed so that you get the perfect flavor and textural experience. The restaurant is very open, reflecting the loftiness of it's surrounding neighborhood. Nothing really compares to Graham Elliot. Nothing.
