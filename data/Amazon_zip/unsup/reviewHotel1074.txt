Worst. Hotel. Experience. Ever. I've never written a review about a hotel (and this is the second ever 1-star review I've given) - that shows you how bad this experience must've been. I booked on kayak many weeks in advance. (I know booking through kayak doesn't result in quite the same service that booking through Fairmont and paying full price would have - however that is no excuse.) They: - double-booked our room - gave our non-smoking room to someone who came earlier in the day - only had one smoking room left in the entire hotel - would not give us any benefits in return (except breakfast - which we had already booked at a MUCH better place weeks in advance as well) - left stains, hairs, dead flies and dead mosquitos on our beds - AND the types of hairs that shall not be named in our tub - and then charged us an extra $70 (which they didn't tell us when we left, I had to find it on my credit card bill, and call them to have them remove the unwarranted charge) REVOLTING!!!! I could give many more details about how DISAPPOINTING and DISGUSTING we found the Fairmont Chicago - however intsead, I will simply advise you to CHOOSE SOMEPLACE ELSE!
