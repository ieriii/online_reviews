I haven't been to the restaurant yet (only had it delivered), but we've been very happy with the food.  One of the tell tale signs of a good Italian restaurant is their alfredo sauce. So many places have this thick, gloppy, flavorless sauce masquerading as alfredo. Calo, on the other hand, served us a lovely, buttery, cheesy sauce that was exactly what you want from alfredo. (FYI, alfredo sauce is so rich that I can only eat a bite or two of it, but tasting my brother-in-law's tempted me to order my own next time.) We've also been very happy with their linguini in clam sauce, the buccatini con pomodoro (really tasted fresh and light and delicious, though I'm sure it added about 3 inches to my waistline), and the pasta alla Milano.  My only negatives would be I think they're a bit pricey (maybe more worth it when dining in if the atmosphere is really nice), and the majority of the pastas had meat in them (though they may be available without meat). I really look forward to going here in person and having more to say.
