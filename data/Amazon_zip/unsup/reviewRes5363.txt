Although the weather was not very cooperative during our visit, the food and the service definitely compensated for it. At first, I was kind of thrown off when we had to wait outside for about an hour because they don't take reservations. It was also kinda lame that they had more outdoor seating than indoor since Chicago doesn't really have the best weather. The food, however, was flawless. We ordered the fried pig ears with the crispy kale and egg, the roasted bone marrow, roasted corn, the roasted pork blade steak with 'Nduja and honey and for dessert we had the fried brioche with ricotta cheese and chocolate inside. For all of that, I thought we were going to rack up maybe a little around 100 bucks, but nope. When the check came, it came up to about 75 bucks and that's with two glasses of beer too. So to sum it up, not only it has great food and service, it's also not that expensive. And as an added bonus, it is a fun place to go people watching as well.
