This place has awesome food! It's by far my favorite Chinese restaurant. However, it's a little bit pricey and now they've started charging $1 extra per person for rice. They don't ask if you want it either--they just give it to you and then it shows up on your bill.  The staff is either really nice and helpful or fairly rude depending on the day and who's working. However, their food just can't be beat and they have an amazing selection!
