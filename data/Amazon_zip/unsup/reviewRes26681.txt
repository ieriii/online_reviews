I went here yesterday and I LOVED the pizza!!!! Whats not to love from their thin pizza! I had pepperoni and mushroom! WOw oh man was this thing good. It had the pizza covered in Pepperoni! I was born and raised here in Chicago and have had my share of pie's. This is in my top 5. Service was good and everyone was nice. There was a old guy with beard and long hair. He was thanking everyone as they left the door. nice guy. Hasta pronto!
