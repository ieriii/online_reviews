I love meat; steak, bacon, hot dogs, and everything in-between! The Chicago Diner has none of that. Yet it is one of the best restaurants that Chicago has to offer. As the name implies it is a diner that offers great diner fare in vegetarian and vegan forms. Now if you enjoy meat as much as I do do not fret. The dishes are presented in a form that you will recognize. One fabulous example is their Rueben sandwich, it looks and tastes like it's corn beef equivalent. Every meal I have had has been very similar. The only word that comes to mind is "Yummy!" But, if you really are still feeling a bit uneasy in trying this place do not write it off just yet. They serve eggs and dairy, so you can still have a connection to your carnivorous tendencies. Oh, and before I forget, they have a good selection of local beers and wine which they happily offer pairing suggestions. The atmosphere is fun, laid back and easy going. The staff is friendly and attentive. Having been dragged to a variety of vegetarian restaurants by vegetarian friends and family I can tell you that I have experienced quite the number of restaurants which are not only unfriendly to the typical omnivore but some are downright hostile. The Chicago Diner is the antithesis of these stereotypical vegetarian food eateries. It is welcoming and friendly. The Chicago Diner, is a great introductory place to bring your carnivorously shy friends to expose them to the wonderful world of vegetarianism. Thanks Chicago Diner!
