Sushi Sunda is a GORGEOUS restaurant! The atmosphere is nice. The hostess did not offer a wait time she said we could sit at the bar or the group tables because we did not have a reservation on a week night. The food was great and very fresh. We had a the ridculous dessert which is a carrot cake to die for! We drank some nice cocktails. It was pretty pricey but I would say not bad for every once and a while. Great lounge area! Great place to meet for drinks!
