First time at Grand Lux Cafe was during a recent trip to Chicago. My friend and I went on a Friday early evening and did not wait that long for a table. Grand Lux is a lot like Cheesecake Factory; they're practically the same restaurant. We ordered edamame as a starter. I like how they marinated in soy sauce and other spices to add to the flavor. I was disappointed in my sandwich. I ordered a chipotle grilled chicken sandwich, and it came with ingredients not listed on the menu, such as corn and avocado, which I normally do not eat. From my understanding, the "chipotle" part referred to the type of mayo they would use on the sandwich. Our waiter (John K) did offer to rectify the situation, however, and was extremely nice, easygoing and attentive (would give 5 stars for service). If you go here, you must try the beignets! Apparently these are a signature item of Grand Lux, and they recommend ordering early in your meal, as they take a half an hour to prepare. The beignets came HOT, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. One thing that was off-putting for me was when we were ready to be seated, the waitstaff told us to go upstairs around some corner, down the hall, etc etc. We, along with some other patrons, we're a bit confused, as when we got upstairs, there was no one there to greet us. They should move the host/hostess upstairs to better guide you. I'd go here again and perhaps would give it more stars the second time around.
