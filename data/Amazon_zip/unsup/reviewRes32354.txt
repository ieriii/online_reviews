Get thee to Demera and get thee quick. I tried Ethiopian coffee for the first time last week (amazing) and decided to give the national cuisine a try too. Food is delicious, nutritious, vegetarian friendly and gluten-free. What more could a city girl ask for? They have lunch specials Mon-Fri - $7.95 sampler platter. There's really no excuse not to give it a try. Oh, and try the beer. Smooth and slightly sweet, just like the coffee.
