I have to say the experience has been different both times I have gone. The first time was with a large group of friends. got to sample a bit of everything as the portions were HUGE! Second time was with just 1 other friend and the waiter helped in the ordering and we both found it a little disappointing. But I know there is great food here! I cannot wait to go back and get the Duck Service between a few friends! I have heard great things about it and have enjoyed the duck both times I have had it!
