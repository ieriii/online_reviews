Went here last weekend. I had high expectations given the reviews on this site and from other people. Boy was I disappointed. The drinks were good and so was the service. But the food was BLAND. The only good piece of meat was the fillet. Their signature meat (I can't remember the name) was bland as well, juicy yes, but not much flavor. I also heard good things about their supposed grand salad bar; but when I saw it, I was like "this is it?" It wasn't that grand or spectacular. Something you would see in any buffet joint. The best part was probably the BREAD. It's a nice buttery, cheesy small piece of heaven! More than likely I will not return. Chicago has plenty of other old school steakhouses that I would rather go to. Key word here for Fogo is BLAND.
