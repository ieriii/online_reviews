HEAVEN! What an amazing experience After trying for weeks to make reservations, I miraculously got same day reservations (and major brownie points from my husband). I don't want to say too much to ensure the surprise factor for future diners, but the food was EXCELLENT, service was great (the chefs serve you - so they really know about the dish), and the atmosphere is anything but stuffy. They welcoming you into the kitchen anytime - and it's pretty much unavoidable since you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom (and after 2+ bottles of wine, you will make at least one trip back there). They even invited us back into the kitchen to take Jamison shots with them. They ended up serving us around 12 courses - all delicious. Not only was the presentation there, but the taste was as well. And it's SUPER reasonably priced considering you are eating the food prepared by a world-renowned chef. My husband was completely enamored with this place (which is rare for him)- as was I. If you get the chance to go here, GO! It's worth it!
