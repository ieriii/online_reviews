I had the vegetarian caldo (Spanish for soup) it was awesome. Great if your feeling a little under the weather. You may order any of the caldos as mild, medium or hot. I have to mention their wonderful drinks. I love to get the Santa Julia, which is a very good red wine. The refreshing fruit/ tea drinks are all very tasty. Many love the hot chocolate drinks. I feel that trying any of the mentioned beverages will not leave you disappointed. But most of all, and what keeps me coming back, I really love their philosophy and you may read all about it while you are waiting to order; "investing in our community, our staff, our customers, and the local family farmers who grow for us and living in balance with our environment and the seasons." Whenever a restaurant is educated I don't mind spending my time and money at their establishment. Not only is the food great but they care about the planet.
