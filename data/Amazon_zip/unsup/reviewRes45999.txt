The Grand Lux Cafe is what you'd expect- almost identical to The Cheesecake Factory. Same ginormous menu with equally ginormous portion sizes, same decor, same touristy customers. I've come here on Girl's Movie night simply because of its proximity to the theater at 600 N. Michigan. Don't get me wrong, I like Grand Lux , especially the appetizers- it is just a LOT of food and you can tell that it's a chain restaurant so don't expect gourmet, and def don't expect healthy either. When I leave I feel large and in charge and usually have to unbutton my pants a little.  Last time I went with 2 other girls, we ordered 6 appetizers off the menu thinking that there would be 4 or 5 potato spring rolls instead of like 8-10. We had to have 3 waiters carry all our stuff out to our table which was slightly embarrassing. Next time we definitely will not be getting so much food.
