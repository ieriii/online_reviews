Went on Saturday morning around 10. Too late for breakfast and too early for lunch (starts at 11). So we ordered some hot chocolate, churros, and breakfast empanadas to pass the time until lunch was ready. The variety of hot chocolates was impressive and the egg empanada was great. Churros were a decent deal (3 for $3). Sandwiches are a bit pricey ($9-12) but portions are large. Only got to try one soup because the other soups aren't served until 3 pm. That one soup was awesome though. Luckily our wait to order was less than 10 minutes and we were able to score seating pretty easily. I could see people getting annoyed with wait times. Excited to bring family/friends to try it out
