Lalibela is better, so you're better off going there instead. Here's 5 reasons why: 1. The service was so-oo slow and somewhat absent. 2. When the food finally came, it was lukewarm. 3. They gave us a beef dish when we ordered lamb. Perhaps they thought we wouldn't be able to tell the difference...? 4. What's up with the Western-style salad drenched in Italian dressing? That doesn't seem authentic. 5. Dirty bathroom, dirty floor.
