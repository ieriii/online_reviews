This place is delicious. I really can't say enough good things about it. Its always packed which is a great sign and service is fast. This is the place I go whenever I want a great bowl of pho. Even though I haven't ventured into trying many of the more exotic meats in the pho, those that I have are delicious. The broth is wonderful and complex. However, its not too complex that it would not appeal to the average american. Also, be sure to try their spring rolls. I can never remember what they are called but they are fried with the thin spring roll papers and made with pork. Trust me on this one. Delicious!
