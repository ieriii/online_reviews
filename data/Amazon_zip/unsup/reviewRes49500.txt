It is true, the mojitos and the Entrana are fantastic. Also, our server, Ricardo, was on top of it all, informative and not intrusive. I got the Entrana and calamari combo and was blown away at the portion size and great flavor. The boy got another steak which was good but not as wonderful as mine. We got there after 8pm on a Friday night and the wait was maybe 10 minutes. The bill for 2 mojitos, 2 glasses wine, appetizer, 2 entrees was about $80 and very much worth it.
