We rolled into this gorgeous resto already excited at the Blackhawks' first victory. What a place to celebrate!! This resto is as stunning (black communal tables a la Asia de Cuba in NYC span this resto; and their sushi bar is hands-down one of the nicest I've seen!) as the food is good! We started with their brussel spout salad (WOW!) and the meal stayed consistently excellent throughout (with the exception of the tuna wasabi sashimi, which was just so-so)! I highly recommend (most of) their specialty sashimi; tuna atop toasted shrimp-flavored rice; and their miso-glazed cauliflower. Service was also quick and helpful, which was a plus considering how packed this place was. At about $125 for both of us (including 1 drink a piece and tip), this place is not cheap..... but if you want a place to dress up and start your night out on the right foot, you can't go wrong at Sunda.
