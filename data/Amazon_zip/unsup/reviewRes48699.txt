I really like this place. It's a fun place to go, especially if you have a large group. I wouldn't recommend it if you're on a date (too loud). I've been here several times already and have no complaints about the food. I gave this restaurant 4 stars only because the service can be a bit iffy at times when the restaurant is packed. The food is very good. I especially like the mussels, pork rinds, charcuterie plate, and the potee. My only wish is that they expand their dessert menu. They have an excellent beer menu! A bit pricey but worth it for a night out. I would especially like to thank the hostess (manager?) with the long dark hair. Very kind and accommodating!
