I've been going here for years and was one of their big fans, but recently bought a deal from Reader's Real Deal that said it could be used at any of the three locations, yet my Deal voucher only had the original address (1132 N. Ashland) printed on it. I figure, that's cool, that's the one I like anyway! Went in two nights ago to get some steak tacos, and as soon as the guy sees my voucher, he tells me that they don't accept them, I need to go across the street to use it. I show him the address printed right on the voucher, he says, "Too bad, not here." So I cross the street and the guy across the street says, "You can't use that here, go a few doors down to the other location." So we had to walk down the street to the sit-down location, and I really wanted to go the original location, it feels like you're in Mexico. Oh, well, we get 4 small steak tacos to go with barely any steak on them for $13 and change. I remember the good old days...
