I came in with a large party of almost 16 people for a birthday dinner. We were there about 10 mintues before our 7:30 reservations and were seated right away, but after being seated we played the waiting game. Waiting for menus...waiting for our bottles to be uncorked...waiting for bread...waiting for our orders to be taken....waiting, waiting, waiting. It took almost an hour before we recieved our entrees.  Now granted, we had a large party so no one minded the wait. Besides, we were busy drinking wine, chatting, and enjoying ourselves. What bothered me is that they rushed us out after our meal was finished. They told a member of our party three times that we needed to leave because they had made a 9pm reservation for another large party and it was now 9:30. Well, sorry Caro Mio. Perhaps you shouldn't give only an hour and a half for a 16 person party to eat dinner. Perhaps you shouldn't have taken so long in the beginning and we would have already been gone.  The food? Eh. I ordered the spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce. It was ok. Nothing spectacular. The lasagna was good and so was my friend's sausage and meatballs, but the service was so horrible that the food and everything about Caro Mio just left a bad taste in my mouth.
