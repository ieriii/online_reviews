Authentic Italian deli, formerly of the more working class Blue Island neighborhood. High quality domestic and imported Italian staples at reasonable prices. Carried out two sandwiches from their daily lunch specials menu. This menu updates weekly and is posted online, check before going if you're one of those be prepared types. "Chicken Fontina" - Crispy chicken on a gourmet wheat bun w/sliced fontina, deli mustard, lettuce, & tomatoes w/fries. A little heavy on the poupon but tasted great. "The Fresh Tomato Panini" - Fresh mozzarella on a 6" pretzel roll w/tomato vineger, red roasted peppers, & fresh basil w/a .33 bag of chips. Loved it. This one was just a little heavier on the balsamic than I care for but it was a fantastic sandwich. Nice families were eating in at the spacious, clean dining area. Enjoyed some great samples of pasta made with Italian sausage, pesto and artichoke, and some locally-made gelato. Friendly service all around. Keep up the good work guys.
