tried dining in the restaurant rather than getn it delivered, and god bless them they are so nice in there but they did not understand a word of the orders we made, we ordered fried rice and 2 diet cokes and mango beef. she arrived with 2 ice teas and satay shrimp. lolwatever this place is great but maybe since the delivery is so good ill stick to that
