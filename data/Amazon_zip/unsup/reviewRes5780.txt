My husband and I went here with a gift card we received through 'lettuce entertain you'. Our waiter Eric was amazing! He had a great personality and was unlike most 'forced happy waiters'. He was genuinely happy and it reflected in his service. We got the calamari as and appetizer and it was a great sized portion which was unexpected but exciting! It was delicious. For our meals we chose to do the filet medallions in mushroom, Parmesan, and potato sauce topping with au gratin potatoes (delicious!!). We also got coconut shrimp with a twice baked potato. We shared the items so that we could get a better idea of what we liked since this was our first visit. All items were delicious. We will definitely get the medallions again! As for the shrimp, the sauce is what makes it so we may try something new. For dessert we shared the larger portion of key lime pie. It's not huge but it is super rich so sharing it was great! We also decided to try the martini flight. They are smaller sized glasses but we were looking more to taste test to find one we liked. Cosmopolitan and green apple were average and normal. The stormy night and raspberry samples however were our favorites! Also make a reservation because it gets packed fast!!
