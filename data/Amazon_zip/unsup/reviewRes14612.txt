Definitely will be back to Revolution Brewing Co. soon! Went there last night for dinner with friends and it was great. We were seated right away and got right down to it. I ordered the Bottom Up Wit and it was delicious. So delicious in fact that I ordered another one. My husband tried the Gold and the Workingwoman's Brown which were both very good. We ordered the Bacon Fat Popcorn that everyone is raving about and the opinion at our table was that this was something to try, but we won't be ordering it again. It was OK.  I ordered the Forest Burger which was done just right and took that baby down. Some fries remained on the plate just because I was stuffed!  Our server was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.  Overall it was a very good experience and we are already looking forward to going again.
