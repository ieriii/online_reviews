Oh my dear Ceiling Cat ... this place is amazing. My wife and I went here for the first time on our anniversary, and Indie didn't disappoint. We ordered crab rangoons as an appetizer; upon their arrival, we noted that they were small ... but *wow* were they delicious -- much better than any other we've had elsewhere. The maki sushi we split was quite good, and furthermore made me happy to know I have a trustworthy place to order sushi from in the future. My entree was the basil chicken ... which -- NOM NOM NOM -- promptly disappeared. ^_^ The service was good, and the ambiance cute -- the art adorning the walls is eye-catching, and the lighting is a just-right shade of twilight. We'll certainly be back; I've already stopped by once just to get the crab rangoons for take-out, and they were just as good as the first time. I don't know if I've lived in Chicago long enough to finger any particular restaurant as my overall favorite, but Indie would be on my shortlist. (Afterword: It's now late 2011, and I've since moved back to New York state. I can easily say that I miss Indie more than any other restaurant in the entire Chicago area, and it's tied with the Free State Brewing Company of Lawrence, Kansas as my favorite restaurant *anywhere*.)
