A higher quality of pizza than most pizza joints in Chicago. The other dishes they offer are good too. The fried shrimp is great, and the burgers are pretty good too. If you are a meat-lover, order the Art's Meaty Delight, delicious! Great place to order from when every other delivery place starts tasting the same.
