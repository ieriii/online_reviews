nothing beats listening to jazz at 2:30am sipping a fine beverage at a candle lit table. the ambiance and the history of the place make you feel like you've traveled back in time. personally i think it'd be a great date spot. plus you can hop down to Gigio's after your done and grab a slice of amazing pizza.  gotta love uptown.
