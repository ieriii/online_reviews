My girlfriend and I stayed at the Whitehall Hotel for our Spring Break trip to Chicago (4 nights, 5 days). We'd checked out a BUNCH of hotels on Expedia and Yelped a bunch as well, and we settled at the Whitehall. We also got a great deal on our hotel + flight combo through Expedia, and we're glad we booked here. The hotel is in an EXCELLENT location in Chicago. It's in the downtown area, and MINUTES away from any and all transportation you'd need to get where you've gotta be. It's a block away from the major buses you'd need, and only 3 blocks away from the L line. The decor of the place is nice -- it's a good mix of old-fashioned ideas with a modern touch. The people who work the desks are extremely helpful, and knew we were out of towners -- gave us some recommendations immediately for places to eat and even drew out how to get there...always a plus. The room itself: completely and absolutely perfect for what we needed it for. We weren't here to soak in bed all day, we were gonna be out exploring what Chicago had to offer. So the Whitehall delivered -- a BEAUTIFUL room (HUGE bed), with a nice bathroom and desk to plan things out. It was cleaned the same time each day, and the staff left it looking terrific. If we ordered anything to the room (such as towels, extra toothpaste, etc), they brought it up within 2-3 minutes, which is also a plus. The negatives: the real estate isn't great. Rooms are a bit on the smaller size, but again, it had everything we wanted and it had it done well. The other odd thing was the curtains...they weren't able to be closed. They were in a fixed open position, but luckily, there was a FIRST LAYER of blind to close the window off but allow SOME light in. Just an odd sort of characteristic. Overall, the Whitehall, for it's location and price, really can't be beat in my mind. Although it's got it's odd shortcomings, so does every hotel, and my girlfriend and i had an EXTREMELY pleasant stay here.
