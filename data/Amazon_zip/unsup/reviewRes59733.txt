so ill keep this short and sweet hopefully, well my fiance and i were on our way to the cubs game, and since we didnt wanna spend a ton of money at the game we figured we would eat before the game!so i just spotted this pizza joint out the corner of my eye and i could smell the deliciousness that awaited us. so the place is cool, the cashier was super friendly the slices were like $3.43 u can get it thin crust, pan style or stuffed, so that's 3 great selections all for the same price.so we both got a pepperoni thin crust and the slice was huge i finished that slice before she could even pull out the parking lot lolthe pizza was great , i love the seasonings they used, not the doughy taste or too much sauce it was made just right and fresh, just like chicago pizza should taste!5 stars guys!!!!!!!!
