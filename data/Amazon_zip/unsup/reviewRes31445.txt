I'm a huge fan of Mastro's steakhouse. I have been twice in the past month and both times the food is always spot on mostly. The petite filet was great, the chefs cut strip is amazing as the lobster tails; mac and cheese thumbs up. A few in my party had the giant tomahawk wagyu steaks and raved about them. The seafood towers could use some work. The deserts are just so so except the butter cake. so good...
