Delicious! Came here on a trip back to Chicago; I begged my friend to go there since I have a "thing" for Rick Bayless and was desperate to try the food. After watching all his TV specials and Top Chef, I had high expectations for the food at Frontera, and I was not disappointed. We knew going in, since it was a Saturday night, that we'd have to wait...So we decided to make the most of it and have a couple of drinks at the bar. The atmosphere is fun and energetic, and I came very close to stealing everything off the plates as the servers walked past... If you just accept that you're going have to wait, then your life will be easier. The hosts know what they're doing; they were spot on with their quote as to how long it would be until a table was ready.  Once seated my friend and I split the taquitos (best I have EVER had), and I ordered the pork entree. It was served with the best mashed potatoes I have ever had in my life...full of cheesy goodness. Top it all off with the pecan pie and a cup of coffee, and you're in business!  A wonderful meal at a wonderful place. Kudos to Rick and all of his team for this magnificent establishment. I hope to return the next time I'm back in Chicago!
