Love this place! I return again and again for delicious and interesting yet unpretentious food. The service is consistently friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is great. A little pricey, but altogether worth it for the experience. It's great for dates and out-of-town visitors. Lobster-filled tater tots? I think yes. Go on a Monday night if you are on a budget! You might have to wait a while to get a table if you don't have a reservation, but they will take you phone number and call you when your table is ready if you want to walk around the square or grab a margarita in El Cid's outdoor patio next door.
