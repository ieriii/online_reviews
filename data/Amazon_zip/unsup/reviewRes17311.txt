This is my new favorite lounge- DELICIOUS drinks, yummy food, good service, nice cozy atmosphere with the perfect jazz and Sinatra music. Between the 2 of us we had four of their signature cocktails - each one better than the last, the green bean appetizer and the sammy sandwiches. It was the perfect amount of food for a light dinner. That being said- this would not be a good place to 1) meet people, since you sit in your own isolated table 2) go with a group of more than 4 people since the tables are very small or 3) go with people who eat a lot of food because the tables are small and the food options are limited. Also get there relatively early- there was no line when we arrived at 7- but a long one when we left at 9.
