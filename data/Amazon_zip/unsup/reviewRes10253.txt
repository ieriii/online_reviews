Came here for lunch earlier this week.  Atmosphere - best part about the restaurant! Beautiful patio makes outdoor dining possible in the middle of Chicago. Appetizer - My companion and I shared a prosciutto as an appetizer. It was enormous! Sonia C. would be pleased with the value of this meal. Entrees - My companion got the sea bass, and I got the black spaghetti. The sea bass had a little too much butter for my taste. The black spaghetti was very flavorful with the pasta cooked at just the right level of al dente.
