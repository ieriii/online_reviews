Two friends stumbling along Chicago trying to shop and we suddenly got hungry and just wanted to sit...we saw this place and figured 'nice, French food, let's get some bread and wine.' so to see all Vietnamese food on the menu was relatively shocking. We had scored a great table on the patio so we decided to stick it out and are so glad we did!!! The food was really, really good! I had the spring rolls and the barbeque pork and my friend had the ravioli and...I forget...but we both kept talking about how delicious the food was. The service was fabulous and we had an amazing summer lunch on the patio at this very unexpected place. Loved it.
