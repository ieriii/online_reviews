Yum, yum gimme some. The food and beer selections are outstanding. But, it is not easy to get in so plan accordingly. I went on a Sunday around 3 and we missed the wait list by one table. The service is good. Try the popcorn with bacon and parm along with the wings with blue cheese potato salad. Lots of Veggie Friendly items as well. Beware, it's hipster central. :)
