This was a great hotel. They let me check in at 6am and they even upgraded my room. I stayed here for 4 days and I got cookies every morning and they have all the amenities you need. It is close to public transit and is nearby shops, restaurants and everything else in downtown. They have a nice somewhat-rooftop deck with a pool (massive spiders on the rails on the steps up) I would of given them a few stars off for the spiders but the hospitality here was next to none. I will stay here again! BTW parking is $33 a day
