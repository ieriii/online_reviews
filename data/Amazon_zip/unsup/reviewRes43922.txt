now, i want to make a disclaimer that 3 stars is not a bad thing. The only reason it gets this is that it does nothing really to distinguish itself from any other steak house in the city. the wine list is good, the apps were good, the service was above average, and the steaks were cooked right. i was there for our companies holiday party earlier this month and had a good time. I just dont get overly gushy when it comes to the standard of steakhouses. maybe im just used to great steaks when going out in this city and this just blended in with the rest. would i go again, probably not because been there done that and there are alot of other places i want to try. would i ever tell someone not to go. NO. they should go and have a good dinner because that is what they will get
