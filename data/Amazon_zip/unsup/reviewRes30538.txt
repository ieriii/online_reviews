Mastros always delivers, and this Chicago location is no exception. The bar area is dark and provides a great atmosphere, especially if you are on a date. If you are traveling on business and dining alone, the bar staff is super helpful and full menu is available. You will often hear, if you have had one Filet Mignon or NY Strip, you have had them all. This is often true, but Mastros is the exception. The flavor of their steaks is second to none. The wine list along with appetizers and sides are top notch. The only thing I dont like about Mastros, and specifically this Chicago location is the live music in the bar. Its often too loud and its usually a cheesy cover band or something similar. It doesnt fit the mood, just hire a chill jazz band or forget the live music all together. I highly recommend this location though, you will not be disappointed.
