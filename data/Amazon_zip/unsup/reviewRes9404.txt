Perfection. I could end the review there but that would make me a pretty lousy "Yelper"... This really was one of the best meals I've had in Chicago. My husband brought a group of clients (and his lucky wife) on a Thursday night, which was really nice as It wasn't too crowded. The decor has a nice lofty feel to it, with large windows at the front, and soft lighting throughout.  We chose the fixed price menu with the wine/champagne pairings for each course. I started with Licorice, which was a light crisp salad with pear, goat cheese, and a hint of licorice shavings. For the second course, I had the Wild Striped Bass with chunks of strawberry and beets. Incredible. Finally, I chose the Corn dessert as I wanted to try something other than some type of chocolate. It was warm, slightly sweet, and creamy (w/ a hint of salt). All three course were amazing! In between the second & third course they brought out a mini grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions that was insanely delicious (surprise surprise).   I wish I could have remembered each wine pairing they had with each course, but I will tell you that EVERYONE at the table thought they were perfect. I haven't tried the brunch that everyone else on here raves about, but I can tell you the dinner is unreal. It's great for entertaining clients, a date night, or for a special occasion. I will be returning for my birthday!
