Went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers and came away just a bit unimpressed, but far from hating it. It's a well-decorated, tasteful and relaxing space, but that is the best of it. I found the food to be a bit lacking- although it was not bad it was consistently bland and unremarkable. The service was average for the price point.  The menu sounds intriguiing in print, but the food just didn't quite live up to the expectations established by the menu. For example the chicken and pork adobo was rather dry, and worse, it had no heat to it whatsoever. A dish with chilies as a featured ingredient should have a little more heat to it. Similarly, several rolls that included spicy ingredients also had little to no heat and came off as bland and lacking any character. This included a couple of table-shared specialty rolls that seemed a touch overpriced at 15-16 dollars each for eight small to medium sized pieces. This was followed by the set lunch for $18 that included a salad or soup, an entree and 3 pieces of spicy tuna or California roll. The fish in the rolls did seem quite fresh, and the salad, while simple, was nicely done.  All in all, the set lunch was a fair deal with appropriate portions for the money and I might go back and see if anything else on the menu lives up to expectations, but I wouldn't be in a rush to do so.
