Wow - great breakfast! I had the orange brioche French toast, my husband had the huevos rancheros. Their french toast is outstanding, right down to the low-viscosity, pure maple syrup. I tried my husband's huevos - really excellent. They serve them in a souffle dish, a mix of black beans, onions, peppers, scrambled eggs and cheese. I think there might be some tortilla in there, too. The wait was about 15 minutes when we went (on Sunday morning), but I like the efficient way they deal with the long lines: you wait in line to order at the counter, and while you're waiting, you get a number. After you order, you collect your silverware and napkins, and you are seated at the first available table. By the time you're seated, it's almost time for your food, so even though you wait a bit (and really, it's so busy, how could you expect anything else?), it doesn't feel like that long a wait.
