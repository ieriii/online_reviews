Meh... Unfortunately, I didn't like the food at Mayan Palace. The enchiladas were very dry. I think the corn tortilla on the enchiladas might have been dried out. The tostada was OK. The beans just lacked flavor and the shell was semi-soggy when served. The service was fine. The waiter started out kind of grumpy, but was pretty good once we ordered.
