So I was pumped when I got a coupon for this place (Groupon, Living Social...one of those!). I had been meaning to try it ever since the President declared it his favorite Italian spot in the city! So a friend and I headed on over to see what the fuss was about. I am a sucker for Gnocchi, so that's what I got. Hmmm...where was the flavor? It definitely was lacking, not very hot and was a disappointment. My friend got the Pennette Cardinale and that was delicious! I wish I would have gotten that! The bread they serve is pretty good, but the olive oil was nothing worth noting. We made reservations and I am glad we did because this place gets crowded. And this place is VERY small so be prepared to wait outside for a table. You can't even wait at the bar because it's so small. Tables are right next to each other so you'll be hearing the other tables conversation. I feel sorry for the waitstaff working here. They must trip over everyone all night long. Overall we had a nice dinner, but for such rave reviews, I guess I expected more. At least next time I'll know what to order!
