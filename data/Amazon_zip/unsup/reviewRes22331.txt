My gosh was this place good, When myself and a group of friends decided to head into Chinatown for a nice dinner i was not sure how good it would be, then as he headed a few blocks away from the main Chinatown gate , i worried a little bit more. And once more when walking through the doors to an unassuming restaurant brightly lit, but not one to be the Debbie Downer of the group i decided to give it a chance, and boy was i glad i did. upon sitting down in a large table  in the corner we where handed what can only be described as a large book of approx 20 30 pages of menu items written in small type (so don't forget your reading glasses). While we all took are time reading page after page we enjoyed a bottle of saki ( kinda of a yummy Surprise,i had never had it before) We started our meal with some Spring rolls and Crab Rangoon(damn good) and a plate of spicy cabbage (and i do mean spicy, but so good) next was a hard decision what to get for the main course and while i could have been a bit more daring i went with a shrimp lo mein.. So good, and even now i type with one hand and wipe the drool with the other. i think they only mistake i made was not asking advice From my server. but i will know for next time, cause even though I'm not a local i will be back for more
