This is a great restaurant to go to for That food and it is in a great location. My husband and I have gone here a few times for Thai food and there are times where right across the street there are festivals going on. It is also super convenient because it is right by both a train stop and a bus stop. Their pad thai is one of the best I have ever had. I am super happy with the food and the service. Would recommend.
