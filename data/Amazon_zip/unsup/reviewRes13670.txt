All experiences to Glenn's have been really good. Pretty sure we heard about it from the Eater 38 list. The quality of the seafood and preparation of dishes are great. Sort of "dinery" feel inside, but the dinner time menu is definitely not. It is always sad, though, when you've picked that perfect dish off the wall (yes, the menu is on either side of the restaurant, written in chalk! pretty sweet) only to find out supplies have ran out. Service has always been fine and thankfully we've been able to get a table without waiting more than 20 minutes, except for one time. Parking kind of stinks, but there are meters across the street if you get lucky. Have never been to the "all you can eat shrimp" night or breakfast, but plan on doing so soon!
