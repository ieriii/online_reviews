It might be silly, but my favorite item was a side... After telling my companion what I wanted him to order (so...I'll be getting the short rib goulash and you'll be getting the sausage stuffed chicken thigh.... this generally works well with us, thus making him an ideal dinning friend!) my friend secretly and then openly opted for the veal paprikash! The short ribs, the veal and our starter of smoked salmon were all tasty, but his side of gorgonzola polenta had me chronically stealing from his plate.
