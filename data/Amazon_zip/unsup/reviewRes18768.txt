I've been here twice now, two weekends in a row.  I'm giving this 3.5 stars but can't give it four. The burgers are fun and inventive but the read better than they taste. They just aren't that fantastic. Today I tried the Black and Blue but it doesn't hold a candle to Moodys. Last week I shared the Hangover with the wife, and as much as I love a burger with a fried egg on it, the same burger at Hot Chocolate or Kumas had far more flavor. I do love the beer list, though I wish more of the beers were on tap and fewer were in bottles, but even so there really isn't anything to complain about in regards to the beer list. So it gives it a good effort but doesn't quite satisfy. One thing I'm learning is that a list of fantastic toppings looks impressive and gets the mouth watering, but doesn't compensate for a mediocre patty.
