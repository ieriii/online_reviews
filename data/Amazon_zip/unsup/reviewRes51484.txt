Even after the remodel I still love this place! The people are great and the atmosphere has always been welcoming! This is the kind of restaurant I could go to with a group of friends and have a great time well into the night. Now, here is the meat of this review: The best carne asada and horchata I've ever had. I know, I know... I'm definitely going to get a lot of feedback from those two statements, but to my taste buds, this place is epic. Did I mention that they have amazing margaritas? No? Well, this place has AMAZING margaritas!! =D Every time I am back in Chicago you can expect me to enjoy at least one meal here!
