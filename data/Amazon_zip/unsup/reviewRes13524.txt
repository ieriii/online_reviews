If you don't' give this place 5 stars you must not know what you are talking about. Revolution is the BEST place to get a burger. I've eaten a lot of burgers and this is it. The beer is fantastic, every other meal I've had is also fantastic. There's a lively atmosphere any day, any time. The only draw back is it's too busy on the hot nights to go out. Does that make for a lesser star review? No. Because they have the BEST burgers.
