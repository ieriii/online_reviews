Went here for the 1st time. My hubbie is a major Mexican food lover and we travel EVERYwhere to get some good Mexican food. He rates this as a 4.5 if that was an option. WE went with a friend that lives nearby who frequents Garcia's.  Lets begin....we were promptly seated.  Drinks. They have Horchata and its good!  Chips & Salsa.  Salsa was fresh and tasty. Perfect spiciness for our taste. The chips could have been fresher but were good.  Guacamole. Seasoned well and creamy. Very nice. The small was enough for the 3 of us.  Chicken and Shrimp Fajita. SOOOO good. Perfectly seasoned, the hubbs just finished the left overs. Large portions. Very nice. I would have liked to have seen black beans instead of the refried beans.   Taco Dinner.  The other 2 had the 3 taco (combo of ground beef & Steak) dinner. He liked the option to have the 2 taco dinner just in case he felt like it. Liked the steak more than the beef and its packed full of meat. Enough so you have extra to dip in your chips after! Next time he plans on having extra cheese b/c they have nice cheese.  We find that some of the best places have food that tastes good the next day and we are currently eating them and my fajitas are still SO yummyt! So we definitely recommend this place!
