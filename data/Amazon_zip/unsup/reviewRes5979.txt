Last night was a night of self indulgence and gluttony at Davanti Enoteca. I suggest everyone do the same. The sea urchin and crab linguine was the best thing I have ever tasted and probably will ever taste. It is all downhill from here, folks, but at least now I can die a happy woman. This delicious seafood dish has a hint of hot-and-spicy quality that I totally dug, and you will too. I promise. One of the best things about Davanti Enoteca? They price their bottles of wine at retail price, meaning that bottle of wine you'd buy at the liquor store next door is the same price as you're paying for it at the restaurant. As for our experience? We ordered everything we could possibly maybe want to eat and filled ourselves to the brim with 2 bottles of wine and 6 shared plates (for two of us). Our bill was only $120... the wine probably made up for about half of the bill... I am already planning my return trip.
