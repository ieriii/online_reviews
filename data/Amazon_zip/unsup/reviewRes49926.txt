This place cracks me up. It is full of sexy ladies from the burbs and the girls who work here are always wearing little sexy get ups. I have been here a couple times when out of towners and suburbanites want to meet up and always enjoy the ride. The layout is actually pretty good. They have a lot of outdoor seating, and have two floors of tables. It really has a nightclub feel to it. We went upstairs to join a work party of a friend and sat with a group of guys with shiny watches, open dress shirts, and girls with tans and augmentations in the places where you might expect. It was not my scene and there was a lot of cheap domestic beer being guzzled, but the service was good and the employees were nice but this place can be too busy. We had our drinks and joined the party. A guy sat next to my GF and said "I hear you are an artist? I love the art baby," then he looked at me and said "I am only kidding bro" ... well, he was fun. I asked him what kind of art he enjoyed and he said "You, know, all kinds" and I said, yeah, "all kinds are good." Funny. I am happy that this place is full of people who are sexier than me, have tans, and super mani-pedis. We all need a place to go, so I am all for Fifty/50 since many of those suburban girls who are having ladies nights at this place are sexy (I won't lie, the tanning bed girls are cute!). I won't come here much although a friend of mine says the food is amazing and it probably is (she likes bacon), but I am glad it is here since it provides a counter-narrative to the too-cool-for-school hipster scene. Girls in Bebe t-shirts, big mirrored glasses, and way-too-high-heels provide an almost in LA sex appeal sitting with guys with product in their hair, big muscles, who say things like "I love the art baby!" Celebrate diversity. You go, Fifty/50!
