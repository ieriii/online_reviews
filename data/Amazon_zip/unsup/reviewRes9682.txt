Okay, we had a wonderful time, nice service, pleasant atmosphere, my wife is wonderful company and gorgeous and I love to look at her and talk to her and it was a great evening. However, the big trick on this menu is to use tons of sugar. Great. It's a flavor enhancer. But by the end of the evening my tongue was sick, sick, sick of sweet. The parsnips (with the impressive venison) might as well have been cool whip, I couldn't finish them if you paid me they were so cloying. By the time we got to dessert I was DONE, I couldn't eat another bite of sweet. And my dessert was (theoretically) based on bacon! Full disclosure, I don't love sweet, even for dessert. So this isn't a fair review. But if you're like me and would rather have fat and salt on the tongue than sugar, be warned. Even the cocktails were overly sweetened.
