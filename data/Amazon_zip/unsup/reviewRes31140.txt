Great service and steaks! I loved when this location was Blue Water Grill so was sad to see that it didn't succeed. Blue Water Grill was pricey and expect Mastro's to be the same if not more expensive. The steaks are amazing and a great selection of cocktails and sides. It's a carnivore's feast but there's other options if you're not in the mood for red meat. It's a great place to entertain with friends or have a date night.
