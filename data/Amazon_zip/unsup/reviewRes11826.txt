I went here for a party, in which we had the nice party space in front, and the pizza was delicious. They had several varieties; my favorites being the pepperoni and margherita. It lost one star because it was sooo crowded, although it was a weekend day. On another note, they also brew their own beers with many different ones to try out. Great place for a group night out.
