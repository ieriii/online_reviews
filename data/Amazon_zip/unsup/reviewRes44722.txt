Travesty of a place. We arrived early on a Friday, like senior citizen early. Two of the three of us were there, and said we were waiting on a third. The place was empty, so we assumed there would be no problem getting a table when our third arrived. And as they said nothing at all about it, we had no reason to believe that the hostesses thought otherwise. So, our third ran late. We were to meet at 4, and 20 minutes go by when we hear the hostess tell someone that there was a 45 minute wait. Thinking that couldn't be right, we walked up to ask, and we were told that yes, there was a 45 minute wait because a large party was coming in. When we asked if we'd only have 25 minutes because we arrived 20 minutes ago, they said that no, it was a 45 minute wait. When we asked why they didn't say there would be a wait when we arrived, they had no answer. We asked why they didn't advise us to put our names on the list, knowing there was a long wait and that we were expecting a third, and they had no answer. The manager then tried to blame us, even though he had no idea about the facts of the situation. We walked out. We've eaten there once before, the pizza is shitty deep dish nonsense, and if you're not a tourist there's no reason to go here. Amateur hour. Avoid.
