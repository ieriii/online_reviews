Maybe this place is good. They had lots of beers on draft, so that's something... BUT i ordered some fancy meatballs and they weren't so much fancy as they were few, small, and overpriced. These "kobe" meatballs, were nothing special, certainly not made of kobe beef, the beef that is legendary in the hills of japan because the heffers are fed beer and given massages... oh no, this wasn't that kind of beef. These meatballs were a disappointment. There were only three served for the appetizer, and each was about the size of a marble. EXCUSE ME!!!!! Is there a ground beef shortage!!!! That was probably $0.05 cents of beef! I paid $15. WHAT THE HECK GUYS come on!
