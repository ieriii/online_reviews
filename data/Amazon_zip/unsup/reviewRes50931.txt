I am a big fan of coming here for brunch. Usually not a very long wait, I take my out of town friends here because they are not used to having to wait significant time for seats. The have good bloody marys that you can drink while waiting and excellent cheese grits. I'm drooling thinking about them. Their dinner is pretty good too.
