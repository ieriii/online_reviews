Greasy, tons of toppings... hot heaping mounds of delicious-ness. This is what Chicago-style pizza is supposed to be. It seems a bit expensive ($20s for a pie) but if you can finish more than 2 slices of a large you're more of a man than I am. I highly recommend pep/mush combination... they cover the pizza with so many toppings you almost forget there's 5 pounds of cheese underneath. Delivery has always been quick and friendly. Pizza always shows up hot. Cool point - reheats VERY well in the oven. Which is good, because my 2 roommates and I were never able to finish a large.
