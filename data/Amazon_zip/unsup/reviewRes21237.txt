Holy moly, strawberry malt was a showstopper. I would elaborate on the rest of my meal, but I can't. All I can and will think about for the rest of my life is, "when can I come back to Chicago for that freaking life-changing strawberry malt?" Hot dog? Oh yeah, it was aight. Pineapple soda, meh. Fries, crunchy. If you come to this place, honestly, you may as well get the life-changing malt. Cash only. The only thing missing is waiters delivering food on roller skates.
