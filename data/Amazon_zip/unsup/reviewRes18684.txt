i can honestly say im a regular here food & beer selection is great ! the staff is nice and friendly and are more than happy to take care of you if you get lost in the beer list ask one of the lovely bartenders what they recommend 75% of new ipa's i've tried is all due to their help lol ive never had a problem finding a seat at the bar or table and i usually go on a week night or weekend. 30$ will leave you full and bubbly don't skimp out on the tip either these are genuinely nice people who serve you
