I went there with my wife today. we rarely get out because of four kids. anyways our food hadn't shown after what felt like 25 minutes. i asked the waitress where our food was and she replied "this isn't fast food." Then she went to check and found out we were waiting for over half an hour. When our food did come, it was cold and not cooked through. I left a 15% tip. That is small for me. I will not go there again.
