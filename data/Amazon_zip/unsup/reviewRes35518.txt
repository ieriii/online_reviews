I was unable to get in - Closed due to Failed health inspections. Really, why would anyone ever go back here. Places like this don't deserve second or third chances especially if they are repeat violators. Why do we accept such low standards when it comes to Chinese food?? It doesn't need to be dirty and have bad service to be good! lol I love Chinese food but If I keep hearing about places like this, It will be a long time before I go again.
