Very, very good Mexican, Tex-Mex! Went here on Friday night at about 7 pm. This place was packed.  The set-up is kind of odd for the table wait. A line just forms through the front dining room in between tables. So if you're so lucky to have one of those tables, you'll have a constant line of people hovering over you pigging out on your food. And the line does not stop! The line was constant 20 deep through the front door. The good thing about the line is that it goes pretty quick. We waited for about 15 minutes. When we were seated, they give you chips and two salsas. A red salsa and a verde salsa. The verde salsa was smokey and definitely better than the fresh red salsa. They was give you a bowl of picked vegetables that had a real spicy bite. All the entrees are cheap! Most things are in the $6-12 range for a ton of food! My wife had the tamales which she loved. I had the Fajitas Nortenas which were thick cuts of skirt steaks. This dish was huge. I made 3 fajitas and had enough to make 3 more that I brought home. I must also say that refried beans was so good. I usually don't like refried beans, but these were the right texture and creaminess. Paying for your tab is also kind of odd. There is a cash register at the back of the room by the kitchen where you bring your check and pay. I think the waitresses can actually take your payment also, but that probably would take some time. The service was fine, but our waitress didn't come around too often and left us sitting for awhile before we were able to get our check. All in all, this is great, cheap place for Mex food. We will definitely be back!
