As a vegetarian, I was not blown away by Alinea. There are so may interesting directions for vegetarian food, and I feel that they didn't capitalize on any of them. Instead, I received the same thing as everyone else, just with some vegetable or mushroom substituted for the meat in each dish. A decided lack of creativity there, something for which the establishment is supposedly known. In particular, the offals dish for the meat eaters: I received just mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, etc. as substitutes, whereas the chef could have gone all-out with strange and crazy vegetarian equivalents to offals (e.g. fermented, molded, tofu?). But it seemed the look, not the concept, of the dish is what they replicated. Also, the wines were a bit too sweet for my liking. In general they seemed to pick underdog varieties, and it was fun to hear why they were actually better than everyone thought they should be. Despite my negative comments, everything was very tasty and it was an interesting and fun dinner. I'm glad I experienced it.
