I didn't know what to expect and so it easily exceeded my expectations. The food was delicious. We did the Premium tasting menu and the only course that was less than great was the lobster preparation. Everything else was incredible. The service was spot on. This was our first visit and will definitely not be the last. It's a little noisy in the dining room but not so noisy that it becomes uncomfortable. I forgot to try the Sangria which is supposed to be the best around so I have a great excuse to do this again. That, and I know my foodie daughter and her husband will go mental here. The sooner the better... Thank you Mercat a la Planxa...loved it.
