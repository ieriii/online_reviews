Oy! Again with not being able to give half star ratings but alas... I was in Chicago visiting a few friends. As we were planning on what to do during our first night in town "Violet Hour" seemed like a big win amongst my Chicago friends. They told us it was a speakeasy and very hip. Also mention of some good music. Hey, you had me at speakeasy. After dinner we make our way down some street and all I see is a white wall of sorts. One can barely see the door handle! Ok, when someone says "speakeasy" I am thinking "password". A bit disappointed that it wasn't one of those places but it was still hidden so still a win. But then we had to wait in line for half an hour. And the hostess was a bit "meh". My mental Yelp rating was going down a few star notches! Things that upped my sentiment? The decor - I absolutely loved the high chairs. I have recently been on a Tudors kick so seeing high-royal-esque chairs were a plus. Baby blue velvet if i remember correctly. Great ambiance with the lighting. Kind of reminded me of Velvet Margarita in my hometown (Hollywood). We had to sit with strangers which was fine by me because they sat us with a dope couple. Drinks were a bit overpriced (thanks to my friend for fronting the bill). One thing everyone MUST try is their "punch". We weren't sure what would be in it but we ordered 2 bowls. WOW! This stuff could rip asphalt off the pavement! We shared some with the couple we sat with. I had to order a sprite to "water" my drink down since it was beginning to burn my throat! Great drink but man was it strong! I wish we tried their tapas. Will have to do it next time I am in town...
