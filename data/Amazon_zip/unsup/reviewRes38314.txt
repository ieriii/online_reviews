Since my husband and I are big fans of Belgian ales, Hopleaf was the perfect bar for us. We went in on a Friday night and had to wait about 30 minutes for table. But this was not a problem since there was a small bar upstairs that was not crowded where we could drink. I had a sandwich and pommes frites which were good and definitely better than "typical" bar food. Also the bartender and wait staff were incredibly friendly.
