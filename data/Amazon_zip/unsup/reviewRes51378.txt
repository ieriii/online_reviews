-Fresh Salsa! -Tasty Burritos! -Great Margaritas! But the real reason I come here... ....THEY HAVE THE BEST HORCHATA.....EVER! I like to order their large Horchata "to-go"(even if I'm dining in), with no ice. Why waste space with ice cubes when it can be filled with the BEST HORCHATA ON EARTH?!  I think one day i'll come here with an empty gallon jug and just ask them to fill it up...seriously. I am Phil "the Mouth" J, and I endorse this message.
