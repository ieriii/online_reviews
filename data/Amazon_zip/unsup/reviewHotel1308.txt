Can you really go wrong with the Ritz? We stayed here for a little "getaway" one weekend. Everyone always knows your name, which I am still not sure how they pull that off. Service....impeccable, food the same, and drinks were great too. You really do get what you pay for. The room was a little "dated" in my opinion, but still had the comfy bed, fridge, and great bathroom. I can't say enough about the gym, I wish my condo had a gym like that. Headphones a plenty and great machines, and they actually had free weights over 25 pounds! Oh, and I also saw Juwan Howard pull up in his blue Ferrari, he looked a little tight in there, but it was still a sweet ride
