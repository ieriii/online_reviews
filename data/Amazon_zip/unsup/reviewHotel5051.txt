I'm comparing this hotel to the Embassy Suites Chicago Lakefront at 511 North Columbus, Chicago, IL, the Embassy Suites at Washington Square in Beaverton, OR, and my prior experiences with Hilton resort properties.I stayed there with my wife and our 2 y.o. infant for 3 nights in October 2010.The Good: The staff was very, very friendly and helpful. I had to take a breakfast tray back to my room while managing an infant, and a staffperson offered to help me without me having to ask her.The location is also very convenient as it's located in the heart of the River North district. A Jewel/Osco is across the street.The Bad:The rooms are outdated. The walls are thin. The bathroom smelled funny. The carpet was musky. The sleeper sofa was outdated. And the curtains don't blocked out enough light.The breakfast buffet was very poor. The scrambled eggs were rubbery (even when they served a new batch.) The fresh cantaloupe and honeydew tasted stale. The omelets used frozen spinach and not fresh. They did not rotate their offerings.Summary:I will never stay here again. It was not worth the money to me to stay in a sub-par room and be served a sub-par breakfast. In the future, I will either spend the same money on a better room and buy breakfast separately.
