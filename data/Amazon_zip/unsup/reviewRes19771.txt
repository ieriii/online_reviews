OH BOY, man is that sandwich that is served in hot soup HOTTTT but it hurts so good that i couldn't but eating more. and, guess what, even though the wait to get in is painful (esp on a hot summer day with a 10 year old cousin), the pork is so tender and delicious you can't avoid it. All worth it. They are considerate of the fact that it takes forever to get in; they will serve you water IN LINE. this food left me with just shivers. the cocoa drinks were perfect. i don't know WHY my mother ordered a salad here (i mean, come on, it's bayless), but she noted that the salad could use a bit more flavor or dressing. I had bites of the woodland mushroom, the seafood sandwich, and of course my pork sandwich in the hot soup. Don't forget the churros!
