The pizza is very good. The beer is pretty good. The lack of any waiting area and obvious ignorance of fire codes that results in butts on your table...not good. I'm sure I would have enjoyed my experience a lot more if there wasn't someone flicking their hair over the table. I'll try it again on someday though, as soon as I figure out what day everyone else won't be there.
