I went to Schwa on 7/13 as a late father's day gift from my wife. She had gone there before and really wanted to take me. The restaurant itself is a small store front with no frills. You walk in and are met by the kitchen staff. No waitress or hostess, just you, your wine and the chefs. You can bring some wine or beer for the kitchen staff as well. We had the nine course dinner and it was pricey. What you get is a dining experience that really focuses on the food. We started with a clarified bloody mary that looked like water. Suprising flavor that woke up my pallet. The dishes are very unique and memorable. If you're a fan of big portion dishes do not go here. The dishes are small but retain a lot of flavor. You get a detailed explanation from the chef who serves you. My favorite was quail egg raviolo, the halibut, and the chef's spin on a s'more. We were served braised ox-tail in a rich mole made with chocolate, topped with a foam that tased like marshmallow and served in a dish that had enclosed smoke. So when you took a bite you got the flavor of chocolate and meat, marshmallow, and the smell of smoke. Very good.  If you're not picky as to what you eat (they served us a variety of items from octopus to sweetbread), enjoy a laid back setting with a wide range of music and enjoy truly inventive and really wonderful food then try it.
