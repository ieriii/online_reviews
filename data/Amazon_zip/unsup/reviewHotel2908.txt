This is the worst Sheraton I've ever stayed at. The staff were horribly rude. I did not feel welcome when I checked in. They don't give upgrades to Gold Starwood members like the other Sheratons - you have to be Platinum. And you have to pay for anything other than the room (i.e. internet, gym, local calls). They charged me for things in the minibar and I didn't eat any of that expensive crap! The housekeeping staff was extremely slow. It took until about 5pm for them to come to clean the room. And get this - they didn't extend the wedding rate for the parents of the bride so that they could stay there an extra night! I will NEVER stay at this hotel ever again unless I can get a room for less than $70.
