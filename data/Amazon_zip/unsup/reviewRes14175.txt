This place is great for several reasons... 1. The staff likes each other, they love the customers, and they are excited to work there and to share their food with you! I have been offered free tastes of their cuban coffee when I go early in the morning. 2. Their food is freakin delicious!!!!!! The fish is amazing - falls right off the bone - so good. Their entrees - try any of them. Even their shakes are really good. Very very delicious. 3. They have a great back room thats heated all year round with free wi-fi. Plus is BYOB. No alcohol on the menu so if you want some, bring it yourself. Also BRING THEM YOUR OWN RUM AND THEY WILL MAKE YOU FANTASTIC MOJITOS! The ONLY reason this place does not get 5 stars from me is because its insanely loud - I mean outrageously loud. I don't know what it is, but I can never hear the ppl at my table. Its a terrible place to take someone if you want to talk at all over dinner. You'll be SHOUTING.
