i really like milk and honey. Their food is wholesome and good. If it wasn't so busy I would go much more often.  I'm surprised to hear about people getting bad service. I think that a lot of people walk in with "restaurant service" on the brain. But Milk and Honey is a counter service establishment so I do not expect a bunch of people fawning all over me and kissing my ass (i mean...it would be a nice touch...but that's a whole other subject) its a dog friendly place and they always have lots and lots of umbrellas. I've never waited more than 15 min for an outside table so I'm pretty happy with that. Although I like to go when it isn't as busy. granola, huevos rancheros, and the iced tea or coffee are must haves!
