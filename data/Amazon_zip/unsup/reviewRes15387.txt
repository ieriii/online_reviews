Went in on a Friday night around 8pm - no wait for the backless chairs by the fireplace. The drinks were SO good. Service was a little slow, but very friendly. The waitress answered our questions and gave good explanations for unfamiliar ingredients. I ordered the Juliet and Romeo and the Pim's cup variation #5. My friends both ordered the latter once they tasted it - not too sweet but easy to drink and interesting. I personally enjoyed the Juliet and Romeo the best - tastes like summer! Will be back, but probably before the rush because I don't want to wait on the loooong line I saw when I was leaving on Friday.
