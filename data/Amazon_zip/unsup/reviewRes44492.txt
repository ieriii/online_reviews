There are so many reviews on Alliance bakery....their following is huge. Plus, something about knowing that this bakery has been open forever gives it brownie points (pun intended!).... I'm not gonna lie, I came in here for a cupcake because cupcakes are like my crack, and Yelp is my like my dealer, letting me know where I can find them. Everyone raved about the cupcakes here so I had to give them a shot. And well, they're okay. I didn't care for the chocolate cupcake I ate but we also got a turtle brownie that was a-mazing!!! And dog bone desserts for only $0.35? My dog thanks you, Alliance. I don't think the cupcakes were anything special (and I think all cupcakes, like children, are special) yet I would return for their other desserts, and because the cakes in the display window are just too cool.
