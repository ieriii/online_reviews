Great dinner, fantastic brunch here! I've yet to try the fried chicken & waffle (which looks seriously killer) but so far so good. Though the dinner fare has a lot to check out, make sure to make time for a brunch here. Beignets! YES! I think we ordered 75% of the menu for 4 of us last time we were here. At least it felt like it after plate upon plate of yummy things came and left. Aside from the perfect beignets, the charcuterie plate was on point. Good pate, excellent tasso and terrine. The corncakes are a nice break from the ordinary, combining the savory flavors of corn and black bean with the presentation of pancakes. Yum. Crab cake bennies were great, the delicate hashbrowns even better. French toast is to delight in. Amazingly huge, but a much lighter flavor and weight on the palette than expected! Def a good spot if you want to do a blow out brunch. With all that we ordered, cocktails and endless beignets we were still under $40 per person. If you ordered with your brain not your stomach you'd barely even notice the price. Great place in Andersonville for sure.
