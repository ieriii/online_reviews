The pizza at Piece is awesome... I'm excited to go back and try more toppings. Hopefully, this winter with a great group of friends. I went with my parents, and we ordered one white, one red, and one plain, and for some reason, didn't put any additional toppings on, so, they were a bit plain. That being said, the crust and sauces were delicious, very fresh tasting. I had one of their house brewed beers - which I would not do again. I have an allergy to something that ends up in a lot of microbrews (not sure what that *something* is, I just know it's bad.) I ended up with a horrific migraine that put the kabbosh on the rest of my night, but I don't blame Piece for that. I just know to stick to the bottled stuff from now on.
