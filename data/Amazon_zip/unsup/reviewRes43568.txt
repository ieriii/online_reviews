This is the best pizza in all of Chicago or possibly the world. I recommend it to many friends and coworkers and they are immediately converted to "the Art" as we lovingly call it. The crust is perfectly crisp yeet tender and the sauce is sweet and flavorful with just enough spice. For me, the sauce is what makes the pizza. I am a big fan of the spinach mushroom stuffed. By the way you can trust my opinion, I am a native Chicagoan and part Italian. I know pizza.
