Out-freakin-standing. Love the sandwiches with a little side of white beans in oil and the pastas are all pretty good. Prices are low low low. They have a few choices of beer if you are so inclined. You can sit at the counter and watch them cook or try for a spot in the window where people walking by can watch you eat.
