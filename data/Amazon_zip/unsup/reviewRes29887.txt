I love this place. And not because its steps from my apartment - which I must admit make it wonderfully convenient on those foggy-headed Sunday mornings - but because it's everything brunch should be. Delicious, cozy, friendly and laid back. No crowds packed with perfectly put together people that scoff at my baseball cap and comfy pants - aka pajama pants. No snooty servers and overpriced, mediocre concoctions. And definitely no ridiculously long waits. I've never waited more than 15 minutes on a Sunday morning, thanks to the "blink and you'll miss it" location. The steamed oatmeal with bananas and brown sugar will leave you all warm and fuzzy inside. And the French toast stuffed with bananas, candied walnuts and brie .....well, do I really have to say much more? Bonus: this place has a great wine selection, full bar, and live music on Saturday nights.
