Within a couple of hours of writing my original review, I was contacted by the owner. He was extremely kind in offering his apologies for my experience on my birthday and offered me a chance to try it again. My bf and I went on Friday night and were not disappointed. Yes, it's crowded, but for good reason - the pizza is really good!! We ordered 2 smalls - one bbq chicken and one pepperoni - both were delicious, and huge for a small! We had leftovers and finished them for lunch the next day.  So, here are my take-aways from my experience: (1) If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. E.g., if the person on the phone tells you the wait will be 45 minutes for a decent sized group, it's probably not. (2) Come early, before you are starving, so if there is a wait you won't be that upset.  (3) Have a back-up plan. Stuff happens.
