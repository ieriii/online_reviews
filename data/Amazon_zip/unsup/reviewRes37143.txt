I must say that I am a beer snob. If you are like me then you will absolutely love this place. They have an amazing selection of Belgian beers and just about any other micro brew you could possibly dream of. Not only that, they have great food too. There mussels for two is the perfect amount to spit with a friend or date! Their duck sandwich is also fabulous. I love sitting outside on there small patio but if it's packed the bustling inside atmosphere is fun too! Everyone is friendly because of the shared appreciation for beer so mingling anywhere is fun! I must make a recommendation of visiting sooner than later in two different ways. One, that you need to go here if you have never been. Two, that it gets really busy right after work so the sooner you can show up for happy hour the more likely you will find a seat. This pertains to all nights of the week... Monday through Friday. Drink classy my friends!
