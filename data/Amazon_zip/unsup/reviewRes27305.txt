A MUST if you're in Chicago. We got lucky and were able to make Friday reservations the night before and it was the only one available for the weekend. I came here with 2 other friends and decided to do family style since all of us were new to Chicago.  Tried: Trio, Trio, Trio: Sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco & Coctail de Atun Tropical. Ceviche Fronterizo is Lime-marinated Hawaiian albacore with tomatoes, olives, cilantro, green chile; on crispy tostaditas. Ceviche Yucateco is Steamed Mexican blue shrimp & calamari, lime, orange, habanero, avocado, jcama & cilantro. Crispy tortilla chips. Coctel de Atun Tropical is Sashimi-grade Hawaiian yellowfin tuna, avocado-tomatillo guacamole, tangy mango-grapefruit salsa. All three had different flavors. What's great about the trio option is the variety. If you're a fan of ceviche, this is a must get. Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena: Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak (marinated in spicy red chile & wood-grilled), black beans, sweet plantains with sour cream, guacamole. This was my favorite dish ordered. The steak was actually cooked medium rare. The steak kept the juiciness and made perfect tacos. Enchiladas de Mole Poblano: Homemade tortillas rolled around Gunthorp free-range chicken, doused with Mexicos most famous mole. Black beans. I'm already a fan of enchiladas and this dish really hit the spot. The mole sauce added a hint of sweetness and the dish was very well cooked. Costillas Ahumadas (Friday special): Applewood-smoked Gunthorp pork spare ribs, ancho barbeque sauce. Three Sisters Garden grits with Otter Creek cheddar. I wish I came with a bigger appetite because this place was one of the best mexican resturants i've been to. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in town.
