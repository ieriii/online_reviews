My girlfriend suggested that we should check the place out due to some rumored to be amazing lunch specials. So despite it being dinner time, we headed out for it. In general you can tell that youre in for a good meal when the place is packed at 9pm on a holiday weekend when half the city is seemingly out of town. We ordered the chicken puff to start, and got a delicious wonton of chicken and veggies with a killer sauce of 1/2 chili and 1/2 plumb (kept separate but in 1 small sauce cup). My girlfriend and I both ordered Clay Pot dishes, I went with chicken and she went with catfish. Both dishes were cooked in clay pots with onions, red pepper, ginger and a caramel sauce. Absolutely delicious. Add in the fried banana dessert and a more than affordable price and you have a winner. Highly recommended.
