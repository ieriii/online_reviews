Very disappointing visit to this restaurant. Ten minutes after being seated, someone finally stopped by for drink orders and we asked to place our order. Upon ordering their Boarding House Lunch, we were told they were out of fried chicken. We heard an excuse about it being featured somewhere and demand was high. They serve this lunch from 11-3 everyday, and it was 12:30!! And the place wasn't even FULL! We decided to try and find something else on the menu. Well, another ten minutes passed without so much as a glance our way. So we left, very unsatisfied. I hope they start ordering more chicken in to cover maybe two hours worth of patrons.
