I took my friends here who were visiting out of town. We got extremely lost but the helpful hostess set us back on course.  I think we ate everything. Definitely get the pork rinds, oysters, pork belly. Let them suggest a beer for you. After eating I didn't think this was possible, but I think we were all drunk on pork? I was in a euphoric state all the way back to my apartment where we promptly all crashed on the floor.
