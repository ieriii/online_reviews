I have been here a couple of times, and I keep wanting to go back! If you like weekend brunch, then Yolk is a definite must try. They have a VERY extensive menu. I am not kidding. You could go back every week for months and try something different every time. Eggs, pancakes, crepes, skillets, so much variety you might find yourself overwhelmed. Sort of reminds me of the Pancake House (my favorite!) but cleaned up and without the grit and more expensive. Some ADVICE: be prepared to wait! It gets very crowded very fast, even for a place with such a vast interior. I have never waited less than 40 minutes, the last time being on a Sunday afternoon at 11:00. Also, the parking around the area is difficult as it is Michigan Ave. But if you circle the block over to Wabash where you can frequently find street parking with pay meters and also some small pay lots. As for the food: delicious! I love French toast. It is my favorite brunch item. But most places you go for brunch don't give you the option to get French toast with eggs and meat. You always find pancake combos, i.e. a short stack with 2 eggs on the side with either bacon or sausage. One of the things thats great about Yolk are all the options!!!! And they do indeed have a French toast combo with 2 eggs your style with both bacon AND sausage! That is hard to beat if you love thick, slices of mouth watering toast fried in batter, dusted with powdered sugared, and then lathered with butter and syrup. mmmmm.... But most of the other options are terrific as well. I recommend the crepes, particularly the apple ones, and also the skillets. And you definitely cannot go wrong with the pancakes.
