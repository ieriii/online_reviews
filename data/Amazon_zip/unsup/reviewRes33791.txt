I'd never had middle eastern food before, so I honestly did not know how to order when I got here. I ordered the chicken schwerma which was really good, but a little too spicy for my boring tastes. My roomie got the falafel sandwich which was awesome. I have no idea what falafel is, but it might be my new favorite thing. We also got hummus and a side of pita bread to take home. Next time I go, I'm going to try the salad bar. The only downside of this place is that it takes cash only, but there's an atm on site. The best part about this place is that it is super cheap, two sandwiches and hummus were both under $20 and they deliver!! Yay for trying new things!!
