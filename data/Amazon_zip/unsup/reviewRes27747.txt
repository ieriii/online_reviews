Tasty deep dish pizza. Haven't tried Burt's yet so I can't compare the two, but all of us enjoyed Pequod's very much. Lou Malnati's was my friends' previous favorite deep dish, but all of them stated Pequod's is their new #1. The crust on the bottom is crisp, almost crunchy. Highly recommend getting your pizza topped with sausage. Large pieces, nicely browned on the surface, not overwhelmed with fennel seeds. Favorite part of Pequod's deep dish is the bit of cheese baked on the crust. Some people have suggested ordering their deep dish with extra sauce and extra cheese, but I thought our pizza had a good ratio of cheese, sauce, and toppings. Five of us easily demolished a large sausage, mushroom, and onion deep dish ($23.50). Skip the garlic cheese bread appetizer, and eat more pizza. I didn't have the religious experience with Pequod's that others have proclaimed, but I thought their deep dish was fantastic and certainly plan on returning.
