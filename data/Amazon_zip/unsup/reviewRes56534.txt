I've eaten at Frontera a dozen times.Likes: The Topolo margarita. It is very good, one of my favorites. A bit on the small side for $10 bucks, but it has a great flavor.The chips and dips. Good flavor on both sauces and thick chips. $4 charge once again is a bit steep, especially when other places include them in your meal at no charge.Dislikes:The food always sounds great, the descriptions of the ingredients and plate presentations are very good. The issue I have is the food never tastes as good as it sounds or looks. Don't get me wrong, it has complex flavors and seems to be made with fresh ingredients, but all the dishes seem to lack salt (I am not a salt lover, but you need a touch to bring out flavors) and other times the sauces don't complement the protein ( a dark mole type sauce does not go with fish, even in Mexico, dark moles come from the intrior of Mexico...not much seafood there).I keep going back because I don't care for greasy tex-mex and Frontera is definately several steps above that.
