I loved this restaurant. You walk in and are just in awe of the space. The huge windows, the wall decorations, the music in the background, the great service. Mercat definitely has it down, it was a great experience. There were four of us and we just kept the tapas coming. We started off with a pitcher of Sangria. It was pretty good, just staple Sangria if you ask me, but we werent here for the drinks. We had about 10 tapas and each was just as good as the last. I think my favorites were the spicy potatoes, garlic shrimp, bacon wrapped dates and the cheese with the caramel bacon dipping sauce. The standout to me was the dessert. We ordered the chocolate empenadas with the banana marshmallow on top and OMG I am still dreaming about that dessert. This dessert was by far the best dessert I have ever had.  Each of the dishes had such a great flavor profile. We were never sitting and waiting for food. We always had at least 2 of our tapas on the table at all times. The service was great. My only gripe was a cappuccino was $5, coffee was $4 and the espresso was $4.50. Everything else seemed to be a great price point, until we came to the after dinner drinks. $4 for a coffee? Seems to be a bit of a rip off to me. I would definitely come back, the food was absolutely amazing, but next time I would not order a coffee or espresso ;)
