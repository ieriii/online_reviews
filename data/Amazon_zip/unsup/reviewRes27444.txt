I love you, Graham Elliot! Everything from the music playing in the background (think postal service, death cab, and passion pit) to the juxtaposition of fine dining in a completely casual atmosphere, made this not only one of my top dining experiences, but also a place I would suggest to just about any foodie looking for a good time. We had the tasting menu, which I would recommend to anyone coming here for the first time. My favorite item was the pea soup with mint marshmallow (sounds weird, but sooo delicious). A very close second was the wagyu beef with sunchoke and pecorino. The drinks were also very tasty. We tried the Man-jito and the Smoke Monster (the latter definitely put a few hairs on MY chest....) All in all, this is one of my absolute favorite spots in Chicago. Highly recommended!!
