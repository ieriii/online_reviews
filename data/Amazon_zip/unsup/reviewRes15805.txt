I ate here a couple of weeks ago and genuinely enjoyed it. It's taken far too long for me to end up here, but last Sunday, after craving Italian, we broke and headed over and dined. I had ricotta gnocchi and it had a unique flavor and just a little bit of zing. I was definitely into it.  The wife and I split desert, which was this apple crisp with ice cream dish. Great stuff. We're planning on trying their pizza at some point too.
