Pizza. - Check. Beer. - Check. What else do you need really? Quality? A sassy yet endearing staff? Selection? Check, check, check. I've been here once and my only visit was a treat. We went on a Saturday night and it was quite busy but we were still easily able to snag a couple beers from the counter and enjoy them during our "20 minute wait" turned into a 10 minute wait. (I suppose I owe a thank you some guy named jerry and his party of 6 for splitting) Honestly I only tried one of their house beers and it was of course the Cameltoe. Not of course because I am some sort of deviant but because I love love love hoppy beers. Our waitress was a self proclaimed hop head and recommended it and also touted its high ABV. (9. something IIRC) This beer was quite good. Not the best IIPA I've had but quite good none the less. Other than that I was drinking Firestone Walker Double Jack since that beer is amazing and they also had it one tap. For food we got crazy. Much to the shock and dismay of our waitress we order a pizza with the following: BBQ sauce, Clams, Spinach No typos there, yes that was the pizza we ordered. Our waitress warned us that typically folks get the white sauce with clams and what not. We however bravely stuck to our guns and pressed on with our endeavor. And guess what? It paid of big time. So awesome. It may have been the high alcohol beer we were partaking in beforehand but this was seriously one of the best pizza's I've had ever. So good in fact that if I go back thats what I'll get again. The server took my victory dance like a good sport and claimed to be happy to have been wrong. Piece was awesome and I will definitely go again.
