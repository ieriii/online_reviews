I heard great things about this place, and I was won over by the amount of vegetarian options, especially that they had vegetarian Ash-e-reshteh (Persian vegetable/noodle soup), which is one of my favorites, and it's hard to find a meatless version in restaurants. I liked that the menu was full of traditional Persian dishes, not just Middle Eastern dishes with a splash of pomegranate sauce - a lot of diners associate Persian cuisine with the Middle East, when really it has a lot more in common with northern Indian/Pakastani cuisine. We started with the ash-e-reshteh, which was seemed light but was a surprisingly filling soup. We also ordered the kashke badimijan (roasted eggplant), dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves), and shirin polo (rice with pistachios, raisins barberry & carrots) with pomegrante mushrooms. The food was all amazing - especially the complex flavor combos. The were served in a spicy tomato sauce, which was a perfect complement to the not-spicy rice stuffing inside. The flavor combo of the shirin polo was an interesting contrast between the sweet raisins and tart barberries, and tasted even better when I mixed in the spicy roasted eggplant. The servings were large, so we ended up taking half the food home, and unfortunately didn't have room for dessert. Next time I'll leave room because I'd love to try the Persian gelato - flavors like fig/date, saffron with rosewater, and chocolate hazelnut. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast, from the host who seated us to the server. Our server asked us if we'd like him to explain any menu items or give recommendations, and was perfectly okay when we said we were fine choosing things on our own. All in all, this was a great dinner out.
