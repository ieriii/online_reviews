I came here with some friends for brunch this weekend. The place was busy! I was kinda set off at first because the guys who had been working there did not explain how the seating situation works. It is a little different here. You first arrive you order your food at the register and then you are seated and the food arrives. The food was great! We had ordered: Huevos Rancheros- super yummy Orange Brioche French Toast- my second favorite House-Made Waffle House-Made Granola-this is great! they make this themselves... greatly recommand
