It's meat... and lots of it. What is not to love? the salad bar is very good, but always tries to derail me from my goal of eating my weight in meat. But seriously, good meat is hard to come by and I think this place has it. The service is outstanding and more meat can come your way as quickly as you desire it. If I have anything less than complimentary to say it would be that some choices were a bit salty and that the price is a little too much to make it a 5-star selection.
