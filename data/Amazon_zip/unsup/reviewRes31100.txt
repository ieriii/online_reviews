This is my favorite vegetarian restaurant in the city of Chicago. The food is always delicious (I am craving the dagwood sandwich right now), the hot drinks warm the soul (mmm, chai), and they always ask if I want my cheese to be soy or dairy. The lactose intolerant in me says, yay, soy! One time I had their fake fish sandwich that was a special... alas they took it off the menu. I wish that they would put it back. Giving up fish was the hardest for me to do when I committed to the vegetarian lifestyle so to have a fake fish was a treat! I digress. The food is always piping hot, the mashed potatoes with mushroom gravy is delicious, and the loaded potato skins are amaaaazing.  Seriously, try them. The only bad thing is that the wait time can suck because this place is so popular. I guess Ellen almost used them for her wedding. I love Ellen, too!
