For a hotel that boasts a spa in it's name I would have expected a more calm environment. The wonderful spa aside, I don't understand why each hotel room would be equipped with a large stereo without volume control. During the night, both rooms surrounding me were blasting club music with the bass turned on what seemed like max. If you want to stay at a hotel for the purpose of relaxing and enjoying their spa, stay somewhere else. Also, the check-in/front desk area is not well organized. Sure, they have kiosks, which didn't work for me or my boyfriend so we waited for someone to check us in at the front desk, which we didn't mind but it took an unreasonably long time. Oh and I loved when they explained turndown service. Thank you, I've stayed at a hotel before. Bottom line: If you wear Ed Hardy, like doing blow and party to techno music, this place is for you.
