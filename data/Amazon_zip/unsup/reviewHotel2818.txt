One of the nicer embassy suites I've stayed at. Wish they had better chairs in the large conference room that I had to sit in for 2 weeks! Great location! There is so much to do w/in walking distance! & starbucks is right next door ;-) Pops for Champagne (across the street) is a classy must! Love the heaters at the entryway. Accommodating staff. Free breakfast made to order (although I always ate oatmeal and fruit). No free wifi ($10/day). No free parking.
