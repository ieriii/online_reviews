By some miracle, there were two seats open at the bar when we showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday night (no reservations, of course). Which led to one of the more enjoyable dining experiences I've had in Chicago. The ambience, food, and service are all in perfect balance. I think our server must have had ESP, because she showed up at the exact moment I was thinking, "Hm, I think I'll order another beer." And when I inquired about what looked liked shot glasses of milk, the bartender not only explained what it was (creamy limoncello), but poured us a couple of samples. And then, of course, there's the food, which is rustic and satisfying yet sophisticated. I know the Publican is famous for its treatment of pork, and all the parts of pig we dined on that night were delicious (I had no idea that pork ears could be so delicious as a salad garnish), but even the accompaniments -- the artichokes in broth with the pork belly, the spicy rapini with the country rib -- were equally revelatory. The only thing that we weren't impressed by were the fries. I think they need to steal the Hopleaf's, and then this place would be perfection.
