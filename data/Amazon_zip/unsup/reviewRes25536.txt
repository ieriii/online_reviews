I've got to say that I felt let down by Pequod's. I enjoy all styles of pizza and most topping combos, but I found that Pequod's fell flat. While the toppings were good (tomato, basil and garlic), there was just too much bread. The crust was good and all, but it together it just didn't work. Not enough topping, but the caramelized crust was good. Also, cold pizza the next morning is usually yummy, but in this case, it only got worse... My recipe for success would be 1/2 the crust and and 3x the toppings, with more cheese (more cheese is always a good thing!)
