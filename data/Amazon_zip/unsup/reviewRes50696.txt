Before I forget, Liza the corn bread is pretty good here. Yummy Yummy Yummy. I like their southern inspired brunches. Who doesn't like Andoullie sausage skillets, corn flake crusted french toast, I like the choose your juice and they're freshly squeeze it. Their coffee/espresso drinks seem pretty strong to me. Just be warned the mud one (its espresso and sweetned condensed milk is really really sweet, so its not my style for a morning drink but it may be your style) They also have beers and other alcoholic drinks if you want that for your crawfish benedict, or crab cakes. Just go there and try it. If you don't like it, don't come back.
