After working for a foodie business and eating at hundreds of delicious ethnic/foodie/gourmet/Michelin starred businesses all over the US, I can proudly say this is the best damn meal of my life. I'm so lucky to have a boyfriend who believes that a sensual (but ultimately ephemeral) experience as unique as Alinea is easily worth $500. Eating here is a huge treat, a once in a lifetime opportunity (unless you host something on the Food Network) and worth every penny- really, I promise. Alinea truly delivers on every level- I'm proud that the Midwest offers the creme de la creme by international dining standards (could El Bulli really be better? I guess I'll never know). Read up on Alinea's expediting process before you go; pique your interest by watching youtube vids on the molecular gastronomy devices Grant solicits. Page through his "cookbook," and watch some of Mike Sula's brilliant Reader vids on their collective mad genius. Consider all of it opening act to your tummy's greatest show. Grant and his team are savants (duh) but also dorks of the highest level; food nerds who treat dining as a video game, to conquer each evolving level and eventually save the princess. You supply the gold coins, of course.
