i'm probably not cool enough to come here, but i love it anyways. i don't know what i was expecting when i walked in for the first time, but i liked it. vh is dimly lit, velvety, intimate & cozy. on the night we visited, the clash's greatest played overhead. me & my date were able to belly up at the bar after about a 40 minute wait. it seems as if having some kind of facial hair is a prerequisite for being a bartender at vh. also mandatory? that you-dont-give-a-shit-attitude. they could have cared less that anyone was there, but service was fine. yes, the drinks were expensive, but they were inventive & one-of-a-kind. and let's be honest - you're paying for the whole speakeasy thing too. we had two rounds & bounced; my favorite was the hush & wonder. if you're looking for something different than being surrounded by collegiates chugging beers & throwing back o-bombs, violet hour is for you.
