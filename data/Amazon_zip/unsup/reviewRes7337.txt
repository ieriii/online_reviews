OMG I loved this place. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, and we ate like kings. We had a reservation for 9 I think, showed up 45 minutes late and they still got us a table right away, which is rad. The food was great- the dude got pumpkin ravioli with butternut squash which was amazing (tho a little sweet for me). And I got the biggest freaking lasagna I'd ever seen. Seriously it was the size of a standard letter. 8.5x11 for sure. But what really blew me away was the service. We had a waiter named Chris (I think), who was amazing. Super attentive, very helpful but not constantly hovering. And when I mentioned it was the dude's birthday (I'm not gonna lie, I was hoping to scam some cake out of them), they comped us tiramisu no problem. The reason I posted four stars instead of five is that it is VERY crowded in the restaurant, to the point where you almost can't move without bumping another table, which can be pretty uncomfortable. However, everything else was rad. Go.
