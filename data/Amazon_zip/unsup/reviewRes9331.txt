I paid as much for supper for two here as I paid for my first car (a Chevy beater in 1969), so it was hard not to choke from time to time at the thought of forking over $145 per person (plus cocktails and tip) for the tasting dinner and accompanying wine flight. Notwithstanding the expense and some menza-menza courses in a leisurely night of noshing, the over-all experience rates 3.75 stars for the ambitious but fussily presented cuisine and 5.50 stars for the table-side elan of our server. Net: This is a solid four-star, once-in-a-lifetime experience. But you really need to do it only once. As well it should, the menu changes according to the season. Our night in mid-September featured cold cucumber soup garnished with creme fraiche, a small but lovely licorice salad, a pair of brilliantly executed fish courses, some fine bites of filet mignon fried in duck fat, and two desserts. Any meal with two desserts rates an extra half-star in my book.  Everything was competently prepared and painstakingly composed, but the flavors in some courses, as noted by other reviewers, were strangely subtle. While I celebrate chefs who don't overpower the ingredients, I didn't leave Sprout with an indelible memory of any dish - or an urge to get a second mortgage to hurry back for more.  In contrast to the un-memorableness of all but the crispy, creamy preparation of the mahi mahi, I loved the wine flight, which took us around the world in a series of sips that perfectly complemented each course. The pours individually seemed a bit grudging but any more wine would have rendered us insensible to the depth and texture of the dining experience.  This is splendid place to take your honey for a special occasion, if s/he is a fellow foodie. And you can cost-average the price of the experience by taking said honey to dinner each night for the next few months at the Burger King conveniently located next door. You might even spot my Chevy beater in the parking lot.
