I got lucky! The food at Schwa is truly amazing and very innovative. Bring the chefs some gifts (aka, Jameson Irish Whisky!) and you'll be def set for a night to remember! Started with a great amuse of chocolate covered cherry in a sweet cocktail of cherry. The texture was like nothing I've ever tasted (between explosive and creamy)! That was paired with a soda made of flowers! Truly 5-star and innovative. What I like about Schwa is that fact the chefs bring out your food! So, you could always ask questions and get a definite answer. The chefs also brought us gifts of booze and food not on the "menu." The second dish was soup in a petri dish! But this was no simple soup! It was Chef Carlson's version of a Thai soup made with kappa and iota carrageenan to create a smooth gel texture that rivals anything I've had at Alinea or Moto in Chicago. The tiny mushrooms made this dish truly cosmic! There was so many little details that I wished I would not have been on my 4th libation of the night! Chef kept bringing out food and drinks and chatting! The crew at Schwa is small and very knowledgeable! The horchata and rice krispy treats = Awesome The roe with lavender air = Epic The salmon The squab The pork belly The turmeric ice cream ... Too many drinks to recall! I will say that these dishes all were so complex yet so good and easy to eat that I'm speechless! Then came the Chefs signature = quail ravioli with black truffle (Note: seems like fresh black truffles where in every dish) This dish was full flavored and memorable as one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life! That's how good Schwa is! It's probably the best food you'll ever eat in your Life! Throw in getting to know and chat with the chefs...priceless! Good luck getting a table at this establishment!
