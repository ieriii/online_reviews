hadn't been to bongo for awhile, but i'm glad we revisited, because our experience was so good. sat at the counter, which is not usually my choice, but here it's a good one, because you can carry on a conversation easily despite the background noise, which can be considerable, and the counter server was so laid back and friendly, with the coffee pot grafted to her arm. i had a heck of a time choosing between sweet and savory, ended up with the rock shrimp benedict which did not disappoint: shrimp were tender and sauce was not too heavy and complemented it well, potatoes were well browned and seasoned; tasted of bacon, maybe? hub had the chocolate french toast which, no matter how you look at it, is dessert, not breakfast, but if you accept that fact, it was really yummy. bread was moist and the melty soft chips combined with the creamy sauce made for a way too decadent first meal of the day. seriously though, it's enough sweetness to last a week, so be prepared. other than that, the high ceilinged industrial space does echo around considerable sound, there are booths available seating eight, including a number of wee folk who add to the din, so really, counter seating is more conducive to conversation than a standard table. i'll try that again next time. we have concluded however, that this isn't a regular go-to breakfast destination for us. tab came to $40 including tip, which is more than we want to drop every sat., but o.k. for an occasional foray. as to those bemoaning the wait: if it's the weekend and you don't want to wait, as with any of the popular brunch places in chicago, get there when it opens and that problem is solved.
