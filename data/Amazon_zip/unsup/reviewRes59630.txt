* It's the usual only-in-Chicago inexplicable curse ... After blissfully browsing for a million years at Reckless, you emerge onto Milwaukee starving to death, but assuming that as in ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WHOLE WORLD, you'll be surrounded by high-calibre quick-service eatery options, only to straggle down to Division miles later having found NOT ONE NORMAL DECENT EATING OPTION along the entirety of the whole damned stretch of garbage storefronts, hipper-than-thou-bars, and assorted rubbish of various kinds (No, I'm not including any place that serves fake meat and is affiliated with the evil Yahweh cult) ... So FINALLY you wolf down your tacos at La Pasadita, and they're ... passable ... Ah, yes, Chicago ... It's a stumper.
