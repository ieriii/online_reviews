Who doesn't love encased meat dressed with minimal veggies, slathered in condiments, and wrapped in a warm bun?  Hot Doug's, you always hit the spot. Skip the weekend lines, my friends, and try to come during the week! Best time to come is usually before the lunch rush. Key to success: come before 11 and you will find minimal lines! So skip school or play hookie from work. Hot Doug's is definitely worth it!  I enjoy the Marty Allen and so should you!
