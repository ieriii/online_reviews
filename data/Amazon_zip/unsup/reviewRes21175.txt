The food was superb, exactly what I wanted, but not really what I was expecting. From a "celebrity chef" I was expecting something more out of the ordinary, someone trying too hard to do something different or interesting, but this really is Mexican comfort food, soups, sandwiches, chocolate, churros, etc. The flavors are subtle, but complex with great combinations. It is relatively simple food, but just done so well and balanced. The beverages, jamaica, lemonade, and chocolates were all spot on. You can just see the care and quality in everything they do. This is exactly what I want in a restaurant, all the details are taken care of, it knows what it is and does it well. At first, I was thinking the pricing was a little high. Now, if it were my everyday lunch spot, sure, that might be the case. I would only go occasionally though, and for that, the pricing is right where it should be. I would gladly pay that pricing on occasion. In turn, the pricing doesn't seem to be too high, or they wouldn't have a constant line. And if anyone thinks anything here is too hot/spicy, well, I feel sorry for you...
