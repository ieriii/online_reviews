Went to Publican last night for my boyfriend's birthday. Couldn't be a better dinner spot for a male birthday; lots of meat that is slow cooked, moist and delicious and a really good beer menu. Our server was really key in our picking the best dishes and the right amount of food for a group of 4. We ended up getting the country chicken (probably my favorite, best chicken i've had in a while), the potee (2 different meat cuts and a sausage), the veal loin, the squash and romanesco vegetable plates, and the chef's choice of oysters. We also got two desserts (waffles and apple pie) and two amazing beers each, and finished every bite. Ended up being about $60 each but it was totally worth it, especially for a birthday celebration. Happy birthday Neil!
