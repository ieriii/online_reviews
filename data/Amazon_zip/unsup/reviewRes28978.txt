Pequod's is without a doubt the best in Chicago pizza. Whenever someone from out of town comes to visit, and I want to impress them with Chicago food, I take them here first. Start things off with a bang. More often then not, my guests will love the food so much they'll purchase a t-shirt from behind the bar as a keep sake. The deep dish is good here, as good as a deep dish can be, I guess. To me, a deep dish pizza is nothing more than a stomach ache topped with cheese. You have to love this place for it's New York style pizza...so thin...so delicious. The sauce is unheard of...I heard the owner traded his first born child for it....and the crust is just right. Not too crispy, not too soft....but a whole lot of perfect. Pepperoni and sausage is my favorite, but I will give you some advice, my dear pizza loving friend. If you order Pepperoni, ask for "light pepperoni." This will give you as much as you get on a normal pizza. If you don't request this, you will find yourself drowning in a sea of hundreds of pepperoni....out of which you may never escape.
