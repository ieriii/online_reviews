This was my first experience with Fogo 2 Go, and I had read a lot of complaints on here about slow delivery, and bungled delivery orders, so i was leery of placing an online order, but I'm glad I decided to risk it, because it turned out fine. I ordered two chicken dinners, a mini pizza and some bocce balls, and was given an estimate of about an hour. In fact, the food arrived hot, fresh and 10 minutes early. The driver was missing my 2 drinks, but when I pointed it out, the restaurant called to apologize, and sent them over. All the dishes were great (the pizza was MUCH better than Apart, with really fresh, crunchy, flavorful toppings and ample cheese) and the only negatives I noticed were that the chicken was extremely black and salty, which I actually didn't mind, and the garlic in the potatoes was a bit over the top. I am a big fan of garlic, so if it tasted that strong to me, others might find it unpalatable, but this was minor stuff that didn't detract much from my enjoyment. I used a Groupon today, but would probably order again at full price if I was in the area.
