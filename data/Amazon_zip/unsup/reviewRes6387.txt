This five star rating is SOLELY for Paige, the bartender. She did her best to make an arcane, off-menu drink (a French 75, since you've politely asked). When she noticed that we weren't thrilled with her version, she remade it without asking.  Thanks for her excellent and concise customer service (and a good Campari drink).
