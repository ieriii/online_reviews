By far our favorite restaurant. My wife and I come every season to taste the new menu. We even fly home from Chicago every season and come here. I miss it. The food and drinks are always great. Don't settle for the tasting. I do miss the wait staff wearing chucks and the blaring music. Bring it back GE!
