I went to Sprout for dinner on a weekday and did the Prix Fixe option....excellent choice! I had a variety of meals to choose from among the 3 courses offered. I loved the decor of the place, it probably made my meal that more enjoyable. I had the Shrimp for an appetizer. They gave me two but they were on a bed of greens and had a yummy sauce to boot! My meal choice was the steak with crab. Again, perfectly seasoned. The butternut desert I chose was okay - the granola was a bit chewy for my liking. Despite the positive experience, I'm not sure I'd go again due to price. Our bill (for 2 people) with a bottle of wine came to over 200 bucks.
