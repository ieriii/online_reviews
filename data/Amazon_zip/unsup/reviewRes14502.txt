The food was great, even wonderful. Really terrific food. Our waitress was also wonderful. So, I enjoyed the food and waitress. I can only give 3 stars, however, because of the way I was treated by the person who seats people. I arrived at 5:25 pm. Our reservation was for 5:30 pm. He showed me our table and I started to sit down but he asked "Where is your other party." I answered, "She is on her way." He then told me I could not sit down until she arrived because it is their policy not to seat partial parties. I asked if it would be okay since the table was empty and the restaurant so crowded and there was really nowhere for me to stand. He again said no, due to policy. I had to stand there in between all the tables of people eating their food for 10 minutes until my friend arrived. Our table sat there empty while I waited and I kept having to move while waiters and patrons tried to walk around me. I had my coat and purse and I was in everyone's way. I felt humiliated standing there not allowed to sit until my friend arrived. It was so stupid of him to make me stand next to our empty table. I wanted to sit down and have a glass of water or soda while I waited for my friend. This was silly and he didn't seem to care that I was in everyone's way. The bar was full and there was literally nowhere for me to stand but I was prohibited from sitting at our reserved empty table. This was very offensive to me.
