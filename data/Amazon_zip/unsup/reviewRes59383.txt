I am a fan of Fox and Obel!  I still haven't found that one grocery store for all my shopping, but Fox & Obel does many things very well. In fact, they do thing good enough where I'll drive up to Chicago once a month or so to shop there...and I'm coming from Joliet!  What do I drive there for? The produce? no, not really. But I do drive there for their cured meats. Yes, I'm addicted to Iberico Bellota jamon. It is soooooo good.   While I'm there getting my Iberico fix I also check out the cured meats, butchered items, chocolate (Valrhona's my favorite), the cheese and the bread.  I don't want to turn this into a jamon (salumi) review. But some notable cured meats to try when you're at Fox & Obel are...  Iberico, Iberico Bellota, Pio Tosini, Petit Jesu, La Quercia and the others.  On another note: I wish they had more specialty items like quail eggs, a larger number of top end butters, larger selection of heirloom vegetables, real wasabi.  enjoy the food!
