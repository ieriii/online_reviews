i was skeptical. really skeptical. i thought it was all fluff and hype.. and whiskey, but when i tried the food, i was seriously blown away. maybe it was a great night for the restaurant and i was particularly hungry, but i am going to give all the credit to the chefs in the kitchen. we ordered the wild boar sloppy joe: oh yea.. the sweet brioche, the tang on the meat, the heat from the roasted jalapeno. this was a way better choice than the burger (which im sure was good, but wild boar! how can anyone turn that down.) Potato agnolotti : imagine little pillowy noodles filled with ultra creamy potato.. it came with a great rich sauce, but the mushrooms were a bit gritty (baaah), the shaved foie gras didn't add much for me, but it was a good dish overall the absolute best thing we had was the pork belly confit. it was a giant piece of pork belly, crispy and juicy and tender all at the same time...there was risotto with chestnuts and apple. seriously this was just so delicious and complex and well married flavors. i can't wait to have it again.
