I've been going to the Chicago Diner since the 90's and am very sad to say they have lost most of their appeal. The menu has changed a lot and is now packed with processed food. The food is still okay, it's just not what it used to be. They used to have a delicious tofu scramble with tahini, soy sauce, sesame oil and sunflower seeds. They served it with a side of steamed kale and corn muffin. It was, in short, my favorite meal of the 90's. They have long since stopped serving it, and even their corn muffins are a different recipe now. Although I am sad about the slow decline of the Diner, I still do respect their long years of serving Chicago vegetarians. Also, they have very tasty desserts.
