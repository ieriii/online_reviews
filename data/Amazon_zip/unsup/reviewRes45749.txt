Wilde's aesthetics are as great as it's service and food! My husband and I have been there more times than I can count. It has never disappointed. From the brunch egg sandwich to the Cobb salad, from the trout to the knife and fork salad, from the Reuben gone Wilde, to the amazing fish and chips...Wilde is a gem in the South East Lakeview Neighborhood.
