I wish I could give five stars, because the food is really delicious! Always well-seasoned (I think they use crack cocaine on the chips though, because I always get hooked after the first one!) and lovingly prepared. But today, I opted to not get water (or any drink) because I picked up 2 glasses from the stacks (water is self-service) that were FILTHY! How disappointed was I today?? I love XOCO, but they need a new dishwasher.
