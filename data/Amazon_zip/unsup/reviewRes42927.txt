If you can't tell from my reviews already- I eat a lot of pizza! I've tried lots of pizza places throughout the city and I finally got to try Art of Pizza the other night. We had it delivered and ordered deep dish and thin crust. I don't normally like deep dish so this review is for the thin crust pizza which I thought was very good. It had lots of sauce and a good amount of cheese for my tastes since I don't like a lot of gooey cheese on my pizza- I like more sauce than cheese. Anyway, next time I'll take a taste of the deep dish, but I am a big fan of the thin crust!
