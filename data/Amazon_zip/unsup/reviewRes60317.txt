Probably the worst restaurant experience I have had in quite some time. My wife wanted to surprise me and go to a Sushi restaurant (she doesn't eat sushi) so she ordered the steak which ended up mostly fat. She sent it back and the manager, Nook Rug I believe started yelling at us. Customer service was terrible and they refused to take the steak off the bill. In fact, we never even got an I'm sorry...just hurry up, pay your bill and leave.As for the sushi, it was ok, I would rate it a 3 out of 5 if I were in Wichita, but in Chicago I would expect much better.
