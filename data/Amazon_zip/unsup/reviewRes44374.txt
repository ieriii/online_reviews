Wakamono, like Hall and Oates would say "you make my dreams come true" The fish is fresh and delicious. While this is not an inexpensive lil' joint the sashimi plates are so worth it. I can't remember a time when I didn't get both red and white tuna. Simply stellar. While the service staff is at times a little abrupt they are quite serviceful. The most uncomfortable part is that the guy filling up the water is so on the ball that anytime you take a drink of water, he is there with his shiny silver perpetually full pitcher.  Overall, my favorite sushi place in Chicago.
