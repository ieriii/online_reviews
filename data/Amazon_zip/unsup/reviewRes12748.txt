I am a huge fan of their brunch! In fact, I think I might be a bit obsessed. I am in love with their Crab Cake Benedict. Having said that, I have tried many many items on their dinner menu and I've always been pleased. I love the atmosphere with it's exposed brick walls and creative art on the walls and fun music. It's never been over crowded and the drinks from the bar are so amazing you won't mind waiting for a table on a Friday or Saturday night. In the summer they have a great outdoor patio!
