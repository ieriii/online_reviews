I came here recently and have mixed emotions about it. While nothing was bad, nothing was great.  I wasn't thrilled about where we were sat. I hate feeling crammed in and I do not like feeling apart of the two tables next to ours convo...and that's exactly how I felt. It looked like they had a lot more fun options of places to sit (the bar, the lounge-ish area before the bar..). Our waiter seemed very nice, although; he seemed to explain a lot of things about the menu but I had no clue what he said cause I couldn't hear him cause it was SO loud!  We went with one red and one wine flight.  As well as, three cheeses and three meats. After the 8 glasses of wine came out and our other treats, we didn't even have an inch of space left on the table. We finished up with a caesar salad cause nothing else really appealed to me. Bin36 is a good place to try. Like I said, it good but nothing to rave about. I probably will not be back but I'm glad I tried it!
