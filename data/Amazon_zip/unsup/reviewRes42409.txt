Ok, I'm giving a lot of 5 stars, however I am very picky, and these all deserve it. The Art of Pizza is hands down the best pizza in the city of Chicago, period. It's incredibly delicious with fresh ingredients. Their eggplant parmesan is fantastic. It's a huge portion and bloody inexpensive! Easily stretched for 2 meals.  I only wish their dining room was more than an "eat and get the hell out" atmosphere. All the cops eat here, and I would think they know pizza. Better than Uno's, Giordano's, Due, Lou Malnati's is a close 2nd, and Gino's East would be #3 behind these guys.
