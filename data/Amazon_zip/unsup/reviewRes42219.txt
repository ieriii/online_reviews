ok I haven't tried that many Vietnamese places here in chicago. Its is so hard to find good asian food in chicago. yes asian as in from korean all the way to Indian. that has been my experience for the past 8 months. My expectations were not very high for this place but boy i was so wrong with my assumptions. it is so good. as good as it gets. excellent meal through out. the menu has a lot of non traditional Vietnamese, i stuck with the classics and i wasn't disappointing.
