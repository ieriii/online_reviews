Very dissapointed with the guacamole and the margarita's nothing really special. Very surprised to hear it was voted the best restaurant in the country??? We have read several reviews before we went, of course there will be both negative and positive reviews. Well now we know there is nothing special about this restuarant. Please people save your money and go somewhere else.
