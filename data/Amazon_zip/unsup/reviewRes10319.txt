So probably no need for one more stellar review, but wow! Went here tonight for an early birthday dinner (happy bday to me!) and I was very impressed. The actual restaurant was bigger than I expected with both a hip urban restaurant feel in the front and a homey, older house feel in the back. The garden and patio was spectacular and I'm hoping for some more warm weather to try it out. Food - amazing. We had the grilled seafood to start...so nice. Then we shared the pappardelle with lamb meatballs and the Branzino fish. Fish hands down delicious--that grapefruit sauce with capers that I was so sure wouldn't work--totally worked. The pasta was very good and hearty with eggplant and little spiced lamb meatballs. It was very good, but completely overshadowed by the fish. The quality of the pasta itself was amazing--clearly made in-house and fresh. Yum. Dessert - chocolate hazelnut cake and gelato...another wow. Not too sweet, but decadent at the same time. I was very sad that I said I would share with my fiance! Best of all was the amazing service. We had Alfredo as our waiter and he was so enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and pleasant that it truly made the meal. After dessert he asked if we were celebrating anything--when I mentioned the bday, he ran off and brought back a plate of biscotti with Happy Birthday written across the plate and a candle--it was a lovely surprise. I look forward to going back here often!
