I should have known better than to go to Gino's in the heart of downtown, but it was raining, and we were very hungry. Upon walking to the front door, we were stopped and told to wait outside, in the rain (mind you, no one else was outside, just us.) The employee, with her walkie talkie, radios command center and gets us clearance to come inside. This is when we enter the second phase of pizza verification. The host raises his hand in a stopping motion and says, "move as far back into the corner as possible and wait to be seated." While waiting in our "holding pen," another patron walked up to ask how long the wait would be. The host threw up his hands, and before the man could speak, said, "look, it's going to be about 15 minutes, I need you to move back to that corner." The host then storms off , swearing under his breath. Dazed, I was then knocked into by the parking attendant, apparently too close to his key rack, that's when I decided it was time to leave. Regardless of the fact that I've lived here my whole life, it doesn't negate the fact that you can treat people like garbage when they come to your establishment. I've had Gino's plenty of times, but never have I had an experience like that. If your waitstaff is flustered over being busy on a thursday night, then hire some employees that can handle the pressure.
