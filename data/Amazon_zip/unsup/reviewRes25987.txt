Planned a surprise party for my hubby + 10 friends on a Friday night. Everything was flawless. Food was delicious, service was attentive but not overbearing or nosey. We cleaned up all the tapas / share plates & drank every last drop of sangria. Deeeelish! The atmosphere was perfect & lively! So happy to have been recommended Mercat. Thanks for a wonderful surprise birthday!!! Looking forward to returning to enjoy brunch.
