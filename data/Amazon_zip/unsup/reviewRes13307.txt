Revolution doesn't need any more reviews, but I feel the need to chime in on one thing. Bacon fat popcorn. Get a bowl. Or 2. Or 3. I'm not even a huge pork-eater [insert lame joke here] but this shizz is the bomb. Beers were great, dinner was delicious (I will now be adding cream cheese to my mashed potatoes at home), desserts were SO good (PB&B? Yes, please!) service was fast... it's even vegan/veg friendly. If only it were closer to home. Go, now. And don't forget that popcorn.
