I don't know what all the fuss is about. I've been to many Pho places in Chicago over the past few years I've lived here, but this one doesn't rank all that high. It's not bad just really average, especially given that if you walk around the corner down Argyle there are at least 4 other Pho restaurants that are all better than Tank. Don't get me wrong, my meal was good but the place feels like a school cafeteria and has absolutely no charm. There are lots of big vivid pictures on the menu and I think that's why people like it so much. All the other Pho places have the same great stuff, though! Hai Yen and Pho Viet are close by and have better food.
