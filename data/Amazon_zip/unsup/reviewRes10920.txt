I am a big fan of their beer selection and pizzas.  It's a casual place that is typically busy, but they are great with groups. I can think of at least 3 times I have shown up with a group of more than 6 at the very last minute, and somehow they have made it work for us.  I like their selection of specialty pizzas, but they will pretty much make whatever you want. You can ask for more sauce, more cheese, more toppings, etc, and they won't rip you off with all the extra charges.
