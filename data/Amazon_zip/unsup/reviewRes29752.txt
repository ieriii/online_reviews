Update: I've decided to add another star for the dine in experience. The portions were slightly larger, and the food was definitely more tasty for some reason. In any case they earned themselves just a bit more praise. I got take out here last night and while i thought the food was alright, I definitely wouldn't rave about it. For $25 dollars i got smallish sized portions of 2 dishes I ordered along with an appetizer. These were ordered off of their "hot and spicey menu" and to me they might as well have been placed in the regular sections, because when you ask me "how hot" I would like something and I tell you "as hot as you can make it" I expect my mouth to be on fire... which definitely wasn't the case... the thai chili i put on it was hotter than what they served up. There are definitely better tasting places around the city. I will give it to them that they do run a very clean looking establishment. I have to admit I very much prefer the chinese restaurant next door called "Tom Lee." The last time I was there with my dad, for $25 bucks we got beef chow fun, szechuan chicken, fried rice, and won ton soup. So to Opart I say "good day."
