Well run, service was great, food was out fast, they pay attention to detail. Had the avgolemono for the first time-so I have no reference point, but it was lemon heaven. Loved it. Gyro platter appetizer was plenty for dinner and excellent. Can't wait to go back and try more off the menu, but knowing me I wont be able to steer clear of the soup and gyro. Free valet-but be kind and tip! Check it out, you won't be disappointed.
