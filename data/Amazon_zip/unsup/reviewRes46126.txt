Ehhhh - this place is only so-so. If you like Cheesecake Factory (long lines, overly large portions, tacky decor) then you will be in heaven. I will say that my food was pretty good, though I can't remember what it even was. However, I like dining out for the experience - and there wasn't much experience to be had here, my friends. However, the are a number of "safe" options (nothing too creative here) and while not remarkable, nothing was horrible, which is why I awarded it 3-stars. If someone asks me to go again, I would probably return...if they couldn't be talked into going ot Yolk around the corner.
