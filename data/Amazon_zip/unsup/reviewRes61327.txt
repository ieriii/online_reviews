This place is expensive but we normal people always go with a free entree coupon. I love the salad bar - hearts of palm, seared ahi tuna - yum! Mushroom risotto, smoked salmon, haha - I should just go for the salad bar lunch. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a great steak, but I could eat their salad bar all day. As for the steak, well, the first few cuts I got were mouth-wateringly juicy and delicious. I guess I'm just not that big of an eater, because after awhile, it becomes too much. It's still good, but they all blend together, but I kept feeling like I had to stuff myself to the point of bursting to justify the price. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon was definitely my favorite. They didn't have lobster - when do they have the lobster? They didn't have lobster the last time I went, either.
