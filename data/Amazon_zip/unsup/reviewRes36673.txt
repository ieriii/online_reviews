After a few hours of hauling all our worldly possessions up two flights of stairs to our new apartment, I decided that I needed sushi. Unfortunately, it was 9 pm on a Sunday night. Enter Yelp. I narrowed it down to a few contenders in a 5 mile radius, and ultimately went with Indie Cafe, because: 1) they seemed to be the most reasonably priced 2) they had a decent selection 3) their website was the prettiest 4) they delivered We ordered the crab ragoon, wonton soup, the cashew chicken for my anti-sushi boyfriend, sake nigiri, sake maki, an avacado roll, and a philadelphia roll. It arrived in about 40 minutes.  The crab ragoon was good, although not as mind-blowing as some posts led me to believe.  The wonton soup was a pleasant surprise. There were carrot slices and peas in the broth, and shrimp and chicken in the wonton, instead of the classic "mystery meat." It wasn't the traditional wonton soup that you expect, but rather a healthier spin on it. My boyfriend enjoyed the cashew chicken, but then, he's easy to please. Now, the sushi. ....Eh. It was okay. All the ingredients were fresh, everything was prepared well, but there was just something missing. It was just a little bland.  Basically, it was decent sushi at a decent price for a last minute, late night order. But if I want really good sushi, I guess I'll have to look for another place. I will definitely order from them again, just not for sushi. Their appetizers were great, and the Thai menu looks delicious. The next time I want take-out that's healthy and affordable, I'll be giving them a call.
