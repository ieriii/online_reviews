First off,....FANTASTIC service! Staffs were friendly from the start to end! Myself and three other deaf girlfriends had dinner here this past weekend. Coincidentally, two of them bought a groupon deal, so requested if we could use them. The staff divided us in two groups with an adjoining table. A waiter who was an absolute gentleman provided us with a piece of paper to write numbers for our selection from menu to help with communication. I was definitely IMPRESSED with his consideration, patience, and accommodation. Second, only one of us was Indian, which is me! So, I have numerous experience with Indian foods. This place tops the list of my fave Indian restaurants. They started us off with garlic naans and a mild indian tomato sauce dip which everyone LOVED. We ordered foods that were typical Indian dishes, but also there were some creative dishes that I never heard of before! such as the Kashmiri naan with pineapple, cherries, and walnuts which was really DELICIOUS!!!.....and the Kaju curry (cashews and sauce) which was fine, just too much cashews. Also, on menu, you have choice to have mango shake (which is not typical) instead of mango lassi and two my friends ordered it twice! We were too stuffed to have desserts which we had hoped to taste. Next time! :) And overall, a great ambiance atmosphere and not noisy as we arrived 30min after the restaurant opened for dinnertime and already the place was filled with customers! I definitely recommend this place for Indian food.
