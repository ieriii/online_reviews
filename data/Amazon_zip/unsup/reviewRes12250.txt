I could have sworn that i wrote a review of this already. how could i have made such a gross oversight?  This restaurant definitely belongs on my short list of favorites. From the moment you are greeted by the soft bread and fantastic honey pepper butter, you will think you're in heaven. The taste of cuba appetizer is wonderful because you get a bit of everything: empanadas, chicken croquettes, mariquitas; all with a delicious light saffron sauce.  Now onto the dinner. The honey jalapeno pork chops (not 1, but 2!!!) are to die for. They are juicy and covered in the most wonderful sauce imaginable. You will definitely have leftovers. The almond-crusted halibut is excellent as well, but in my opinion isn't quite as good as the pistachio encrusted chicken. Chicken, you say! Yes, chicken. This dish is seriously amazing, even if it is chicken which i usually don't order at restaurants because it's usually kind of boring.  I don't think i've ever made it to dessert here just because i get SO full from my dinner. Come here and eat! You will love it.  p.s. the only thing i'm not 100% about is the mojitos here. They put sprite in it! stick with the margaritas or other rummy drinks that are much better.
