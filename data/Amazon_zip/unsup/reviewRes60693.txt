I'm always in the mood for Grand Lux. This is so much better than the cheesecake factory that I'm not even sure why anyone bothers to go to the cheesecake factory anymore. The wait can be long, but I'm so happy once I start eating that I forget I waited so long. Make sure you order some of their cookies to take home with you...yum!
