XOCO. Rick Bayless. Wikipedia. "Younger brother of sports journalist and television personality Skip Bayless." Ugh, I was already annoyed before I even stepped foot into the restaurant. I just hope Rick cooks better than his brother comments on sports. For starters we had churros, which are Spanish doughnuts dipped in thick chocolate. I expected this combination to be super sweet but it was twisted ridged goodness. Captain Crunch's cinnamon has got nothing on these churros. The Pepito Torta which accommodates braised tall-grass short ribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack, black beans, and pickled jalapenos in its buns was phenomenal. The Mole Poblano (Thursday special torta) encompasses braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy fresh garnishes, and fresh cheese was good but pales in comparison to the Pepito. One day I will be back to try the Ahogada, the golden pork carnitas is dine-in only. XOCO's tortas are worth trying, even if their maker is an Oklahoma Sooner.
