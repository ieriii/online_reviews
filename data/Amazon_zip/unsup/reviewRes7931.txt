Best pizza I've had since I visited Naples. It is not possible to compare it to chain pizza stores here in the U.S. When I left Naples, I just assumed I would never eat pizza like it ever again. I'm not a big fan of doughy pizzas (think Papa Johns) as it is. Deep dish - eh, every now and then. Neapolitan is my preference when possible and this is the best I've had in the U.S. The atmosphere is a clean, open pizza parlor feel. I like being able to see into the kitchen area. The one downside is the small tables -- food did not fit very easily on the table for 4. And we only had 3...Service was prompt and attentive, just right for a pizza place. We began with the insalata di mare - fresh calamari, cuttlefish, and shrimp. When seafood is so fresh, there's no need for much seasoning and they do a good job of preserving the natural flavors. I would have preferred more olives, I think there was one on the entire plate. Pizzas. We had one white (bianco nero), one red sauce (funghi e salsiccia). Both were spectacular. The crust on both had the perfect amount of chew and flavor from the oven. The bianco nero was amazingly light, I loved the porcini mushrooms. The truffle and truffle oil gave the overall flavor a nutty, earthy flavor. The funghi e salsiccia had more going on in terms of toppings. The sausage was wondrous. The only thing I wish was that more basil was added. The few leaves of basil I ate was the perfect complement to the sausage and mushrooms. Will definitely be back.
