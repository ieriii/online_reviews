BEST THAI in the city!!!! I live 2 blocks away, which i don't know if it's a good thing or bad.... Pretty much anything you order on the menu is great, I especially love anything they cook with Duck in it. Great curry menu as well. I also highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea (reminds me of sweet Assyrian Chai). The joint is really clean and has nice decor like Thai carvings on the walls. def try this place out if you never have, its directly under the Western Brown line.
