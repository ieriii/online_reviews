I really loved this place, but the entire group I was with absolutely hated it and were dying to get out of there. I think it boils down to what you're looking for in an evening. If you're looking to sit around and have nice, pricey drinks and chat with friends, this place is perfect! If you're looking to "hook up", "meet new people", "let loose", etc, this isn't your scene! The drink we had (grapefruit something or other) was tasty, but seriously -1 star for the pitcher prices. We calculated it out and the ridiculously priced pitcher doesn't really save you much over just getting individual drinks. If I buy in bulk, I should get a discount, damnit. It's easier on the bartenders, etc, I should see some of those savings! *On a side note, the hand cut huge ice cubes they put in the drinks are freaking cool. I'd definitely be back to this place, but only without my "fun-loving" friends in tow !
