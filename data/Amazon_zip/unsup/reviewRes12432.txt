Bought the $20 for $40 groupon and spent it on a weekday lunch here. Lunch ends at 2PM, and got there around 1:30. There was only one party of four at a table in the entire restaurant at the time. The waitress that served us was very friendly and nice! I love her laid back attitude. Sorry I forgot to ask your name (waitress with short curly hair), but you're the best!! Had the Papa Rellenas as a starter, which was to die for! Warm, flavorful food from heaven! lol We actually ordered two plates of it! haha!! I had the Tacos al Carbon (Chicken), and my boyfriend had the steak quesadillas (which isn't on the online menu but it is in the restau). My tacos were good but not phenomenal. My boyfriend loved his quesadillas, and he's very hard to please when it comes to steak anything. The steak in 'em was very tender and flavorful. Overall, we LOVED our experience at Cafe 28. The service and food was wonderful. We felt well taken care of, and we hope to come back again!
