To call me a wingman would be an understatement. I have more of an obsessive compulsion toward the buffalo variety and rarely stray away from that one sauce, though the level of heat varies by my temperament.  That being said, upon walking into Crisp on a Wednesday afternoon I became so overpowered by the scent of Korean Barbecue that I did something absolutely unheard of: ordered 10 wings, half spicy Buffalo and half...  ...  ...  Seoul Sassy!  I took the food to go because I was already incredibly tired and knew that this basket of poultry godliness would certainly put me into a food coma. At this point, I'm not sure my relationship with Buffalo sauce will ever be the same after experiencing such crispy colossal wings covered in sauce so sassy it'd make even the girls at the Wiener Circle blush.
