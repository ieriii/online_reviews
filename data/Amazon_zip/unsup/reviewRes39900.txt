One of the best meals I've had in a long time. It was definitely worth the hour wait. The small plate scallops and tete du cochon were both incredible. I was a little skeptical of the scallop dish at first...scallops and short ribs are definitely not a traditional pairing but it worked and it was good.  I had the wild boar sloppy joe with beef fat fries as an entree. Also, amazing! The spiciness of the sauce was a nice, unexpected surprise. The beef fat fries were flavorful but by no means the star of the meal. For dessert, I had the chocolate tart. It was a little too much after such a heavy entree but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it.
