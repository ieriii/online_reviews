My personal favorite in Greektown (and I know I'm not alone); great weeknight or pre-game spot. Free valet (worth a star) and consistently good food and service. It's Greektown... I won't ramble on because I'm sure you get it. They're all pretty good and pretty similar, I just like GI a little better and feel comfortable there.
