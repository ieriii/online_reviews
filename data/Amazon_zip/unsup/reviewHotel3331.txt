This place is great. Excellent location, very close to Millenium Park, the Art Institute of Chicago and the river. The building may be older, but if it is they remodeled it because it looks brand new on the inside. Our room was huge compared to where we stayed the first night- a tiny little place down the street called River Hotel or something like that. We had a little bit of a view of the city too. Huge flatscreen TV and we were given free wi-fi with our deal. They had some cool displays too- different musicians on each floor after you get off the elevator. Our bathroom kind of sucked though. Horrible shampoo and conditioner- it smelled funny. And a weird but annoying thing was that the toilet paper holder is really far from the toilet. Strange. Also, the bar downstairs sucks. Service is awful and they play techno at a Hard Rock place. Makes no sense. Other than that this place is awesome. Also, if you play guitar, they will let you borrow some really cool ones- as long as they have your credit card number. One guy showed us a $6,000 guitar. Don't drop that!
