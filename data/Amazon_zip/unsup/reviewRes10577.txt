Who doesn't like pizza and beer? This place has them both. I like thin pizza so this is definitely spot on for me. We got the white sauce very simple with some basil and tomato - it was delicious. I also had an IPA that I was totally satisfied with. Big place. I'm sure it'd be good for big parties. I went with my cousin and sat at the bar in the afternoon. It was nice. The staff was just okay. Not overly friendly or helpful, but not rude or assholes. I'd recommend it and I'd go back.
