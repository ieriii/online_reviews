I absolutely love this place. Four of us were there yesterday for an early dinner (and watched the place get packed), and we had an excellent meal. Even the 13-year-old picky eater in the group got adventurous and ordered the lemon and parsley pork chop, which was thick, perfectly cooked, and tender. I got the grilled salmon which is served over grilled asparagus and champ (their mashed potatoes that are made with whole milk and have purposeful lumps- soooo good). The artichoke cheddar dip was also amazing, and the service was perfect- attentive without being annoying. I live in Milwaukee, so when I get down to Chicago I like to try new places because there is just so much, but I think I'll be back to Wilde soon. Not only was the food delicious, but the beautiful bars, library, ceilings, and restrooms make this a really special place. (Seriously, go to the restroom--even if you don't have to--just to see it).
