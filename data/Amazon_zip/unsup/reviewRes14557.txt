we were delightfully surprised at the food at glenn's diner. the selection of fish was phenomenal. i think there were like 16 types of fish to choose - all very fresh. clam chowder was the best i've had since being in boston. who would thought that you could have great chowder in the north side of chicago! prices are great for what you get. come before 6pm and you get the fish dinner special which comes with your choice of frish, red potatoes, vegetable, cup of soup AND salad. we utterly everything we have ever eaten there except the shrimp scampi (bit too much oil and breading on shrimp for my taste). make reservations since this place gets busy fast.
