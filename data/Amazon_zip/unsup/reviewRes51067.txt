Solid 5 stars in every area!! Food, atmosphere, service, everything. Get thee to Big Jones!! This was my second time at Big Jones and it was even better than my first experience. My fiance took me here for my birthday. Big Jones sent my a birthday card coupon for a free drink AND dessert, which I though was extremely generous. Our server, Andy, was completely fantastic. Informative, attentive, pleasant, and sweet. He really enhanced the total dining experience. I really dislike when servers give you attitude and/or aren't very informed about the food. Andy explained the specials in a way that made you want them. He also told us in advance that if I wanted the red velvet cake for dessert it might take 15 min bc they make it once you order it. I appreciated the heads up. The other service was excellent as well - we went on a busy Sat night and our water was constantly filled, silverware and napkins replaced, table washed. Very impressive. I had the crab cakes for starters and cannot say enough about them: light, almost fluffy, with slightly tangy sauce, these were perfection. My mom, fiance and I ordered the house ground burger, which was just as good as I remember it. The bun is truly the perfect weight and the meat is super fresh and high quality. My brother got the bbq pulled pork sandwich, which was also fantastic - had just a slight vinegar taste, in a good way. We had the red velvet cake for dessert with the homemade ice cream and the cake was perfectly crispy on the outside and warm in the middle. The homemade ice cream was to die for. I would describe it as buttercream ice cream? Super rich and creamy....nothing like store bought ice cream. Overall, this was the best birthday dinner ever!! We had so much fun and will definitely be back to try brunch and other items.
