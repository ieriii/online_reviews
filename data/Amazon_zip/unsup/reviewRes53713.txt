The food is great here! Delicious! I've gone several times and being Korean I was somewhat skeptical about the You So Crazy Korean Burrito but I have to say that the Seoul Sensation is exactly that...sensational! The chicken of course, especially the Wacky Wacky Wings, are awesome too. The BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces are my favorite. I've told many friends to try it and they have all liked it as well.  The owners were very friendly and helpful explaining the menus and they seem very invested in making sure that you will enjoy your meal there. Definitely will be returning to try out some of their other menu items. You have to go!
