I wanted to love Publican after hearing from various friends that it was the best restaurant that they've been to in awhile.  They raved about the pork rinds and the chicken. We ordered both the chicken and the pork rinds. Both were too salty. The chicken came with fries that seemed to be deep fried at least twice. We also ordered the potee which was moderate but the sausage was also extra salty and I couldn't balance it with the vegetables provided nor with the bread. I had to drink many glasses of water to clear my palate with these dishes. The only dish that was not overly salted was the greens.  The greens were delicous.  Sadly it was the only dish we enjoyed.
