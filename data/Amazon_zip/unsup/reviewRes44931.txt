This place serves my favorite thin crust and it's really the only place I get delivery pizza. It cheesy without being greasy and tastes yum. I've had the deep dish twice, and it's not my favorite at all. It's not bad, but it's just not my particular style. The crust is a slight bit dry and its like a brick of cheese. I've also had difficulty having twice been sent the wrong order. They made it right, though - I called and was given a credit for my next order. So, customer service is good at this place, which is ESSENTIAL. I'd suggest you try the deep dish for yourself and not listen to my opinion, because honestly it's good pizza - it's just not my style. For me, I'll continue ordering the thin crust every few weeks.
