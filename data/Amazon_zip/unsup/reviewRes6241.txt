Third time to try to write a review on yelp. if this doesn't work then forget it. We love Wildfire-they hosted our Rehearsal Dinner. We are out-of-towners and they handled all details and responded to phone calls and e-mails immediately. Food and service and quick turn-around on bar were excellent. We got so many compliments on our 55 person event. Pricing was reasonable as well.
