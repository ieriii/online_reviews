Went here on a friday night back in october. I had reservations at 6pm and it was crowded. The ambience of this place is one of the key factors I think why people go there. The server and host were very friendly and did not have to wait long to get the table. Prices are average, not overly expensive and the food tastes good. I would definitely go back here again. If you want to run into a celebrity, this might be the best place to, haha.
