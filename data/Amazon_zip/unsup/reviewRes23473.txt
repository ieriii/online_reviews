This is the only place I have eaten at in China Town, only because I am such a fan of Sichuan food. But, it is time to start branching out to other restaurants. Okay this time the service was pretty good, but the food was not what I was expecting. I ordered the orange beef tenderloins ($12.95, with rice). There is only one word different than the Sichuan beef tenderloins (recommended)! I saw a picture on the menu and I swear it did not look breaded!! At one point I was wondering if there was actually any meat inside the breading. For your average American tourist who likes the breaded stuff, he would have "never tasted anything so flavorful before" (5/21). I couldn't even finish it because the breaded garbage makes me feel queasy. I did find out though that once your order rice, you get an unlimited supply thereafter.
