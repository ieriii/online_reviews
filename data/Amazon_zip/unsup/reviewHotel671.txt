We picked this place for our one-year wedding anniversary, mainly because we're cheap and wanted to use my husband's points and Gold status to our advantage. I noted in the reservations what we were celebrating because I'm a glutton for free stuff- I can't help it! Everyone loves an anniversary...! Our check-in was smooth and they could not have been friendlier. I wish I remembered the names of the people we worked with, because they hooked us up with a room on the 23rd floor and a lake view, and when we got back from our night out on Friday, we found the front desk staff had sent up a really sweet card and piece of cake, congratulating us. So awesome! The attached Starbucks was super handy, the rooms were small but comfortable and we were central to everywhere we wanted to go- everything was a short walk away. One hiccup to our stay was housekeeping, we were gone Saturday from 10 am- 4:30 pm, and our room wasn't touched. They got us fresh towels as soon as we asked, and it's not like I make my bed at home, so this was a minor issue. Also, they had charged us for parking ($42 a day, W.T.F!!!!) even though we flew down. Whatevs, the cranky Sunday front desk woman eventually took care of the charge... she also messed up our late check out, but since I'm so kind and flexible, it wasn't an issue ;) This place is no frills and not cheap if you don't have points, but it seems reasonable enough for the location. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
