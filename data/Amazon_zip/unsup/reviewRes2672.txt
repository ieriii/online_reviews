I'm an avid Hot Doug's fan as I go biweekly (or try to). I have yet to branch out and splurge on the Alligator sausage or the duck sausage, but I stick with what I know. I always get The Paul Kelly (Brat) and the Sally Vega (Corn Dog). These are always accompanied by the glorious duck fat fries. One order is enough for two people (in my opinion). I love the decor and atmosphere. Doug is always the one who takes orders and it's nice to see that in the restaurant biz today. He is the nicest guy and runs a great restaurant. Standing in a long line is just part of the experience here and it is completely worth the great tasting food! They just expanded to now have outdoor seating so I look forward to using that in the Spring and Summer months. Make sure to look up the hours though because Doug tends to take long vacations and closes down shop. I promise, your time waiting in line will be worth the delicious food! MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CASH AS IT IS CASH ONLY.
