i think the entire south loop neighborhood comes here to brunch. ive never been here when it hasn't been packed. i'm not surprised because the food really does taste great. It's not mind blowing (my favorite breakfast/brunch place being m. henry, meli's cafe and overeasy) but i did enjoy my green eggs and ham. this is a solid place for breakast food, just brace yourself for a little wait at the door.
