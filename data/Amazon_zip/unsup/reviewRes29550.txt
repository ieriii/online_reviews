i came here with a sinus infection and a lost voice and ordered the tom yum with fish. too much information? possibly. the moat of soup that protects the fire beneath nearly broke all of congestion in my head. i cannot call it a miracle soup because my voice did not return to me.  my friend got papaya salad and crab ragoons. the salad was meh. but the ragoons were special, overstuffed with cream cheese and crab. unlike any i've ever seen. nearly the size of a chicken thigh. i want to say something like 8-10 of them also. too much for us to handle. beyonce and her children were like "can you handle this?" and didn't even let me answer before they interjected, "i don't think you can handle this."
