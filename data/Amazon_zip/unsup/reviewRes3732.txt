Went here and split a half chicken with someone and we got the Seoul Sassy and the BBQ sauces. If I remember correctly, I enjoyed the Seoul one much better, which was good, cause my companion preferred the BBQ. I would definitely come here again, though I probably wouldn't choose vegetables as a side since it's just pickled veggies. Fried mushrooms however are always a friend of mine.
