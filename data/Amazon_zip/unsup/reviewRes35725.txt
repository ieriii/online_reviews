WOWIE! Absolutely the best Beijing Duck ever! They have turned this non-menu item into a fun, fun event. Carved at your table...you can see the juice running down the sides of the perfectly cooked duck at precisely the same rate you are salivating to start eating it. At $32, it serves 4 and comes with soup, steamed buns and excellent fried rice. My wife and I did not feel the least bit guilty when we barely were able to slow ourselves down in order to take some home for just the two of us. Friendly service in a little bit of an industrial setting in this new location. We can't wait to go back!
