Wow, it's kind of sad how many folks on here are bitter over the fact that there are so many children there! Albeit I'm not a fan of a restaurant full of kids wreaking havoc, unless you're at an upscale restaurant downtown, it shouldn't really surprise you.  I've been here twice and carried out once. The Buffalo Nachos are where it's at. The second time I went, I was a little put off when the waitress snagged my salad plate without offering me a new one when my grilled cheese came considering I obviously had a small sampling of the salad bar. My carryout had cooked my burger far too rare but I ate it anyhow and it tasted great. I'd go back again. I will go back again.
