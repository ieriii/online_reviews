Why does this place has such high rating is beyond my understanding. Forgive me for only trying vegi dishes but everything was as if chef was fighting with his wife while making the food or something. So blend. If this place was on Devon, I would have given it 1-2 stars. On the bright side, 2 of us filled ourselves to neck for under $35.
