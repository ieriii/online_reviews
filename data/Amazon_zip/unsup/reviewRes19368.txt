Alright, I know I review a lot of sushi places, but this one takes the cake. BEST sushi I've had in a long time!! I have to agree with all of the reviews that claim the White Dragon roll is a must order. Pretty sure I'm going to dream about it.  The other highlight of our meal was the outstanding crab cake appetizer - not too crabby, not too messy.  Service is really great here. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly and made great recommendations for us first-timers. I was surprised by how crowded (although it's warranted!) Coast was on a weeknight so I'd recommend making a reservation on any night of the week.
