When it comes to places that are have been around for years, this place is mouthwatering. The fact that you have to systemically order and I still like this place says a lot. Great hot dogs done the Chicago way and tamales. Recommend trying at least once in your life if not more. An old time type in drive in where you park and wait for your food in your own little cubbyhole area.
