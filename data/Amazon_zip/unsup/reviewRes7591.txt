A carnivore's wet dream. Salad bar is good, but who would pay 20 bucks for cold veggies? It's all about the meats here. Yes, it does cost 50 bucks, but you can get your money's worth easily if you stick to the better meats. My favorites: Filet mignon, ribeye, lamb chops. But you'll have to decide on your own. Not only do they have amazing steaks and chops, they have very polite and attentive service. Waiters, managers, and guys-holding-skewers-of-meat constantly come along asking whether you would like anything else, any meats they can send your way, whether you'd like a fresh plate etc.
