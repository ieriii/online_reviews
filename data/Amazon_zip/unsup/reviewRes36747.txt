I love the breakfast here! I just went this weekend and the place was very cute inside. The bathroom was semi odd with one stall, small sink, but spacing was weird. The place was pretty full but there was no line during Friday noon. I loved the butter here along with the different jams for toast. The menu was huge and I would like to come back for lunch...but the breakfast menu was great. Most of the food were between $12-15 and they had great specials going on. We ended up getting 2 of the specials. I got the Pancetta omelet and though I am normally not a fan of goat cheese it was creamy and amazing with the omelet. I managed to eat the entire plate along with the potatoes (which were seasoned and a bit spicy..great combination that brings flavor to your breakfast). The portions are huge and you could easily stuff 3 people with 2 breakfast orders. There was also fruit (cantaloupe) included with the meal and the toast. I got the plain coffee which was very good!!! Normally I am pretty picky or just don't expect much from plain coffee but this place was great. Rach got the Lox benedict which she didn't finish but def attempted to eat a lot of it. It had salmon and was just huge. She got some kind of drink too...the top of the drink menu drinks are pretty small portion wise but the bottom can be split? It looked like a regular fruit smoothie with honey on the bottom. Not sure if it was worth it. The service was great and the waitress was nice, helpful, and pretty funny. The atmosphere was great and even though people are seated closely, it was pleasent and very enjoyable. This is probably my favorite breakfast place! The french toasts looked amazinggggg...the table next to us got that and basically cleaned off the plate (not sure if it involved licking it..since it was just that clean...)
