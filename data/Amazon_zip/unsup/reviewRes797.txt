I stopped reading somewhere between the 1694th and 1843rd review and I guess I'll just give you my take on things. Going to Hot Doug's is like going to see the Mona Lisa. You spend most of your day planning for the voyage, hoping for a spiritual experience, only to find something small and marginally interesting behind the velvet rope as you are fight your way through the crowds.  This guy is a genius. You go to any city in the US and say "I'm from Chicago" and people will say "ohh...Hot Doug's!" I don't know how he has been able to get the spin machine working but I think I needed to fend off at least three different Food Network crews while I was there at 1:48 on some random Tuesday. Excellent product but not culinary nirvana. Well prepared, well-conceived and well-crafted sausages. But it's a sausage, and if you or I made a sausage (even our first crack at making a sausage) it would taste 80% as good because it's just salty meat. Elk tastes like bison tastes like alligator tastes like pig tastes like turkey tastes like lips and assholes. The food is good. The line obviously adds mystique.  There is no magic here. I can't really offer any better options but if you want "Chicago Dog" go to Portillo's or, hell, Home Depot. I'm handicapping a 3.5 to 4 star meal with a huge BS factor (ala Kuma's Korner).
