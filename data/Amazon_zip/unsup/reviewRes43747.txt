Great for brunch and lunch any day of the week. Gets a little crowded on the weekend, but only because the food is insane. Great drinks selection and their paninis are mouth-watering. Their bright interior makes you feel wholesome and warm inside. I love this place. The only downer is the setup with the line building right outside the door through the seating area, and the space runs tight. Worth the wait, best brunch on Division.
