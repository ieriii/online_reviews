I've been looking forward to coming here for years now, and I can finally say that I've had great, upscale Mexican food! Don't get me wrong, Central Ohio has tons of great, authentic Mexican restaurants, but not any good upscale Mexican eateries. We had the 3 ceviche's the chicken mole, braised goat, and Tlacoyos de Tocino. I've had better ceviche, and I'm not a huge fan of most mole sauces, but the corn cakes and goat were totally and utterly amazing. The service once seated was decent, but the receptionist/host was a little cold and matter of fact. I tried to make reservations earlier in the day, but they said I had to show up in person 1-1.5 hours before hand to put my name in. When I showed up around 5:45, it was a 2 hour wait, so plan accordingly.
