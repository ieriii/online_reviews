made a weekend trip to chicago a couple of weeks ago and my sister took us to this restaurant, and boy this place was packed! our reservation was at 7 and we waited 30mins to get to our table. other than that, this place is amazing! For the drinks: i love their red sangria, we also tried the coconut mojitos which were BOMB. their frozen white sangria was very good as well, it was a lot stronger than the regular red sangria which i LOVE. lol For the food: as far as the food, we didn't wana order the big plate entrees so we ordered pretty much everything on their appetizer menu. the ropa vieja was very popular on our table, the braised beef melts in your mouth, just delish. however the ceviche was my favorite! we tried 3 out of the 5 types of ceviche and the hiramasa was my favorite. we also tried the pork adobo and we weren't disappointed as well. it was very flavorful, almost like the filipino adobo that i'm used to. :) The dessert was the best part! we had the carnivale ice cream cake. it has three layers -- Mango, guava and pistachio ice cream. it also has the chocolate ganache, pineapple, raspberry and dotted mint sauce all around. AMAZING. very happy with this place. i'll make sure i come back here next time i visit chicago.
