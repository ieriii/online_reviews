Eh. Leave it to the wound up yuppies and Lincoln Park trixies who want to kiss chef Dale's ass. The food was imaginative, I'll give it that. The vegetables tasted like mud. The menu was altogether pretentious and intentionally non- discript. Don't bother going if you are actually a vegan or vegetarian, they failed at accommodating my lovely wife. Its called sprout wtf? I found the wait staff adorable, however.
