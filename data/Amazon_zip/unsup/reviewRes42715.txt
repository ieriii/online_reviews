I had finally tried their an Art of Pizza, pizza, which their art, The pizza had onions, green bell peppers, sausage, and cheese and pizza sauce on a deep dish crush, and it was vey good. Art of pizza is a place I recommend to anyone who wants to try a new deep-dish-pizza joint. I like it better than Gino's East, but not better than Ricobenes or Lou's. The prices are very affordable and you'll it they have a calm relaxing atmosphere.
