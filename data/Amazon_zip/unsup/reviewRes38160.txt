I found this place while walking up and down the "Magnificent Mile" in search for a place to eat. Turns out this was the same place our native Chicago friend told us to check out for true Chicago-style deep dish pizza. I have to say, I was not disappointed. The deep dish takes about 35 mins to bake so we shared a Greek salad while we waited. We were also able to try Chicago's very own Goose Island beers which was cool. The pizza (sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms) was deelish! A small was enough for 2-3 people to share, depending on how hungry you are. We weren't able to finish our small (too much beer!) which I regret since you can't get pizza like that in New York!
