The food rocked. Went when 4 adults 2 kids. There really is nothing on the menu for kids. That's ok, think this is not a place for kids. All the adult meals were flavorful, sandwich type stuff. We really enjoyed the food. We had some nut appetizer that was spicy and fit well with what the restaurant is supposed to be about. We had the hot chocolate deal....very thick, chocolatey. It was very rich and sweet. You have to know what your are getting to appreciate it.  My only compliant is the layout of the place. It really is horrible. Hard to maneuver around to a place to sit, cramped, really bad. Music is too loud.
