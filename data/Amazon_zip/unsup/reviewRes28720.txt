Just tried this place for the first time with delivery. We read a ton of reviews beforehand so ordered the dishes recommended. However, we took our chances with one Curry dish that hadn't been recommended and, as expected, it was the only one not that great. We ordered: 1) Lard Nar Talay- Great flavor and big chuncks of seafood. The noodles were a little greasy though, so I'll probably request a thinner, lighter noodle next time 2) Moo Ping- Amazing! Pork skewers with a tasty, spicy light sauce. Good size, about 6-7 skewers 3) Gaeng Pa- $96 of the Thai Curries- Just ok, not much of a flavor.  Overall, the food was a step up from most Thai take-out. The portions aren't huge though, so don't skimp on ordering.
