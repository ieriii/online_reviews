This place is pretty good for a chain type restaurant. Just had a work seminar/lunch there today. Good chopped salad. The cedar plank salmon was great. I like the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. Desserts can be skipped. The cheesecake was quite flavorless but they offer sauces to put on it. In the past I've tried the steaks which are average. If you are in River North, there are way too may places to go for better steak. Due to location lots of tourists and people with gift certificates as everyone I know seems to get a LEYE certificate around the holidays from someone.
