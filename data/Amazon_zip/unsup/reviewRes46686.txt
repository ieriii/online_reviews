I've been here a few times, and none of them were good experiences. I've been for brunch (not a good idea) and dinner. We had a lettuce entertain you gift card which is one of the reasons we went back. Every time we come here the wait is forever, the service is terrible and the food is "meh". And if you are super lucky to get seated right by the salad bar/brunch bar you will never ever want to eat from it. I people watch, and watching those people has grossed me out.
