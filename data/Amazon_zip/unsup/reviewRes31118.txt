I was excited when I heard about this place because even though I'm not a vegetarian, I do choose vegetarian options whenever I eat out. I even picked out what I wanted from the online menu before actually coming. However, once I got there, the experience was pretty bad. Firstly, the waiter was borderline rude and just plain uninterested. He never refilled our waters and didn't even bring out our food--I think it was the busboy who did. I mean, I know it's a diner concept, but still, I expect a decent level of service. Secondly, the food was really bland and unexciting. I eat tons of vegetarian food, and there is no excuse for it to be lacking in flavor or creativity. I had the sweet potato quesadilla..I can't remember what my friend had but it was equally forgettable. People seem to rave about the quesadilla but I couldn't even finish it. I wanted to try a dessert but I was so put off by the food that I just wanted to leave. There are tons of other vegetarian spots to hit up in Chicago that are ten times better than this place--I mean, you can find a vegetarian dish on practically every menu of every restaurant in this city, and it's probably ten times better than what you can get here. Stay away.
