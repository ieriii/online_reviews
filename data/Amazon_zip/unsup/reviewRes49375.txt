Hands down the best bakery in Chicago! I love them. I'm a wholesale customer and re-sell their treats for catering and in my cafe. I can't tell you how wonderful these people are. I have had several occasions where I needed something last minute or I totally forgot to place an order and Peter or Mitchell always hook me up. Always. Their pastries and cakes are divine and my customers always ask where we buy them. I've never had a bad experience with them and will continue to use them as a supplier. Thanks Alliance, you're the absolute best.
