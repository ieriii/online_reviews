I really enjoy this place. The service is always top notch and the food is as fresh as it gets. I also appreciate the wine list a unique assortment of great wines... My favorite being the Twisted Oak &$@!.  The mac and cheese is a must and the ravioli. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a great date spot.
