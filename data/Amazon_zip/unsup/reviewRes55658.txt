WOW...I was very impressed with Glenn's. We went on a Tuesday for the All-you-can-eat crab leg special. The legs were as big as my arm...I think they made money on me, because 3 was my limit, THEY ARE HUGE!!! And, the service was great, they were very attentive to when we needed more legs, a refill of a drink, etc. Very good place.
