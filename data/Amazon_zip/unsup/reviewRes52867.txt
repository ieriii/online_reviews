Finally I am ready to write a review. I have been at this place for four times. Food is just ...OK! The meat and fish taste like low quality food. The prices are too high for the food quality they offer!!!! Service is good and atmosphere relaxing especially in summer time when the outside sitting is available. I will not come back soon!!
