This place is fantastic! My husband and I love Italian food, and my husband has spent some time in Italy, so sometimes it is difficult finding authentic Italian food. This place definitely delivered! They even had Ribolita on the menu, which we had never seen on any menu in the US. The service is excellent, too! Our waiter was so nice and helpful, and when we showed up early for our reservation, they seated us right away.
