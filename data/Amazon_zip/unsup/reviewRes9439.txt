Ordered from Le Colonial via Dining In because they explicitly offer gluten free versions of a number of menu items - specifically, I ordered a gluten free chicken salad. Almost immediately became EXTREMELY ill. When I called to inquire about the item, they first attempted to claim that the questionable crispy topping was fresh garlic. Seriously? Eventually, they admitted that they topped my supposedly gluten free salad with "crispy fried shallots." This item is not listed as an ingredient on either the gluten free salad or regular version of that salad. I would never eat anything labeled "crispy fried" - the chance of that being gluten free is remote. The manager I spoke to about the problem said he needed to speak to the kitchen, and that he'd try to get around to that late tonight. Sure. Long story short, if you're gluten free, don't expect to get food that won't make you sick from Le Colonial. Not only did they have no clue what was in their food, but they clearly don't understand the concept of gluten free.
