What can I say that the 180 reviews before me hasn't already said? I just want to add in my five stars to the list. This place is so tasty. My favorite dish of all the dishes we ordered was the octopus salad. It had a very complex flavor. I could taste so many levels of sweet and tangy and salty and even a little fruity. The texture was marvelous. I wish I hogged it all up from my boyfriend. I also had a surprising cocktail with rosemary flavoring. It was very good. The plume of rosemary filled my olfactory senses with every sip. The other dishes were fantastic too. I even appreciated the pasta (although I am still not a pasta fan.) Order the octopus.
