This is a really cool, very chill place. I came here with friends for a drink. You absolutely have to be in the mood for a very chill, very quiet time. The drinks were very creative and good. Our waitress was so nice. Her name was Aubree I believe. I had no idea what I wanted to drink but told her I wanted vodka and something sweet and she told me about this off the menu drink that was absolutely fantastic. I'll definitely be back.
