Call ahead and reserve not a table, but a duck. If you haven't tried it yet, you don't want to go in and find that they ran out. The restaurant is recognizable from all the roast ducks they hang by the window... so you just have to try one. The Peking duck dinner is $37 for a whole roast duck, carved in front of the diners and served in three stages: 1) The duck skin and meat are carved and laid out on a plate. Add these to the steamed bun wraps along with scallions and carrot pieces. 2) The rest of the duck meat is made into a fried rice dish. 3) The remaining bones are made into a soup with winter melon and cilantro. Crispy skin, tender succulent meat, and they serve $4 beers. I'm used to wraps that are more like pancakes, but nothing wrong with their slightly sweet steamed bun wraps. They also give you some radish as a side dish and sherbet for desert - sour stuff helps all the food go down. Your clothes will smell like food afterwards but it will be well worth it. You'll likely have some leftovers too.
