I went on the first night because my boyfriends lives two blocks away. Just the two of us showed up and got a table for two. It was really packed being the first night. The servers and host quickly and nicely helped us. As we were sitting two of his roommates called and said they were coming. We told the staff and they said they would find us table for four right away. While we were sitting waiting for our friends 4 of our other friends decided to come by. This caused even more chaos for the staff and they graciously helped us with no problem. The food was good. Im not a meat person, so I got a great salad. There wasn't an option for anything vegetarian, even in the salads, so I got it with out. I asked about it later, and they said since it was only the start, they were starting out with less on the menu and adding later. I have no doubt after the comment I put on the comment sheet and this, that they will add one ASAP. They seemed eager for constructive criticism. All and all, we will be back again. Its great to have something fun in Ukrainian Village.
