This is truly my favorite sushi spot in Chicago. The fish is fresh and the prices are reasonable. Why I love it so much is that it is always consistent. Whether I am dining out or ordering in it always tastes great. When dining in the atmosphere is "trendy" (I really hate using this term) without being pretentious. For example, I took my mom here tonight and she loved it. She didn't feel out of place at all. I think it is a place for everyone. When ordering in (same with Ping Pong), I feel like Martha Stewart has packed up my order. Everything is so neat and tidy and in the cutest containers. I know it's nerdy, but the littlest things go a long way. Hands down my go to sushi restaurant.
