I've only ever been here for Sunday poetry slams, but I've always had an awesome time. This place has turned me on to poetry!!! Drinks are expensive, and I'm also under the belief that they only except American express . . . good for me, maybe not so good for others. I bring all my first time Chicago visitors here for the slam!
