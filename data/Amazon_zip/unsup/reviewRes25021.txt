Feeling sick? Head over to Artopolis and try some of their Traditional Soup! This chicken and rice soup has a lemon flavor that will wipe away any cold or flu. Ok, maybe not wipe it out, but I bet it makes you feel better. Need a pick me up in the morning? Try one of their almond croissants. Eat it fresh to enjoy the gooey custard-like filling while retaining the flaky outer crust. I can also recommend their selection of high quality teas! Other than that though, I am pretty much meh on this place. It's confusing when you walk in. Which counter do I approach? (There are three.) Who is going to help me? I always seem to be there during an off-time which probably doesn't help. It's cute that they have the craft and grocery section in the back. You can also find all kinds of baskets with items for sale too. Some over priced, some fun. I'm just not convinced. What can I say?
