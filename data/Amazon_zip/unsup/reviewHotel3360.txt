I have some mixed emotions about the esSEX inn (juvenile, I know, but it makes me laugh). It was in a great location, walking distance from Millennium Park and some other sites. And I guess for the price, I shouldn't have expected much. The first night teh boy and I stayed in our own single room. It was nice and cozy (and by cozy I mean really small).  The rest of our stay in Chicago we were in a bigger room with a few other friends. And the air conditioner started leaking. We let the front desk know, but nothing was done about it. By the third day, the carpet was soggy. It squished when you walked on it. No big deal if you could avoid it, but there were five of us in the room (one sleeping on the floor) so not a whole lot of room to maneuver around the marsh.  The windows in the room were kind of scary too. We pretty high up and the windows near the floor just open right up to the sky. No screens or anything. Good thing we didn't have a baby toddling around or it might have toddled right out onto Michigan Avenue! The elevators were on the fritz during our stay as well. Only some of the buttons would work, so if you were on one of the floors that it didn't feel like going to, you had to go past it and walk down a flight or two. The restaurant and bar were a joke, but I guess ok in a pinch. If you want a drink, I suggest going to the Hilton next door. I sort of hold the esSEX inn close to my heart because it was so awful and just made our trip to Chicago that much more memorable and entertaining.
