don't get their congee....it was pretty bad. it wasn't cooked look enough to get the rice to break up into mush, so basically I was just eating rice in hot water. I've had thier Pho many times and it's always pretty decent. i do like their summer rolls though with shrimp.  probably the best Pho in the area....but doesn't compare to the Pho I used to get in LA and DC.
