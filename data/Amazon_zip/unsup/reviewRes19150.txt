Stumbled into the Gage for an early dinner after sightseeing in Millenium Park. Place was empty around 5p when we walked in. I've always wanted to try this place and it did not disappoint. Started the shrimp appetizer, which was TO-DIE-FOR! Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce had a slight kick to it that really brightens the dish. Friend did a rabbit arugula salad which was equally well-done, rabbit was melt-in-your-mouth tender and flavorful. For entrees I had the salmon, which was again cooked to just the right temperature. My only complaint was that the corn relish on top tasted a bit too sweet, almost like canned corn. The other two entrees were elk (!!) and the lamb tenderloin, both were also excellent. All-in-all, a very satisfactory meal. Can't wait to go back!
