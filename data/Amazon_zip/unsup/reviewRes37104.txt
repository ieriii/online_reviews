Hopleaf is the place to go for beer drinkers. I regretfully didn't try the food, but I plan on returning because what I saw coming out of the kitchen looked AMAZING. Pros: - Incredible beer selection (30+ drafts, 250+ bottles) - Good, friendly service - Laid back, casual atmosphere Cons: - No reservations = long waits (for a table) - Kind of cramped inside when its busy Great place to take beer snobs or your casual beer drinking buddies.
