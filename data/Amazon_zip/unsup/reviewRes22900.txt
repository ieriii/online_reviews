Good food. Way over priced. The only thing I get here is . . . Wait for it . . . The shrimp basket?!?!? Yes, it's amazing! The burgers and hot dogs are standard and the fries are good, but you can get this kind of "Chicago-style"stuff in a lot of other places on the north side of chicago for way cheaper- and faster.
