Salad bar is better than Texas de Brazil, IMO. Lamb chops, grilled pineapple, and the beef ribs were the best. Read a lot of complaints about the food being salty, so I was honestly a bit apprehensive before going. Was pleasantly surprised to find that this wasn't this case. If anything, I felt as though the some of the cuts were slightly bland. Did not have to make a reservation on a Friday night. While this was nice, I'm afraid this says something about this place... usually restaurants are hustlin' and bustlin' Friday evenings. When it comes to Brazilian meats, I'm afraid Fogo de Chao can't be beat.
