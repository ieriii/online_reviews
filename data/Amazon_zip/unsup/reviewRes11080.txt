If you're a whore for service like me, then you will love this place! The service by Geraldine was nothing more than fantastic. She was quick, efficient, informed and just all around nice. This was my first time there and certainly not my last. I love the interior, I could move out the tables and live in the space. It has a good feel and if you sit in a booth with your friends there is SO much room for like no double 10 people! The food is delicious. We had quite an array of food at my table. There was nothing on the table that we didn't think was stellar. We had the following: I had the Breakfast Burrito with chicken sausage and lots of creamy guacamole. The salsa is delicious too! We shared: *red velvet pancakes My friends had: *pretzel pancakes *apple something french toast *traditional eggs and bacon We were all more than happy. They serve Intelligentsia coffee too; which is malicious! I work in a hotel downtown and I recommended The Bongo Room today to a guy going to meet someone on a date. He came back and said it was awesome. He had some time restraints with travel, etc and he told them up front and they made sure he got in and out in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend The Bongo Room.  Cheers!
