Decent, but definitely not worth more than 3 stars. There was a lot of food for the price, since I went on a Monday night when they have a really nice discount on their family-style meal, but the food overall wasn't anything to write home about. I don't see myself going back any time soon. Also, I'm not sure what all the fuss is over the pumpkin ravioli. Yeah, it's unique, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good.
