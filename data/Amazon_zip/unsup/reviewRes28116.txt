Overall, a good Mexican restaurant. I had the Beef Tongue dipped in egg and fried and that was arguably the best dish among the four of us. The carne (skirt steak) my wife and daugter had was thin and crisp, but not all that tasty. Several dipping sauces for the tortilla's. Cash only here. A long line to get it, but it moves quickly. With so many other Mexican restaurants higher rated on Yelp, it may be another decade before I return here, but Nuevo Leon will still be here when I do.
