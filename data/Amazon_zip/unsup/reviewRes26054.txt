Damn good deep dish pizza. Got a sausage pizza and it was delicious. Caramelized crust added another level of flavor. Crusty was nice and buttery and crisp too. Also got wings which were great. I ate all of them so I was full before eating the pizza. I don't eat that much deep dish because I love thing crust so much, but I think I could fit Pequods into my weekly eating schedule.
