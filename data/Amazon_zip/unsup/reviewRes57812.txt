I wandered in here for breakfast one day, and lived to regret it. Nothing against the waitstaff, but the food was worse than mediocre, and the prices were extortionist.I ordered the tofu scramble, which came with tortillas, black beans (tasted like they were straight out of a can) and veggie chorizo (again, straight out of the package, by flavor). At one point, I asked for extra corn tortillas. Big mistake. When I got the bill, those two tortillas cost me $2. Seriously? $2 for two corn tortillas? No restaurant has even ever charged me for extra tortillas before, they're so cheap. At Cermak, you could get 40 tortillas for $2... And, speaking of extortion, the bottomless, diner-quality coffee is $3. What if you just want a small coffee? Too bad, you will still pay $3, and there's no decaf available. The tofu scramble itself was pretty terrible. It was tofu and sad, overcooked vegetables, nothing else, no spices, no flavor. I expected the chef at Nana to be a better cook than me, but I was wrong. The menu stated the veggies would be seasonal, and since it's still winter, I assumed that would be stuff that keeps in a cellar (root vegetables, onions) and stuff that can grow in the cold a bit south of here (spinach, chard, other early greens). But no, in mid-March, Nana's idea of a seasonal vegetable is a sad hothouse tomato. So, to sum it up: if you want to be charged $18 plus tip for diner coffee, crappy tofu scramble, canned beans, and two tortillas, Nana is the place for you.
