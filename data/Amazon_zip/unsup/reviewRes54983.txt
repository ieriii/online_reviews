Right on, Matt B. I took my wife here for her birthday this past June. What a mistake. I can't even remember the fare, all I remember is that it was inferior to what we've eaten at Everest, Alinea, Blackbird, Bistro Campagne, etc.  What I do remember is that the jerk who served us (who I understand is also the chef/owner) scoffed at our decision to arrive sans wine (wife was pregnant), perhaps concluding that we were unsophisticated, one-time tourists. The rest of the evening, his service was at best standoffish, as if it was a nuisance to deal with us.  Does he think he's such a great culinary artiste that he doesn't need to treat his customers with warmth and courtesy? In a town teeming with Mozarts, he is a Salieri.
