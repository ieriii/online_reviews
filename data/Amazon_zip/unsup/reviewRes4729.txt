This place is amazing! Very fun, lively atmosphere. Our server was the best, I forget her name but she was a very down to earth Spanish girl. We got roasted corn with pickled mushrooms to start, it was alright. It's served cold which caught us off guard but we still managed to eat every last kernel. We also got the fried pigs ear and HOLY CRAP!!!! That was super good. You have got to get it if you go. I got the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes, don't be fooled..it's a super small portion so make sure if you're interested in that for dinner, get an appetizer just for yourself. Love the purple pig!
