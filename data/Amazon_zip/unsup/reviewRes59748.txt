If your looking for a good piece of pizza or some pasta this is the place to go. I just moved in down the street and my roomates and myself eat here 3 times a week. Their daily specials are unbelievable! $7.50 for a HUGE chicken parm with spaghetti, $2.50 meatball sandwiches, $5.50 meat ravioli and the best part is they all come with soup or salad. It's not going to be the best you ever had but I assure you its very tasty and well worth the money.
