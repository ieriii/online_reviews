i eat like a king here for $6. this. place. is. so. f'g. good! i made the mistake ONCE of going to albany park for a falafel sandwich and i died a little. it was no where close to the magic that is sultan's.  you walk in, there's a huge bar full of amazingness, and then closer to the counter (CASH ONLY - be ready) you can custom order hot foods/whatever you want. oh my god. i can't even explain what their spinach pies do to me. also the lentil soup. i can't even explain over yelp. there are not enough letters on this keyboard. they also have these huge, wonderful vegan cookies at the register for $1 filled with dates. come come come... you will not be disappointed.
