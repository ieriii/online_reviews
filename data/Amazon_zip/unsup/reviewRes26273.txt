I've loved this place since they opened over 15 years ago and miss the days when you could walk in any day of the week and get a table. I don't subscribe to the theory that Chicago has a "best" pizza because there are simply too many good pizzas out there - not to mention too many types of pizzas. But I will tell you one thing for sure, of all the pizza I've had (and my cholesterol levels will attest to the fact that I have had a lot), Pequod's is my hands down favorite. Is it the caramelized cheese? is it the spice blend they put on the top? is it the fresh ingredients? great service? I don't know, but for many many years now I, my extended family and friends have been coming here to celebrate many birthdays, showers, graduations, etc., and will continue to do so until we are able to.  LOVE this place!
