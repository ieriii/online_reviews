Wear your Ray-Bans... Smile broadly... Clap your hands to the rhythm... Now look up and sway your head...yeah you got it... "Do I do, what I do, when I do...my love for baklava...all right." After a hearty slab of braised lamb at the Parthenon Restaurant next door, I felt like oh you know...something sweet. The moment I saw "Bakery" in the name, I knew they would have a big display case of baked Greek goodies. Ah, there it is...the baklava. I sat myself down thinking I could eat a sliver, but I got a whole hunka of Almond Baklava for $3.75 (see photo). It was so puckery sweet that my molars started to ache from all the sugar. It was so lip-smacking good that I started channeling Stevie Wonder... Yes I got some almond kisses for my lips Yes I got some honey-syrup, phyllo-flaking kisses full of love for me Yes I got some almond kisses for my lips Yes I got some honey-syrup, phyllo-flaking kisses full of love for me... Listen to Stevie for yourself...I swear he's talking about baklava: http://www.youtube.com/w BAKLAVA - 4 stars....diabetic coma ahead...o-pah! AMBIANCE - 4 stars...more than a bakery...a bright, clean cafe SERVICE - 4 stars...ah, the happy denizens of Greektown TOTAL - 4 stars...yes I got some honey-syrup, phyllo-flaking kisses full of love for me
