Milk and Honey! Bring your out-of-towners here if they want to feel city-like. Totally yuppie-central, love when the patio opens up and there is more seating. I've only ever had the breakfast menu-items here. The Huevos Rancheros: The perfect combination of beans, tomatoes, yummy eggs with a layer of cheese on top in a ramekin. It's actually a large portion when you puncture the golden cheese baked on top! I can share this with my boyfriend and get a side of something else and be perfectly satisfied for breakfast. Totally my default here! The Egg Panini Sammich; My mom gets this every time, again: they do something with the scrambled eggs here that makes them delectable and a good consistency. The Yogurt and Granola: Homemade Granola is delicious, I just kind of felt weird that the fruit was pre-mixed into the yogurt. Maybe it's just personal preference and It is March, so the fresh fruit isn't as yummy as during the summer, but i feel that they could just put the fruit on the side instead of me guessing what I'm eating (I think it was apples?) Overall, great for weekend brunch!!
