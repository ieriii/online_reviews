Honestly, Sprout is our favorite restaurant in the city. We eat out at "fancy" restaurants about once a month. Every place we go inevitably gets measured against our current favorite, Sprout. So far, no one has quite measured up. Every aspect of dinner at Sprout is perfect. The portion sizes, the flavors, the service, all top notch. We have probably been 5 times in the last 14 months, my only complaint is the menu doesn't change as often as we'd like. That's probably our fault for going as often as we do. The 3 course prix fixe menu is the way to go, they bring you a couple of extra goodies. My favorite entree is the Short Rib, which unfortunately I haven't seen on the menu in a while. If you like fig, the fig dessert will blow you away. It's still my favorite dessert anywhere Sprout is laid back, relatively cheap, and just an awesome experience. Every person we've taken has said the same.
