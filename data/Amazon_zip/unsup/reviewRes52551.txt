1 star for the coulette. 1 star for the black pepper filet. That's about it, out of 15-20 meat offerings. All the other cuts were simply ok or not good at all. Everything in the salad bar was just ok as well, and the price (50-60 a person) is most definitely not worth it for a place that is, again, just ok. If trying different cuts of mediocre meat in an attempt to broaden your carnivorous horizons is your thing, then Brazzaz might be for you. If you want something, anything, better than mediocre, go elsewhere.
