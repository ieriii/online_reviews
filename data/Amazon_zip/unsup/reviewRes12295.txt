Crowed, loud and waited to long to be seated. Also waiter looked unhappy. I wanted to give him a hug. but it's a pizza joint and the beer was awesome. Love love the worri'n ale was the best beer i have tasted in my whole entire life. I actually only picked for it's name and was so happy i totally didn't mind the loudness. Also the waiter knew his beers when i asked about the other beers he would recommend i was impress by his knowledge (i think i even cracked a smile out of him) The golden arm ended up being a great recommendation. As for pizza I was disappointed with their pepperoni. The crust is good but the actual meat not so good. The white pizza awesome, love the garlic. We also had sausage and some other veggie, also very good. This place is a good place to bring friends you haven't seen for a long time, and really don't know what they are really into anymore and want to keep the conversation to a min. But still have a good drink and pizza.
