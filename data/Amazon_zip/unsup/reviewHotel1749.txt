This is a great hotel which is rather unique. The big CON is they have small rooms. It's a renovated older hotel so its not like they designed it this way to begin with but it was rather tight. I, for one, don't mind since I rarely stay in my room that long... I am a up and about type person. For some people, this is a big deal since they need a large room. Don't let that deter you though. The staff here is great. Very helpful, very service minded. They mailed a post card for me an gave me an umbrella when I asked where I could buy one. My friend got upgraded to a suite because they made a small mistake. These are good service minded people. I like the decor but it could be a bit much for some people who like a more traditional feel (Kimpton hotels are mostly like this though, its their thing). As other people have mentioned, they have wine every day for an hour or so. Really really really cool of them. It's also a good way to meet other guests. If you get a deal on this hotel... I'd say check it out.
