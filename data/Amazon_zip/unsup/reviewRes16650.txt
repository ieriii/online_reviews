Agree with the fact of why oh why this place doesn't have the name posted? We walked a block off passed it - just to find out that we passed this well *hidden* place.  OK - the inside .. it's .. different. They have the weirdest, tallest, most uncomfortable chairs. It made me feel like a gnome sitting on it. The ambiance is not too bad. I like their idea of 'separating' the sitting areas and the standing up bar area with the curtain.  They have a good selection of mixed drinks - and that's what we went here for, nothing else. Will I be back? Ummm .. maybe not. But I enjoyed it (the drink mostly :P) while I was there.
