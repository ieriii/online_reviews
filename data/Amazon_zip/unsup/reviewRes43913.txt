My bf will say this was the best steak dinner he's had- But I think I've tasted a few more then he has! Then again, even I admit I was pretty impressed with Kinzie's. Our waiter eagerly performed the song and dance of the different steak sizes- all vacuumed up into tight plastic. But it was interesting, and with our sudden knowledge we chose the porterhouse... good choice, perfect for sharing. The sides were delicious- mushroom risotto! I've been to Gene & Georgetti's- and yes, the steak was awesome. But in fairness to Kinzie's, there's is pretty amazing too!
