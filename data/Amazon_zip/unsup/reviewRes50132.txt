A real gem. Over the last 1-2 years, I've had brunch, dinner and drinks/snacks here maybe 6 times. Almost everything has been satisfying and unique.  Love their focus on pickles and charcuterie, love their baking, love what they do with greens, love their whiskey of the month club/cocktails/whiskey list. Most of all, I love that they do interesting food that is also fun and delicious.
