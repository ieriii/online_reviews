To die for food. You don't know what to expect from this place looking at the outside. Inside it is very cozy, inviting and vibrant with laughter.  I had the asiago tortellini. It was so rich and delicious, the kind of food you dream about. My husband had the lemon chicken, and it was yummy, also. My friend had the chicken parmigiana, and said it was very good. Wonderful food. Would definitely go back!!
