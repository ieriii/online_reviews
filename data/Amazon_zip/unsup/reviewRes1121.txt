What more is there to say...I stood in line for an hour in November (and I'm from California now...it was COLD), ran down the street to the nearest ATM for cash, just to sample these sausages. And it was worth it. Yummy "encased meats". Friendly folks. Mama Marie and i shared like 4 of them. Go with a friend, try lots. It's delicious.
