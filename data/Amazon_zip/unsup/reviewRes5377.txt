Wow - I was completely blown away by The Purple Pig. We ate outside, with a lovely view of Chicago. The servers here are fantastic - they actually seem grateful every time you order! They brought out our orders promptly every time, and it's no big deal to order a few things, eat, then order some more. You might not have the same server for every dish, but it doesn't really matter. Of course, the food was what truly shined. The roasted beets (goat cheese! pistachios!) and morcilla were my favorites, but you'd be hard-pressed to find a dish that isn't full of delightful flavor combinations or elegantly presented. The cheese comes with toasted bread and a tomato-grape jam that paired nicely. I didn't really care for the fried prosciutto bread balls, but everything else was fantastic. You'll leave satisfied but not stuffed, which is the way eating should be, right?
