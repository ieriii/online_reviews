[2011.09.30] First off the service was excellent. My water glass was always filled which goes along way in my book. We started off with the Guacamole "Kleiner Style" which came with freshly fried chips had great flavor. This guac had a good garlic taste and had chunks of avocado. We tried the Ropa Vieja (braised beef) on recommendation from all the reviews we read; I'm glad we did. The combination of the braised beef and sweet plantains complimented each other. The sleeper dish, my favorite of the night was the Arepa (Berkshire pork). The pork was tender and had great flavors with the other ingredients. For the main course I shared the Costilla de Res (Braised short rib). The beef was extremely tender and fell apart in my mouth. The cheese polenta which came with the dish a rich creamy taste to the short rib. I would definitely come back here again.
