Sultan's is fantastic! This coming from a girl who didn't like falafel until she tried it at Sultan's Market. I'm also a fan of their kefta kabob and chicken shawerma. Their food is fresh and tasty. The quality is superb and consistent. The prices are more than reasonable, they're downright cheap. $3.75 for the best falafel in Chicago? Yes, please. If' you're not into falafel or pita, Sultan's also offers their sandwiches as meals: your choice of meat served over rice or lentils with hummus, Jerusalem salad, and a fresh pita on the side. The meals are also delicious and well priced.
