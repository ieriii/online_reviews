Skip the pizza, go straight for their beer. If I were rating this place solely on their beers, I'd give it 5 stars. Their pizza is just above average (and quite over-priced) in my opinion but the real standout is their house-brewed beers. Despite the corny, sometimes sexist names of their beers, they arguably make some of the best beer I've ever tasted. Their IPAs (Cap'n Kick Ass, Cameltoe, Wingnut) are exceptional, super hoppy and full of flavor. You will be hard pressed to find tastier ones anywhere. They also have a nice range of other beers on tap. I especially like that they have 3Floyds Alpha King and Gumballhead. A diverse selection of Belgiums can also be found on tap and in bottles. I often love to go to Goose Island because they have many different beers to sample from, but they rarely have anything tastier than Piece's IPAs.
