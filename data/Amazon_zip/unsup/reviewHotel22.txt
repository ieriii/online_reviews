Stayed here over the Jan 15th weekend. The location is perfect! Close to Michigan Avenue, train and of course Giordano's. Inviting entrance to the hotel with a canopy with heat lamps when you walk up. The elevator is small and a little rickety but it does the job. I would bring your own towels as the hotel ones are a bit scratchy. Didn't encounter the hotel staff much, just at check in/out -they were polite. I would stay again when in town.
