A friend brought us when we were visiting, and I loved it. We had some fantastic white pizzas and some even more fantastic beers and I seriously could have hung out there all day. It was a Saturday and totally busy, but we were after lunch a little bit, so we didn't have to wait. I know it's not Chicago style and some people find it boring, but the amazing combination of beer and pizza here really hits it home, and it was one of the most enjoyable pizza-eating experiences I've ever had.
