i'm sorry, have i offended you by....placing an order?! have i inconvenienced you in some way by....being a customer? i'm over the service here. this restaurant is run by apathetic kids with bad attitudes and too much flannel. i like the physical space, i like the food but the service is ridiculous. last time i went for brunch, my waitress looked like she was half asleep and appeared to be completely hassled by our order. and the servers kept walking around, filling up everyone's coffee around us but mine! don't these people know who i am?!?!?! i'm nobody! but i still want good service...
