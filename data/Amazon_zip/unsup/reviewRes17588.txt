Fresh off the train from Midway, I stopped by India House for dinner not knowing that the food would nearly put me out of commission for two days. The tandoori plate and the curry were fine (and I'm a big fan of Indian food) but I was nauseous all night. Weirdly enough, the food I took back with me sat on the counter for three days and didn't emit any odor. Makes you wonder.
