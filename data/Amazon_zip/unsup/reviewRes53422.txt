What can I say about Doug's that everyone else hasn't already said? It's amazing! I've been going for around 2 years now (minus that 7 month stint I lived in Brooklyn) and I'm so happy to see how popular the restaurant has gotten. (Not to mention wildly jealous that he hung out with Anthony Bourdain.)The long lines are a drag but it gives you plenty of time to catch up on all your Words With Friends games and ponder which specials will be up on the board that week. Or.. skip out on work, go to Doug's around 2:30pm mid-week, and there's generally never more than 10 people in line. I haven't read all 1,000+ reviews, so I'm sure it's been noted, but for anyone who has never been, don't try to run inside and snag a table while someone else in your party holds the spot in line. It's rude to every other person who is patiently waiting to sit down and feast, and you will be kindly asked to go get back in line and wait until you've placed your order to find a table. Just trying to save you the embarrassment! Oh and in the winter, notice that huge sign that says 'DON'T HOLD THE FRONT DOOR OPEN' and abide by it. 5 stars for Hot Doug's!ps; One time, I saw Doug totally out of his element at Comp World or whatever that place is called on Elston across from Target and it was like seeing a unicorn. Rare, but epic.
