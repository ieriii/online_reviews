First time dinning here and I must say, it was quite good. Started with two appetizers of hummus and olovieh which was kinda like mashed up potato salad. Both were equally scrumptious and my friends and I fully enjoyed them. The location was very convenient with the train station a few feet away from this charming restaurant. I've heard that the kabobs are fantastic here, so of course I got the rib eye & chicken breast kabobs. They were accompanied by either dill or white rice, and I wasn't sure which to order but after my friend ordered a portion of each rice, I decided to try it as well.  I have to admit, the rice was a bit bland but the kabobs made up for it. I thought the the service is a little on the slow side especially for a Wednesday night, but I would definitely return.
