This is the best value hotel in Chicago hands down. And I think it's because of all the renovations that were going on. I read some other reviews and found that they've been going on for some time. I always wondered why it was so cheap for a landmark hotel each time I saw it on Orbitz. I'm sure the prices will go up once they are finished. My room had a sort of old charm. I originally reserved a kingsize bed, but took the queen just so I could check in early. Queen beds are pretty small once you've been sleeping in a kingsize for the better part of your life. But it was sufficient. Minibar, check. In-room safe, check. Duvet, check. The location doesn't get much better. You're a block away from Water Tower Place and everything you need is in walking distance. If you take a quick trip down the alley adjacent to the hotel, you'll find yourself at a Starbucks, and if you take the alley across the street, you'll find an Einstein Bros. bagel shop. Both among my favorites. My only complaints: They charged for crappy "wired" internet. When I checked in, I told them that my flight wasn't until 7pm on my day of departure and they suggested I book another night--which I did. Meanwhile, on the insert that my room key came in, they said that for $60, that they can accommodate late check-out up to 6pm. So I reversed the reservation and told them I'd like to take advantage of their $60 charge instead. When my check-out time came, I called just to confirm that I would be leaving late and the guy said I could stay until 1pm. Why would I pay $60 to stay an extra hour when I could have booked another night for a preferential rate of $90? Finally after a bit of attitude, he agreed to let me stay until 5pm. I left at 4.
