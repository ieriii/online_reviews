Imagine you bought some Hot Wheels, and they came with a Porsche. Imagine you go to check out Where The Wild Things Are at your local library establishment, and you're sent home with Marisa Miller. Imagine you order some eggs, and they come with so much extra food that you forget your main dish and end up as a fat, comatose mess on the floor of a restaurant. One of these things is possible at Yolk (maybe two...but Marisa hasn't responded to my letters). This place is ridiculous - they have an expansive menu, and the amount of food you get is absurd. I ordered a Mediterranean omelette (which was incredible), and it came with potatoes, fruit, and a side of banana nut pancakes. A side. Of pancakes. I look forward to the day when I go to Peter Luger's and a filet comes with my creamed spinach. Even though it was crowded, at 11 AM we managed to sit with a 5 minute wait. This was my second time here, and our waitress wasn't the most friendly (everyone else in the entire place seemed to be) but the food was well worth it. I am very full. And it's almost dinner time.
