Not that my review matters with so many here, but I figure I'll throw in my two cents. This place is what you would expect from your typical restaurants catering to par-desis (non South Asians): very good quality cuts of meat and tiny portions for a rather exorbitant price. Also, fancy, orientalizing dcor and a huge bar screams "white folks eat here for a 'cultural' experience!" The food is not bad, a little bland; I much prefer my Devon haunts. The menu is pretty extensive, and have a range of dishes that span the subcontinent, another clue that this is not a place for South Asians. As an aside, I'm rather shocked to see they have chaats, though they put a tad too much chutney on them. Chaats are a street/snack type food, so the fact that an actual mid range, sit-down restaurant offers then, and charges over $5 for something like bhel puri is a bit odd. All in all, it's the kind of place I'll take my anglo-friends who whine about eating something like goat, which is as quotidian a meat as you'll find in this type of cuisine.
