This review is for the lunch buffet only. From my experience, India House has the best lunch buffet in the downtown area. Although a tad on the expensive side, the food is very high quality, the place is clean, the atmosphere is quite comfortable and relaxing, clientele is fairly classy, and it is an overall pleasant experience. All of the typical dishes are executed well, so you can definitely get your Indian fix.
