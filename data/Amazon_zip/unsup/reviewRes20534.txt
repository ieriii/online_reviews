excellent food. simple. clean. fresh and unique. it's expensive for a pub but cheap for a nice restaurant. i started with the heirloom tomato salad with smoked gouda. when it came out it looked like a fist size pile of mult-colored tomatoes with no cheese. i asked about the cheese and they promtly brought me a new plate with twice as many tomatoes and some cheese on it. it was stunningly beautiful, seasonal, simple and delicious. however for 15 dollars i expected a little more than the sprinkling of cheese. overall no complaints. it is bustling and load but that's kind of part of the charm.
