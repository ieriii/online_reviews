Okay, to be fair I haven't tried what has been described as, 'mouth watering chicken wings'. But, I have had their big buddha bowl, which is their stab at bimibim bop. I love bimbimb bop and feel like it is a dish that is really difficult to mess up. Well, this place has succeeded in doing just that. It wasn't just the one time, it was on multiple occasions. Okay, so how do you mess up the easiest dish to make? Well, first of all the rice was overcooked and clumpy and kind of gooey. I love sticky rice, but this was not the consistency I was looking for. Also the vegetables on top tasted like soapy dish water. There wasn't any flavor in these poor vegetables. There should be a nice subtle flavor of garlic, sesame oil and a touch of salt. It all tasted bland to me and the egg on top was slimy. I have eaten a lot of bimbim bop in my day and have been treated to some delicious homemade versions, where the egg is perfectly cooked, with the yolk soft and runny and the whites cooked just through. The top of this egg was slimy and undercooked, not appetizing. I came here with a friend for lunch and we couldn't even hear each other because they were blasting Kings of Leon at an ear splitting volume. The guy apologized though and turned it down to ear bleeding level.
