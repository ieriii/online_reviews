My bf and I went here for dinner and it was my first time there. He has been there a lot and highly recommended it. The food was really good and the service was great. We ate upstairs and although the seating is quite umm... "cozy" we still had a good time. By the way, "cozy" is a nice way of saying, the stranger next to me was practically sitting on my lap and we had to fight for arm room like at the movie theatre. Alas, I'd highly suggest going at a non-peak dinner time hour to take advantage of some of their delicious specials.
