i really want to like this place but after my 3rd visit i decided NOT to come back again.This place looks really cool, small and cozy, you feel you are not in Chicago! Good food choices, BYOB is a plus, outdoor sitting.1st time I came here, the food was excellent but then I had to run in the bathroom for No 2. I have eaten to many places over my 28 years and this never happened to me before. I wasn't going to come back but the 2nd time I came here was with a group of friends that wanted to try this place. Whatever. 2nd time around, the sandwich I had was just ok, the goat cheese empanadas are the best here and the exotic drinks, the calamari was the most HORRIBLE calamari I ever tried in my life! And to top it off I paid nearly 40$ for something I didn't enjoy. Yeap, the food here is expensive! Also, this place doesn't even have a washroom for their costumers. isn't this illegal?There is no reason for me to come back here again.
