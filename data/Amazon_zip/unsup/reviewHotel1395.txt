A nice spot to park the parents when they're in town!! Right around the corner from Watertower Place and all the Michigan Ave. fav's, this ideally located hotel has pleasant & friendly front desk and valet/door staff.  The staff was responsive to problems, for example - when my parents' window shade fell off the wall at 10pm, a maintenance guy was there within minutes.  Although their room was small, it was fancifully decorated and clean. Their friends had a room next to the elevator which was more spacious (b/c it's handicap accessible, the bathroom is at least normal sized and not miniature). The bar isn't really separated from the lobby, it almost feels like one space. Martinis were on par for the neighborhood ($14) and the bar had a live trio playing one evening. Parking was $44/day, almost 1/2 the room rate - ouch! (Why do this when you have your lovely daughter who can serve as a shuttle driver between her apartment and your hotel?!) Room rates were reasonable ($105) by calling the hotel directly, but I'm betting you could get lower by using a service like Priceline.
