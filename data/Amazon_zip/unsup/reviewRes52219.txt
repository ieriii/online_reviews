The pizza was very tasty and filling. The dinner salad was huge and more than we could handle. The waitstaff were attentive and properly set our expectations concerning the time needed to cook our pizza. The restaurant has a unique vibe with their graffiti everywhere decor. We thought it a good value and worth a visit if you are visiting Chicago.
