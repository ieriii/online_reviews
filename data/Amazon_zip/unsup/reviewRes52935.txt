This place has just gotten better and better as time goes on. I am madly in love with the fried yucca with plenty of garlic sauce on top (pllleeeasse don't eat this on a date...or around any other human being.) The empinadas are perfection as well -- I tried the vegetable filled one and the goat cheese and red pepper one. I prefer the goat cheese. It has a mild and sweet flavor to it that just rolls on the tastebuds. The black beans here are stewed for a long time and absolutely perfect. This is the great summer joint, with a lot of patio seating and later business. It's perfect for a bustling, yet intimate dinner with a date or small group of friends.  YUM. YUM. YUM.
