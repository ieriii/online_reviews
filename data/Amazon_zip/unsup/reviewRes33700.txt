For what it is, Sultan's is the best. Excellent falafel sandwiches and other great foods for CHEAP. Good sized servings of tasty food. A well-stocked salad bar. Yes. For fulfilling its role in the neighborhood so well, I will completely ignore the occasional long lines or hard time finding a seat (though it usually isn't that hard). I bring all visitors from out of town here for a quick and cheap lunch visit before taking the Blue Line downtown.
