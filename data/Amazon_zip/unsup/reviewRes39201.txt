"Move...Move...more coming..." That was our waitress telling us to move the dishes as she was putting down the many little bowls of "side dishes" while we waited for our bulkoki (bulgogi?) and spicy squid to grill. As many have said before me, just try whatever is in the dishes, you might be pleasantly surprised. My faves were the beansprouts, seaweed, egg, tofu and glass noodles. A trio of us dined here for a late lunch and we all left pleasantly full and satisfied. For a Saturday, the restaurant was only half full so we were seated right away. The bro opted for bibimbop while me and my cousin ordered the bulgogi and spicy squid to grill. The squid was just OK. You have to grill them just right or else you can overdo it. If I had to do it over again, I would have just ordered some more beef instead of the squid. The bulgogi was wonderfully delicious--to me, the beef was better than the squid. Grill the meat, place in lettuce wrap with a little rice, sauce and/or other condiments--sooo damn tasty, I'm so ready to go back. The bro's bibimbap arrived to the table sizzling and looked pretty good. Full of veggies, rice and egg. Service was ok, not overly friendly. Water-refilling a little slow--which I didn't mind so much here. It's laid back, casual and I can't wait to visit again!
