Really good. I would go back again. Whiskey/bourbon selection was great and the prices were cheap. The menu can get a little pricey so I liked that the alcohol was on the cheaper end. Long wait for our table but its a popular spot so that's expected. Also, I never mind waiting when there are cheap drinks to be had! Food was good to great. Shared several items. Pretzel was good but I felt like I could have that anywhere. Tongue small plate was also good but I have had better. Seriously, that wasn't a cheap joke. Had tongue at a Venezuelan restaurant and it was far more tender. Short ribs were out of this world amazing. I can't remember everything else we tried and I'm too lazy to look up their menu. Go with friends that like to share. I would recommend ordering as many smaller plates as possible so you can try lots of dishes. Service was good. Our waiter was available to answer questions but was not intrusive. Will go back but not on a Friday or Saturday night.
