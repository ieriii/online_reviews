I eat lunch at Meli every week, and I try to have something different each time. Nothing I've ever eaten at Meli has been average, everything has been really good or completely delicious. My favorite thing to get is their Cristo Melt that's on vanilla-battered challah bread. Great coffee and juice, and food always comes super fast.The service tends to be hit or miss depending on who you get, but it's always fast and I've never had a wrong order. If you go on Friday, just make sure you try and get there before noon. It gets packed.
