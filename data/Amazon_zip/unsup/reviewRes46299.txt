I like the food. The service can be soooooooo bad, though. The past couple of times I visited were like a comedy of errors... I received the completely wrong sandwich, so I ended up eating 10+ mins after my tablemate. However, the manager came over and apologized and I assured him it was no big deal. But the waiter was all huffy over his mistake, which wasn't cool. But that was a small price to pay for the comped entree... score! Another time, they forgot to put in my baked to order dessert with my entree, and didn't realize it until when I was supposed to get it. I was given the choice of waiting, or picking a quicker dessert. Since there was nothing else I wanted, I said I was totally fine with waiting the 20 mins.  She was all "really?" and looked at me like I was crazy and taking up a table for no reason. It's not my fault that 1) she forgot about it 2) the place is somewhat of a zoo.  But I don't care, I still like the food.
