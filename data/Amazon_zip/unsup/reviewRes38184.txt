Hopleaf has one of the best European beer selections in the city! The wine list is quite good also. If you are looking for a great meal, you will not be disappointed. The steamed mussels are fantastic as well as the authentic pommes frites w/garlic mayo dipping sauce. Make sure you get there early or you will have a wait on the weekends. If you are a beer connoisseur Hopleaf is a must!
