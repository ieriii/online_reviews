So my relationship started with Piece Brewing when I was sucked into the fold of Homebrewing. The go to place for my mentor, we would come down to the city 2-3 times a month, and always end up going to piece. I think that it had somethign to do with the Live Band Kareoke on Saturday night.  Beers - From my favorite Camel Toe to the Big Black Mariah, I can get by big beer fix here. In August, my brother in law was visiting from Antwerp, Belgium, and he fell in love with the Hefewiezen they had on tap at the time.  Pizza - I always go with the choose your own adventure here. They have some suggestions on the menu, but they are always the run of the mill pizza that you will see at any other resturant. Last time I was there for a bachelor pre-party, we got a bar-b-cue chicken with bacon and red onions. Fab-boo!!! Service - here is the lacking part. since this place is always packed and you are almost guaranteed to have a hoarse throat the next morning, try ot come up with interesting names to be called out at the bar if you are waiting for a table top or to be seated. Last time we went we tried to be the Super Friends, but the hostess wasn't all that into it. Really, get a little dorky and shout out "Table for 8 for Superman. Green Arrow, your table is right there. Wonder Woman, your party is at the middle table top." I mean you do have live band Kareoke....
