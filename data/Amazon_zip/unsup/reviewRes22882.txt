Props to Lao Sze Chaun for offering vegetarian hot and sour soup. It's not the best I've had, but it's better than none. I tried ordering the vegetarian chicken appetizer but they were out! Instead, the waitress suggested other items like Dry Beef and Jelly Fish even though I informed her of my diet. My boyfriend and I had the Hunan Vegetables and Double Fried Eggplant with Fresh Chili. I preferred the Hunan dish (it had sauce and crisp vegetables), but both of them are extremely boring and overpriced. Lao Sze Chuan was a disappointment. I am really surprised that Chicago doesn't have vegetarian Chinese restaurants like Vegetable Garden and Harmony Cafe in DC. The food is absolutely delicious.
