Look, as long as you know what to expect then you shouldn't have a problem with Violet Hour. If you read the other reviews and say to yourself "why the hell would I pay 11 bucks for a drink, when I can go to Happy Village and get the special beer for 2?" then don't go. I can't afford to go here all the time, or have too many drinks, but it is an amazing place and if you are someone who is intrigued then I highly suggest coming on a random Wednesday and partaking in an experience. Also, sit at the bar. You get to see up close what a cocktail from back in the day might look like. Other notes: Is it pretentious? Yes, but in a good way. Is it worth $11? Matter of opinion, but I think at the very least for one time it is. My bartender was also very nice and will talk to you and help you with suggestions. I found that it is more of the other guests that can be rude, but it isn't the place where you mingle, you go there with people and have good conversation. Chicago is always behind on trends, but this bar will stack up to a NY cocktail bar any day. Ok, sorry, long review, but overall amazing experience and drinks. Again, if it seems to interest you, I highly suggest giving it a try. Also, this week they put in their new spring menu. I suggest the NY sour (for a daquiri (read: girly drink) and the last one under the rum (name?) for a regular drink.
