I go here a lot. But not really for the food. I go because I'm vegan, and it's nice to have the entire menu for an option. I also go because the wait staff is AMAZING. Some of them love to chat you up. Some of them simply like to do their job efficiently, and prefer to be brisk (but never rude). They'll make great suggestions and tell you to try a milkshake and a piece of cake--but you know they're doing it out of love for sugar, and not because they want your money. Seriously. They're great people. And they're great to talk to if you're looking for tattoo inspiration...As for the food: it's okay. It's definitely not deserving of the awards it wins. But I've absolutely had worse.
