my favorite chinese restaurant in chicago. one of the best fish dishes i've ever had anywhere. do not try dessert. all the vegetables are really fresh. the service is good. the menu is daunting--but they're great at pointing you in the right direction. some of the spiciest food i've had. i've never had anything close to this good.
