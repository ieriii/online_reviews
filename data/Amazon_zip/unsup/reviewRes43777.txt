This place is nice on the inside; it would be a great place to take a coworker on his or her birthday, or to take a client visiting from out of town. The atmosphere has a slight sophistication to it, but it's still casual and comfortable at the same time. We went just after 1 and it wasn't super busy. The service was great and fairly quick. I had the penne pasta, which was basically pasta with grilled chicken, mushrooms (I opted out on the mushrooms), red onions, and spinach in a gorgonzola cream sauce and it was de-licious! And...it was only 12 bucks! You'll pay that much, if not more, for an alfredo dish anywhere else...and that's WITHOUT chicken. This dish, however, already comes with chicken. Mmm hmmm. :)
