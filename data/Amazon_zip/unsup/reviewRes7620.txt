Amazing. I am a total foodie...and Italian is my fave. I was in Chicago on business, and so I yelped Italian food, and this is what I found. And, oh, my Yelpers, you have not let me down. First, the bread. I think that the bread basket can set the tone for the meal, and we started off nicely. Homemade breads with some really nice olive oil.  I started with the avocado appetizers, which I think were a special. Oh. Wow. I don't think I have ever eaten anything that amazing in my life. The dish consisted of fresh avocado, tomato, mozzarella, basil, and some other stuff on top of a baguette. Seriously, I considered cancelling my pasta and ordering more of the avocado dish.  However, I exercised some self-restraint, and held out for my noodles. I had homemade tube noodles (I have no idea what they were called..they were giant tube-shaped noodes) that were made in-house that day. The pasta was topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, and just the right amount of seasoning. Everything was so fresh. No flavor overwhelmed me..it was just such a perfect blend. I think that's how you know when you've got a great chef.  The person I was with had the lobster ravioli, and she really liked it. I tried a bite, and it was delish. Very rich.  We were so stuffed that we couldn't have possibly ordered dessert....but oh, will I ever be back. Yum. The service was nice. Attentive but not overbearing. The interior had a quaint, neighborhood, yet upscale feel. Prices were fair- about $20/dish.  (Note- I noticed that on Mondays they do a prix fixe for about $20/person. That includes salad, soup, appetizer sampler, 2 pastas, dessert per person. What a deal!)
