If I could give this zero stars, I would. Considering that my last stay here was during the summer and with the spate of conventions in town my only options were a) this place or b) an $800/night room at the Peninsula, frugality won out. The room made me think of that old line from "Wings", where Lowell said "I wonder how many people committed suicide in this dump." I get that it is an inexpensive hotel, but you would think that with the amount of business it gets and the location the management could have done something to make the place more appealing (hairdryers in the rooms, people, hello?). I might also add that the noise from the elevated train was unbearable and, between that and the flimsy door with equally flimsy deadbolt, I got around 2 hours of sleep the one and only night I stayed there. Save yourselves the money and sleep in the lobby of one of the many swish hotels just up the street.
