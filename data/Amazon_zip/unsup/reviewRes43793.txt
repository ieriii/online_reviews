I recently just went to Kinzie for Valentine's Day with my hunny. Since he completely forgot to make a reservation we opted for this chophouse because it was the only one who had availability before 10:00pm. Based on previous reviews, it seemed like a great choice and when the night was over we were extremely pleased with our decision. Once we were seated, we were greeted with a champagne toast. I'm not a big steak eater but I was interested in hearing about the selection in more detail. I was surprised when they brought out actual visuals of all of their cuts of meat wrapped in plastic on a nice silver tray, great presentation. Our waiter schooled us on all of the cuts, simplified the fancy verbiage on the menu, and in the end I decided to go with the 8oz fillet while my boyfriend chose the Delmonico. We paired our steaks with the four cheese macaroni and stuffed jumbo baked potato (packed with cheese, chives, sour cream, and bacon) Everything was delicious and well prepared. The only issue we had was the tables were put really close together. I'm not sure if they added a few to accommodate the Valentine's Day rush, but even the waiter had a hard time maneuvering through the aisles. Overall great place, reasonably priced compared to some of the other steak joints in Chicago. I will definitely return!
