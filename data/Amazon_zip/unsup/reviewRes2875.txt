OHMIGOD, what an experience!!! I've never been to such an upscale restaurant. everything was perfect and in sync - the food, wine, table service, etc etc. Desserts to die for, and the suckling pig was FANTASTIC (even though I did feel really bad about eating it afterwards). They really take care of their customers
