I had so much fun grilling my own food and trying out a wide variety of kimchi even if we don't even know what it is. It could've been better if they label everything, so we know what we're eating. Grilling is fun but make sure you go home after trying out this place because you will definitely smell like smoke.Their soup was awesome. I think they made their miso soup from scratch not like those other Japanese Restaurants who I think just prepares the instant one.Service was just okay. Some of the servers were not fluent and could not understand English very well. I may come back when we have friends from out of town. But, if it was just us...I may not have the craving for their food ever...again.
