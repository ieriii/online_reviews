In the beginning we ordered several tapas, but bacon wrapped dates were especially great. As main dish we chose a paella, but it looked like a deconstructed one...chicken was on top not incorporated. It tasted good, but was not what I expected. Sangria was not good...the first one that they brought us had so much ice, it tasted like water. The ambience was very nice....overall, I would say was a nice experience.
