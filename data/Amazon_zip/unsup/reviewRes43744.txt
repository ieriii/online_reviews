Kinzie's service is impeccable. It really is. Every server I've had there is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I go there about 3 or 4 times a year, and I never am let down. I do have to say that I'm not a fan of their appetizers. It's not that they are bad, but they are mediocre. I go for the steaks. I got the Delmonico, perfectly cooked and tender. The bf got the surf and turf, a 12oz lobster tail with a 8oz filet. The surf and turf is not the norm, but it was very good. The lobster was meaty and the filet cooked to the temperature requested. The sides are generous. Compared to other steakhouses, their sides are a great price and the portions generous. I love their mushroom risotto. Considering restaurants try to charge $12 for the same portion, it's a great deal. I also like their giant baked potato and their smashed potatoes. If you are not a bacon eater, their smashed potatoes come with bacon already made, so stay away from them. Also, stay away from their fries. I swear, they are Ore-Ida seasoned steak fries. They have to be. Dessert....it's not the best part there. The good thing is, that they are pretty decently priced. $4.95 for a dessert at a steakhouse isn't bad at all. Anyways, go and experience it. It's not a chain, it's been owned by the same person for the past 18 yrs and it's great. Oh! One more thing! Make a reservation...it makes your life a lot easier and you get seated on time.
