We went last Saturday. The place was packed, but it was the Valentine's Day weekend so no suprise there. We had calamari for starters and for main I had shrimp ala capri- I love this dish. It came witha lot of extras too. Salad bar, soup, coice of side- just great.The one thing I don't like the LaVilla for is that I have never tried their desserts- I'm just too full after dinner to even look at the menu. Good place!!Friendly staff. Good food!! And great pizza too.
