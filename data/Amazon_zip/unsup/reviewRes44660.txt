We really enjoyed the deep dish pizza. The services was - eh. We went on Sunday evening and a few of the waitresses and a bus boy were dressed up for halloween. We are not fans of halloween, but to each his own. I felt kind of bad for one of the waitresses because she was dressed up as Madonna or a bride or a mix of both and the table she was helping laughed at her constantly. Jerks. I mean - like I said - we don't do halloween, but we didn't make fun of anyone either. Our waitress (was not dressed up) had a habit of disappearing, not refilling our drinks and putting forth as minimal of an effort as possible. Typically, we order from Giordano's in Hyde Park and always delivery. So this could have been an off night for this location. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and a shot to do better next time.  The bathrooms were clean, the food was good and the service could have been better.
