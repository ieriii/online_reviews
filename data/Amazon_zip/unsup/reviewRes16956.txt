Love it! Love it! Love it! I have been there a couple of times on a date, with friends and recently with family, and i have to say the food is outstanding the ceviche(seafood salad),arrachera, pollo Billy and ropa vieja are delicious! And valet price is very fair only $5 bucks, plus the place it self is really nice and colorful. I go there as often as is can!
