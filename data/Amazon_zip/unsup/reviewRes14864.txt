I really really wanted to like this place, and I really don't. I live pretty close to it, and I thought when I first saw it, hey this could be perfect little place for eating at when I don't feel like cooking. I walked in and was not greeted by anybody. I asked one of the employees who was going in and out to take the orders to customers sitting in the patio if there is any available tables outside and she was looking at me like I asked her something in Chinese. Finally at the third time she got it. The cooks and one of the waiters were yelling " si si si si si si" constantly and it was just annoying. The guy that took our order at the register kept walking away in the middle of my order, and I had to repeat 5 times what we wanted. Okay I ignored all this and we went outside to sit. We received our food, and immediately I thought I could have made this at home. It was two pieces of bread, grilled chicken breast with no seasoning, not even salt and pepper, lettuce, tomatoes and grilled onions. It was just bland, and I didn't enjoy eating this at all. What is the point of eating outside and spending money when the food you're given is something you can make yourself? And I would at least season my chicken and definitely grill my onions with something more than just oil. I don't believe this is how they really do it in Cuba. It's like going to an Italian restaurant and being served spaghetti that's sticky and topped with market-bought marinara sauce. The only thing I liked was their fries, even though they were greasy beyond words, they tasted pretty good. My husband ordered Pollo dinner, again the same thing. Maybe I will give them a second chance or go to another Cuban joint and compare.
