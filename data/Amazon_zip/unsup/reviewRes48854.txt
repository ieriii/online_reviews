Food is delicious (got the red wine poached egg), but service did NOT have it together. Went there for brunch with a group of 7, and it was packed when we went in. After we ordered we waited over 45 minutes for our food. There were other tables that were seated after us and got food before us. We all ordered from the brunch meal, no one got fish, so I don't understand what the wait was about. I was expecting the waitress or the manager to come over and tell us what was going on, but nothing. I'll give them this, the waitress did give us free desserts, but this was 45 minutes into our wait and after we expressed our concern. And no one refilled/offered a refill on our coffee, the menu said bottomless... What really annoyed me was that no one apologized for the long wait on our food. And only after we got our food did our waitress pay attention to us by asking if we wanted drinks or anything else (aka run up the bill). Seriously I've had better service at Outback Steakhouse. Overall the food alone is worth the trip, but service was a huge disappointment.
