We went for Sunday brunch, and it was very crowded. The service was really slow, but it was a really busy time. The music (Greek pop) seemed to get louder the longer we were there too. The bakery is stellar. The food was great, the atmosphere is delightful, and it was an all-around great brunch. My one real issue was that the soft drinks (charged a typical $1.25 or similar) were tiny and had no free refills. I know it's trivial, but being on a budget, it really caught me by surprise.
