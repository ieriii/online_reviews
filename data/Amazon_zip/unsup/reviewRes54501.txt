I trekked here for my birthday with friends earlier this month, and everyone in my party LOVED the food! I became vegan a few months ago, and it is immensely refreshing to come to such a restaurant with its large vegan menu. They prepare their veggies in many tasty ways (including with pesto sauce, mmmmm...), but the highlight is the vegan comfort food (country-fried steak, BLT, etc). Only one other person in my group of 7 was vegan and the rest all eat meat, and EVERYONE found something delicious and filling. I had to keep giving my friends more sips of my chocolate chip cookie dough milk-shake, because they couldn't stop marveling that it was dairy-free. As for the staff: The waiters are friendly, funny, and well-informed about all of the dishes on the menu. And when our server heard that it was my birthday, he made my milkshake complimentary!This is a fantastic restaurant for vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters to enjoy together. It's also a great way to introduce avid meat-eaters to a plant-based diet in a way is that is casual, comfortable, non-pushy, and DELICIOUS.
