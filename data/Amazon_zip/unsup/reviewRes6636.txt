I made my first visit with a friend to this new spot in the days between the holidays. We were looking for a place to chill and catch up a bit before NYE, and I had read about Davanti in Time Out. We managed to sneak in without any fuss and decided to sit at the bar for a light bite. The place was buzzing and still felt comfortable - not over the top loud and crazy by any means. Perfect for the occasion. The decor is good - well lit and upbeat, modern Euro trattoria style that kind of reminds me of a modern version of so many awesome old world trattorias that I've been to in Italy. I was floored to learn that they carry Menabrea beer! My favorite beer from Italy is such an elusive one to find for some strange reason. I also liked their straight forward "quartino" style wine list that allows two people to sample about a glass and a half each of a variety of wines for a minimal cost. We decided on a few cheese and salumi selections, burrata and polpo (super fresh octopus that was delicious) and then had a Pizza della Fattoria which has farmed egg, pork belly, potato, scallions, asiago and bechamel. A deliciously rich version of my favorite food group - PIZZA! I recognized a couple of the staff from Purple Pig and was treated very well. I look forward to going back sometime soon for the full dinner experience. Definitely worth a trip down Taylor Street! I'm glad to see this part of town come back to life.
