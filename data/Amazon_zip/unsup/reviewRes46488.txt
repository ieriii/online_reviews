This place was yummy :) My favorite part was the ice cream sundaes! The hamburgers were nice and juicy, but I have had better. The decor is cool inside and we had a great booth seat at the window. Make a reservation is my reccomendation if you are going on the weekend, as this place is small inside. Our waitress was very nice and the service was also great. Valet parking was easy and we only $8, not bad. I would come here again for a round two.
