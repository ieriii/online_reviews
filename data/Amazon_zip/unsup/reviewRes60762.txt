I've been there four times now and im quite fond of their burgers!My favorite so far is the lockdown warden but havent been dissapointed in any of my choices. The first time i went there the fries were kinda soggy but they definatelly fixed that problem. However last time i went there they were playing some dubstep music and i dont know how that fits in to their metal/jail theme? i asked the bartender if he could play something else, he said if i dont like it i can leave. The attitude was totaly uncalled for. Next time i'll just get my food delivered.
