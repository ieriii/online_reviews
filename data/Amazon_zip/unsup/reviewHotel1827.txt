The hotel has quite the club feel on the first floor. Check in desk is in the back left hand corner and there is really no where to wait. A big mix of concierge desks, elevators and check in staff. I would also have liked to know in advance that they place a $200 hold on your credit card. Made for a surprise when I checked my accounts. Overall, too trendy, not practical, not even sexy. Whoever thought these particular bathroom sinks were cute was right -- but they should also consider function. No way to wash your hands, face or brush your teeth. It was preposterous actually. How you maneuver to accomplish those tasks was beyond me. Really bad water pressure too. The room was clean...but carpet just felt dirty. Please tell me that this building was once something else and re-purposed for a hotel. Otherwise, the layout just does not make sense. Bliss products were the best part.
