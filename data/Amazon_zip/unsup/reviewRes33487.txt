Totally just happened upon this place today while walking around downtown. I had heard some good things so we decided to pop in and check it out. Quite a few people waiting but they quoted us a 15 min wait. We took seats at the bar and probably waited 5 minutes. Our waiter sucked, but the food was good - noting new, but good solid breakfast food. Oh and I liked the design of the place too. Clean, modern, open - nice. If I lived closer I'd go back for sure!
