Food: Meat was tasty but low quality Service: Rushed Salad Bar: Excellent Price: Way overpriced for the quality Atmosphere: Modern Cool Music: Was intermittent, skipped, broken and loud when working If you've never been you need to go check it out! I see this as a gimmicky once every 3 to 5 years type of joint! We waited 25 minutes past our reservation time to get seated near the kitchen. Valet parking was $12 plus tip! I'm not against spending money by no means! But I really feel like the food, service and whole Shtick didn't live up to the price. This place needs a class in how to put it all together and create a more complete dinning experience!
