Food: Definitely high quality cuts of meat Service: Your glass will never be empty - but your plates sure will be! Price: Well, you pay for what you get! The Fogo all-you-can eat is $49.95. All the fine cuts of beef, pork, chicken and lamb you can imagine. The salad bar is generous, but no real standouts. In all, a great brazilian steak house, but my first experience was at Brazzaz here in Chicago and it left a permanant PREMIUM memory in my brain. The salad bar was more outstanding, if my memory serves me right. With all other meats equal, it comes down to price. And Brazzaz I believe is at least $5 cheaper per head. Great Riesling on the menu at Fogo, however!
