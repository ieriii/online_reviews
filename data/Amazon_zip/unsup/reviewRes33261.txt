WOW. I hardly have words. I just can't believe I haven't visited this place long ago. I've lived in the area for over 2 years and always drive by this place, telling my husband that it is cute and we should try it. Well, we finally did tonight and we were overwhelmed with the friendly service, delicious complimentary appetizer, perfectly paired Romanian wine, and the most delicious entrees we have had since a very fancy/expensive dinner for our anniversary a year ago. And the entrees were only $15!!!! So delicious and a good amount of food..I couldn't finish mine and my husband was stuffed by the time he was done. The owner was extremely nice and the outdoor seating area is cute. We cannot wait to go back with friends in the next couple of weeks. Maybe we will try the free limo service next time! ;)
