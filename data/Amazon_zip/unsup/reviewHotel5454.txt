I stayed here this past weekend and had a very nice night. My friend was visiting from out of town for Halloween and we wanted to get a hotel for the night. Our plans were a little last minute and I was super worried about finding a reasonably priced hotel. Luckily, Sutton Place was running a $99.00 sale for the night!!! Jackpot! You couldn't ask for a better location. Sutton Place is close to so many restaurants, the bars on Clark and Division, and shopping. A cab ride from Union Station to the hotel cost around $7.00. Everyone in the hotel was friendly and you could tell they actually cared about our stay. The rooms were so quite, we literally heard zero noise from our neighbors. And, our room was right next to the elevators on our floor and we still heard no noise! Perfectly fluffy beds, I had the best night of sleep. My only complaint is that there are no ice machines. You have to call room service to deliver you your ice. So essentially you have to pay for the ice (since it would be expected for you to tip room service delivery) But, it just get a pain to keep paying for new ice once the ice melts...
