If I were rating this place based on food alone, it would get 4 stars. I had the steak and blue cheese salad which was, frankly, filling enough to be a meal and very good. I ordered the steak medium and got medium rare but that did not bother me because I like both. There was not too much dressing on the salad either which is great because I hate drowned vegetables. I got a double baked potato on the side and that was good but not even close to the ones my aunt used to make. Her double baked (and deviled eggs) are the measure for all others and this potato - not so much. But the rest of the place gets 2 stars from me. The interior is just too big and too packed together. There were four of us and we had to shout to hear one another, it was so loud in there. I ordered two of the same cocktail but they may as well have been two different cocktails because there was no consistency. They forgot my potato at first (but quickly got it for me). There were so many people standing in the front that it felt like a bus station. Also, I don't want to be a tourist hater since I am often a tourist other places. But I don't like being in places with such huge concentrations of out-of-towners. Just a personal preference. I will stick to little french bistros from now on when I want to get my steak on.
