You know that lusty, warm, excited, tummy flip feeling you get when you see a guy (or girl) you like pass you by and you say to yourself, "Hot damn! I want you!" Biting into Sultan Market's falafel made me feel kinda like that! Seriously, a few moans of pleasure had to be released. Saying that it's good just doesn't do it justice. Their pita sandwiches are awesome as well, especially since you can have it as spicy as you wish (medium, please!) and trust me I've tried them all. I haven't tried the salad bar, but it always looks fresh.This place is definitely a great go-to spot for delicious cheap eats and Mid East treats. mmm mmm! FYI: Cash ONLY!
