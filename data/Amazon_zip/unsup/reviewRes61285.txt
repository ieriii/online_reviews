My friends and I went for my birthday on a tuesday and were blown away by the service!!...very attentive, very knowledgeable. I would give the service and salad buffet 5 stars, but the meat only 3....most of the beef was too done for my liking, as well as salty and dry. The salad buffet was amazing, i should have just stuck with that. But if you want to be waited on well downtown...this is a good place to be.
