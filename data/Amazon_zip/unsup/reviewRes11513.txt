Im only giving this spot a 4 star rating because I haven't had anything else and I hate to give a 5 to something I've had only a single dish and beverage at... That being said, The beef filet sandwich with St. Andre cheese, apple, watercress relish and horseradish aioli was so rediculously good. No doubt worth the 5 star rating. I'll be back with an update.
