Foie gras duck sausage hot dog??? Yes please! We came on a Monday afternoon and there was a line peeking out the door. I guess it's true, there's always a line. While we were in line, the people in front of us started talking and we got involved in a conversation with them, and our 30 minute wait went by a lot quicker. The outside is kind of boring looking, very unassuming, but the inside is kitschy and bright and fun. Lots of primary colors. Lots of hot dog options, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of them. We ordered: Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel: Woah. So tasty, so decadent, so fatty, so bad for my arteries, but SO GOOD. The sausage itself reminded me of the Taiwanese style pork sausages (for those familiar with longanisa, the Filipino sausage, it's kind of similar). Slightly sweet, very rich. A must try. Crayfish and pork sausage with shrimp remoulade and creme fraiche: Yummy but the creme fraiche had a very goat cheese-y taste to it.  We had another 2 hot dogs that were a Jack Daniels fennel pork sausage with something and then the other one had something with smoked gouda. I can't quite recall and the website and menu seems to change daily, but I remember them being very tasty as well. They were a little pricey but you are getting gourmet hot dogs. We had to take the train to the California stop and then hail a tax because it would've been a 1.5 mile walk to Hot Doug's, so just as an FYI, it's not super easy to get to without a car or taxi.
