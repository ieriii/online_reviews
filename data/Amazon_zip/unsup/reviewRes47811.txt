I have mixed reviews for this place. I've been many times to the rooftop for drinks and the setting is great, drinks always hit the spot. The first time I went to dinner with a friend we went on a Saturday night and the food was outstanding. The buffet area had about 50 different options to choose from and everything was fresh and fully stocked. The second time I went on a Sunday night. The place was half empty and the buffet had only 10-15 items that looked a little old. Also, the waiters were very stingy with the meat and only came around a few times. Lesson learned: go on a busy night when they are prepared to serve a crowd.
