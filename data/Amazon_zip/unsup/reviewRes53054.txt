We absolutely love this place! We started off going to the other smaller location and finally got a chance to try out their new location. We went around 7:00pm on a Friday night -- there was a wait for the patio, but we had no problem getting a little corner table in prime people watching position. We brought a bottle of wine and saw that for $10 they will mix up a batch of fresh Sangria for you which we look forward to trying out next time. The food is always amazing -- we have not had a bad sandwich there, juicy meat, chewy bread, perfectly grilled vegetables. They have a great housemade hot sauce that we put on the sandwich and use to dip our Papas Frites. I'm personally addicted to the sweet plaintains and love to get the Ropa Vieja sandwich and add plaintains to it, it's a great combination. The atmosphere is very cool, old cuban articles, photos etc paper the walls, it's dimly lit and makes you feel like you are in Cuba eating in a little hole in the wall. The service was great, no complaints there. This is definitley one of our favorite spots in Chicago!
