I don't like deep dish Chicago pizza. My friends wanted to try it and we came here because it was close. I've done the others (UNO and Gino's East) and this was good too. Again, I'm not a person to rate pizza, but since both my husband and I are anti deep dish, we got other menu items and really liked them. I got pasta with meat sauce and he got ravioli. Both dishes were really good and I really like their tomato sauce. Delicious. The service was awesome and they have good mints on your way out the door.
