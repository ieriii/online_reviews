Ate here last Thursday and the food was excellent! Sooooooo good! Very pleased with the service and the back patio is small but very nice. The only thing is I would reccomment staying away from their coffee Martini, tastes like straight up coffee beans. I didn't have the heart to return it but they added some sweetner so that is was somewhat drinkable. The Cucumber Mint Martini was pretty good though.
