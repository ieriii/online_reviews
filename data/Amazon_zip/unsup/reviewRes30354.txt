I have been dragged here multiple times by my vegan and vegetarian friends, who swear by the food here. I personally don't love seitan, but have to say that certain things on the menu (mostly the seitan-free items) are pretty good. I occasionally crave the taste of tofu and suggest going here myself. They will actually make you eggs and cook with milk and cheese if you prefer. Brunch here is probably the best meal to head here for. Omelettes with cheese are hard to mess up, even in a potentially vegan restaurant. If you are vegan or vegetarian, then this place is a pretty good option. Also I bought my friend a vegan chocolate cake made by Chicago Diner at Whole Foods for her birthday, and it was not bad!
