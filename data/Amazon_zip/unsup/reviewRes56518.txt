Lovely, lovely, lovely.My last lunch in Chigcago was the best. My family were a little tierd and not as enthusiastic BUT came around as we were treated well and the food was awsome. Unlike some of our other Chicago dining experiences we had excellent value for the price. All the food was prepared with fresh, quality ingredients. Well done - highly reccomended.
