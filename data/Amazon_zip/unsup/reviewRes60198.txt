The food was great and the service was fantastic. Omar, the chef, is culinary school trained and his passion for good food comes through as you watch him make your pizza. The customer service from Omar, Richie and Pedro (delivery guy) was great. We tried two pizzas with half and half: one Chicken Brasil (very good, very cheesy) & Marguerita (tasty, subtle flavors, nice fresh tomatoes on top) and the other was a Bar-B-Que Chicken (very good, especially since I wasn't sure of what to expect from BBQ sauce on pizza) & Pomodoro (also good, the black olives added a nice taste). I'd definitely go back for the pizza but I really want to go back for a non-pizza item as well; the roasted chicken with black beans and rice looked delicious!
