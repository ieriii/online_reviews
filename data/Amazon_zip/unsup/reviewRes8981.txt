This was heaven on a stick (with the stick thoughtfully removed before serving) and some roasted veggies bedded lovingly on delicate tasty dill rice..... My lamb kebab was D-lish. Tender, well seasoned (spicy and flavorful without being too much). I would like the option to have a few more veggies and a little less of that delicious rice, for my waistline's sake, but it was MM-MMM good. Tara, I understand the craze now. I will not go postal on the next person who says 'Oh my Gawd!! Have you TRIED Noon O Kebab??? Eeets SOOO gooooood!!!' - although I may ask them to calm down or suggest they take a vicodin.
