I love Kinzie Chop House, such great, friendly service and good food. The bread baskets are to die for. I love the Goat Cheese Salad, fresh and really great.  I also really like their pasta selections, if you like risotto the Steak Risotto is a great one to try. If it's too busy for a lunch or dinner wait, you can try to be seated at the bar, which isn't so bad for a quick lunch.
