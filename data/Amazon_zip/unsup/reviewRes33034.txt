We recently visited Chicago for a long weekend, and Yolk was our go-to breakfast spot every morning. Yes. It's that good. They've got a lot of fancy-schmancy stuff on the menu, and every thing we tried was great. The purist in me, though, most appreciated the simple stuff they did so well. The pancakes (just the regular old pancakes) were some of the best I've ever had. Fluffy and hot and not too sweet. I also had the oatmeal (twice), and they offered a number of options to jazz things up, like fresh berries and raisins.  It gets busy early, so, unless you don't mind waiting in line, plan on arriving early. Because my kids are for some reason constitutionally incapable of sleeping past 6:30am, we had no problem getting a table.  Because it's so busy, the service can be a little slow, but, for us at least, our servers were always friendly and accommodating (even if a little frazzled at times). The layout of the space is very open, and even when it's crowded it doesn't feel cramped.  Cops apparently love this place. There were always about a dozen of them scattered throughout. So if you're a fugitive, or if cops just make you nervous, beware. You might want to wear a disguise.
