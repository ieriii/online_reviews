I really liked this place! A few of us had dinner there last night and I was very happy with everything I tried. They were sold out of our wine but ex planed it is sold out nation wide so I will forgive them. I split the lobster salad, which is Caramelized Lobster, Lemon Quinoa and basil. It was very good! For dinner I had fish and chips. It rocked. I would really recommend it! My table also ordered the surf and turf which is Sea Bream & Oxtail, Toast and Pesto, also quite good; and the seared Tuna. Any of which would be a good choice. We also had dessert- try the chocolate cake! This place has a good energy and I appreciate the style and theme. Try it!
