First, the four stars average rating here is deceptively low. Check out the negaive reviews - they are almost always because of poor service. If you are at an authentic Chinese restaurant in Chicago Chinatown and expect good (or even moderate) service, you need to go back to P.F. Chang's. You're expecting the wrong thing. This is authentic, ass-kicking, spicy Szechuan food (my mom's family is from Szechuan). I like my food spicy and find the food at the usual Cantonese, northern Chinese, etc. restaurants lacking in spiciness. The food here will may you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you sweat, and it will make your sphincter hate you the next day. And that's a sign of a good meal - when you don't even care when your sphincter punishes you the next day. If you want great service and/or don't like spicy food, go somewhere else. If you want authentic Szechuan food that will make you sweat blood, this is for you.
