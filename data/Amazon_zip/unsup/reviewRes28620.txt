I honestly don't know how anyone could not like this place. Yes the wait sucks, but when it comes down to the food and service, it was simply amazing. Secretly I wish I could have smuggled a big container of the Guacamole home with me, but the damn terrorists have won with the whole no liquids thing. I had the special which was a perfectly cooked leg of lamb on top of a bed of beans. The meat fell off the leg and tasted excellent. Even the gentlemen who was filling up my water said how he would have it every day if he could. Our waiter was friendly and not pretentious nor did he act like I was eating a disney world. If I lived in Chicago, I would go here often...after I would figure out how not to deal with the wait. Bravo! 5 Stars
