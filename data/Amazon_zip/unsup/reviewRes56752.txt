I had my bridal shower at Spacca and I have to say they were wonderful! Jonathan is very helpful, and really knows what he's talking about. The staff on the day was amazing and sweet, so great. The food, of course, is amazing!! I can't recommend this place enough to anyone, it is awesome!!!! They really want there customers to be happy.
