I hate to join the 'what-happened-to-Garcia's' chorus, but really. What happened. A few years back I used to head to the tiny Garcia's fairly frequently, for cheap mexican food and margaritas. I enjoyed that it was small, I enjoyed the more condensed menu. I thought Garcia's to be one of the better, more basic authentic Mexican places on the North side (growing up on the South side and having access to a lot of great Mexican). This is not to say that Garcia's is bad now, it's not, it's just the overall quality that used to be there is not quite there anymore. The service was not great. To be fair, it was busy the night I went, but my table waited maybe 15 minutes before being approached by a server. Yeah no. Chips were meh, salsa was fine. The menu had increased exponentially, maybe this accounted for why I was brought the wrong order. The food was still tasty and priced-right, just now there are definitely some service issues to contend with.
