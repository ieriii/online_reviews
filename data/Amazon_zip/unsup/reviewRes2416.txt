Hot Doug's is just something that you have to experience. Definitely go for the specialties like anything with foie gras or rabbit. Skip the plain stuff like the Wisconsin Bratwurst. The duck fat fries are worth the trip alone. Hopefully, there won't be a line out the door when you go... because it doesn't move that quickly.
