When my friend Kat recommends something, you listen. So when she told me the Irazu oatmeal shake is "legendary," I knew this had to be my first meal stop in Chicago. Lo and behold, Kat was right (as usual). She was so right about it that I feel compelled to publish her rightness in a review, even though this thing is so highly regarded that it will be in the review highlights for all eternity and certainly does not need my help in promoting it. We also ordered a pitcher of guava juice, in which we dumped our BYO Bacardi from the liquor store down the street. This was a tip from our waitress, and she was right: it really is the only way to drink the guava juice. Everything about this place is just right.
