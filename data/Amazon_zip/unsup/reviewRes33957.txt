Went on a Saturday and it was PACKED, so we opted to take out. We waited longer for the take out that it would have it we would have waited for a table. It was really really warm in there, which is understandable but seriously turn up the AC ! But besides that the food was FANTASTIC ! I ordered the Bacon Quesadillas wrap and a strawberry desert crepe, My boyfriend got the south of the border Benny and a banana desert crepe.  Bacon Quesadillas and south of the border Benny were amazing, and still warm even after the drive home. They both came with fresh fruit which was really very very fresh. The crepes weren't the best. Try the fresh OJ, it was de-lish !
