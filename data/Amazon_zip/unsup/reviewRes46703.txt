I love R.J. Grunts. It is something between bar food and a nice restaurant. Everytime I go there, they are super friendly. When I bring people who have never been there before, they get a free (half) dessert. The salad bar is great. It is actually filling and still healthy. Also, try a Magharita, they are huge! Or the warm cookie with icecream...I could go on and on...
