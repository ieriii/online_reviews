Love this place, the pizzas are great, and are thin enough for each person in the party to order one (plus sharing is way more fun). NOTE: a place like this which uses a wood oven, and tosses each pie by hand when ordered, means that the pizzas may not taste exactly the same each time, esp depending on humidity & temp conditions outside. My favorite thing they have is the burrata cheese appetizer, it's not on the daily menu but has been a special every time I've visited, and is wonderful, I highly recommend asking if its available. Good cheese slices while you wait to be seated are available from the hostess, and cannolis on the way out are a nice touch. Easy to park in the lots immediately west of the restaurant.
