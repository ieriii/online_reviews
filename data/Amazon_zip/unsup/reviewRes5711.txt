two words: overrated. i had so many friends who told me to go and said it was good, but emilio's tapas in streeterville or lincoln park is hands down better (it's been my favorite chicago tapas place for over 3 years!). the only especially good food at purple pig was the octopus and beets, but nothing else was particularly fantastic
