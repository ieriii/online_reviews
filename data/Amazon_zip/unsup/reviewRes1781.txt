If only all restaurants were this simple and awesome. Hot Doug's principally does one thing--encased meats--and because they hone in on that one area, they've perfected it. From the foie gras sausage to straight-forward Chicago dog, I've had pretty much everything, and it's all awesome. The duck-fat fries are good, but I prefer to focus on the wieners. Ha ha, I said "weiners." The one star I left off is for attitude. Yeah, this place is awesome, but maybe the owners could do their legions of fans a favor and expand their meager hours, take credit cards, open another location--anything that makes it easier for everyone to get their meat fix. All these limiting factors make it seem Hot Doug harbors this meat-elitist attitude that Chicagoans are DAMNED LUCKY to be getting their precious wieners AT ALL, and they should just SHUT UP, EAT and be HAPPY about it.
