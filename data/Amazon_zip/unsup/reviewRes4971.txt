My lady and I have been wanting to go into this place for a while, so when my birthday rolled around, she took me in for lunch before we went on my annual birthday bender and cubs game. Showed up around 115, and we're promptly sat outside. Took a few minutes for the waiter to showed up, but it was sort of busy so we weren't too concerned. When he came over, he didn't introduce himself, just asked what we wanted, and when we told him we hadn't been there before he just said okay and walked off. If this guy would've put in ANY effort, he could've pushed our tab up another 30-40 bucks. Any way, this apparently is a hip place to get lunch, so bad service was to be expected. So we stared at this menu for a good 15 minutes before our beers showed up, which was pretty good and considering it was spanish paired pretty well with all the pork this place dishes out. We ordered the chorizo stuffed olives, which tasted like deep fried cocktail olives (which they were, our fault,) the neckbone gravy which was really good, the milk braised pork shoulder which was awesome, and the serrano ham on grilled bread and a duck egg which was the ultimate disappointment. I have never eaten such a salty dish in my life. And it wasn't the ham, it was the seemingly fistful of rocksalt sprinkled over the egg. I couldn't eat it and my girlfriend, who's kind of picky and took forever for me to convince to try a duck egg beforehand, looked at me like I was crazy. When I mentioned it to my server, asking why it was so salty, he told me the ham is supposed to be salty. I asked him if the ham is salty, why all the salt on top, he just looked at me. I told him he could take it away and to please bring the check. Believe it or not, the check came almost instantaneously, fastest I'd seen him move all day. So disappointed.
