I've been here a few times, including the cupcake crawl of '07. (Strange I thought I had written a review at the time) I've had their sandwiches, cupcakes and brownies. The actual bakery seems a little cramped, but come warmer weather there is more than ample space outside and their loungey coffee shop atmosphere room next door. The sandwich I got was a very tasty tomato, pesto and fresh mozzarella on a wonderful crusty bread. The bread was great, the mozzarella was tasty and the rest was good. The cupcakes I thought were good, but a little too much for me. When I think of a cupcake I think of a little cake that I can eat in three or five bites, here they are a little dense, much more like a small cake, (yes, I know that cupcakes were originally meant to be tester cake portions...), but a little overwhelming. Their brownies are ok, not great, but ok. The service can be okay too, I've had really great service, but also slow service with a meh kinda attitude. A little out of my way, but I don't mind stopping by here when in the area.
