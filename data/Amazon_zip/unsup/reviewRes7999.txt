Ever since the restaurant expanded, it has been a lot easier to enjoy these delicious pizzas. Plentiful seating inside and out on a quiet street. My favorite: the quattro formaggi, for the cheese fan. No sauce to contend with. Just four melty cheeses. It comes out in minutes (all pizzas do) with a perfectly thin, just a little burnt, crust. Try to go Friday-Sunday. Usually one of their special appetizers is burrata, a fresh mozzarella with sea salt. Delicious.
