The longer I live in Chicago, the more I want to eat stuffed pizza. On this particular visit, we had actually intended to try Gino's East or Edwardo's, but we were hungry early and Giordano's was the only one open at 11. I've been to a different location before, and thought it was good, but nothing special. Unfortunately, I have the same opinion this time. Plain and simple: the mozzarella sticks were lukewarm, and the pizza was under-seasoned. And yes, I agree that it is smart to have large drink glasses so you don't have to fill them up AS OFTEN, but that doesn't mean they should be filled up once and completely neglected thereafter. Just sayin'. Probably shouldn't have given it a second try, but oh well. I'll know better next time.
