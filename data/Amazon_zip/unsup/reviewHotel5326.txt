We had our wedding reception at The Doubletree in June 2012. The Doubletree and our coordinator Slavyana did an amazing job on our wedding. They were very accomodating and there to make sure all of our dreams came true! I was set on modern downtown chicago wedding without spending an astronomical amount of money and the Doubletree was the BEST choice for us. The cocktail hour on the 5th floor pool deck was super unique, we got rave reviews from guests on the food, and the ballroom was beautiful! There is only one ballroom so you don't have to share your wedding day with another couple. I even had my original catering manager leave her position 3 months before my wedding and the new manager, Slavyana, did EVERYTHING to make me feel comfortable and taken care of with lots of attention to detail. We used this venue guest accomodations as well. I docked a star for service not for the event itself but for the hotel reservations desk. They were very slow, did not seem to know alot that was going on, and our discounted parking was very messed up. Also the elevators stopped working the morning after so everyone had to take the stairs down 20+ floors. I hope they get better because it can be a great go to hotel for the area!
