I am updating my review to give this place 4 stars from 3. The service here is really great, the owner/manager is super friendly. Everybody is super friendly. The food is really good. Since my last review, I've been back a few more times and tried various noodle soup dishes, and they're all super tasty. I still like the lotus fried rice. Prettier but no nonsense good tasting vietnamese food. The place is BYOB. Awesome right? I give 5 stars for the best of the best, this is pretty close up there.
