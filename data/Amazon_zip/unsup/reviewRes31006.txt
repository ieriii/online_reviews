Loved it. Great selection. Fresh ingredients, friendly service and lively atmosphere.  The chips with chedder and truffle dip was amazing. Hush puppies were ok, not as fluffly as I'd like. The chilaquiles were fantastic. All the food leaving the pass looked delicious. Would definitely come back.  It gets busy for breakfast/brunch.
