So, I finally made it here after living in Chicago for four years for college. I went with the traditional hotdog without the sport peppers. The hotdog was great, super tasty and fresh. The toppings were also fresh and in just the right proportions, they even honored my request for ketchup. It was pretty late and we didn't want to eat in the car so we walked up and ordered and sat in the room adjacent to the walk up service window. The chocolate malt was absolutely excellent, satisfied my sweet tooth and my chocolate cravings. The only thing I didn't like were the fries. Some of them were good, some of them were burnt, and some didn't even look like fries. I'm super picky with my fries so it's no surprise that I didn't like them. $5.50 for a hotdog and fries is a bit much but then again, I think most things are too expensive and this hotdog was amazing. I'm looking forward to trying more delicious fatty things in the future.
