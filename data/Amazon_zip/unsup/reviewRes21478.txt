My husband and I are doing a "Chicago Hot Dog Tour" this summer - aka, trying a new hot dog stand once a week. We've lived in Chicago for years and never really gotten into Chicago style hot dogs, so now is the time. Superdawg was stop #1 on the tour. I must say, it's food held up to it's reputation. We both got the Superdawg, which was great. I loved eating it with a pickle. The fries were pretty good, though Chick-fil-a's waffle fries have them beat by a long shot. We also got a chocolate malt, which was good 'n thick. Though it tasted more like a shake rather than a malt. The one complaint I do have is the service. The woman who took our order at the walk-up window was very short with us and not very friendly. Also, we had no idea it was cash only until we overheard another patron say so, which was after we ordered. Good thing you don't have to pay 'til you get your food, so my husband had time to get to the ATM at the gas station next door. There is also an ATM in the attached dining room. So Superdawg, I think you were pretty super. But we'll see how you stand up against other Chicago hot dog stands in the coming weeks.
