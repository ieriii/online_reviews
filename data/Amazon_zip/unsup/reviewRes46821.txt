OK, with 500+ reviews there is little I could add but I can't resist putting in my 2cents.. I came here out of curiosity mostly because I had enjoyed going to the original in Wrigleyville 5 or 6 years ago. I wanted to see what the greenest restaurant in America was like. It was all good. The other reviews make that clear. The food was good, not too expensive, and somewhat creative. The service was professional and attentive and friendly enough. The ambiance was cool, the art was good. The biggest negative was something that comes with the territory when you go to a popular and yes, trendy new restaurant: it was crowded and noisy. I really wanted to carry on a conversation with my new friend. The only way we could hear each other was to lean in and talk in uncomfortably loud tones. So don't come here during busy hours and expect to be able to carry on a normal conversation. Of course in the green spirit, you could just mouth words and use the recycled conversation all around you:))
