I once waited for 2 1/2 hours in the freezing snow for this place. I had frost bite, the menu memorized, and was covered in frozen drool by the time I got in, but it was WORTH IT. The duck sausage with foie and truffle mustard? Gave me a total mouth boner. God, I love this place. As a side note, I taught a high school food studies class and ordered gourmet dogs for the kids to try (which they loved) and Doug gave me over 50 dogs FOR FREE. Because he's a giver. The only thing that sucks about this place is the hours, but I'm willing to deal it with for those amazing sausages.
