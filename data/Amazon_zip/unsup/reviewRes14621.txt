My husband and I went to 90 Miles Cuban Cafe for a late lunch today. We shared a fish soup, the Cuban sandwich, the Lechon sandwich and a side order of fried plantains. I"m not a big fan of fish soup but the one I had today was really delicious. I really liked the Cuban sandwich, and my husband loved the Lechon (very big with lots of pulled pork). The plantains were yummy, too. We topped it off with Cuban coffee and one empanada filled with cheese and guava. The service was very friendly and helpful. Couldn't get any better!
