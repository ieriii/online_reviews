Holy smokes, this place is incredible. I just went back to eating vegetarian, so dinner here was kind of an unintentional last hurrah for my meat-eating days, and i couldn't have asked for a better one. The portions are huge and cheap and the different barbecued meats are absolutely delicious, especially the pork - they barely even need the tasty sauces. They are insanely busy so service is not the quickest ever at peak times, but it seriously doesn't matter. If you have a large group, make sure you call ahead of time for a reservation or you'll never eat!!
