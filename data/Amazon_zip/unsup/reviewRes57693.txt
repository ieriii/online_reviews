O V E R R A T E D but good! I really wanted to belive in this place. No exxageration but almost everyone I know says this is the best. I have to disagree, and so does my husband, mother in law and my son. We came here on a Tuesday night (raining and freezing) and it was crowded. We were seated fast which was a huge plus. I ordered the carne asada dinner with one enchilada. I WAS NOT A FAN AT ALL of the enchilada. It was made with american cheese EW, I only know this because I asked. I took one bite and BLAH! The carne asada was fantastic to say the least, tender, juicy, flavorful and flat out great. (Best part of my meal)Frijoles were a big pro as well. I couldnt stop eating them.Guacamole -EH (could be better) Warm Horchata? huh? yes. warm.Arroz (rice) was ok, it seemed instant actually. Tacos- tortilla is fried in the meat drippings which makes this the best part of it, they use the cheapy meat that reminds you of dog meat in china, it had a lot of fat and was pretty gross if you ask me. AND they didnt have any soup. They have about 6 on the menu but none when we got there, huge con.Will I eat here again? ONLY if I was in the neighborhood. THERE ARE A TON of other better Authentic Mexican places to eat in Chicago. This was def. not on my list at one of the best.
