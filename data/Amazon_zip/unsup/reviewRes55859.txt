Indian food this good is hard to come by. Nan, tandoori?? Delicious! Took my gf here and she is pretty picky about certain types of cuisine. I though i would have a hard time getting her to appreciate indian food, but not with this place...the food was hot, fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly and very accommodating...definitely coming back and bringing her again. it's always nice to turn someone on to something new and find out they actually enjoy it just as much as you do.
