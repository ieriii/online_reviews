Without repeating too much that has already been said, the choices here for deep dish are amazing. The toppings are delicious, the tomato sauce is superb, and the beer choices are excellent also. You've got to get some Pequod's if you live anywhere near here, or can make the trip. Make an afternoon out of it and go see a movie at the theater across the street afterward. (maybe before, the pizza and beer might put you to sleep)
