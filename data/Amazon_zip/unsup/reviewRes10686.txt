Piece is amazing! Their pizza and the beer they brew in house are killer. The atmosphere is fun and the location is great. Their salsa appetizer and greens salad are also fantastic, I've never had a bad experience here. Piece will change your view on toppings. If you've never had basil on pizza this is the place to do it.
