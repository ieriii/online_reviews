Food at the Gage is consistently good. Ordered the scallops salad on my last visit-- the shellfish was cooked perfectly--tender and tasty--served over broccoli rabe which added a beautiful and slightly bitter counterpoint to the creamy smooth taste of the scallops. The wine was terrific.. we ordered a Pinot Blanc to start --that was refreshing and citrusy. Finished with a Cabernet blend that was knock your socks off amazing...just wish I could remember the name of it!! My only complaint-- the noise level! The Gage has a lot of hard surfaces and tile--that seem to magnify crowd noise. I was sitting right next to my dinner partner and we had to shout to hear each other. That is partly because there was a particularly loud table of what appeared to be drunken radio DJ's with bellowing voices-- nearby... The super-loud atmosphere subtracted from what would have been an otherwise lovely experience.
