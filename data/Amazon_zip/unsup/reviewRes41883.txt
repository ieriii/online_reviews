Gilt Bar was the site of the 'last supper' - my chosen restaurant to share one last intimate dinner with some of my favorite people before moving to Austin. The short story: It's exquisite. It would be easy to get lost in a menu devoted to indulgently-remixed rustic fare, but then there's those 29 other extravagant details or so - sweeping chandeliers that outdo even chandeliers, the luminous lighting, brilliantly-crafted couture cocktails, that super sexy downstairs lounge (check, please!), the (beautiful) people watching and... oh right, Gilt Bar is possibly the most distracting room on the Chicago culinary circuit. AND I LOVE IT. You've got to get some - food, that is. Take what is yours to be had! From the dimepiece mussels (they taste as good as they look), to the tenderloin steak tartare with poached egg to the roasted bone marrow, this is serious, full-on eating. A place where a real man brings a real woman - no lettuce pushers here! If less is less and more is more, then Gilt Bar is the coquette who can't stop toying with the art of exaggeration - in even a hedonistic world, Gilt is the guilty pleasure. J'adore!
