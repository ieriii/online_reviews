I've only been here once so havent tried enough of the menu. But I had the breakfast sandwich which was good. Is it worth a 20-30minute wait for? Probably not. The menu looks very typical (breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, etc). My potatoes were good but nothing special. The salad with the breakfast sandwich was just leaves...nothing great. Overall, a good brunch place but nothing special.
