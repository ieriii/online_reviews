Can I say.... SEXIEST SHOWER EVER. This place is beaaauuutiful, the rooms are stunning and the shower is AMAZING... giant room with gorgeous tile, double-headed shower that makes you feel like you're under a waterfall. Super comfortable beds, 2 giant flatscreen tv's, floor to ceiling windows.. 2 small balconies overlooking the city. Upstairs lounge was also super fun, we went on a Thursday and it was more chilled out, older crowd and not so great DJ. On Saturday it was totally opposite... super pumped up crowd, great DJ, lots of energy and lots of sexy young people. A room in the hotel directly across from the club was rented and there was a girl dancing in her shorts and bra in the room for everyone to see... FUN!! The staff working at the Dana were also amazing, very friendly and helpful. The doorman (didn't get his name, young man with braids) was super friendly and cheerful every morning, and our bellhop T.J. was also super friendly and helpful. Great bartenders, friendly receptionists... All around an amazing experience which made my stay in Chicago absolutely special. Gym is nice, small but does the trick. A few treadmills and bikes, and some strength training equipment. The cardio machines have tv's with headphone jacks so I was happy : )
