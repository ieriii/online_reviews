A friend and I went to Icosium on a Friday evening (around 7) and quickly got ourselves a table. The place was busy but not packed and we were quickly asked what we would like to drink and nicely given more time to figure out what we wanted to eat. I went with the Greek crepe while my companion went with the Icosium crepe. Both of us ate the entirety of our meal...which was a good deal for 8.50...I added the Halal Merguez (lamb sausage) to mine for an additional 2.99 and I wasn't disappointed. In fact there was nothing disappointing about the experience. Turkish coffee, check. Heaping crepes, check. Great value, check.
