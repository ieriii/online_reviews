I have grown up in the area for just about my entire life. So needless to say, I understand what Chicago pizza is about (hate to sound like a jerk but it is what it is). So here it goes before I go any further. This is NOT Chicago style pizza. I have told friends not to go here and expect deep dish. Piece is pretty up front about that since they come right out & say it. There's Chicago, New York & the style they make- New Haven style. The best way to understand this is that the crust is more flat than thin. The way the dough is made and how it's cooked are totally different methods of cooking (that's a story in itself; I believe they call it "apizza"). The texture is closest to Neapolitan style. The sauce is also a bit different and you choose from the following: red (tomato sauce and mozzarella pizza), plain a traditional New Haven pizza, a generous amount of red sauce topped with garlic, extra parmesan and olive oil (This pizza does not have mozzarella.) & white plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese. I kept my pizza somewhat simple- I went with red. Now things get expensive once you start adding other toppings. I added sausage & mushrooms ($2.00/each). Still, the taste was very good. The rest of the menu is pretty straight forward- 4 sandwiches, 4 appetizers, 3 salads and 5 deserts. Portions are quite good as well. I was fortunate during my visit since I went at an off peak time. While I don't live in the city, I would visit here if I were in the area. My only complaint is that quarters getting tight as the evening went on. All and all, this celebrity owned business (Cheap Trick's Rick Nielsen is part owner) is pretty well run. A very nice change of pace for me.
