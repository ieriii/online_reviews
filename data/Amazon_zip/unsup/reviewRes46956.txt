The only thing good about this place is the mac and cheese. Otherwise, the staff is pretentious, unhelpful, and ignore you unless you wave your menu and beg them to take your drink and food order. Mind you, I was sitting at the bar. Maybe I needed a little more cleavage, I dunno. Bartender was bored and boring. The most he said was that they only serve water upon the customer asking because they are so Eco-Friendly/Chic. Blah blah this place is an overpriced bag o' wind. Not returning.
