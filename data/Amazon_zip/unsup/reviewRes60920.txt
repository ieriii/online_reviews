I really enjoyed Bin 36. I must say the big open space is really cool. I'm a novice to wine but i enjoy it, so we let the waiter guide us with which flights of wine to try. The waiter also suggested a cheese flight to go with the wines, and everything was great. There are so many wines and cheeses there you would have to go there a bunch of times to try them all. Great place to go after work with a group of friends. My group had a great time and will be going back soon.
