We came here for a drink after dinner someplace else and before heading off to a bar to see a band so I can only comment on the drinks and the "speakeasy." I think my husband was more enamored with drinking in a room designated the "speakeasy" than anything. The girl down there was very nice and suggested I try the Death's Door Daisy (death's door vodka, aperol, st. germain, lemon). My husband tried some sort of rum runner/pina colada-y drink that I can't find online now. There were a handful of tables filled with couples or groups of 4 and it did take a little while to get our drinks. We weren't in a hurry and we were chatting so it didn't really bother us. She brought over a carafe of water while we were waiting which was nice too. My drink was great but I think I could have only had one, it was incredibly tart. It was what I was in the mood for but couldn't see making a night out of this drink without some serious heartburn around 3am. I wish they had a small dessert or appetizer menu down here since the upstairs was packed and I was in the mood for a small bite but I understand. Overall, it was a cool vibe to relax with a drink and your special friend.
