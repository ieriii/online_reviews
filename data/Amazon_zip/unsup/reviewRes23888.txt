Good experience overall! Free valet (plus your courteous tip, of course), and they were pretty quick with returning the car and didn't leave us waiting in the cold for very long. Wait staff watches your table like a hawk (not in the creepy disturbing way) - we were very impressed by their attentiveness and promptness. We did not wait at all for a table, though it seemed relatively busy for a Wednesday night. Food was pretty good. Tried a chicken and lemon-y soup, plus fried calamari, for starters. The soup gets high marks for authenticity, and the calamari high marks for fried deliciousness. The bread was not warm or crusty, though the provided olive oil satisfied. Entrees are reasonably priced and the portions range from adequate to monstrous, depending on your appetite for cheese and pastry. Food was flavorful and appetizing. Desserts were a little bit of a letdown - the spice cake was dry and lacked some essential flavor, though the tiramasu was pretty good. Be aware that there is no soda fountain, only bottled soft drinks. For a low-key evening with some friends, I'd go again.
