You could not pay me to go back to this place. The server was absolutely horrible. I have never experienced anything so uncomfortable and never been treated so terrible in my life. The amount of money we spent was fine, however, the food was not even that good and the server actually talked crap about us in the corner the entire meal. For that money, i should be at least told 'thank you'. Not to add drama, but it was my mother's birthday (she is a chef) and her only request was to have dinner here and she even got a hotel to come. She was disappointed and my father was insulted by the wait staff. One star is too much. Never go.
