I love this place. Lovely decor. Fun music.Very fresh nigiri/sashimi, 2 pieces per order. Creative and delicious maki rolls.The sushi rice is firm and substantial.It's BYOB which adds to the value pricing of the place in general. I generaly stick to sushi there but I really like their curry dishes.
