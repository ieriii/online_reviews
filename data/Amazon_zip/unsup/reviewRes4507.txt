We came here for the weekly poetry slam. Not only did we get barked at by the crazy old bartender lady upon entering, but we also got hustled out of $6 for the poetry slam/music performance by some chick and her band. The venue itself is very nice- cozy booths lined all around the place and a large central bar. The place filled up by 7:30pm and by 8pm people had to stand or set up folding chairs around the floor. The host is an extremely nice and funny guy but the slam was still a little too yuppie for me.
