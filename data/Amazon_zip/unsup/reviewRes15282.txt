The wait was long, but the drinks were rockin'. The music is loud, the lights low, and the high-backed chairs super comfy. In short, come here with a small group or a date, but not with a large group because it's hard to hear and the seating's not great for big groups. I had an Old-fashioned and the Boy had a Juliet & Romeo and In the Pines; we loved all three, but we're scotch and gin fans. I've had many an old-fashioned and this was definitely one of the best -- right down to the large cube of ice, lemon peel, and expertly balanced ingredients. I highly recommend you come here and try as many cocktails as you can--you won't be disappointed. Oh, and the house rules are sassy (samples: No Grey Goose. No Cosmopolitans.) and you can bring a copy home, printed on a postcard.
