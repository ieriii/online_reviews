One of the only times I went to Chicago and didn't eat here was because I was getting over a really bad case of the flu and I knew I wouldn't be able to enjoy the food (it also gave me an excuse to go more than once on my next visit!). As someone who has worked in restaurants for over 10 years this place is run really well, you don't wait too long for the food and the service has always been awesome. I'm a fan of the california reuben and the entire breakfast menu. I've never eaten anything here that I didn't like. I would cry if this place ever closed down. For you out of towners I suggest picking up a recipe book. It's loaded with awesome recipes that even a novice cook can make. Also, the wait can be long on the weekends during lunch and dinner hours but I've gone in the mid-afternoon and I've been seated right away.
