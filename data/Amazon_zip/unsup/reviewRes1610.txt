You gotta love Hot Doug's! The duck fat frites (served only on Fridays and Saturdays) are so fabulous, they're worth a trip in themselves. Be prepared to stand in line for quite some time and then fight for a table, but I promise you, it's worth it. The food is inventive...think reindeer dogs at Christmas time, and other exotic "encased meats" like buffalo on a weekly basis. Of course, they have the standards as well.  Doug himself takes the orders most of the time and is super bad ass for becoming the first restauranteur to be slapped with a fine for serving foie gras after the ban. Imagine...foie gras at a hot dog stand! Last time we were there, we ended up standing next to the old Tribune food critic and a recognized travel author who ended up sharing a table with us. Everyone comes here because it's the best! A few words of warning: be careful of the strange hours Doug's keeps. I guess when you're the best, you can be open as you please. Also, bring cash.
