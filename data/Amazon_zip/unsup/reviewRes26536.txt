I went here for Restaurant Week and the food was great as was the price. My only complaint is that the service was extremely slow. I visited during lunch and there were only 4 other tables, yet somehow our meal lasted 2 hours! Based on food alone I would have given this 4 stars but a 2 hour lunch for 2 people is ridiculous.
