My friend and I came here after a nice dinner for coffee and dessert. I was so excited to find a place like this in my neighborhood, but I was shocked at how rude our waiter was. I think he was the bartender (tall with black hair - looked like he worked out). It made you wonder what was going on. He was nasty, condescending and confrontational, and we were friendly! If I were a guy, I totally would have punched him out. I felt like I was on that MTV show, Boiling Point. The place seemed okay otherwise, but it was hard to tell, because the guy was such a jerk.
