This place is cute. I went here with 2 friends. Two of us are gluten intolerant and I heard that this place had some gluten-free items on the menu. I was SOOO excited to see that I could get a hamburger with a gluten-free bun! For 6 years, I had been eating hamburgers without the bun. So this was heaven. It was really good. But I got sick later...so some gluten must have snuck into my meal. The service was good, besides the gluten mishap. It's a cozy yet very spacious place. I recommend Wildfire, unless you have a gluten intolerance.
