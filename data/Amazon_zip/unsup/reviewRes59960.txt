Having been to both Miami & Colombia, I can say this place has great Colombian food. I love the bandeja paisa, but they have great steak plates as well. I'd never had baby octopi, but they were great too. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere, which includes lots of Colombian art, is very nice. Drinks are good too. Can get a bit loud at times though.
