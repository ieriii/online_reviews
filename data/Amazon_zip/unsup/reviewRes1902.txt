I love hot dogs more than anyone else I have ever met, and the Chicago style hot dog is solely to blame for that. I now eat 4+ dogs a week and have my friends concerned about my nitrate intake. Pish posh... That being said, Hot Doug's serves up the best hot dog I have ever had in my life. That is a pretty bold statement. They have everything you could ever want, and if they have it on the menu, the Venison dog is something I would fly back just to get. Honestly, the quality of the duck fat fries is self-explanatory. They will make you swear off fries from elsewhere altogether. They aren't always on the menu, so it's not to say the regular fries arent great... They are about a 9/10. Not to mention that Doug is the man. I love this guy, he's always right out front and resembles Jon Favreau in big glasses, I want to be his best friend. Not only that but a buddy of mine is scheming to get Doug and his sister together to get him into the family. Can't say I blame him.
