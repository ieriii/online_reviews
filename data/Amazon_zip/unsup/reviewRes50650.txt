Great for breakfast/brunch, but the dinner experience is unspectacular. Not bad, just sort of undistinguished in a way that fills you with regret one-third of the way through your Chilean sea bass or what have you. Onto their strengths: Brunch. On weekends, come early or late; if you hit the place on a Sunday at 11:00 just as the post-church crowd is cresting, the wait, ironically, can come to resemble Purgatory. The staff do their best to be accommodating, but there's just no good way to deal with the crush of dozens of people and kids arriving simultaneously. If you avoid the rush, you're in for a satisfying experience. The service has been at worst passable and at best excellent, with the usual cruising altitude somewhere around "quite good." But the decor is frankly disturbing, especially the mural that depicts some kind of monstrous chicken laying an egg as it menaces innocent patrons with its googly-eyed visage -- and the egg is still encased in some kind of horrific membrane connected to the chicken's birthing orifice. Not an image conducive to enjoying breakfast. That doesn't say to me "folksy Southern charm"; it says "the part near the end of Aliens when Ripley blows up the queen's egg sac." Menu highlights: Crunchy French toast, corn cakes, crawfish cakes, omelets, grits, and mashed sweet potatoes. Menu lowlight: The crab cakes, which smelled unnervingly like warm garbage the single time I had them. Avoid. A great place overall, but they need to a) revamp their crab cakes and b) tear that chicken mural off the wall, chop it into fragments, burn it, and bury the ashes on holy ground.
