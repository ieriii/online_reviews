I've only gotten food delivered from here but it was absolutely great.I was craving Pho noodles really bad so I searched for the places that serves pho here on yelp. Simply It was the first one on the result list.I checked their menu online, saw that it was reasonably priced so I gave them a call. The guy on the phone was really nice. I asked him how much the minimum was for the delivery and he said not to worry about it. I ordered the beef pho (I was craving tripe or meatballs but didn't see it on the menu) and avocado cream cheese wonton things. The delivery came very quickly and when I checked the contents inside, I saw a small styrofoam box labeled complimentary. When I opened it, to my surprise it contained an assortment of fruits (orange, pineapple, and strawberry). It made an awesome little dessert after my meal. Pho was great although I wish they gave me a little bit more veggies. Avocado cream cheese things were on the bland side but passable. I can't wait to try their food in person.
