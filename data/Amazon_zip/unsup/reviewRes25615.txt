Nice atmosphere, but I think it's quite expensive for what you get. You really pay for the atmosphere more than the food. Maybe I'm not into the fondue thing as it was my first time. I had to lower my rating to 2 starts because coffee is one of the items that is included with the meal. I was there with my girlfriend who preferred tea and asked to substitute. We were told that coffee comes with the meal and tea would cost extra. Hmm. A $42 meal and can't substitute coffee for tea? Come on. Really? That's enough to cause me to not return...
