First time at Glenn's. Somewhat curious about the bar-they have Tangueray (and vodkas) but can't make Martinis. Settled for simply Tangueray on the rocks, but no olives?? Ok, ok. Had the Smoked Trout dip for appetizer. Very creamy and delicious. A very generous portion as well.  What a great selection of fresh fish! Pricey, but that's to be expected. I chose to try the Mahi Mahi and was not disappointed. It was paired with some very buttery roasted fingerling potatoes and steamed broccoli, which is just steamed broccoli :). It was an awesome early summer evening and we dined outside. A city-boy here, I live the bustle going on all around. If you're bothered by the distractions (especially the Brown Line el constantly intruding on your conversation,) you might want to eat inside. The service we found to be very good. This was a Wednesday evening and early and moderately busy. Overall it was a great dining experience. Will be coming back again.
