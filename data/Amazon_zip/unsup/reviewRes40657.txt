I don't think I need to add anything about the Pho (it's amazing, order the beef on the side if you want it medium rare), but I am compelled after my recent visit to send a shout out to the Simmered Marinated Pork (#189). It's braised bacon... I think. Or something really similar and totally delicious. I can't even describe it, you just have to order it. I love this place. Also, much love to the fried spring rolls, especially the shrimp ones. I miss you.
