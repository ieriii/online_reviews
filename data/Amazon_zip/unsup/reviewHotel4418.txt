Got an unbelievable price of 90$ per night thro priceline. Then, upgraded to concierge level for 40$ more.. Totally worth it! Concierge level gets a free breakfast, which is an extensive spread!. Also, the toiletries are super! Beds are great. Views can vary depending on your rooms location. Great location as well.
