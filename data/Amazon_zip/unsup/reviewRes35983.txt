I've been twice in the last two weeks and enjoyed both meals. I see what the hype is about. A few highlights of these visits: -The wait wasn't ridiculous for a saturday or sunday around 1230 pm (about 30 min) -The hostesses and waitresses are always friendly -Tofu scramble, breakfast quinoa, avocado smoothies were tasty - so I can have some element of health without sacrifice even on the weekend As Tony the Tiger would say.... GRREAT!
