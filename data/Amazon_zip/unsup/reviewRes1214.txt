I gotta say these are the fanciest hot dogs I have ever eaten. They are also the ONLY hot dogs I have stood in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes for! It was hilarious that the people directly behind me and ahead of me werent even from Chicago! The couple in front of me had landed into Chicago from LA and decided to come straight to Hot Doug's from Ohare. Thats craziness. The guys behind me came from Louisville, KY and headed to Hot Dougs after getting lost in Gary, IN. Thats lunacy. But our curiosity for these hot dogs bonded us together! The variety this place has is amazing. They have 11 items on their menu not including the specials. I tried the Thai spicy sausage with seaweed salad. It was SPICY! But very tasty. The sauce also had some wasabi in it. I'm not a fan of wasabi but was very impressed at how the flavors of everything meshed. I also ordered the cheese fries. I had a taste of the duck fried fries and I personally thought the cheese fries were better than the regular duck fries. But hey, anything fried cant be bad right? The place is small but the atmoshere was very nice. It didnt feel too crowded at all in the confined area we were in. A great tourist attraction! I would definitely come back on a warmer day to try some of the other hot dogs.
