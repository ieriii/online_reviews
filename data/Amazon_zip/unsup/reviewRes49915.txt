Being a vegetarian I was surprised to like a Colombian steakhouse as much as I do - but the great service and beautiful room go a long way to make up for the limited vegetarian menu. I had some great appetizers (empanadas and plantains are both delicious with the sauces meant for steak, by the way) and the vegetarian paella which was a little lackluster for my taste. A third of the plate was mushrooms, which would not have been a bad thing if they weren't all white mushrooms, cut thick and undercooked. My date seemed to enjoy his skirt steak a lot. I told him it was dangerous to lick a skillet, but he's a daredevil he is. Luckily a delicious mojito was close at hand to soothe his third degree tongue-burns.
