My mom makes me go to this place, but I don't mind it. I am not vegetarian or vegan, but the meatless options are very flavorful and I don't miss the meat. We had vegetable tortilla soup, gyoza dumplings, the reuben and a chocolate cake. The waiter was very nice and accommodating. They also have a much improved beer list which is a wonderful thing.
