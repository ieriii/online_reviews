The pastas were tremendous...Best sauces I have had in a while and I grew up In NYC....Pasta was cooked perfectly El Dente....The prices were even more surprising,,,There are not too many places in Chicago, let alone in Lincoln Park where you can get a bowl of pasta for less than 10 dollars...My only complaint was that the calamari should be served with marinara sauce, not cold cocktail sauce (Change that please) We will return again and again
