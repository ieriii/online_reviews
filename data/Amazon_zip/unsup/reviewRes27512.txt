My family loves Pequod's. It is one of their favorite pizza companies of all times. I have been on the fence for awhile because I was not sure if I really did enjoy their caramelized signature crust. I used to think it was too burnt for my liking. Yesterday, on a Saturday, I ordered a small pan pizza with garlic and spinach for take out. Service: The place was packed, but when I made my way to the order desk, they had several people on hand to assist. Serving size: My roommate and I shared the small pan pizza and it was the right am amount of food without overeating and we were pretty hungry to begin with. This pizza smelled amazing. I was tempted on the ride home to take a bite, but I resisted. When I took a bite at home, I was speechless. The caramelized crust is ingenious and really gives the pizza a delicious and unique taste. They are now in my top 3 favorite pizza places of all times. If you have not tried it, do it.
