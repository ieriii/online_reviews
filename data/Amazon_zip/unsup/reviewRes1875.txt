It was my first time here and it was amazing! I ordered a regular dog and a foie gras dog. Both were excellent. I was hesitant to try the foie gras dog but after taking a bite out of it I was very surprised to find it quite delicious and extremely savory. The garlic aioli combined with the foie gras was divine. The duck fat fries were also very good. They were crunchy and not too salty. They are a definite must-try item :D
