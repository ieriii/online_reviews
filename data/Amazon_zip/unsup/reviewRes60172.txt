Haven't been back here for the past 2+ years. For some reason I got sick of their Pho twice. Everything else are fine and decent tasting with reasonable pricing. You gotta give it to them on the number of dishes on their menu. If you're an indecisive person, the menu can be a little intimidating. Probably will go back and give the Pho another try one of the these days.
