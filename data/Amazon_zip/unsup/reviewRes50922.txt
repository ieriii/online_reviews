I went on Saturday around noon so I wasn't too surprised to see about 10 people milling around at the front when I walked in, but was delighted that because we were only two people, they could seat us right away. We were seated in the back alcove by the bar with all the other couples. It was a bit of a tight squeeze, but totally manageable (even better if you like eavesdropping on people's conversations). The decor is a trip... lots of fun stuff to look at. Our server wasn't the best, but he didn't mess up our order or act rudely. Plus, it was a busy brunch so I didn't expect special attention. I do wish he had thought to ask if I wanted more iced tea BEFORE we had paid the bill, but oh well. Huge, overwhelming menu. I finally decided on the red eggs and was very pleased with my choice. Yummy corn muffin too! I'll definitely go back and try something different. Oh, and I drove there and found parking only about a block away which was another huge plus, especially since it was raining.
