Hotel was awesome. Very clean. Pool was great. Lots of rules but that's what makes is so clean. Health club and sauna so clean. There is so much to do at this hotel. Pizza in lobby restaurant is so tasty. Front desk manger Gerald was so helpful. Barnard helped us with all our needs in the lounge on the 17 floor. Make sure you get a room that you have the privilege to use the longe it has a great breakfast and a great cocktail reception. Oh I forgot to mention Sarah in marketing who help me with all my reservations. Thanks again Radison... I will be back Forsure Mercedes
