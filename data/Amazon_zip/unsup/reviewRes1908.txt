I love this place! Yah, yah...the hot dogs are good, that's a given. But what I find the most interesting is that the owner, Doug himself, tends to the register every time they're open. Okay, but back to the hot dogs--they're delicious! Every day the menu varies, but I cross my fingers for BLT. Yah, the line is long but that just proves how good it is and it's definitely worth the wait.
