BAM!!! 5 stars, done and done. This is probably the most amazing place ever to have been planted on Planet Earth. It's all vegetarian/vegan food but not like what you bloodsucking meat eaters are thinking... no, it's not all salads and veggie plates, quite the contrary. I love meat. I mean, I f-ing love it. My friends have bought me socks with pics of meat on them because I love it sooo much. However, this past August I gave up on delicious meat for the (damn) environment and some weight loss wishes. It's been very hard with my meat cravings and the best way I could describe it is that Chicago Diner is a veggie diner for people who LOVE meat. The first time I went I was craving some down & dirty Arby's beef and cheddar sandwiches so I ordered their beef and cheddar... FABU! Heaven in my mouth. Honest to God. We also had Nachos with vegan chorizo, bbq and buffalo hot wings... God himself would cream his pants over those babies... enchiladas, a gyro to go, a Reuben to go... seriously, I could go on. We ate so much f-ing food it was insane. It's crazy how all these non-meat & nondairy products taste just like meat. Uncanny. I could truly go on forever. It is a bit cramped inside but get over it, it's a diner. The staff are so friendly and I like that none of the staff let any tables go unnoticed... they all check on everyone. It's a wonderful display of teamwork that I greatly appreciate. Oh, did I mention that the staff are all very attractive- cha ching! One last thing, the dessert... INSANE. You will die. Just f-ing die. Do yourself a favor and get a piece of vegan cake (if they have it, German chocolate... you'll need to change your pants after you eat it... in a good way). After you eat your vegan cake order another one to go... you'll be infinitely happy with yourself for it. PS- if you don't like this place, clearly you are a jack ass.
