This place is damn close to my infatuation with Kohan Sushi. Well it trumps Kohan in the romantic department. This place makes me feel kinda sexy: perfect lighting, comfy seating to put me at ease, dark woods to warm the room. Even their website is sexy. Musts: get the house warm sake! and start with the jalapeno miso soup.. just be prepared for the kick with that soup, and make sure your water is at hand for the kick. What I've tried in my last two visits: boston trio roll, maki mexicano roll, oedipus roll, emerald roll, and hmmm I forget the last... but they were all great! I appreciate the creativity of the rolls. At times those ends were a bit fancy to chew on though. As great as they were I did not salivate as I do for Kohan. But Wakamono is not a far stretch from places worth craving. Dessert was great as well.. a warmed, not cooked, 5-spiced pear. It was great and would have eaten more if I wasn't full from dinner: full from sushi? Yes I went home not needing to stop for fast food on the way back.
