Having lived next to Chinatown for 5 years, I figured it was finally time to give it a try. If you haven't noticed, I don't get out much. But Lao was the obvious choice after speaking with my Asian friends. The menu is roughly 53,281 pages long so picking an option took 35 minutes of browsing. Jokes aside, I closed my eyes and picked one. With my horrible luck I ended up getting one of the most boring and bland dishes they serve. But others ordered a spicy beef dish and fried pork which were nothing short of outstanding. I was grabbing seconds and thirds as I pushed my order to the side. My advice - don't get the chicken with vegetables. Seriously, don't. Follow my advice and you'll love this place. Delicious.
