My wife and I have ordered delivery from here numerous times, and always has been good. Tonight it was unbelievable delicious.The Salmon Kabobs were melt in your mouth delicious, some of the best salmon I've ever tasted and I've eaten a lot. Baba Ganouh and Hummous were amazing, and my wife's Eggplant dish was also excellent. It doesn't get any better that this meal they delivered tonight.
