From start to finish, our first experience at the Purple Pig was wonderful. Despite its tourist-friendly location, this place was full of locals (ourselves included) who've heard about this new spot and managed to sidestep the throngs of visitors into this cozy space. Our Friday post-work brains were fried, so our server's suggestions were absolutely critical. He hit it out of the park with several recommendations, including a shaved brussels sprouts dish and slow-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. The wine list is great and offers half-bottle pours that are perfect for sharing. Most of all, the atmosphere perfectly complements the upscale comfort food. While the place was buzzing, nothing about the experience seemed rushed at all. Great experience that I can't wait to repeat soon.
