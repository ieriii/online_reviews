Overrated. Out of all Italian restaurants, I picked this one due to high rating and reviews.  I've ordered pretty much everything on the menu since we had a party of 9. We had the white and red wine, 5 appetizers, 8 main course, and 4 desserts. Salads were good and fresh, but nothing too extraordinary. Calamari was good, but I don't think it is very challenging to prepare. The Crostini di Avocado I really enjoyed. Fresh avocado and cheese. It was pretty filling but I would recommend it. The best entree was definitely the Milk and Honey baby back ribs. It is so tender but not overcooked that it melts in your mouth and off the bone as soon as your knife glides through it. The Zuppa di Pesce had TONS of seafood. If you are a huge fan of seafood- this would be good since it was a great variety of it. We got it mild spicy and it gave it a little kick. I definitely recommend the lobster ravioli over the rabbit one. I am a huge animal lover so I actually didn't even bother trying the rabbit ravioli but my party says it was "just ok".  The Sea Bass quickly disappeared on the table so I am assuming it was good. The lasagna was left half untouched. I really should have passed this dish. The service was excellent. All staff were extremely attentive to our needs, went out of their way and explained the wines we've had and took pictures for us.  Check came out to be $600+ and I thought it was a bit overpriced for what it is. It is a local joint but the decor and ambiance was cozy and warm. I think it's a cute date place for couples and the outdoor patio dining area seems more inviting. I've never been to Italy, nor can I really comment on the "authenticity" of Italian cuisine. All I'm saying is, I'm a LA girl and have had much better food over here on the other side of the states. P.S. Excuse the spelling. I don't have the menu on me.
