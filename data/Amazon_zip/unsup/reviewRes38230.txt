This is a place for people who love good, really good, beer; do NOT get anything else as I was very disappointed by the port available. I love the frites, plus, the desserts I've had have been quite yummy. Only drawback, except that I don't care because of all the good beer, is that if you arrive after 10:30 you will be forced to stand and push your way up to the bar, unless you go and sit in the restaurant.
