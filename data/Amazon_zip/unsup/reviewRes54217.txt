Don't get me wrong, Irazu is a wonderful restaurant that serves delicious goodness, but you won't find more than a few of their menu items in Costa Rica :OA typical Costa Rican menu will have gallo pinto with eggs and plantains for breakfast (AND not OR as they do in Irazu), gallo pinto or rice&beans with skirt stake, fish, pork chops, chicken, or even canned tuna for lunch and dinner. You won't find spicy stuff like salsa or hot sauce unless you find the only Mexican restaurant in San Jos, which, by the way, is a Tex-Mex restaurant started by someone who moved there from the States. I wish their chefs would educate Ticos on the Irazu style of Pura Vida ;)Irazu is best in the Summer because: BYOB and great outdoor seating.
