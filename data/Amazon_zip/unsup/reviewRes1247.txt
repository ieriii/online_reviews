The wait was two hours long, was it worth it? Yes! Would I do it again? Not for two hours! I had the Chicago style, Andouille sausage with brown mustard and sauteed onions (Salma Hayek), Spicy Jerk Pork Sausage with Caribbean Dijonnaise and Sauteed Plantains, and the Smoked Alligator Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and St. Pete's Blue Cheese. The Chicago dog: best I've ever had; in fact so good I would put it up in the same caliber of tastiness as their with his 'gourmet' and exotic dogs Andouille: simple, tasty, elegant; solid solid choice Alligator: Didn't taste like chicken...didn't taste like what I thought alligator would taste like either..supposedly it tastes like fish/rabbit; it was hard to get a good taste with the blue cheese. Blue cheese usually overpowers anything its on unless its used very sparingly Jerk pork: really damn good. Perfect embodiment of Doug's...simple, yet refined; and really damn tasty. The meat encased wasn't completely ground. It was actually quite chunky, which I prefer; it gives you more of the feeling of consuming real meat. The dijonnaise was a well matched complement to the sausage. Duck fat fries: Kinda dissapointing. I know they are cut on the premises, but they are much too thin; and they dont' retain heat very well. They seemed to be warm at best. Perhaps a sizzling hot batch would be really good. But even after eating them immediately after being served (while only warm); they tasted just like plain ol' fries. PS Although the classic Chicago dog is a steal at $1.75, the more eclectic and exotic choices can go any where from $7-11 Overall: Tasty, quirky and fun. Just come on a deader day. And bring a book, umbrella, and maybe a granola bar.  Go with 2-3 friends, it'll help the time go by faster in line; plus its all about variety here. Just order up a ton and share them. They cut quite well.
