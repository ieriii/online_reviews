Went here last night with my two friends. I was thinking about giving it four stars, but after sleeping on it I have decided to go ahead and give it five. The extra star is for the hot chocolate which is absolutely amazing. I hate hot chocolate, always have, and this hot chocolate was not only not bad, but it was good! If for no other reason, go here for the hot chocolate. We also got chips and guacamole. The chips are perfectly salted - something worthy of high regard because too many places over or under salt their chips. There was unfortunately not enough guacamole, but what there was was tasty. I had the woodland mushroom torta. It was good, but not great. The bread was a little hard to crunch. The goat cheese/mushroom combination was really good. I wish it had been a bit easier to eat. Lastly, the three of us shared three churros. Dip these in the hot chocolate. So good!!
