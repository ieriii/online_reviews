Okay, so I've been wanting to go here for a while because it seems like the perfect lunch spot: huge menu, decent quality, great location and plenty of dessert options :) But the mile-long line and huge mobs of people waiting outside turns me off. Finally, today, we decided to just go for it. We got there around 4:30 p.m. (on a Saturday) and got right in. We really lucked out. I got the mushroom burger and my fiance got the tofu sesame scramble thing. I LOVED my burger. I honestly think it's the best non-meat burger I've ever had. And the fries were delicious. My fiance said his tofu was really good as well, and the portions were huge. Neither of us could finish, and we were starving when we got there. Prices aren't bad, either. I think I was more shocked at the three dollar price tag for my diet coke than anything else. My burger was $11, the tofu was $13. For lunch, that's not bad on Michigan Ave. And the strawberry cheesecake at the end was huge and the perfect conclusion to a great meal. I can understand why people will wait in line for this place. It's not a fine dining experience by any means, but it's really relaxed, provides great service, decent prices and a lot of tasty food combinations with a large variety to choose from. And if you're lucky enough to score a window seat over-looking Michigan Ave., even better.
