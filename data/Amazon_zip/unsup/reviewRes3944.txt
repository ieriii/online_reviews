I'm a Korean, and without a car, it's hard to satisfy the craving for food from home in Chicago. A friend introduced this place as 'the restaurant with a baby chick painting'-not very promising. When I decided to try it out of desperation, I wasn't disappointed. Bad boy buddha bowl had all the longed-for veggies and enough portion to last me two meals. Fried chicken was pretty good, too. I had Seoul sassy sauce, which faintly, if not quite, reminded me of home. The menu's relatively simple, but I think it's a good way to get a Korean food fix without a long trip and often frightening service at other Korean restaurants.
