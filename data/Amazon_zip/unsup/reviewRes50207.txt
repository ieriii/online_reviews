I truly love Big Jones. As a native New Orleanian, I'm pretty picky about Southern food, and Big Jones consistently passes my tests. The relish tray is delightful, gumbo is dark and rich, shrimp and grits are super authentic and satisfying, brunch is insanely good... Hell, even the burger is outstanding! The only reason for four instead of five stars is the high price of cocktails. I love their delicious Moscow Mules, but at $11 a pop, it's gets pricy.
