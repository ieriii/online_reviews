So dinner club came knockin to Le Colonial this week. The host, a very nice gentleman, escorted us to our table on the first floor. Looking over the menu, there are a lot of tasty looking items, especially the appetizer section. And on Wednesdays, there is a 'date night' menu for $20 per person (the caveat here is that both people must order from the pre-fixe menu.) The date night would be good but alas, I was not on a date (insert sad face.) Anyhow, I sampled the grilled shrimp appetizer, scallop salad, and filet mignon salad. Delicious! The shrimp, a must, were wrapped around sugarcane and served with lettuce, carrot slices, noodles, and dipping sauce. The scallop salad had a large serving of thin noodles and I really liked the lime dressing. Overall, the food reminded me of gourmet thai. I'm not sure that it's any more delicious than some of my favorite take-out, nonetheless the food tasted great and the overall atmosphere of the place is romantic but lively. For a weeknight, it was a mix of business groups and people on dates (or dinner club.)  The only con is that the tables are really close together. One of the guys at the table next to me tried to play footsie and was denied.
