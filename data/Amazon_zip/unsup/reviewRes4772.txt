I'm not sure if I just failed at ordering here, but I felt the food was just okay. Nothing excited me. - Split Brussel Sprout: 2 stars. I noticed a lot of Yelpers talking about this dish, so I checked it out. About the size of a cup of soup. Meh. - Pig Ear: 3.5 stars. The textures and are really delicious and interesting in this. My favorite dish of the day. - Pork Neck Gravy with Ricotta: 2 stars. Our server's recommendation, but it just seemed like a nice tomato sauce on buttered toast. Skip it. - Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: 3 stars. Meat was tender and moist, but this isn't anything you can't get at 100 other restaurants. Definitely skimped on the mashed; not a good meat to mashed potato ratio. I wouldn't discourage you from visiting The Purple Pig, because I like that the plates are small and made to share, but come in with low expectations. Then you might think everything tastes better.
