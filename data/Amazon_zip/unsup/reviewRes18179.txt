Yet another wonderful BYOB spot in the Ravenswood area! I went there with my special lady. We were originally told that it was going to be a half hour wait, but it was only ten minutes. I can handle that. They seated us in the back room, which was dark (good dark, not can't see my food dark) and quiet. We started off with some fried calamari. Granted, I fried calamari is a fairly easy dish and most of the time, even when I have it at not so good Italian places, it's always at the very least decent. And Caro Mio's calamari mas definitely better than decent. The breading was light and crispy and the calamaris were not too oily. Then, on to their delicious, in house made pastas! There is a huge difference between boxed pasta and homemade (or restaurant made, if you will). The lady ordered the special: gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce. It was a (fairly) basic that had just enough of those homemade, authentic touches that made it a beyond basic dish. I, on the other hand, had the pappardelle con porcini, which was beyond outstanding. It was just enough cream and oil (you know, the good stuff) in the sauce and it had the perfect mushroom flavor to it. Plus the sauce and the porcini mushrooms was paired perfectly with the the pappardelle (which is almost like a wide linguini noodle). Altogether, it was a little over $50, which isn't bad for a nice, romantic dinner at all. And BYOB with no corkage fee! Bellisimo!
