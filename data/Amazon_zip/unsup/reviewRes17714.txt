I am typically not the first person in line for Indian food, and I will add I still have to be in the mood for it, but this place is pretty good. A friend and I went for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and it was delicious. I tried a number of different plates but the one that sticks out the most is the Salmon curry. It was salmon fillet chunks mixed with creamy curry and vegetables that made it perfect. Nan bread on the side is a nice compliment for those of us who have relatively sensitive stomachs to heat. (Helps to head the heartburn off at the pass) We finished off our meal with milk balls and mango ice cream. For the price, this place can't be beat. I will definitely be back.
