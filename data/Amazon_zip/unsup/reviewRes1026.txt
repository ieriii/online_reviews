Just want to add to the chorus of people who can't seem to rate this place high enough. After having seen Hot Doug's on No Reservations and marveling at the pure awesome that was the Foie Gras Dog I knew that on my next visit to Chicago we HAD to go here. We waited about two hours in the heat of the midday sun and were a couple innings late to my first ever Cubs game but it was absolutely worth it. I mean really the Cubs haven't put out a product as good as Hot Doug's does since 1908, but I digress. My wife and I split 3 hot dogs and a single order of the duck fat fries were enough for our whole table of 4. We had the Keira Knightley which is their red hot served topped with neon green relish, the aforementioned Foie Gras Dog which is Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel and the Mountain Man Dog which is Antelope, Elk, Buffalo, Venison with Roasted Yellow Pepper Sauce and Daru Cheese. They were all really excellent. The red hot was simple but really well done. The chunks of Foie Gras on top of the duck sausage are so ridiculously large but so very delicious. But for me the highlight was the Mountain Man the yellow pepper sauce was just the perfect compliment to the meat and cheese. I could have eaten 3 of those myself. Hot Doug's is now a necessary stop on any future Chicago vacations!
