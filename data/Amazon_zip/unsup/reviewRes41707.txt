Dont snack before hand if you're planning on eating here. The portions are very generous. It's typical of a Chicago steakhouse and I like it that way. I'm particularly impartial to the 20+oz Cowboy steak. It's a bone-in ribeye which means that the actual steak retains more juices because of the bone. And a must, a definite must, is the lobster bisque (every time I order a bisque I think of the soup Nazi episode from Seinfeld). I've convinced everyone I know that has gone there to try it at least once and all have come back with glowing reviews. It's hands down the best in the city. What I do want to know is, has anyone ever had enough room to actually have desert?
