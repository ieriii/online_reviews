this place works best when family and friends are in town. the sparkling venue packs a wow and the extensive menu should provide something for everybody. the food is tasty but nothing special and the portions are Brobdingnagian. To the ire of many a waiter, I usually just split an entree with somebody else. I would go for dessert but am usually too full. I suppose that's my gripe with this place--a restaurant that features supposedly scrumptious desserts serves entrees so large that you'd have to pack at least half of it to save room. while the high prices are justified by the large entrees, i simply can't condone food served in such portions. as noted by other reviewers, drinks are far overpriced.
