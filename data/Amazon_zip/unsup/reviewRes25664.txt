I went to Geja's Cafe with a groupon. I had never before eaten fondue, so it was definitely a new experience. We started with cheese and fruit and breads to dip in the cheese. Interesting how yummy grapes dipped in cheese can be, but I ate the grapes by themselves too. The entree was scallops, lobster, beef, chicken... (Prince Geja's, I think). It seemed like a small amount of food, but I was pretty full when we finished. It's so hard to cook food and time it while you are sitting for dinner. That was my biggest annoyance with fondue. It might have turned me off from fondue forever... I do want my food to be cooked when I'm at a restaurant. The chocolate, which we ended up packing, was delish. (Also, note, even though the meals all come with salad, cheese, entree and dessert, you can opt out of dessert if you want.) I loved the pound cake and the cut up fruit. If the chocolate had been slightly darker, it would've been yummier. All in all, a good place, but fondue probably isn't my thing.
