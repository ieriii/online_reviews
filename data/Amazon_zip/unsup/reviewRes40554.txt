I use to think Tank was the best but that was a really long time ago when I was a novice pho eater. As an experienced pho connoisseur, I find Tank's broth a little on the dark side with too much grease floating on top. Flavor is also not as complex as it should be which means they are skimping on the expensive spices. The onions can sometimes be stale and they don't serve culantro with the fresh veggies. Meat is also on the gristly side. Trivial things to most, but after you've eaten your 3679th bowl it is the little things that make the difference. Portions are large, however, and they have an extensive menu if you're not in the mood for pho. Their sandwiches left me with an unsatisfied feeling and I actually went across the street after our meal in search of better banh mi. I still stop in if I'm in the area but Tank is no longer my favorite.
