We stayed here for a wedding, so had a discounted price. That definitely helped us love everything more, but overall not a bad hotel. The service was great. We had pleasent interactions with the front desk employees (who checked us in very early when we arrived), room service, and cleaning staff. We slept in leaving our "Do Not Disturb" sign up frequently and were not disturbed. The location is great. We frequently walked from our hotel to our destinations. The lobby is trendy, warm, and inviting. Our room was small, but pristine. We had a big, Queen bed, nice furniture, a wonderful TV, and nice bathroom producuts, towels, and a robe. There was little storage for our stuff and luggage, and no mini-fridge, which would have been nice. The bathroom too had little storage.
