I have always imagined my death as either falling asleep and never waking, or as a bank heist shootout like in the movie "Heat". Now, most certainly, my death will be me barricaded in the kitchen of Xoco on delivery day, slowly killing myself with sugary vanilla deep fried churros and the occasional pork product. I cannot begin to adequately describe how awesome it is to take that first uncomfortably hot piece of churro and pop its crispy fried goodness into your mouth. The sugar and vanilla dissolve as a wave of bliss consumes your entire body. Please try them, you will not be disappointed. My cubana torta sandwich was very tasty. The mustard and jack cheese made that sandwich. My only complaint, if this is even a complaint, was that it was hard to taste the pork over the bacon. It was fabulously tasty and a joy to eat so do not read much into my complaint. I should also note that as a big fat man, the sandwich with some chips and guacamole was enough to fill me up, which I found very surprising. The atmosphere is crowded and a bit hectic, even going off peak, but the staff was excellent and very helpful. I cannot wait to go back and try some other dishes on the menu!
