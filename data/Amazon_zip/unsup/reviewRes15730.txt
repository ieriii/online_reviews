For old school Chicago-style Italian food, I think this is the best place around. I say "Chicago-style Italian" because it's what I think of as being Italian-inspired American food as opposed to what you might see at a restaurant in Milan or Florence.  The food is good. The prices are very reasonable. The bar is fun, and so is the dance floor with the live music. It's an Andersonville landmark.
