This place is stellar! Honestly for those gourmets the pancakes, hotcakes, and French toast are really the most splendid treats I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. How can it get any better then Oreo raspberry flapjacks! And those are not the only delicious things on the menu. The sandwhiches and giant salads they offer for lunch are equally scrumptious. Every time I come here I am never disappointed whether its the poached shrimp salad with fresh mozzarella, the turkey club with house potatoes ( potatoes grilled with onions and seasoned just right) or the tomatillo salsa scramble which is so good I seriously think I could eat it every day. Now I know everyone complains about the wait but here the secret kids they are open everyday and its a totally different chilled out vibe if you go during the week. But if the weekends are the only time you can get your BLT Benedict fix then check out the andersonville location- OMG the patio at this location is drop dead gorgeous! Straight up I have yet to see a more magnificently beautiful patio. Keep up the good work bongo room and I'll keep coming back for more.
