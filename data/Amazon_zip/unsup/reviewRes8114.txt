This place is awesome! The service was fantastic. Very attentive when needed and subtle when not. The burrata for starter is a must! The pizzas are all fantastic! The wood fired oven really makes a difference. The wine list is small, but hand-picked, with some great "off the beaten path" wines to try. Sitting outside on a sunny day is just perfect.
