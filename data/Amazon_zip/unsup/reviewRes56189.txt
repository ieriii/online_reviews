I first had their mango mousse cake from a friend and I just had to have it for my birthday. It's simply amazing. It's unlike anything I've ever had and I'm defiantly coming back for it. However, I didn't give it a 5 star rating because I was told that I would have a white chocolate plaque on the cake; that didn't happen. And the bottom of the cake was thoroughly soaked through with syrup. Disappointing, but still good.
