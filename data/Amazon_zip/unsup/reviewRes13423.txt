Look, okay, I've been to this place a million times. I've always liked the Bottom Up Wit, the mussels with apples and bleu cheese, and the potato pizza. You can't go wrong with that meal. But last time I was here I ordered the Forest Burger (gorgonzola, onion crunchies, mushrooms) and I think maybe they put antidepressants in their burgers because the skies opened up and I could not stop rolling on that thing.  I really hate it when you order a $12 hamburger and they work really hard to make it a good burger but give you a shit piece of lettuce and scabby tomato on the plate. The fuck am I gonna do with this? So it was kind of nice to get this chunk of meaty tomato and a piece of lettuce that I couldn't stop talking about. Here are the things I actually said about the lettuce: "This lettuce is awesome. It tastes like it was...grown in the ground or something." "Take a bite of this. No, the lettuce part. Take a bite!" "I have to ask the waitress where they get their lettuce." "Are you going to eat your lettuce?" At some point I was asked what I was on. I guess I was kind of on a hamburger high. It would have been really nice if someone had rubbed my back or danced around with light sticks or something while I ate it. Annoying for everyone else, probably, but most things I like usually are. Waitstaff is cool. One time a tiny pin fell off my coat and they found it for me. The crowd differs from night to night: sometimes it's Backwards Cap Bro's busting a screaming nut all over some sports event on the TV and sometimes it's young white professionals and their families (I swear to God I saw a four year old boy with Bieber hair in jeggings and wingtips). Also the lettuce is really good but I might have mentioned that.
