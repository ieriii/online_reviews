My wife and I ordered delivery from here and got a stuffed pizza with sausage and a thin crust pepperoni. The stuffed pizza was delicious. Some of the best pizza sauce I've ever had. You could actually taste the tomatoes and it was nicely seasoned. The thin crust left much to be desired. It was thicker than I like my thin crust pizza to be and there was way too much cheese.
