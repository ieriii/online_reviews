Yummy!! My hubby and I went there on New Year's day for Brunch. The food was very good. I had the spicy flamenco omelette, which wasn't what I was expecting but was awesome. It was the ovenbaked and not the traditional type of omelette. My hubby had the Strawberry french toast, which was delicious and not sickeningly sweet. They had soft butter and homemade jam and marmalade to put on my toast. Our server was decent and the food and check came fast. Loved it. Why am I not giving this place 5 stars? We were told the wait was 45 minutes and we didn't get seated for 1 hr and 15 minutes. Also, I ordered the Orange Strawberry Kiwi Juice Blend and it tasted good but it was not cold at all. I asked for ice because I like my juice cold. It was also extremely seedy, I didn't think this through before I ordered it. Would I go back? Definitely, we left feeling like we had great food, an overall good experience, and a great value for our money.
