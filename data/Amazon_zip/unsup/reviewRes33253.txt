This is a gem of a Romanian restaurant with an offering of other Eastern European cuisine as well. Good drinks, music, and service. The owner is very attentive and the kitchen staff is quick and well-trained. Probably a good place to go for New Year's and weekends and other holidays. Nice and quiet for romantic meals during the week, too. Try the specialties, they're really good!
