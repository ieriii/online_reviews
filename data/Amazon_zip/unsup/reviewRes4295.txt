This Place is the best. My first time going to the Green Mill was with my sister. It was swing music night, and the front dance floor was packed with swing dancing and the stage had a 16 person band jamming. Drinks are a bit expensive as is the $20 cover before midnight. But does NOT bother me. Any chance I get I am going to the Grenn Mill. Great spot to impress a date after dinner if you are trying to stray from some obnoxious club or bar. One of the best spots in Chicago by FAR! I recommend this place for everyone.
