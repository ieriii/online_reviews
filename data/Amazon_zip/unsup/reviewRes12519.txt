This place is fantastic. Some of the most reasonably priced, well balanced food I have eaten. We went in for Sunday brunch, and I had to wait for my friend for about 15 minutes. I ordered a mimosa, which when I pulled out my card the bartender said "don't worry about it". How often do you get a free mimosa for brunch? When my friend arrived, we were seated immediately by a middle aged Cuban woman who immediately grabbed my hand. This is how this place is...it's warm, inviting, as if you're being invited into their home. The decor feels the same way. Interesting art, clean yet inviting. So, we sit down and immediately have a hard time deciding. My first choice--crab cakes benedict, were already gone for the day. So, we decide to try one of the specials as an app, and split the asparagus and serrano benedict, and the banana-cream cheese stuffed french toast. All were amazing. Banana stuffed french toast may have been a bit too much without the savory to counter act the sweet--but was amazing none the less. We also had a few belini's, which I would say were average. The mimosa's were great, and the coffee was fantastic. Overall, great atmosphere. We loitered for about an hour after we were done eating, some of the last people in the restaurant. We never felt rushed or unwelcome. Great personal and attentive service. I will definitely be back soon to try a few of the sandwiches, as well as for brunch for the crab cakes benedict.
