My counterpart Dragon had a Groupon so we gave the restaurant a shot. I got the eggs benedict, she got the ham panini. The food was pretty tasty and it is good portions for the price. The grocery store had some interesting selections. Now the bad stuff (and there is a lot of it): It took 20 minutes to be seated despite making a reservation. We received no menus, water, or silverware for 15 minutes. The waitress forgot our order and came back 20 minutes after to let us know. An hour passed before we finally got our food. The main host was a fat rude man that shouldn't be allowed near other human beings. The waitress never bothered checking on us. Everything in the grocery store is overpriced. Final verdict: Go here with a groupon, have low expectations, and it'll still be disappointing. This place should really consider management change or at least someone new to run the restaurant. It's too bad because the food is actually pretty tasty. Don't come here!!!
