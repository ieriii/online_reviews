Visiting Chicago from San Diego last week, my friend and I tried both Frontera Grill and Topolobambo on two separate luncheon ventures. The restaurants are literally joined together and one checks in at he same hostess station for both. We found nothing ordinary about these places and they deserve all the hype they have received. I thought the Barbacoa de Chivo (overnight wood-oven goat) dish was to die for. The "Trio, Trio, Trio: Sampling of Ceviche Fronterizo, Ceviche Yucateco & Coctail de Atun Tropical" was superb. (I had it twice.) Also excellent was Carne Asada "Brava" and the Mixiote de Borrego (lamb shoulder slow-roasted in parchment packages with ancho-pasilla sauce). The menu is filled with items I have absolutely never heard of or eaten at all anywhere in San Diego or in Baja. I have read in one Rick Bayless book that East LA can compete somehow, but I haven't tried going there ever. Now I am tempted. As for the drinks, I had a large local Belgian ale-type beer called La Fleur of all things. The marguerites were nice but not as unusual as everything else. I should add, I ate at several two-star Michelin places in Chicago that impressed me less than these Bayless landmarks. I missed (not for lack of trying) the allegedly divine Alinea (three stars) although they called me twice with last-minute cancellations. But I didn't return the calls in time. Topolobambo takes reservations; I don't think Frontera Grill does.
