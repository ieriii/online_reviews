Yes, the wait is long and the dog's are good. But I ask you, is any hot dog worth waiting 2+ hours? It's a serious trade off. The regular dog's were good, but nothing at all to be so excited about. Don't invest the time and energy unless you are going to get one of the specials. I can't even remember what I had because I was so irritable from the wait. I could have thrown some BBQ sauce and smoked cheddar on a Nathan's and been more satisfied at home...and the duck fat fries? Not all their fried up to be.
