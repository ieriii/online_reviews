The tomato sauce is really good, but overall...eh. Just order the cheesy garlic bread for like $3 and get a side of the sauce. You'll enjoy yourself with way lower expectations.  The service is...odd...The people are...odd...It's like they call this place a White Sox bar because it kind of sucks, like it's a crude northside joke about the southside or something...I think I'm offended - no, wait - yeah, I am. Fried mushrooms cost $6. That's like .80 cents per crappy breaded mushroom or something, which, correct me if I'm wrong, is like the very definition of sucking. PS - The idea of anybody in that place (me, our waitress and Paul Konerko included) wearing one of those Pequod g-strings that are hanging from the wall? [shudders + grossed out face]
