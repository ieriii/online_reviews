I've gone to fox & obel a few times now. The atmosphere is nice and what I would expect from an upscale grocer. They have a fine selection of local, organic, and high quality goods. They specifically have a large selection of oil, vinegars, chocolates, wine, cheese, and meats. I had a groupon so I was a kid shopping in a candy store. I picked up a nice assortment of chocolate and beer. I didn't have much interaction with the staff but they seemed nice. I'd shop here more often but it's out of my affordable budget. I'd definitely recommend a visit in to this establishment. They also have a cafe and restaurant but I didn't try those and haven't heard anything about them.
