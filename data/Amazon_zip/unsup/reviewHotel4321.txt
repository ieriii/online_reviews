Bedbugs! We stayed here for a week but found a bedbug the first night. We demanded they move us to a different room on a different floor and wash/dry clean all our stuff, which they did. But they didn't even offer a discount on the room! Besides the bedbugs, the room generally was run down and didn't feel clean. Would never stay here again.
