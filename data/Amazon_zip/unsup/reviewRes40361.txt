A group of us came here for dinner one Wednesday night. They wouldn't seat us until our whole party had arrived, which is fine since it wasn't all that busy. They have a very extensive drink list, which most of my friends enjoyed (I stuck to water this evening). We tried the pretzel and cheese to start- to die for!!! There was a fried crab special that a few friends got, and I tried. It was great. I got the Roasted Half Chicken, which was amazing. Two large pieces of chicken came out and I devoured the first one, it was so good! It came with a few veggies and a "fancy" mac & cheese, which was also super. I had the other piece of chicken for dinner the next night, and it was quite disappointing. It was mostly fat and bones, I ended up throwing most of it away. But, that aside everybody very much enjoyed their meal and it's a cute place with a fun atmosphere.
