OK, I am sure you know why I took away a star: the line to get in is extremely too long. Don't go hungry because it will take you 30 minutes to get inside.BUT- the remaining 4 stars is because Hot Doug's is the best Hot Dog place in the entire galaxy! If Aliens land: take them to Hot Doug's for a rattlesnake dog with honey drizzle and blue cheese! mmmmmm Add some duck fried fries and you are set for some intergalactic deliciousness! Their menu is always changing and is always fun. Order at least 2 dogs and make sure you vary your selection each time. Expect to pay $10-15 and you'll be super fine!!!yummy yummy yummy!!!! Bring some friends to pass the time in the stupid line.
