Wilde is a much, much needed "gastropub" (I hate that word, but I think it aptly describes the place) in the heart of Lakeview. From a fairly humble looking storefront, I was astonished to see a huge, gorgeous bar and dining room, awash in mahogany and stained glass. The "library" area, decked out with leather seating, a fireplace, and bookshelves, is a nice touch. Despite the vastness of the bar, it manages to maintain a level of coziness and comfort - a sign that the folks that designed it did their job well. I simply loved the atmosphere. The food held up its end of the bargain as well. I walked in having no intention of eating, but ended up chowing down on some excellent curry chips (crispy, medium-thick chips, with a curry sauce that had a little bit of heat, and was not cloying), and eating some of my friend's meatloaf, which was the best I've ever had - beautifully seasoned, and lean yet juicy. The service was wonderful. Our server was attentive (without being overbearing), and despite the fact that the place was hopping - it was a Friday night - got our food and drink to us quickly, and maintained a pleasant demeanor. Of course, Wilde is a victim of its success. It's damn busy, and you will wait for a table on a weekend tonight. But don't be deterred - it's worth it!
