If you are a first timer to a Brazilian steakhouse, then you will love this place. Beeeeeeeef. Lots of it. Also, some other stuff like lamb, chicken and pork, but why waste your valuable stomach space on that stuff. The beef is good - filet and bacon wrapped filet are good, but the best flavor is in the flank steak and the "house special" sirloin. The thing that sets this place apart from the others like Fogo and Brazzaz is the salad bar. It is, by far, the best of the bunch. The lobster bisque is incredible. The seared tuna is fresh and high quality - not warm and fishy like some salad bars. The sushi chef is so-so. Not too much selection, but not too bad. There are some hot sides that are great, too. Overall, this is a good choice if you are in the mood for a meat fest. The service is a little slower than Brazzaz, but your gaucho will get you anything you want, you just have to ask.  Also, make sure to sign up for their email and you will get coupons every once in a while. We just went for $32.99 a person with a free dessert when they sent us a coupon.
