Can I just say, CUTEST NAME EVER! Piccolo was very hard to find. We pestered the host over the telephone with directions and he did his best to help us. We were on the phone with him for like 15 minutes. They need a sign with flashing lights! Once we arrived though, the restaurant was beautiful! They wait staff was so attentive. We must have had like 3 waiters and we were a party of 4! The food is delicious and the portions are HUGE! I got like a whole chicken. I distinctively remember our waiter telling me that my chicken would be out in a few more minutes because it was still alive! He was so funny! I met the sommelier and he was a sweetheart! The patio is absolutely GORGEOUS! Even though it's a bit of an older crowd, I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a great Italian meal!
