Amazing Food and the design of the restaurant is really unique.  The Publican is known for there beer and beef, however, I was surprised to find they have amazing seafood as well (try the oysters). The service is fast make you feel at home. There brunch is also mad cheap and amazing. If you are in Chicago and want a casual place with amazing food go to The Publican
