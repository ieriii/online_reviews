Back in the day, before I decided I liked a neat martini best, this was my favorite North-y spot to grab a few brews, bicker with the best of friends, ignore the grungier aspect of the place on an especially crowded night, and enjoy the breadth of the menu. The menu's got its high points, so if you're part of a party that has a discriminating palate but also a mighty thirst and perhaps also a pair of leather lungs to make themselves heard, then you won't want to miss out on Hopleaf. There's something appropriate that this is just a hop and skip away from the more transparently Swedish elements of Andersonville, because it's very much like an urban viking experience. For the picky viking who wants something more than just a Sam Adams or Goose Island to go upscale, at any rate.
