I love this place! In fact, the only complaint I may have is that the menu is too big! There are sooooo many choices that picking one is quite a chore. It's a huge restaurant so it's fairly crowded and noisy... so if that's not your thing, you might want to avoid the weekends. Grand Lux does not take reservations nor can you phone ahead. If you get there during peak times, be prepared to wait 15-45 minutes. Try getting there a little earlier and you may only wait 5-10 minutes. Don't forget to choose your dessert ahead of time. They have a few made-to-order desserts that have to be ordered at the beginning so that they're ready by the time you're done with your main entree. Make sure to leave some room because they're delish!!
