I visited Hopleaf for the first time last night. It's my perfect bar. Unfortunately, a lot of other people feel the same way. It looks unremarkable from the outside -- even a little sketchy. As soon as you enter, all fears are put to rest. Even before you get to the important stuff (the beer and the food, of course), this place is cool. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore, including an upstairs / mezzanine area, and a bunch of booths. It's pretty big, but managed to remain packed all night. Well, from 8pm - 1am, at least... The beers: if there isn't something you like here, go home and shoot yourself, because you've clearly lost all enjoyment for life. The range is outstanding, with one of the most extensive draft selections I've ever seen, and a bottle menu which reads like the wine list in a Michelin-starred restaurant. The food menu is unassuming, and while some of the dishes sound interesting, you would not necessarily expect them to be anything special. You'd be wrong. Our group had the mussels (Thai style), the CB&J, and the ham sandwich. Each was a marvel of freshness and balance. They could charge double for any item on the menu, and I'd gladly pay it. The chef is clearly very talented. The bar staff were really friendly and helpful, suggesting beers I might like from my description of what I was in the mood for next. They obviously have a passion for their product. Conclusion: I spent five hours here, ate an outstanding meal, got buzzed on some of the best beer in the world, and it cost me less than $50.
