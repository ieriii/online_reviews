Why is it that when I review the places I really, really like I personify the establishments and talk directly to them? Oh, Hopleaf. You are so lovely. You are everything I look for in a bar. To say your selection of both draft and bottle beer is "great" would be an understatement (seemingly endless options!). You offer me delicious food (mussels, duck Reuben) and even more delicious beer in a friendly, familiar atmosphere. Your cozy upstairs room feels like drinking in a warm little haven where everyone is nice. In the dining room, they just want what's best for you, a fulfilling meal. In the front room, at the bar, I just feel at home. The bartenders are unpretentious and the people watching is top-notch. Hopleaf, I just wanna hang out with you. All the time. Is that bad?
