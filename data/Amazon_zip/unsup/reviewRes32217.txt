Based on only one visit, I expect to upgrade to 5 stars after multiple trips! We had a Groupon and a brother in law who has spent time doing archeology in Ethiopia, so we had to try this place out. Went kind of early on a weekday, which was perfect since the staff had plenty of time to show my husband and me around the menu (we were Ethiopian food noobs). The food was outstanding. I can't remember what all we had, except that it was all good. My brother in law was impressed, especially with the Ethiopian coffee which he said was some of the best he's ever had. The honey wine was excellent and the staff was more than friendly. We were originally handed the wrong bill (which was less than our tab), when we brought the error to the attention of the manager, he comped us our coffee and brought a free round of drinks to the table to thank us for our honesty. Can't beat that for customer service! We'll be back for more!
