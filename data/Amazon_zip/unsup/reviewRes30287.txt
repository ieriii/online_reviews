I have been here on five bad dates in five months. Each time the waiters were slooooooow with bringing the drinks sometimes with the food. Which compounds a felony. I have served for a few years at various establishments. In my experience, there's a quaint custom of bringing the beer or cocktail right away, maybe while the patron decides or before they get their food. This ensures they will most likely be jovial and it increases the bill, thus one's tip. Not only that, the drinks were a sconch weak. The waiters are cute and winsome, but the service is SLOOW. The food is good, very good. Do try the Rueben, Gyros, burgers, mac and cheeze, shakes if you love your tummy. So I most likely will be back, without the the yum factor, it will be known in my memory as the place where sexual chemistry goes to die.
