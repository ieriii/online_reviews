I have to say that this is one of the more unique places that I've been in Chicago. Modeled after a prohibition-era speakeasy, Violet Hour is marked by a single yellow lightbulb outside of a wooden building and door. I went on a Saturday night around midnight, and there was a good sized line of people waiting inside already to be seated. However, my friends and I were joining a party already there, and the hosts were very accomodating in getting us to the front of the line and seating us in an already crowded booth! The atmosphere inside Violet Hour is very dark and low key. The music isn't blaring, which is nice, and that seems to keep conversation at a decent level as well. They have seating at the bars and at tables for 2, however my friends and I sat at a larger table in the back. I tried a whiskey concoction, which was alright (not a huge whiskey fan), before we ordered our own vodka batch. There were no menus, and apparently they just serve all their drinks in small or large unmarked glass jugs, designated only by what kind of liquor is in them. The drinks were great and pretty strong, the atmosphere was awesome, and the hosts and waitresses were very accomodating. However, one of those large jugs is $90! I guess you get what you pay for, but because of that, this place only gets 4 stars. Get some menus so I can tell what I'm paying for!
