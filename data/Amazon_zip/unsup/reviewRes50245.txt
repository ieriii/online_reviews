I passed by on a warm Saturday afternoon and couldn't help but stop in. They had big glass doors open to the sidewalk, and there is just nothing better than a cold beer at 3 in the afternoon for no good reason. It started out fairly empty and my friends and I had a great conversation going with the bartenders and waitstaff. The other patrons were friendly and the beers were good, but... The 40z thing they have going on screams cheesy gimmick. A new 40 every week is a great thing for a college bar or your average shit-hole, but not a place like this. I mean, they have a chef and look to be priding themselves on a menu featuring 'house-smoked meats' and night-time lounge/slightly class atmosphere. I did also end up having an appetizer, but I wasn't that impressed. That being said, they do have a great space for outdoor dining and I feel like I should give the main menu items a chance. If that blows me away they can maybe get another star; for now it'll stay at a 3.
