What is this? It is most certainly NOT a sushi bar! It is a nightclub wannabe that happens to serve sushi... It is all about the look : not the food... it is so dark you can't read the menu or appreciate what was undoubtedly the beautiful presentation of the caterpillar roll which by the way was absolutely delicious!The edamame were undercooked. The tempura was extremely greasy. The spicy tuna roll (much spicier than normal) and the caterpillar roll were very good. Sushi presentation was beautiful from what i could make out. I like to see what i eat. Service was okay (i think they got the memo on refilling water, in our case they refilled our water glasses 4 times!). If owner is concerned about lighting the tables without changing the atmosphere he created ( i assume he likes it) i suggest he pin lights each table... and dude... what is with the giant screen only you and six other customers can see?... and count the cash in the back before sticking it in your pocket!
