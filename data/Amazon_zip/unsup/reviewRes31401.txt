Sunda is definitely a place to be and be seen - as evidenced by the crowd of fiftysomething men with their twentysomething paramours. We had a reservation but had to wait 30-40 minutes anyway, which is annoying. I know that crowds can be unpredictable, but I'm old and prefer to eat before 9 pm on weekdays. Once we were seated I became aware of how incredibly loud this place is - which was sad since I came with a group of friends and was really looking forward to some good conversation. Again, this just might be me being grumpy and old. Our waiter suggested splitting dishes but we had already been looking at the menu for a but and thus were settled on what we all wanted respectively... so we did some bite-swapping but no real sharing. The good: The pork bao sandwiches, which we split as an appetizer, were really tasty. I also enjoyed my spicy tuna roll, which was meaty and legitimately spicy - a pleasant surprise. I also had a bite of the corn fritters, which were tasty but basically just fried corn. Boyfriend's pork belly was really tasty and a giant portion, which was cool, except that it wasn't served with rice or anything so it was way too rich. The bad: the Number 9 roll was super boring and flavorless. I was really disappointed. Overall, it was a decent experience and the food was pretty tasty, but it's just not really my scene. I'm more of a Chinese-takeout-Gossip-Girl-reruns kind of gal, I guess.
