Four stars...but only because of the wait during peak times. Otherwise, their New Haven-style pizza is a must try in a city that knows it's pizza. Great value for the price, as it's hard to leave this place without feeling full. Their microbrews are spectacular as well, good variety for fans of stouts or IPAs. Service is both friendly and efficient, if you've got an empty glass, you don't be waiting long before it's refilled. I always make sure to bring out of town visitors here because this place is unquestionably worth it.
