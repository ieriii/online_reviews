The food is soooo good at this place. The burgers, the salads, even the Mac and Cheese. I've taken tons of out of town guests here for a fairly quick, not expensive lunch... And, its a super comfortable place too. Service isn't as good as the food, but it's not horrible. I definitely recommend this place and will definitely go back.
