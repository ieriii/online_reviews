I'm not a vegan or a vegetarian but I have this bet going on with my sister that I wouldn't eat meat for a month so that is how I found out about this amazing place. I went with two of my sisters and my dad to check it out. The place is nice and cozy and the wait staff? Phenomenal! My waitress was very attentive and she came to ask if we needed something a second before I noticed I needed something. The food was delicious. My sister and I had the gyros, my other sister had the philly cheese steak and my dad had a chikin ceasar salad wrap. The verdict? 5 stars across the board. When my "no meat month" is over I will still visit this place because it's great.
