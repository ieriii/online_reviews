The food is very good. Almost everything you order is delicious. Also, I like that they have a rewards card for their frequent diners. As I entertain here quite often, I take advantage of the rewards from spending 500-1500 per meal.  My only gripe is that they cant get the Gambas a la Plaxa right. When I order this, 2 or 3 of the shrimp always taste like it was dead for too long. I love sucking on the heads and that is the first thing I do. It kind of spoils your appetite when you get a bad one. I do sometimes order this just to see if one day they get it right.
