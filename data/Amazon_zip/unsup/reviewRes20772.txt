The Gage Burger was a properly made cheeseburger. Melted Camembert and Onion Marmalade brought it to another belly filling level. The fried chicken livers were also winners. I am a fan! Had to sub out the fries for a salad. When in the downtown Chicago area do yourselves a favor and check it out.  Was very busy when we went in the afternoon (we had a 1pm reservation) so take care of things.
