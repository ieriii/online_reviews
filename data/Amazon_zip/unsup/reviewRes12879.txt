As simple as great dining with your significant other or groups. The food and drinks are the best! You have to get the Raspberry Mojito. I love Cuban food and could eat it all day everyday! They offer many variaties of Mexican & Cuban dishes that are great! Always had fun here especially since it was our first date places my wife and I frequent at.
