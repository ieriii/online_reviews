I absolutely loved everything about Longman and Eagle, but when you are a restaurant of this status, that's almost not enough - i.e. I'm still alive and did not die and go to food heaven. However, the food is absolutely phenomenal (more or less). It's possible we didn't order the best of the best on the menu - I guess that's for you to decide yourself: -Rarebit with cheese sauce: like an upscale version of the same at a Cubs game. A good way to start the night. -Pidgeon: This was the best dish of the night. Not much meat (pigeons, are like, kinda small) but the poached cinnamon pear and fig-like jelly are perfect compliments -Apple salad with beet: I felt that presence of beet was a bit strong in this salad, and I'm not the world's largest beet fan. -Wild Boar Sloppy Joe: really good. Very spicy topping (pickled jalepenos!), with a mild, flavorful sauce. Beef fat fries were also great. (I'm not necessarily a fry connoisseur, so I can't say "best ever". Still good.) -Bread pudding: A very interesting preparation, but in the end, I may like my bread pudding a bit more pedestrian. (This one is served as a rectangular prisim of pureed bread.) Pine nut ice cream was great. All in all, I want to come back, because I feel like Longman and Eagle is probably a five star, and I just got unlucky. The decor, ambience, staff are all perfect. Get there EARLY. We were there at 4:45, and the place was full, with no wait. by 5:15, the wait was out the door.
