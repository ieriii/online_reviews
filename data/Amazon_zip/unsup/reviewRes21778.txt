I came here after being told about it from a chicago local. I was told its a great way to experience some chicago food for a great price. One of the best hot dogs ever!! I remember seeing this place on Food Network but didnt put much stock in it since I didnt know I was coming here at the time. The place is a typical drive in. Neon, car hops, window trays, food in boxes, etc. But the food is not what you would expect. The superdawg is so tasty and juicy. The toppings are perfect with a lot of crunch and bite to them. Those little peppers are small but they pack a nice punch. For me it was not to over powering but they still made my eyes water. The pickle is a perfect topper and the fries are good as well ( i would have liked more crispy fries but the ones I had were good none the less) Overall a great little meal. I hope to go back at least once while I am in the windy city!
