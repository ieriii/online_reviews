24 hours! Ha!! It's a nice change to Thai & Chinese eateries. You get alot of food and for 2 it's about $50, so it's not "cheap". That includes drinks soo reallly.. not bad. The food is great. So many little dishes. Might be too wierd for some, but if you're adventures... you'll try it. I had the BBQ and got to grill it! Wooot! Just don't go here at 3am without someone who is Korean. Beware the service too. May not be the friendliest if there's nobody Korean.
