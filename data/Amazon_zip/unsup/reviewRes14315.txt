My review pertains to the Tuesday night special for all you can eat Alaskan King Crab legs. I feel bad in a way giving it just 2 stars but I felt a more accurate review of this long standing special should reflect the quality of the food - and I'd say "Meh - I've Experienced Better" is accurate.  Market price for the crab dinner that night was around $47 and the quality was just so so. I threw away a few pieces of meat because they were like rubber. I could buy crab like this at CostCo and steam it up myself at home for far less and it would taste better I think. Or, I could go to the Half Shell and get a pound for like $35 or so - and I've never had a bad meal there. (Their service is another story). Granted, we ate about 1.33 lbs apiece, so we got more for our money..... but not by much. On the flip side, they do reservations and we were sat promptly for ours. The service was friendly. The place has a nice neighborhood feel. The beer list was good and I had a nice glass of wine. But if you're looking for a great crab dinner at a decent price, try the Half Shell. Or save up for Shaw's.
