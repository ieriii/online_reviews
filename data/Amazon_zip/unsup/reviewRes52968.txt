Hello, DELICIOUS! I live on Armitage, so I pass by 90 Miles a million times. Finally time to try it, I say! And try it I did. Love it, I did.. The servers were fantastic. Mario, our main server, explained all of the specials to us and gave his recommendations. Both of us ordered the first one (I can't remember the name, but it's something pork and garlic and deliciousness), due to his high recommendation on it. GREAT idea. Our total was reasonable, and we had two or three other servers help us throughout our visit. All of them were a lot of fun! Service, food, and quickness are all fantastic in my book. Yay!
