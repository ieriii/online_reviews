EDIT 3/4/08 Buffalo mozzarella you can have your way with me, all night long. We indulged in the prosciutto and mozzarella app and it was way too good. I'm pretty sure I will crave this everyday. Thanks a lot for the torture.  We finally braved the trek to the north side to indulge in Spacca Napoli. It was worth the trip. Coming on a whim and near closing time I was relieved to see that the place wasn't super packed. Our server was pleasant and did a good job explaining the pizzas to us. I chose a special that had pepperoni and crushed peppers. The companion had a pizza with sausage and mushrooms. Both were phenomenal. I appreciated the freshness of the ingredients. We were both kicking ourselves for not trying any of the appetizers. We spent our meal drooling over what other people at other tables had ordered. I am determined to come back for the giant mozzerella ball. For dessert we shared the pistachio gelato which again was amazing and fresh. I was worried that the thinness of the pizza crust would make for a soggy leftover, but low and behold it held up and was still as delicious the next day.
