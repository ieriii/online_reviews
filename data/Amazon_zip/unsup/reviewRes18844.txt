I always feel silly when trying to order because I don't know what half the things are so I just guess at what my stomach wants....and each time my taste buds and belly are mighty happy with me! I hate the line and that its not open on Monday, but darn do I love the food. If you have the time, absolutely stop in and grab a bite to go (because there is never a table to stay in).
