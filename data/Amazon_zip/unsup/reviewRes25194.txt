Great food, swank decor, lousy service. We went here as a foursome at 8PM on a Thursday night. The look of the place is hip and cool. Lots of activity, but not too loud. The meal was quite good, but our waiter nearly ruined it.  Example one: Three of us ordered white sangria and one ordered red sangria. The waiter suggested: "How about a pitcher of white?" I said, "Sure, but he still wants the red." So, we received a pitcher of white, no red.  Maybe we just confused him. Example two: Many tapas places will cycle in fresh plates. I thought this was one of them, so when I had a plate a little messy (with olive pits and various sauces), I requested a new one. The waiter took my plate and disappeared. When our next group of tapas arrived, I still did not have a plate (or utensils). I tried to say something to the guy who dropped off the food, but he appeared to understand absolutely no English. So I waited. And waited. I finally flagged down our server, reminded him I needed a plate, and watched him leave again. Several MINUTES later, he returned and grabbed a plate from a shelf near the kitchen. Unacceptable. These are just two of the multitude of problems with the service.  As for the food, it was delicious. The bacon-wrapped dates were my favorite. I also liked the meatballs and shrimp.  Very tasty food, but very amateur wait staff. I won't be returning.
