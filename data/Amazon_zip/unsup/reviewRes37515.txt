This place is different and on a whim; with a recommendation from an old friend, I chose Hopleaf to celebrate my 24th birthday. I reaaaaally like different. After eating a glorious thai dinner (at Yes Thai .... review to follow), we shanked our semi-buzzed selves over to Hopleaf (on the way I rode the horse on the corner - see photos). As we entered Hopleaf I quickly noted how packed the small downstairs area was (I was warned about this but damnit, it was my birthday and i do not drink shitty beer). So after my wonderful boyfriend put a glorious new find for me (kwak beer) in my hands, I suggested we mosey our party upstairs to check out the scene. We found it equally busy upstairs, but managed to stake out an area on a padded bench by the bar and pulled up some chairs. I had a blast drinking several delicious beers and having a great time catching up with fantastic friends. My miller light drinking friends toughed it out and even enjoyed their new-found beers. Howdyalikethat? I definitely plan on coming back here many a times! :)
