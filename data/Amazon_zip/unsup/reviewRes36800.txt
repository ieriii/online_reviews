Good, solid Thai/ sushi place with very fresh, if uninspired rolls. We enjoyed the Chicago Crazy, spicy tuna and some roll with mango chutney (sounded good, but we could barely taste the mango!). The Thai curries and noodle dishes are also delicious, although the gourmet feel allows them to get away with less than generous portions. However, the prices on both the rolls and Thai dishes are reasonable (most rolls between $5 & $12) and the BYO policy is a nice perk. Get a reservation on the weekends. This place is crowded!
