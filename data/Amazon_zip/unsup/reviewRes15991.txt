Ordered the "pollo" dish and it really left quite a bit to be desired. Maybe because I had something else in mind? Maybe it is my fault for that. Also thought the guacamole had too much lime in it (I may be too used to the guac from Rosa Mexicano). Would not come back for the food. On the other hand, they had a great latin band performing that night, honestly better than what i normally see in Miami.
