This place would be an easy 5 stars if it weren't for the obnoxious atmosphere. A prison themed sports bar with concert level volume? It's like Neo ate Murphy's Bleachers. That aside, the burgers are incredible, the mac 'n cheese is worthy, and the service was excellent. They comped us pints of Half Acre because we waited 5 minutes for a table. I'll be back.
