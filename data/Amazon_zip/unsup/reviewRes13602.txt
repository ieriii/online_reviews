Rev Brew is awesome. We often take friends here when they are in town since it's a Chicago local spot with a great selection of beer and wide variety of "bar food." When they first opened, we went a couple times and didn't get a seat, but thank goodness the "hype" has died down a little, but that's a-ok with me! The wings here are a must! The Blue Cheese Potato Salad that accompanies their smoked then flash-fried wings are yumm-o! I have to say they have the best mussels in the city and I would be content with just a pint, some mussels and frites! They often rotate their menu here and have daily specials. I've tried a few of their specials and they are always very good. The burgers here are also very on point! If you like Fish and Chips this spot is the place to go. They were so good and they give you a boat-load of fish. Their slaw is also very delicious and prepared in a very contemporary way so even if you're not a big fan of slaw, try this one, you may just like it! Their brews here are also dynomite. We usually leave with a couple of growlers after each visit. Cross of Gold and Eugene are my two favorites. Go there and have a brewski for me.
