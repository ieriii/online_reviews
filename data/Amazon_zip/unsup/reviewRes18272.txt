This Chef Bayless eatery is located adjacent to his two other restaurants however here they only serve tortas and caldos or basically sandwiches and soups. It also probably won't matter what time you come here, be prepared to wait in a line. The Cubana is a savory, delicious and warm torta with smoked pork loin and bacon, mushed black beans, avocado, and jack cheese.
