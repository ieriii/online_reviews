Opaa! Greektown is a must when visiting Chicago. We had some good stuff here: Mousaka, Dolmada, Giant beans, Beet salad, Navy bean soup. Even their bread is tasty, covered in sesame seeds.  Originally I ordered the 'stuffed tomatoes' but they ran out. It must be good. Oh and the saganaki, flaming cheese that is flambeed at tableside.  That was pretty cool!
