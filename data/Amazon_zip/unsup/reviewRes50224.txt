Incredible Southern fare paired with one of the best Bourbon/Whiskey selections around. Done and done.  What impresses me is that they don't do what so many places do...assume that 'Southern' food is a greasy pile of fried whatever, doused in too-rich sauces. The chefs actually practice authentic, low-country styles of Southern-inspired cuisine. They pull their menu from several regions and haven't simply said, "We're Cajun!!!" or "We gots us some BBQ!!!" like so many places seem to do these days. Big Jones doesn't seem to be about the hype but about treasured cooking traditions from the Southern states.  This has been our go-to special occasion place ever since we stumbled upon it one night shortly after they opened several years ago, and the team at Big Jones has never failed us. They are always finding creative ways to make my mouth water with their seasonal menu updates, while continuously perfecting their regular menu items. They keep me drooling.
