yes, it is packed all the time- but it is worth it. know what kind of beer you like- the bartenders don't have time to help you decide (which is hard for me because i don't know all that much about beers, just that i don't like crappy ones!) we went on a sunday and sat at the bar, lucky to get a couple of seats- and we ordered the fries (awesome) and the vegetarian pot pie. it was AMAZING. it is great to have such a hearty vegetarian option on the menu, perfect for a cold winter night in chicago!!!
