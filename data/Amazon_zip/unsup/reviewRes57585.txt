We haven't been to Greek Islands for over 10 years, but we used to really love the food. Our family just visited Greeek Islands this week and unfortunately we were disappointed. We ordered the Family Plate. The food was good, but we were surprised at how sparse the amount of gyro and lamb meat were along with the other parts of the main entree. We actually walked away wanting to more of our favorites. Maybe we needed to order an extra serving of each though the waiter said the meal would be large.We may try one of the other local Greek restaurants next time to compare.
