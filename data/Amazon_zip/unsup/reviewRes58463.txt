My friend and I came here for lunch, and the people were wonderful and the environment was nice. We ordered poutine and half way done we find a finger nail, no lies. We tell them and the guy just said Oh, let me take that for you. So we're like alright whatever he might not charge us. We get our main course (Burger and a Chicken Sandwich) and my friend finds hair with the fries. My friend had no more appetite and didn't even touch his burger yet. He tells the waiter and guess what he said? Are you done with that sir? My friend was explaining to him and that waiter just took it and walked away. We asked for our bill and they charged us everything, they didn't give us new food, didn't apologize, and this was the service we got from a restaurant like this. You would think you they would do at least something to make up for it, but they just acted like nothing happened and basically asked for their money. It's kind of dumb, because we were just two sailors just wanting try good food and got the worst service and still had to pay them the ridiculous price. Talk about quality...
