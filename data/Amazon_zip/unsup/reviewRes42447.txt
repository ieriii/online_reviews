This place was average at best. After moving here from Boston about a year ago where I had a multitude of delicious Vietnamese places near my house, I have been hunting for a decent one here in Chicago. Tank was suggested by a few people I had spoken to. I was not impressed. I ordered vegetarian fresh rolls, which were okay, if not a bit bland. I also ordered the chicken noodle soup, which contained chicken so chewy that I had to stop eating it. My Ice coffee was okay, although tasted a little funky. I will give it one more chance...
