I went to Irazu for dinner with a friend last week. There was a bit of a wait, but we just made ourselves comfortable outside and after about 15 minutes, the hostess came and got us and brought us to our table. BYOB we brought a few beers that we hoped would go well with our authentic Costa Rican meal, and were pleasantly surprised when our hostess complimented our choice. Having never been to Costa Rica I had no idea what to expect so we deferred to our server who was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Each of us ordered one of the more traditional Costa Rican meals and were more than satisfied with the quality, quantity, and flavor! I became lost in finding all the best parts of my meal, and before I knew it, it was gone! I had heard such great things about the oatmeal shake, but there was no way I had any room - Next time I will have to push back my plate and take home some leftovers!Would definitely go back. The only tips is that it is Cash Only, though it looked like there was an ATM!
