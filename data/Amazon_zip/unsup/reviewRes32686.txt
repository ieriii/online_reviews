Ok.... 1.) 9:00 reservation w/ 5 of my gorgeous girlfriends, all industry. We sat at 10:15. NOT COOL. 2.) Arturo sent over appetizers to compensate. Very thoughtful gesture, but they were inedible (my very sweet and laid back companion compared the sea bass to "dirty shit you you use to catch the bottom feeders in the ocean") AND they charged us for them. I pleasantly asked the waitress about this and I thought she may attack me at any moment- she insisted I had ordered them. 3. I have been to plenty of Japanese restaurants from Cali to Japan to FL to Hawaii, etc and the raving about this sushi is mind blowing. The tuna was average, the rock shrimp tempura HAD to be sent from the kitchen w/ out the sauce, sea bass sucked, but I did LOVE the escolar w/ the truffle chip? Good stuff...This is such sub par food, but one time does not do it justice, I will try again. 4.) I am NOT impressed to be waiting and starving while what's his name from the Bears brother and his washed up ex -player friend are seated before me with their Forever 21 clad, over tan, beat up go-go dancers in tow...I also think the Skittle twins and every other Chicago Scene nerd made for a nauseating dinner experience, not good people watching... 5.) I HIGHLY SUGGEST Billy, Arturo and Brad tell their other employees, mainly females from UG, not to run around coked out of their mind, mocking customers and starting fights... 6.) This was all too surreal not to try one more time for shits and giggles...I expected more than an Underground with shitty sushi...
