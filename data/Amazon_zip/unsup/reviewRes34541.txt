"Longing for" would be a grand understatement - since I moved out of Chicago and headed back West Sultan's Market and their cheap, delicious, vegi/vegan friendly menu crosses my mind at least 3 times a week. The thought of all of that warm pita bread, hummus, chili-garlic hot sauce, and lentil soup is giving me a huge food boner right now. Oh oh, the salad bar... roasted brussel sprouts, kalmata olives, grape leaves... my knees are quivering. I'll never have a falafel like that again in my life and the memories alone are making my heart feel as though it's in a food processor.
