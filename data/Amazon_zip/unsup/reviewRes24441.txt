Ouch, OH S%#T!, DAMN THAT'S HOT! This is all that was said between my girlfriend and I when we went here for Valentines day. Let me clarify, this place is very romantic. For people who like the exhausted theme of fondue, by all means go here. It's very romantic, so bring a date. Or it would be great for a group of girls/ladies to have a nice night out together. Food is presented nicely, drink selection is above average (for a fondue place), and you'll leave feeling you did something "special." However, our experience was quite the contrary. Our server was rude right off the bat since I wanted a cocktail, but my girlfriend wanted wine. Evidently he was looking to sell us on a premium bottle. We ordered the grand feast deal, it has pretty much everything on the menu. When the food came we were a little excited since it had a nice presentation. Then he turned the oil up to high, because everything began popping and bursting while it was in the pot. Oil splattered all over place, got on my shirt, and the server had little to say for it. All in all, a let down, and probably the last time I'll ever do fondue. The cuisine of fondue it tired and unimaginative. Somewhere in the history of this lame concept, we gave them permission to charge astronomical prices for cooking our own food in oil or in a french broth... Do yourself a favor, go somewhere that you can actually rave about the food and save this for get together at your house (because for the cost of your meal, you could buy the equipment...).
