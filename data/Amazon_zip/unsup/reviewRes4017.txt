I know. I've said "BEST MEAL EVER" multiple times, but Schwa was the most memorable experience. We sat in this tiny room that was barely bigger than my bedroom. The waiters were drunk off whiskey and the place was blasting hip hop music. Mind you, this was a Michelin restaurant, and I loved the unpretentious ambiance. Food-wise. AMAZING. best things -- the truffle ravioli, chicken liver risotto and s'more short ribs. my bf left drunk because that's what you do at a BYOB establishment.
