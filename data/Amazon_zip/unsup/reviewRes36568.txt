After having a horrible week, driving 2 hrs in traffic on a Friday afternoon and then ending up missing my massage, the people at Soothe your Senses Day Spa recommended this place for dinner. They said it was really good and since the night was so perfect, it would be a nice walk to unwind. It was the sunshine in my bleak week. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table which went by pretty fast since I grabbed a menu to help me decide on what I should order. We were seated and immediately the server started taking care of us. We were tired and oh so hungry that the BYOB didn't click. But that's OK, the food was amazing so the alcohol was not necessary. Thai: Tom Yum - Spicy goodness Tom Ka Kai - So good, words can't describe Chicken Veggie Delite - Tasty just too white for me Beef Drunken Noodles - Yummy, spicy and can be eaten for breakfast, dinner, snack, you get the picture. Japanese: Philadelphia Roll - Too cream cheesy and lots of rice, I'd prefer less rice but I guess its OK for a smoked fish, if it were raw though, definitely more fish, less rice! Spicy Scallop Roll - Different, not sure if I'd order it again, a hint of fishy I must say, my dinner companion is not a raw fish type of girl so she didn't want to try any of the fancy rolls. That's why I'm going to grab my adventurous girl pal and go back for the following: The Crocodile The Frie Komodo The Butter Ocean The Rainbow No room for dessert! Although I wanted to try one of the following which I'll save for next time: Thai Iced Coffee Red Bean Ice Cream Sweet Sticky Rice and Mango Passion Fruit Torte Thai Custard I think I'll go back and just eat the Tom Ka Kai and all the desserts! Oh and the drunken noodles, and, darn, I'll just end up ordering a bunch of stuff and getting super full like last time. I just have make sure to park really far so that I can somewhat digest some of that food prior to getting into my vehicle. Or just walk from home. That's less than 3 miles. We'll see. Can't wait.
