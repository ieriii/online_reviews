Went with 2 friends on a Sunday night - were told 1 hour 15 min wait, which was happily shortened to 35 minutes.  We ordered the butternut squash, artichokes with potatoes, 2 salads, cheese plate, and prossiuto, plus the cauliflower. We loved all, the flavors were great! Tiny, tiny dishes though. The squash, artichokes and cauliflower were probably 1 1/4 cups each. I know its tapas, but teensy! I could have eaten more I think! With 5-6 plates on the little table at a time, plus wine and water, it still gets crowded.  For dessert - the panini with nutella, marshmallow, and bananas! And the brioche filled with ricotta and choc chips. Loved both.  I would go back!
