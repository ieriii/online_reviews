Yes! This pizza is excellent! The thick crust is great, but the thin crust is my fave..and its one of very few pizzas my girlfriend and I can agree on. The crust is awesome.. not too thin, but not too thick. The sauce is sweet and plentiful. If you eat at the restaurant, please notice the neon whale wearing women's panties on his head. NICE.
