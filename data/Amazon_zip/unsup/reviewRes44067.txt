Perhaps they had a bad night but, my dad and I both disliked our steaks. We ordered the Delmonico special. The jumbo shrimp were burned, dry and tasteless. The special whisky sauce was terrible and the steaks were very average. The service was also very inattentive. This would have been an ok meal if the steaks were $15-20ea but they were $39ea.
