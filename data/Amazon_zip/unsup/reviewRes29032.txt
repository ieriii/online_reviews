Like ya! Tired of the same old taco? (no pun intended) Check this place out, you'll never think of Mexican food in the same light again. You're gonna pay more than at your typical Taco Bell kids, but it's worth it. Bring a date here and she'll be impressed with your exploration and creativity. Hell, after dinner walk across the street and catch a show at the Baton - they always offer a uniquely good time...
