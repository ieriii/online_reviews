I had the most amazing dining experience last night at Big Jones! The place is swanky. I love the colors and the neat tables and chairs. very upscale but managed to keep a southern feel. The paintings were also interesting. We ordered sweet tea first, and they brought a out a bottle of simple syrup with our tea so we could make it as sweet as we wanted. Brilliant! We ordered the Crawfish Croquettes for an appetizer. I was sad that there were only three... until I took a bite. There was so much flavor in each bite, it was definitely worth the price. The accompanying spicy mayo was tasty. For the main course, I ordered the special- I have no idea what the name of it was, but it was THE BEST PORK CHOP I HAVE EVER HAD. The meat was succulent, and it was drizzled in savory sauce with perfect spiciness. The pork chop was served on some excellent cheese grits, with a wonderful spicy okra/ rice/bacon mix on the side. I could eat this every day i think. WOW. My sweetea had the Fried Green Tomato BLT and she was just as impressed with the quality and flavor. Our waiter was on the ball. Very attentive without crowding. He kept up the great service, even bringing us new forks for each course, and keeping our tea filled. Our main courses took a little while, but he kept us informed in the meantime. I told him I would come back every week if they added the pork chop to the permanent menu. We shared a Red Velvet cake for dessert, and it too was delicious. I can't wait to go back! Good thing Big Jones is only a few blocks from home.
