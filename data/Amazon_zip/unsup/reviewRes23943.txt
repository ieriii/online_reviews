A little jewel in Andersonville, this Algerian place is a delight. Lovely in every respect they have gluten-free crepes, a great atmosphere, attentive service, and high quality food. They work with you to give you exactly what you want so feel free to request things. They are BYOB and one of the best liquor stores in Chicago is right across the street. They even offered to hold our table until we got back with a bottle.
