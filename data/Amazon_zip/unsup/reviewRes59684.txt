I think that if you r looking for the place to have dinner and want to be sure to leave the restaurant satisfied with the taste of food , this place is the nomber one to consider. last night I had the best wild salmon and it was really fabulous. and my huspbent ordered his favorite steak , he loves steaks there, but this time his "midium rear" was a little bit overcooked..and first time we were not happy with the service of this place : the waiter-David was very arrogant !!! that's why I give this place only 4 stars.. to the waiter i'd give just 2
