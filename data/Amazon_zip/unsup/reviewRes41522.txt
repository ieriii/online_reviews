Best pho in town by far!!!! The portions are more than generous..and their pho broth is the top!!!  Beef pho with sweet and chili sauce moderately mixed, with TONS of fresh vegetables...and add green peppers for extra oomph! and you are ready to go. Their shrimp roll appetizer is the great as well...crunchy, and sweet~! Asian chick telling you where to get good asian food. It doesn't get better than this!
