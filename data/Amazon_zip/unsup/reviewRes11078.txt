I've been here twice now, and luckily I've never had to wait. The first time we came the Friday morning after the Yelp holiday party, and second time we came early thanks to the GF's parents being early risers. Their menu looks great. I'd love to try the Red Velvet Pancakes, accept I'm not a huge pancake fan, so I'd only need 2 bites and then I'm good, so I'll have to remember to come with someone who will order that. Both time I've gone I've gotten the omelet with Chorizo, cheese and avocado, and salsa. Amazing. Both the GF and her father have ordered the breakfast burrito, it's huge and delicious. The second time the GF ordered the Veggie breakfast sandwich, it's also huge, and she loved it. I don't know if I'd want to stand around waiting for hours to sit, but if you can get in and get a seat, it's fantastic. Also, 4 meals, 4 coffee ran about $60 plus tip, so it's not your regular greasy spoon breakfast place. I might not go here every weekend, but it's a great special treat.
