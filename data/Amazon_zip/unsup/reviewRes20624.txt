We have previously drank and dined at The Gage and thought the food, decor and location would work well for our wedding after party.  So far, the service has been impeccable, the rental fee the least expensive thing we have purchased for our wedding and we can't wait to have the event there. Plus, since we are at the Art Institute for the ceremony, our guests will not have to walk very far in the cold Chicago winter.
