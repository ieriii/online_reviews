My husband and I visited Chicago New Years Eve weekend. We traveled with our 2 year old son which made restaurant choices difficult. Somehow this restaurant caught our eye.  We walked in and they welcomed us right away. Although the place isn't exactly a "child" restaurant, they did not make us feel out of place.  The food was delish. The wine choices were good. If I lived in Chicago I would visit this place over and over.
