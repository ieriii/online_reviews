We've been here for dinner and just for dessert. Here's the thing, you hear all the hoopla and I think it's easy to get disappointed. The service here is impeccable, the room is classic, attention to detail is fascinating, and the delivery of the food is smooth. The food is not so up to par, albeit interesting combinations and tastes. For example, I had the short rib with unagi...wonderful food, but not close your eyes savory good. In fact, I separated the food on my plates and it was amazing just on its' own. It was definitely more appealing to your eyes than your stomach. Now, that being said, the desserts are worth the couple hour seating. We went to celebrate a birthday and we had the three course dessert. The desserts were amazing little pieces of art themselves and the taste so much more pleasurable. They had printed out a little copy of the menu of the night with the birthday person's name and date...it was a nice touch.
