This place is so fu*king GOOD! I'm from the east coast, so you can probably guess how I feel about deep dish. Gross. This pizza is delicious because it's unique and not exactly New York pizza (they aren't trying to be) but it's still so tasty. It's not like thin wood oven delicate pizza...but it doesn't matter because it's great on it's own level. The best deal is on Sunday night--you can get a large pizza and growler for 25 bucks. It must be take out though. I did this a few weeks in a row until my pants got tight. I'm on a hiatus but i'll be back, don't worry. Service was always cool when I dined in and the beer is awesome. Skip everything there but pizza and beer. Go in and try some or do take out on Sunday. Piece is a great hungover weekend brunch meal, casual date spot, or family friendly place.
