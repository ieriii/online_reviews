I should've prepped for the heartburn. Best dish of the night was probably the artery clogging Tony's Chicken. That stuff is seriously like crack. It's heavily breaded but the chicken is super tender and it's spicy and sweet. As equally good was the garlic peasprouts--mostly stems (which my bf didn't prefer). The shui-zhu niu rou ("water boiled beef")--beef was rather rough and the flavor wasn't up to snuff. The dandan noodles were completely soaked with soy sauce on the bottom so if you let it sit too long, you might as well be eating soy sauce flour. Value? Dude, Chinese in my book should never be more than 20/person! But we came here relatively early on a Fri evening and service was actually one of the better I've seen in Chinese places. Still, 3.5 stars. I'd go back to try other dishes but it's not OMG GOOD.
