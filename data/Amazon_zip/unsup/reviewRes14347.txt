I really wanted to like this place...but unfortunatly I didn't. I had the Ropa Vieja, which is my favorite cuban dish. It looked SOO good but when I tasted it it tasted like nothing. I added salt and hot sauce to enhance the flavor but it didn't help. The plantains were good but overall I was totally disappointed. The service wasn't that great either. Maybe it was just an off night.
