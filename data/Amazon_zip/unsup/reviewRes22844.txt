Lets start with the black bean dip which is smoky, a lil spicy and something to write home about. Yes, the oatmeal shake is what dreams are made of. We needn't spend anymore time on that.  The Chicharron! The Chicharron! When I ate this it honestly changed the way I live my life. The fat and skin peel away from each other and melt in your mouth. I apologize if that sounds gross to some, but I'm not sorry for my description. I'm sorry that you will never know what true love is.
