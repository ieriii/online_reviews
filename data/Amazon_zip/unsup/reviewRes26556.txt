I've been dining at Nuevo Leon since my college days at UIC, forty years ago. This place is large (two additional rooms just west of the main entry dining area), bustling and CHEAP.  A very nice combination meal is only $6, with tostada, enchilada, taco and salad with guacamole, a steal. All the meals receive free chips and salsas: the red salsa is crisp and fresh-flavored, the green is really good and smoky, served in a lava molcajete bowl. And I've always gotten an amuse bouche of soup or a meatball or some other nice starter, again free.  The last lunch I ate there, a few days ago, I had the $6 three taco lunch, and chose barbacoa as the filling. It came with cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes and onions on the side for you to add to your liking. The menu is fairly wide, though everything's inexpensive, covering most of the Tex-Mex specialties and various steaks, pork and chicken. I don't think they do seafood, but I'm not a seafood aficionado, so I probably wouldn't notice if they do or not. The checkout is a little unusual: I usually go up near the register and stand until I see my waitress; then she hands me my check and I hand it to the manager/cashier for payment. I've always paid cash, as my bill rarely exceeds $10 and I'm not even sure if they take credit cards, so have a little cash in your pocket.
