There's nothing particularly Korean about this place other than that red sauce they use on the Buddha Bowl, but they're pretty upfront about that. The menu clearly spells out that these are American takes on Korean dishes, and I'd agree with that. But who cares, if you want Korean food, go to a Korean restaurant. This place is a fried chicken hut and they do a great job. The buffalo sauce is standard issue Frank's Red Hot and the other sauces are pretty sweet (ok very sweet) with some nice heat to balance it out. The chicken pieces are moist and the skin is crisp. You won't mistake this for standard American Fried Chicken, it's got a different texture. We never order in chicken wings because they're so easy to make, but this style of fried chicken requires special equipment, so Crisp is our go to for wings. The buddha bowl is a pretty pathetic example of bi bim bop and I haven't mustered the courage to try the burrito. Stick to the chicken.
