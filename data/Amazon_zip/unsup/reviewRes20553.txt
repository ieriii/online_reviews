I have been here a few times now. Definitely would be a place to recommend to the friendly travelers enjoying the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago, to stop in for lunch or an early dinner. It is a hop off the main drag and once you are in, you slip right into a nook of something fantastic. The ambiance is really laid back (not as stuck up as a lot of other places on Michigan ave. are) Everything on the menu is is good their from their soups to the fish n' chips, to their sandwiches. Their drink menu is extensive as well and some of the more well-priced in the area.
