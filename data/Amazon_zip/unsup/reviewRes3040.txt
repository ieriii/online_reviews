we ordered the whole chicken, plain jane. my husband isn't a saucy type of guy. accompanying our KFC were fries and a burrito with korean beef. the burrito was forgettable. the flavor just didn't work for me. the chicken was hit and miss depending on the piece. some were dry and others were fairly moist. the fries were hot and crispy, but nothing special either. i think we should have ordered the wings. besides that, crisp is in a hip little area called lake view. by the time my husband and i finished dinner, all of the stores were closed. we would visit again to try the wings if we're ever in chicago.
