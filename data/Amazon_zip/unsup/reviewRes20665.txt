Taste like you're actually on the coast, not far from the ocean! High quality sushi. I'm not a drinker, but BYOB seems to be a big reason so many people flock here, and the fact that it's the best sushi I have had yet. The only issue I have is you'll pay $2.00 to $3.00 more than any other sushi place for common maki. With that said, if you're after quality and not quantity come here you won't be let down. Another cool thing is the atmosphere and utensils very natural, yet modern.
