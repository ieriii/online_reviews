Always fresh and delicious, this italian treat deserves special attention. In true neighborly form, owner Johnathan Goldsmith treats diners like welcome family. For example, while I was soliciting business support for a school fundraiser, Johnathan not only supplied a generous Gift Certificate for our event, he fed my 2 kids a snack- each got a 1/2 a pizza to munch on. . . the aroma was too much to take, and we were back without the kids a day later to gorge on fresh, delicious mouth-watering italian pizza. . . ummm. . . think maybe we need to head back tonight:)
