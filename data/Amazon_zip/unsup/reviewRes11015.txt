Piece is an awesome place to get original and fresh ingredients on a great pizza. They also have stellar beers on tap (You won't get a Miller Lite here, they only sell their own brews.) It's officially a sports bar, but its not typical. It's got a really nice open feel due to the high ceilings and giant windows that are open during the summer. It's a good place to go for a casual time without feeling like you are sitting in a basement.  (I only say this b/c a lot of casual places often feel dark and basement like). Piece is a fun hangout to catch an afternoon game or for a night out. I have yet to try the Wed. Night Karaoke or Friday night live music, but I am definitely going to give both a try.
