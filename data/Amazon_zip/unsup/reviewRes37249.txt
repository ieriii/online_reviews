a bar with a gourmet edge! My friend, Brittany recommended this place since she had a mussel craving. And since I don't eat fish, I cannot comment on the mussels themselves, which she said were delicious. She got them beer battered and I tasted the gravy- that was pretty good! Super hearty and great flavour. They come with a huge portion of fries and mayo which aren't very good at all. The place itself is a beer bar- has a staggering number of beers and the bartender seemed really informative. They have space in the back and stairs to the 2nd floor with additional seating. Also, the loo is downstairs- not the best place when you have a couple under your belt.. I had the fontina and the CB&J sandwich. Also had original sin cider. I don't drink beer, so this bar was kinda wasted on me. But since I do like an occasional cider I thought I would try the original sin. Must say I liked it! tart and not too sweet and no prolonged aftertaste.. went down perfectly! The CB&J was super interesting. Had all the greasiness of bar food, and a grilled sandwich- yum yum- but had a great mix of ingredients and flavours taken into account. The fontina was the cherry on top of the cake. Made with spinach and cheese and wrapped in phyllo- and i can never say no to phyllo. Had a goddess dressing on top- not a lot, but well presented - and some greens as well. The textures were well balanced and totally worth the wait! Couple of things to note- they can only zap your card thrice and there is no food till 5 pm. Since I got there at 3, my friend and I waited till 5.
