The gf and I were back in the windy city in late April and happened upon this lovely little gem - thanks to all of you yelpers!  Loved the pizza, loved the fresh mixed greens salad, loved the ambiance.  Had great service. No complaints. The fifth star is reserved for The Homemade Pizza Company - THE BEST EVER!!
