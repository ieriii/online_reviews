This place has been getting a lot of hype, and it received the Bib Gourmand designation by the Michelin Red Guide.  I went for a weekday lunch by myself and sat at the bar. Service was good for a bar seat. I got a draft beer, the bone marrow, and the braised pork shoulder. Beer was good but slightly overpriced. Bone marrow was just okay. The braised pork shoulder, supposedly their signature dish, was tender but was too salty.  Overall not a bad meal. I can see this as a great place to go for a night cap or a munchie with a group of friends. Frankly Chicago needs to have more late night gastro-joints like this near Mag Mile. But still, IMHO, the food was just "okay," which makes me feel that the place is a bit overpriced and over-hyped.
