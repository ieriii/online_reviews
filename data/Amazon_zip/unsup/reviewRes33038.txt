One of my favorite places to go in Chicago! The owner is funny, accomodating and very personable. The staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. A couple of our friends were not sure what to order and the staff did a great job with recommendations. The owner came over several times to chat and joke around with us and at one point gave us all a free shot! The 8 of us each ordered something different and shared it family style and there was not one complaint about the food. Everything was delicious! It is definitely a restaurant to experience!
