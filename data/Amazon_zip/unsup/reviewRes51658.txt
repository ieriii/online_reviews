This is a plain neighborhood dive, but it offers solid food, great prices, and good service. The steak tacos are very good and the GIGANTIC burritos are a steal (my husband can't finish an entire one in one sitting, which is saying a lot). Salsa tastes pretty fresh, the chips are hit or miss (usually hit), and the enchiladas verdes are tasty. Quesadillas are ok. The fajitas are boring (very bland). Garcia's stays open very late, which is not only a plus, but probably also part of the reason why it has such a devoted following.
