***Tortilla Soup Rating ONLY*** While I would probably give the restaurant 5 stars overall, it is the taste of Frontera's tortilla soup that endures. This stuff is AWESOME!!!! Delicious. Just thinking about it...makes me speechless (which isn't great for a written review). In short, go to Frontera NOW and eat their tortilla soup.
