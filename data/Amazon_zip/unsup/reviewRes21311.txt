I had to try this out since I had heard a bunch about it. I didnt really know what to expect but it was pretty good. Definitely different flavors than I normally find around the Chicago area. I do not know how often I would really want to go back but I plan on giving it another shot when I am in the area. I was pleasantly surprised by the flan cake that had my tongue in a confused but intrigued state. Overall it was okay but nothing amazing.
