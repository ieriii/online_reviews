Overall a very underwhelming experience. I went with my brother and our cousin for dinner, and though we were seated in the back away from other tables, it was still inordinately loud. The drinks selection was pretty good, but my glass of Pinot Noir was too expensive for the quality. The menu isn't that big, and the appetizers didn't seem that, er, appetizing. So we just shared a bowl of edamame. Then we got our dishes--the lo mein noodles, the cod and the duck. The lo mein was ok, the cod was too salty, and the duck (which I had) was ok. However, the portion sizes were really small, and an hour later, I felt like I hadn't had any dinner. Finally the waiter tried to push desserts on us, but we abstained. So a glass of wine (my companions just stuck to water), edamame, and three small-portion entrees came out to ninety bucks for three people! I definitely won't be coming back unless they change things drastically.
