My wife called every day for 3 months to get a table for my birthday on 10/30/10 and even then had to settle for a 5:30 reservation. No problem, still really excited to go. We were on the 50 bus at 4:30 when they called to cancel. The guy on the phone told us to leave a message and they would get back with us right away and get us in whenever we wanted. Today is 11/5 and we still haven't heard back from the message we left. My wife felt awful, which really upset me because she had tried so hard to get these reservations and Schwa shit all over us. The food most be amazing for them to be able to treat their patrons like total shit. Schwa if you read this; go fuck yourselves, we'll find some where else to spend our money.
