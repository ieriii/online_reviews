Food was amazing and service was attentive and pleasant. We changed our reservations 3 times and each time the host was just as generous with accommodating the time. I had the seafood combination platter with Mac & cheese and cream of spinach as sides. All were fresh and great. I almost didn't go to the restaurant because of the unattractive photos of the restuarant. Glad I went anyway.
