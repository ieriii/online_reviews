3.5 stars. maybe my expectations were too high, but i just wasn't blown away. don't get me wrong. the food was good, but i was expecting more. the only dish i really loved was the tuna sashimi. that was delicious. a great pairing of fresh fish with an avocado sauce, mango puree, radish. quite tasty. the truffle oil and chive popcorn they started us off with was nice too. the rest was just alright: duck satay, sea scallops, wagyu beef, which you'd think would be amazing but was just okay, wild alaskan halibut and whitefish. actually preferred the whitefish to the wagyu beef. weird, right? finished with espresso panna cotta, dark chocolate torte and strawberry sponge cake. all just okay don't think i'll be goin back....we'll see
