Been there 5+ times Place is huge so wait time is non-existent. Mix of young professionals after work, friends, and dates. Wait staff is always friendly and responsive. Cheese flights are well designed. Every dessert is fantastic including the red velvet cake. Entrees are hit or miss. Portion size is good for most of my friends, but the flavor can be either bland or too strong.
