I've been to this place many times and the food is always great!! The waitresses are always friendly and efficient. The only bad thing about this restaurant is the old guy who is the cashier. He is rude, snide and very unpersonable. I'm not sure if he is the owner, but if he is he needs to give the cash register job to someone who is friendly!
