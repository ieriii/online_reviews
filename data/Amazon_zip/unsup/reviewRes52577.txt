I was recently here for dinner with the family and although it wouldn't have been my first choice for dining I enjoyed the food. My brother who is a big meat eater and just a big eater in general insisted on going here. I'm a big salad bar person so of course I made the mistake of filling up mostly on everything there. My favorites included the shrimp salad and the mushroom risotto. I liked most of the meat that the gauchos brought to our table. I think my favorite was whatever meat I had covered in bacon and the shrimp. Ooohh I also was in love with the grilled pineapple. When I said my brother was a big meater I wasnt joking, he kept his coin turned over pretty much the entire time. My family and I laughed because whenever we looked up a gaucho was there offering some different style of meat to him. It was like he was King of Brazzaz or something. My mom and I shared the creme brulee which was pretty good. It was my first time having creme brulee so I can't compare it to others. I was a little disappointed in my wine, I had two glasses and each one had a little cork in it. Rather than send it back I just took it out and drank it. I probably would've given Brazzaz 4 stars but like I mentioned I'm more of a salad bar person and at $45 a person for dinner it just isn't worth it for me. Now if I had a coupon I wouldn't mind coming back just for any bacon covered meat they want to serve me.
