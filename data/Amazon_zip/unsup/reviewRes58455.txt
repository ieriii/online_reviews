This place is such a hidden gem! One of my ABSOLUTE favorites in the city!My first time here was about 6 months ago when a friend recommended it. After we trucked it to waaaaay out of my comfort zone (the place in on Ravenswood) and walked into the strip mall looking entrance, I was instantly thinking....oh great, this is going to suck. But that was so NOT the case. I was greeted by a super friendly guy who escorted my boyfriend and I to a cozy little 2 top table. We had heard it was BYOB so we were fully stocked on wine and someone rushed over and poured it for us right away. Then they bring the bread and dip...it's AMAZING! We looked at the menu ooh-ing and aah-ing for a few minutes unsure of what we wanted to order when the friendly guy came up to us again and asked if we had decided. I began to say what i would like when he cut me off and said Do you like mushrooms? I replied yes and then he went on with a few more yes or no questions to me before he moved onto my boyfriend and asked him What looks good to you on the menu? He asked him a few yes or no questions and then said, I'm going to make you both special entrees! We were shocked, do people really customize meals for you? This has never happened to me before, I mean, we just walked in off the street! It really blew us away!Then when the meals came, they were both entrees designed specifically for each of us and to our specific liking. I had a homemade pasta dish with the best sauce I've ever tried and sauteed veggies!I could keep going but you get the drift! Put this place on your MUST go to list!
