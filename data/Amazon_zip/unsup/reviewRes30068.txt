You cannot beat the food and the service. You think you know Mexican food until you come here. Every bite melts in your mouth with flavors that blow you away. I always take out-of-town guests here, and I've never heard anything except "Holy c&%4, that was AMAZING!" Plus the margaritas are simply delicious (they go down a little too easy). There's a reason Rick won the James Beard Award.
