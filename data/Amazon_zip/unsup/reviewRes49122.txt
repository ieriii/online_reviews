I love Bin 36! I have been a fan for at least 8 years and every visit has been ON POINT. Particularly because the meat and cheese plate is my perfect idea of an epicurean delight. And the cabernet sauvignon jelly/jello....so awesome with the younger gouda. It is funny when two glasses of wine, four pieces of cheese and a salami are $65, but we are in Chicago, right? In any case, we departed feeling as satisfied if we ate dinner. So I guess I like expensive cheese...
