A small caveat to this review is I was there on St. Patty's day. However I still think just about everything applies. For an area of town like the loop where decent bars are hard to come by this is one I'll definitely be back to. Huge space with a bar upstairs and down stairs, and even on st. patty's day wasn't too crowded. They had a rabbit sausage special with pork bellys, it was off the charts delicious. Something very unique and really tasty. The drinks and food were pricey, probably a little too pricey, but it's what I expected from the neighborhood. Service was good, overall an enjoyable experience.
