I came here with a group of people on our way to Dark Lord Day (see Three Floyds). It was packed out and we had to wait forever for a table. I can't really blame them since it is Chicago and it was a Friday night so what should I have expected. Anyway, I can't really remember the meal all that well. I think it was good, I really liked the popcorn with the bacon and I think I'm going to try to recreate it at home. The burger was good and everyone looked pretty satisfied. The one thing that I really didn't like was the hoppy ice cream that we ordered for dessert. Thank god we were all full and tired and decided to share one dessert because I don't think that I could stomach more than one bite of the ice cream. The flavor combination of sweet cream and hops is just wrong and they should just stop making it. Hoppy ice cream should not exist. (Side note, I just made a Southern Tier Chocolate Stout ice cream and it came out amazing so beer ice cream can be done.) Anyway, Revolution was pretty good and I did try some really excellent beer there. I don't think that this was one of my favorite brewpubs but it definitely isn't the worst. Would I come back again? Maybe?
