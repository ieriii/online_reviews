I am not vegan or veggie- but had one in town so decided to try this place out. They have fake meat in quotes on the menu with no explanation what the 'sausage' is and ... paid 3.95 for a 6oz glass of tomato juice, and unfortunately for that price it did not come in a jeweled gold goblet. If you enjoy all 'food'...not recommended.
