As a native Chicagoan, I never understood the hype about this place until we happened to be walking by and stopped for lunch. And now, all I can say is ... delivery or pickup? So, next time you're wandering by--looking for something to eat before a movie perhaps--give them a try. Green pepper, mushroom and onion, maybe?
