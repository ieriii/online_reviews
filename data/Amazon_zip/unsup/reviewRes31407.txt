Ate at Mastro's on 4/30/11 and was very disappointed with the meal I had. I had heard so much about this place and how good it was. My Porterhouse steak tasted like it was cooked in a 250* oven, had no broiler taste at all. The au gratin potatoes looked like they were on steiroids loaded with velveeta cheese. Also, the desserts like the butter cake had an oily taste covered in a thick syrupy sauce. I have had steaks from some of the best restaurants and believe me, don't waste your money on this one.
