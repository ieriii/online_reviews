Had lunch here with coworkers and it was perfection! Probably some of the best sushi I've had in the city. The place itself is visually stunning, especially the impeccable sushi bar. The iced tea came in a carafe with mango flavored syrup you could add yourself- love that! All the sushi rolls are so unique! I would highly recommend the hand-cut spicy tuna signature roll. Delicious and amazing foodie experience! A must try!
