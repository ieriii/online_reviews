Excellent beer bar. One of my favorites in Chicago. They always have a great on-tap selection and and extensive bottled beer list. If you like beer, you will love the Hopleaf. They have every style of beer available, and even mead! They also have special tapping events from time to time, so make sure you check them out often.
