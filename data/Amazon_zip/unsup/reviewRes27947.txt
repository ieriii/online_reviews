Really good. Less inventive, but also tastier and better executed than I expected! I was impressed at how well the flavor-profiles of the dishes aligned. Often with New American food, "creativity" gets the better of the dish actually making sense. Not so here! Thanks, Graham Elliot, for a delicious, well-thought-out meal!
