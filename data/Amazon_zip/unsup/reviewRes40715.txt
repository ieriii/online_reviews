Wow!! I-love-this-place!!!! I like Chipotle as much as the next guy (maybe more), but this place puts Chipotle to shame! There are three of these right in the same area, but all slightly different. Go to the one with the black sign. Get the steak "super" burrito. The steak is good quality and charred perfectly. The burritos are also large enough to split because the chips and three kinds of salsa that come out first are awesome...it's hard to resist filling up on those. Watch out for the green salsa...it's great but it's HOT! This is so good and so cheap you won't even believe it. Someone got shot there a while back (robbery), but it's totally worth the risk.
