My first Korean restaurant experience in Chicago. I thought the service was good, despite the bad service reviews. We simply asked for what we wanted and it was brought to us, fast. We had the marinated kalbi, pork kalbi, kaibi tang soup, seafood scallion pancake and extra rice. The banchan (side dishes) are abundant. Food quality is fresh and the BBQ was excellent. Keep the jackets in the car and prepare to smell like BBQ when you leave. It's all worth it and very satisfied. Last, CHEAP for Korean, especially coming from NYC. Our bill was $15 each for a party of six.
