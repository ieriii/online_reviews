Yes, I have had the pleasure/experience of dining at Schwa and Alinea within 3 days of one another. Due to this fortunate turn of events, I feel like this is almost going to be a comparison. Schwa is a restaurant you think up with your bestfriends when you are just sitting around dreaming up wild sh*t. And it turned out awesome. Alinea is like Schwa's older, more serious brother, or cousin maybe. (I'm stealing this line from the company I was with...) "Schwa is the type of place you could easily come back once a month to see what those crazies are up to in the kitchen. Alinea is a once, MAYBE twice a year place." Our reservation was "canceled" due to a sink breaking the night before, but rescheduled for the next night. Everyone was very nice about this (Michael apologized profusely), threw in some extra courses, and a few bucks taken off the final bill. Not too shabby. We did the 9 course and easily put down 2 bottles of wine. Really the only course I didn't like was the peanut brittle chicken liver. Luckily my date did, so he got two. Best by far was the lobster course, as well as one of the extras - a quail egg ravioli. I can honestly see why it's hard to get a reservation. The place is smaller than my bedroom.  P.S. take your time on the way to the restroom! It's back in the kitchen and you can see what everyone is up to back there.
