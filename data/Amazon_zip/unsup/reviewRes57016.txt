The food was really great. Ate way too much which is probably the norm here. I really liked it and hope large scale uber expensive places like this can be profitable (ie. stick around) I thought the wine wall was a really nice touch (re; uber expensive place). They didn't seem to sell much wine but the trapeze artist who would descend down from the ceiling to find the wines once ordered was a really nice touch, certainly captivated me each time!
