A group of 4 of us went there on a Saturday night at around 6pm and were shocked that we only had to wait about 20mins for a table. About 10mins into our wait, a line at the door really started to get long, so we lucked out. The only complaint about the hostess service was that we were asked by 5 different people how many were in our group and that they would go check for a table. It would've been nice if they would have just taken our names down & how many were in our party. It definately would've been smoother for the staff and less annoying for us (we began to wonder if we would actually get a table since we were asked by so many different staff members). We went in there already knowing what we wanted, we read the menu online prior to getting there and read reviews saying that it does take about 45min to get your pizza. We ordered an appetizer and it came in about 15min. The calamari tasted like the stuff you get in the frozen section of the grocery store. The mozzerella sticks & spinach sticks were a larger than normal size and tasted good. A draft beer was about $5 for a 16oz, being from out of state that was about $3 more than what i normally pay. SO that was a bummer, but i expected it. The deep dish pizza was delicious! The crust tasted like cornbread (which I love) and it was really cheesy. The waitress was nice and checked back often. The interior design was amazing! All of the writing on the walls, seats, doors, picture frames was incredible. Definately bring a marker with you so you can add to it. I can't wait to go back there again!!!
