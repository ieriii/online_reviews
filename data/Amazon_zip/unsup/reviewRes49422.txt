Oh Las Tablas, how long I have loved you! I remember when you were just a tiny little place with no space for customers waiting for a table, and your service was slow, but lovable at the same time. I fell a little out of love with Las Tablas when they moved into a larger new space across the street because I felt like they lost some of the charm that made them feel like a special find. And, while the "original" Las Tablas used to allow for BYOB, the new location started charging a corking fee. Those changes were disappointing, but luckily the food never wavered. Literally every time I dined at Las Tablas (honestly, at least 30 times during the nine years I lived in Chicago) we started with Arepa Chorriada, which is a wonderful corn-type bread with melted cheese and criolla. It's made even more lovely with a little chimichurri on the side.  I then almost always ordered the Matrimonio (a mix of entrana skirt steak and pollo al ajillo)...it's served on the cutest wood board (hence, las tablas) and accompanied with the sweetest plantain and yummiest yuca and potato. Again, chimichurri here just enhances every bite. All in all Las Tablas is very tasty and reasonably priced. Actually, I wish I could have it for dinner tonight!
