The restaurant itself is a blast. Has a unique blend of an upscale restaurant feel with high quality service combined with an "old school" european tavern-like feel. Got a chance to meet up with an old friend of mine and since he moved to Chicago several years ago, he knew of this place. And actually, he was somewhat of a VIP here because he's friends with the general manager, so they treated us really well including starting us off with a complimentary dish of spicy pork rinds. Honestly, in terms of the food itself, this was probably the best part of the entire dinner. The rinds were sprinkled with incredibly tasting seasoning, but the the rinds themselves almost melted in your mouth. They are so bad for your health I imagine, yet so damn good... We ordered a number of other dishes. Like the other yelpers mentioned, these dishes are served family-style, which is great because you get to taste everything. We got the ribs (not bad, but a little dry), perch (second best dish next to the pork rinds), sunny-side up organic eggs over frites (tasty, but really, just french fries), sweetbread (a weird combination of sweet and saltiness). and the pork belly (tasty, but again, a little dry). If I had to rate the food itself, I'd unfortunately, have to give it 3 stars. However, with that said, the overall experience was very positive. Great lively atmosphere and unique decor with a combination of stand alone seating and shared bench seating at long tables. In addition, their selection of beers has no rivals, as apparently, the restaurant is "beer-focused" as stated its description. Tons of great dark and light beers to choose from with wide ranges of alcohol levels. Bottom line: 4 stars! Great overall experience dragged down slightly by 3 star tasting dishes.
