interesting grocery store slash cafe. i got a burger and fries.....it was decent. i'd say it was decent for a grocery store cafe? the burger a bit too charred in some spots. the fries were okay. it was a slow Sunday night, so i'm not sure if that played a role in my experience. i got a key lime pie also....it was okay. a little runny. some of the cakes and pastries they had there looked pretty good, but i didn't get those. i think this place would be a decent spot if you lived next door. not sure if i would go out of my way to come here, but maybe it was just a bad night for them...
