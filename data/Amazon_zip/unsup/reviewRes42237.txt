I've been going to tank noodle faithfully for the last 2 years. I took a break the last few months after they were closed due to health code violations. I decided to organize 9 of my friends to give tank another try a few days ago. Needless to say, I doubt I will ever go back there for the following reasons: 1. Service was awful. In their defense it was super busy, but we sat for at least 15 minutes before anyone even came over and then when we were finished we waited about 30 minutes to get the check. 2. They screwed up my order. I ordered vegetarian pho with tofu. They forgot the tofu and didn't include half of the vegetable listed on the menu for this item. When I asked the waiter about their mistake he told me that they would not remake my dish but instead that they would bring me some veggies in a bowl and my tofu in a bowl and that I could mix it together myself. He also said "I can't argue with the cooks, so i'll give you the veggies and tofu this time and not charge you extra, but only this time." WTF, you want to charge me for your mistake? So after waiting another 15 minutes they finally bring my veggies and tofu, but at this point my pho was starting to get cold and the noodles were soggy. 3. Pho broth had no flavor. In my opinion the service and quality of food has seriously declined ever since they re-opened. There are many other vietnamese restaurants in the area that have food that is just as good, are cleaner, and actually appreciate your business!
