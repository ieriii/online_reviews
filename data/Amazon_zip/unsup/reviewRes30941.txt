We hosted our office holiday party at Nana this week and can't say enough good things about the food, the service, and the dcor. The Nana staff was friendly and professional, and they worked to accommodate all of our requests throughout the planning process - from designing a custom menu to meet our budget, to working out the ideal seating arrangement, to providing an AV set-up, to creating a simple and elegant holiday ambience. The night began with a mingling cocktail hour featuring an assortment of unique seasonal cocktails and transitioned into a three-course family-style meal. Everyone raved (and is still raving) about the food: pork loin with roasted apples, hanger steak with a chimmichurri sauce, roasted beet dumplings, mushroom quesadillas, and a decadent antipasto platter of house cured meats and cheeses, to name just a few items. I also want to make sure that the house-made white chocolate smothered popcorn gets a special mention. Mmm! After stuffing ourselves to the point of bursting, there was ample food leftover, and the staff kindly wrapped everything up for us - we are still feasting on the leftovers (which, as it turns out, are just as wonderful the next day)! Nana is known for its eclectic brunch menu, but it has also proved itself to be a wonderful choice for private parties - you will definitely be in good hands.
