Went there on my birthday and had a blast. They have half off margarita pitchers on Tuesdays which just hapen to be my birthday night. I got wasted and ended up partying with one of the waitresses after she got off work. It was a blast. Besides that though the atmosphere is wonderful with an authentic Mexican feel. This place also has a porch in the back which is nicely decorated as well.
