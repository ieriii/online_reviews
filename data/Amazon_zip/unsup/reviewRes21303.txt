I love Mayan Palace. Alejandro is the best waiter...ever. Their half price margaritas Tuesdays and Thursdays are a great deal, and the food is good, seems fresh, and cheap. A $4.95 veggie burrito?? HECK YES! It does get crowded on those half price nights, but it's cozy. There's not much to say about Mayan except that it's great, standard Mexican fare.
