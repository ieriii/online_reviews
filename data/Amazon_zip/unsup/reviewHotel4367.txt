I would live here if I could..okay, maybe not... but Palmer House Hilton has been the venue for a number of conventions and events I've attended and every time I'm here, I never want to leave!  This hotel is classy and worldly. Not pretentious classy, more sophisticated, aesthetically pleasing and I feel like I'm on vacation in early 20th century Europe.  I just love the majestic ambiance of the entire hotel- the ballrooms, conference centers, and lounges are beautifully classic! The facilities are gorgeous (and squeaky clean).  I was here one week for a work convention, and the next weekend for the White Sox fest.  My every experience here is magical, no matter what the occasion is! My imagination has a lot of fun here, which it doesn't get enough of as an adult:)
