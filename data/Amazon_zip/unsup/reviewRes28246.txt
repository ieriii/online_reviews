Chicago deep dish is wiggling all of its casserole-like goodness into my heart. And Pequod's is helping convert me into an official deep disher - tart tomato sauce, burnt-crust that was moist on the inside, perfectly crunch on the outside, and lots-and-lots-o-cheese. Unfortunately, Pequod's only offers "design your own pies" (this is starting to seem like common practice in Chicago), and not-so-many topping options (no unusual options or gourmet cheese choices), but this is far made up for my their ah-mazing $4.95 lunch deal! $4.95 for a 7"- 1 topping pizza and a domestic macro pint! I LOVE a good deal! The smaller, individually sized pizza means no sharing necessary! No topping selection arguments between me and the bf! And results in a pizza with a great crust-to-pie ratio! YUM.
