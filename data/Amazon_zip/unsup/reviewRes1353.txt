Delicious! Even the wait around the side of the building isn't bad because it gives you a chance to socialize with other Hot Doug enthusiasts who are happy to share their opinions on the "must-order" items. Most people will tell you to order the duck fat fries; which are only available on Fridays and Saturdays. They are good, don't get me wrong. I just don't see all the hype. My tip would be to order one of the many gourmet sausages that change daily, be it the bacon and cheddar elk sausage or the herb chicken sausage with brie and pear, but make sure to get a Chicago style hot dog as well. Trust me, you'll thank me for this tip because you won't want to get back in line and even if you aren't a big eater you won't be able to help yourself - it's all so good. Not to mention the friendly greeting you get from the owner, Doug himself and the decor is just so darn cute!
