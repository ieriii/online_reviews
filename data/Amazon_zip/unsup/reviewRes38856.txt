After wanting to go to Hopleaf for quite some time, my boyfriend and I finally stopped in. We were pleasantly surprised that we were seated right away, and it seemed like everything was off to a great start. Except it was mostly downhill from there. We waited 15 min for our server to come over, and then he forgot my beer, so I ended up waiting another 15ish min for by beer (we were done with our app by the time I finally got it). We ordered a few different things to try, all the food was decent, but nothing that made up for waiting over 30 min to get my first beer (at a place known for their beers). That being said, the beer selection is amazing!
