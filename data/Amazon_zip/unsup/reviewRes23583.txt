Yum yum yum. This place is great (service not so much...). When you dine in you get free chips & salsa. Love that they expanded their outdoor seating, because inside gets a little cramped. I wonder if their service outside is a little better now... Shakes - Definitely get a shake. My bf always get the chocolate shake, I usually mix it up and get a choc/strawberry shake. The oatmeal is awesome. Definitely get it with milk and not water.  Food - Chicken and rice - so good, very filling. You will have leftovers. Because the dinners are so big, lately I've been getting sandwiches. The breaded milanese (sp?) sandwich is great, they press them I think. They put their Lizano sauce on all the sandwiches, it's like this tangy tomato sauce, it's SO good. Burritos are also very good - they are huge! The only bad meal I have had here was when I ordered the potato tacos (after reading many good reviews on them). I was disappointed though, I didn't expect them to be fried and rolled up like those taquitos at 7-11. It was too much tortilla, too oily, and it was bland! I had to salt the hell out of it, and I never have to salt my food. That was a big disappointment. Service - It's family owned, so you see the same people guy and girl there all the time. The last time I went there was a blonde caucasian male there who looked new.... Service is not the best. They are pretty slow, but when you see the size of the kitchen, it's a little understandable. The wait staff does a decent job, but they could be a little friendlier, they just seem a little cold. One of the reasons we get take out is because we don't like the wait staff that much... They have delivery now, woohoo! Remember, it's cash only! But they have an ATM on site.
