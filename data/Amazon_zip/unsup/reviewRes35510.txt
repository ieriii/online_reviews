I have been coming here for 7 years. Usually for a rice box on my way home from work. For less than $5, you get a box of rice with roast duck/chicken/pork on top with a stalk or 2 of vegetables. Now they have peking duck! Craved tableside, served with steamed buns (not the traditional pancakes), hoisin sauce, cucumbers and scallions. The duck is not the same as the ones hanging in the window, so you usually have to call ahead. And it is available on the weekends (though if you give them a few days notice, you can have it on the weekdays). I think the set is around $30, and comes with pickled radish, duck fried rice, soup and dessert. It is enough for 4 people. I just had this at lunch today... 12 people went through 4 ducks, and had plenty of leftovers!
