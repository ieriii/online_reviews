I'm perplexed with the large amount of good ratings with Revolution Brewing. I'm in Logan Square a lot so I was very excited for this place. The hordes of people who descended on RevBrew wasn't a big surprise and the wait usually wasn't too bad assuming you didn't go specifically for a table during peak times. Outside of the interior, which I love, everything about this place is average. The beer, which I was looking forward to the most because I'm a beer snob, was a huge disappointment. The beers are by no means bad but they fail to distinguish themselves. The Workingman Mild tasted too watered down, the Coup d'etat started off interesting but stopped there and the Bottom Up Wit was merely passable. I must admit, however, that the Eugene porter was pretty good. When I had the RevBrew beers they didn't distinguish themselves from other stalwart wits, milds or saisons. The food (only appetizers so far, will return for main courses) were somehow more bland than the beer, an impressive feat which the cooks should be commended for. The spicy sweet potato cakes weren't spicy at all and lacked any complexity, the bruschetta (goat cheese + beats, traditional) was simply awful and the beer cheese soup tasted like something I could have concocted in 15 minutes. In each of these appetizers what was apparent was that the ingredients were subpar. The beets with the bruschetta lacked flavor and the cheese used in the soup was boring. I really, really wanted to like this place. It's a damn shame that the owner decided to play it safe and produce mediocrity because this place could have been amazing.
