Got there a little before five I was scared that we wouldn't get seated for a while cuz of the long line but we were seated forty mins after opening... Hostesses are a bit snobby but our waiter made up for it... Highly recommend trying the guacamole... Had the duck breast tacoes and the angus steak... Both were good... The plantains that come with the angus steak were delicious!!!
