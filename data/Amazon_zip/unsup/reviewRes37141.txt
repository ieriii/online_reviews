I have lived in this neighborhood and been a frequent customer to f & o for over 7 years now. While the supermarket is fantastic the cafe is terrible! I've had it with this place! They just can't seem to get it together. They hired help is is awful. Too slow and clueless! I enjoy the food and constantly give them "another chance", but today I was sent through the roof. While waiting online for a cup of soup ( I'm 7 months pregnant and have the flu) a man cut right in front of me and told the cashier he just wanted to pay for the items in his hand. Rather than telling him sir the woman is next she proceeded to ring him up! As if I were invisible! At this point I am far from invisible. I just had to walk out. As I did the week before while waiting 20 minutes for a server to take my order. Leave the restaurant to real restaurant people and just stick with what you know......the grocery business. Horribly managed restaurant. It's a shame because they do offer quality food.
