I've eaten greek twice before but was never a big fan. I ate here and i really did like everything i ate. i love locally owned places. they have flavor and familiarity that chains often lack, so this was no exception. the people are friendly and attentive (since i am obviously not greek) and the prices aren't ridiculous. my friend had the spinach and feta artopita and that was really good. salads are fresh and soups are good too. I didn't have much else so i can't say more. i wanted to try their coffee but i didn't have time. i would definately come back. =)
