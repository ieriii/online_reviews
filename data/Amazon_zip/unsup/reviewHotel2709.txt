This hotel was pretty much everything I wanted when I booked it. I Booked a 4-night stay from a travel discount site (Orbitz, Travelocity, etc) and got a rate around 130/ night. The bed was REALLY comfortable! The bath products were Khiel's and added that special touch. All around a modern, clean, QUIET hotel. Their club the J bar (detached but just around the corner) had great cocktails and funky house music (gotta love Chicago house music). There were some misunderstandings when I booked a massage in the Aveda spa but the front desk manager worked hard to make it right and my massage was fabulous (and at a discounted price). In fact, the entire staff was VERY friendly and eager to help however they could...I even received suggestions on some cool nightspots from the person who delivered my shot espresso. They get bonus points for all of the doormen being sexy! I didn't give the hotel 5 stars because I was less than pleased with the room service. One night I had to refuse the food for being cold. On the plus side, they offered a nice selection of fresh squeezed fruit and vegetable juices. The other reason they didn't get 5 stars, my bill at checkout time was incorrect. Located within a block radius is Starbucks, Trader Joes, a decent Mexican restaurant and Grand Lux Cafe (yummy spot operated by The Cheesecake Kitchen). Overall a great location and a hotel I would definitely revisit.
