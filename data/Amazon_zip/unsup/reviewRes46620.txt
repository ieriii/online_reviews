Though it's a bit outdated decor-wise, in this sort of 70s Ruby Tuesday's kind of way, the food is quite good. I was especially impressed with the homemade veggie burger. Most places serve me a gardenburger with their own toppings, and I don't complain, but I have to give credit to RJ Grunt's for serving me something that would take me a few hours to make at home. My husband loved his burger, and was really pleased that they were willing to serve a burger medium-rare. Also, delicious sweet potato fries.
