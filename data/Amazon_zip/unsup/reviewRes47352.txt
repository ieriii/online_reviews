My poor burger.... what a shame, just completely destroyed by whoever cooked it. In fact, other than an OK chicken sandwich everything at our table was completely butchered. We had asked for 2 medium-rares and a medium, and all 3 came out well done. The fries were burnt but somehow soggy and floppy, and the mac n' cheese looked nice but had absolutely zero flavor. I could tell by the ingredients used (the soft pretzel roll, the cripy fried prociutto, and what was left of the poor, dry, grey beef) that had the cook knew what he/she was doing this burger actually might've been pretty good. With a little help that mac n' cheese could've been good too. (maybe next time use some cheese along with that cream) This place feels like it's trying a little too hard to be edgy. The whole metal/prison vibe felt very contrived, and the TVs playing pictures of album covers were just annoying. Honestly didn't like the feel of the place - definitely not a plus. Prices weren't bad though.  Our waitress was very good - a little too attentive as if she knew the kitchen sucked. The food came out real slow even though it really wasn't too crowded (Saturday night at 7PM) but our waitress handled the situation well. We mentioned how bad the burgers turned out (we could only stomach a few bites each) she took those off the bill. To be honest, those burgers were so bad if we didn't get the comp I probably would've one-starred this place.  I saw "Kuma's" in some of the other reviews. Sorry, not even close - shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence yet. Although if someone in the kitchen ever figures out how to properly cook the stuff they have with consistency, Lockdown does have some promise. Maybe I'll check it out again in a year or two if they're still around.
