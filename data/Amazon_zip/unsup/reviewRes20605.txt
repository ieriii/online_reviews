Great restaurant to dip into after visiting the Chicago Insitute of Art if you're looking for something a little nicer.  The wait staff was extremly attentive, friendly and very informative. They have great daily specials, my Mom had the Alaskan Halibut which she highly recommends. I would also suggest getting a side of mashed potates if they don't come with your meal!
