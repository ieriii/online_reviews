Win! Yes! I want my kitchen to look like this! The atmosphere in this spot is the best I have seen! It is all about lighting, the natural "reclaimed" wood and warm lighting makes for such a warm and happy atmosphere, I want my kitchen, shoot my whole house to be that comfortable, I felt like I was walking into a make believe Hollywood lit southern Italian caf... The food was small plate style; my friends and I went for a very ambitious sampling of almost every aspect of the menu... From a watermelon salad to ricotta-honey-cheese and bread heaven, from flat bread pizza to burgers, from beer to wine, from greens to chocolate... We hit it all! It was all off the hook, the only thing I will do differently next time is eat less... I can't wait to visit again!
