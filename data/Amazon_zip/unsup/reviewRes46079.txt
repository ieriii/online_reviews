The service is consistent and thorough. I think its why I liked eating there the most. I dined there a couple times while I was in Chicago. The lentil Bacon soup hit the spot. The baileys coffee didn't hurt. Crispy calamari, spicy edamame, and sauteed brussel sprouts were quick and delicious. I much prefer the food and service here compared to Cheesecake Factory.
