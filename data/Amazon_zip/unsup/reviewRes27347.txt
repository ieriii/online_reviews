Graham Elliot lives up to the hype! I had a great date night on a Friday. I was surprised at how easy it was to make reservations through OpenTable last minute. Easy parking in the vicinity. When we got there, the atmosphere was just right. Definitely not empty, plenty of people sitting at the bar, dining space was maybe 3/4 full. Decor I liked Graham Elliot as soon as I stepped in. As Kevin T mentioned, it's looks a lot like how you might want to decorate your own loft. Trendy, fashion-forward, subtle and not in your face, yet oozes the vibe that you're in a fine dining establishment. Service We were greeted nicely at the door. The menu was simple, yet hard to understand at the same time so I tested our server. He was very knowledgeable, both in terms of knowing the beer selection and explaining how each dish was prepared. My water glass was never less than half full, food was brought out in the right order in appropriate intervals, and the preparation of each dish was explained as it arrived. We were even offered a second popcorn with white truffle oil. Fantastic service. Food Why is it that beet salad always comes with blue/goat cheese? I'm not a fan...but their salad was still good. Their seafood risotto was off the hook though. Prepared bouillabaisse style, it had a fishy taste to it (stock), but in a good way. The calamari was perfectly battered very light with a thin fried shell, and there were some nice chunks of fish. My gf opted for the sea bass, which was tender but definitely pedestrian next to the lamb that I got. Leg of lamb...chopped! From the presentation, it was prepared the way duck is usually served. The pieces were carefully placed over a batter of whipped potatoes and sausage. I left Graham Elliot a happy man, and didn't have to sell any organs to pay for it. Entrees were all ~$30, appetizers ~$10, with beers for $6 and cocktails in the $11 range. It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for. Awesome experience.
