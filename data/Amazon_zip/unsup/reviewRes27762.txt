I found Nuevo Leon to be a great nearby place to have a post Sox game meal. The little parking lot on the side street just east of the restaurant was available and convenient. There was also no waiting at 6:30pm on a Friday evening, and service was quick and attentive. I had egg battered beef tongue - a nice dish, but it could have used a sauce of some sort. My colleague had pollo en mole, also a nice large dinner for only $8 (as mine was). The floors are still slippery, but it's kinda fun to check if they are or not.
