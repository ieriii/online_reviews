Holy churro, Bayless.  I had some time to kill between an early morning appointment and heading to work, so I decided to give Xoco a try. Walked in at 8:30 on a Tuesday morning and there was no line at all. I ordered a Classic (Mexican chocolate with 2% milk) and 2 churros. The staff there was incredibly nice and told me there would be just a couple of minutes' wait for the churros. They came to me straight from the fryer and from the moment I put the first bite in my mouth I was in Heaven. I couldn't eat them fast enough. And they were even better dipped in the hot chocolate. Again... holy churro, Bayless. I can't wait to go back to try lunch and dinner!
