While on vacation in Chicago, my friends and I decided to try XOCO after recommendations from several people. I had the Chipotle Chicken torta which was AMAZING! The avocado was super fresh and the bread perfectly crunchy. The dipping sauce was delicious, not too spicy that it overpowers the sandwich but full of flavor. For dessert we shared the churros and of course had to get the dipping sauce AND vanilla ice cream. The churros were to die for by themselves but dipping them in the sauce and ice cream was unbelievable. Any sort of fried dough product tends to be super heavy and uncomfortably filling but these were so light and fluffy. The line was pretty long, we waited about 30 minutes but it's totally worth the wait. If you are in the Chicago area, go. now!
