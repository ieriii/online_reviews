Maybe it was the hype. I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. I came here New Years Eve with some friends and had the tasting menu. The food was average at best. Nothing special that blew me away. The ambience was more upscale which contradicts what I think of in a tapas place. I'm accustomed to a more casual, loud, friendly atmosphere. Also, the food was pretty pricy. I'd rather eat at Cafe Barcelona up in Evanston any day.
