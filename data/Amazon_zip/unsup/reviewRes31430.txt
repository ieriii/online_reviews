I was so incredibly impressed by this gem amid an otherwise barren area. The staff was incredible and gave great suggestions and was attentive to our needs. The food was so Delicious and wholesome. Made fresh and in house with organic and locally grown. My friend and I took both suggestions given by our server and decided to split the Nanadict and the Stuffed french toast. And wow! Great portion sizes, perfectly cooked and presented beautifully. Decently priced when considering what you are getting. In the Nanadict the poblano cream sauce is amazing, blended with the pupusas to make the perfect alternative to a traditional eggs Benedict. The cherry honey and fresh cherries atop the lovely golden brown stuffed french toast added the perfect sweetness and felt like a guilt pleasure to be eating. The coffee was fresh and nicely balanced. I recommend going with a friend or someone to share and ordering both Nanadict and stuffed french toast as the complement each other beautifully. The decor is done in a country kitchen meets urban artistic cafe to create a delightfully airy and welcoming setting for a late breakfast or meeting over lunch. I hope to see this place remain in the neighborhood for a long time to come and will defiantly be returning in the future.
