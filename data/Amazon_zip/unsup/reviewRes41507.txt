Had a grand old time here with an office party. A going-away office party, that is, so it was one of those deals where a few people REALLY let their hair down. Mostly just one person, really. Lots of yelling from that one. And while I'm not really a steak house kinda person--I think of the typical patron being a boor in a fancy "dinner suit" eying his date's lobster and thinking "$50 entree for the lady = she'll pretty much have to"--this ended up being a really fun place to spend an evening. I had the filet mignon, which someone had recommended before and I will now pass the recommendation on to everyone in the interweb. I also had the lobster bisque, which was recommended by the same person and was very good as well. I also had the equivalent of an entire baguette of small sliced baguette-ettes, about 4 pieces of asparagus that reminded me of the end of the second ninja turtles movie--Revenge of the Ooze--when shredder drinks ooze and becomes super shredder. These were super asparaguses (asparagi?). And beer and wine. I am not a big person. I took a trip to the bathroom just to breathe deeply. And the waiters were great too, handling our large group with all the patience and professionalism you'd expect from professional waiters. Even the yelling guy, they pretty much just let him do his thing. My review is slightly biased, of course--it was a company outing. So the price wasn't a huge concern. For an extra-special night out on the town, though--like celebrating my new money tree--I'd go again.
