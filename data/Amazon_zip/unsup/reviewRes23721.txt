I moved clear across the city and STILL crave theses crepes weekly. Anytime I don't know what I'm in the mood for, it's ALWAYS an Icosium crepe. Try it with chicken - delicious. And that soup they serve? Awesome. Seriously, I'm so happy to be moving back to this neighborhood - there are a lot of great eateries, but this one is just different enough to really stand out in my mind.
