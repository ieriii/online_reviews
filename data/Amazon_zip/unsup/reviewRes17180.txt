Barf, totally ruined this experience by hitting beachwood right after and downing a ton of cheap awful beer. Shaking off my massive hangover I have to say I had a splendid time at this fabulous establishment. I don't ordinarily like the idea of the downplayed front door and dramatic drapery front entrance but the bar made up for it. You can sit at a bunch of posh chairs around a tiny cocktail table OR opt to sit at the bar, which obviously is a hell of a lot more fun and less awkward. My sister was in town so we reckoned getting a punch bowl for the two of us was the right way to talk about family gossip and were right. Got the Jonestown punch bowl which is a delicious and strong combination of some fancy bitters, whisky, strawberries, mint, and orange oil. TO DIE FOR. Hung out with the proprietor of North Shore Distillery and sampled some of her killer local made absinthe and got a lot of drink education from the bartenders (who are total pro's, amazing drinks and meticulous quality control...). Fabulous experience. A little pricey but you get more than your money's worth. Oh, and COME EARLY. I went at 9 and there was plenty of seating. Wait any longer and you have to sit in line with a bunch of jerks.
