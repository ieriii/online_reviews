Really delicious, can't wait to go back! Had a great salad- very fresh, nicely dressed, crisp. The pizza is amazing, so good! I had the margarita w/arugula and would definitely recommend. We were really surprised when the bill came, only b/c we ordered our wine by the glass, which added up quickly. They have a great selection of wines and are very helpful in pointing you in the right direction. Next time, bottle. *Went back tonight, just as amazing- and got free soup! Awesome food and service, can't beat it in Chi!!!
