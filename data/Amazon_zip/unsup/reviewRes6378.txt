This is some of the best Italian in the city. No fancy foams or reductions. No pretentious waitstaff. Just great food. Cracked egg on ravioli? Can't go wrong with that. Wine at cost? Yes, please. The joint is quaint and alwasy packed, but stand by the kitchen while you wait, as they bring fresh pizza around to the hungry guests.
