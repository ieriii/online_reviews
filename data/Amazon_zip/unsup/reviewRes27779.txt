If you an appreciate the genius of a foie-gras lollipop covered with Pop Rocks (the foie-llipop), then GE is the place you need to try. I went with my better half, my 17-year old son, and his SO. We all had the ten-course tasting menu (yes, two teenagers tried and LIKED the tasting menu). After each course (which also included several small dishes not on the menu), my son kept commenting , "Well, THAT was the best course yet..."and yet each course kept improving! i was particularly impressed with the bison dish... and the deconstructed caesar with the brioche Twinkie was AWESOME! The service was fun and relaxed with none of the stuffiness generally associated with Michelin-starred establishments. I can honestly say that GE is easily among my top three faves in Chicago, along with Topolo and Avec.
