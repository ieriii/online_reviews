This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are lovely. I decided to have my wedding here. Jennifer, my coordinator was helpful, friendly and unfortunately also a victim of this monstrosity of a business. My wedding looked a little shabby and as I marched down the aisle, I almost cried at how awful the ceremony looked. I couldn't believe that my instructions were not followed as I laid them out. That may or may not have been the fault of my mother. My wedding favors were never set out or returned to me. My guest book disappeared. My wedding coordinator came up to me (after My vows were read) and told me my cake was not there, and that I would have to sorta pantomime cutting a piece of cardboard for my photographs and guests. (amazing how no one confirmed that my cake was made maybe a day or two before). It wasn't until later I discovered what actually happened. The cake was outsourced to Bake for Me on Roosevelt. Jennifer assured me that my cake would be great. When I came in for my cake tasting, some 2 or 3 months earlier (an appointment that was made) I had to fight for the attention of person given a tasting to 3 or 4 other couples (why did I have to make an appointment?) Apparently, after I made my cake choice, My order was stuck in the back of a file, never to see the light of day. After I returned from my honeymoon, I was told I had to pursue the bakery (not the hotel who had a agreement with this bakery) for a refund. After all, all you did was make us cut a piece a cardboard and have my guests eat cake from Jewel - Osco). I was so heartbroken, All I could do is drink Tequila Sunrises at my open bar (which I was told was upgraded, but also closed 1/2 hr early). Sometimes, when I think of all the money we spent on this entire day, i just want to cry. We barely received an apology and no compensation for their negligence. Thanks for the memories.
