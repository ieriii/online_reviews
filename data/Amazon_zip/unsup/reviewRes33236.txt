I don't particularly care for Romanian food but I have a lot of out of town guests come through and with my place being right across the street from the Bucharest, it's been a really convenient spot for them and most of 'em raaave about the food. While I don't care for their food (only because I have the palate of a 4-yr old), their desserts are the bomb diggity. I almost bought a coupon deal just to go there a few days in a row for their desserts. Def worth a try if you like to explore foods of different countries!
