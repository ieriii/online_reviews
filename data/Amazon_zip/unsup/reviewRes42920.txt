Their pizza is awesome. I almost never try anything new because I like it so much. They use alot of sauce. That is proper. It is approaching righteousness but sometimes they undercook it just a little bit (to be fair I usually get a stuffed pizza with extra tomato and pepperoni and I think the tomato keeps the interior too cool and wet). Its not quite a science. Its an Art, and it is beautiful.
