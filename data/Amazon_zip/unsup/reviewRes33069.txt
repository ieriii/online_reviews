Hugh?? There's only one baby chair for the whole restaurant? Well we just happen to have a spare in the car so we were able to eat here but that's pretty lame for a family restaurant. Note to management: this is a stupid way to lose customers in a bad economy. The wine was just terrible. We started with some Romanian varieties and had to send them back. They tasted corked. Then we tried the Argentina Malbec (I think?) and it was very watery and sweet. Kind of tasted like grape juice. Finally the French Merlot was indistinguishable from the Romanian. I had to question the waiter to see if he didn't make a mistake. Do yourself a favor and stick to the wonderful eastern European beers on the menu.  The food and service were excellent. I had the veal paprikash which had the most tender veal I've ever had with a very nice paprika brown gravy and some tasty polenta. My wife had the sausage stuffed chicken and that was also excellent. I would definitely go back to try some more of their delicacies. I will just not bother with their awful wine choices next time.
