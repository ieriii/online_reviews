I'm not quite sure why this is a must try pizzeria for tourists. Overall, it was too salty for my taste, but I've been trying to cut down my salt intake. The crust is the best part of the pizza. It was alright, but I'm sure there are better places out there. The long lines and ridiculous wait is definitely not worth it.
