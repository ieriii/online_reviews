With all the Yelp love surrounding this place I was half expecting angels to descend from the heavens and deliver this pizza on a sleigh bed draped in white linens. Much to my chagrin, neither the angels nor the bed appeared before me tonight. However, a tasty pizza was delivered but fell short of expectations. Is it good? Definitely. Is it great? Not even close. I would sum Art of Pizza up as a Giordano's knock off. Knock off's generally aren't better than the original and the pizza here is no different. It's the same look and same texture, but not the same taste. If you put a slice of each side by side, most would have a hard time picking out the correct one. Stuffed slices here have loads of cheese, are topped with sauce, and have a crust that was more bread-like than a corn meal mix. I did like the pizza but prefer the flavor of Giordano's to the Art of Pizza version. I'm glad I got around to eating here but will skip a return in favor of other Chicago-style pizzerias.
