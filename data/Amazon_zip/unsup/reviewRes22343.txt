Whenever I go to Irazu I can count on tasty food, fast and friendly service and low-key atmosphere. And, a very tasty oatmeal shake. (I honestly don't think I've ever NOT gotten their famed oatmeal shake). Anyways, we stopped by here after picking up some movies at Odd Obsession and decided to take our night out, in, with a to go order. The place was packed (not unusual for Irazu) but especially busy since the recent renovation with their outdoor patio. We ordered a veggie burrito with a side of gallo pinto, chips and salsa, empanadas and an oatmeal shake to split. Truthfully, the empanadas and the oatmeal shake were the whole reason for coming, we figured we should probably order a real dinner, hence the other stuff, so when we got home and realized our order came sans empanadas, we were a little bummed out. We made a call to explain our empanada-less situation, and the manager let us know that although his delivery drivers had just been sent home from their evening shift, he would see what he could do about sending someone over. A very short time later, the delivery man arrived with our beloved empanadas, AND a bonus order of chips and guac just because. We also received a follow up phone call from the owner/manager checking back to make sure things were right. We were honestly taken aback by how awesome their customer service is and it's another great reason to keep coming back. Big thank you to the awesome staff at Irazu.
