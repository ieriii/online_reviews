This review could theoretically be summed up in 2 words: ROPA VIEJA! Oh my my. All around fab dining experience. Service was wonderful. I came at lunchtime w/ a coworker and it was pretty empty. He happened to know the hostess also who hooked us up with: ROPA VIEJA! This is one of the most magically delicious foods I've ever eaten. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. and....Guac and Chips! I'm always a fan of the guac...until they add too much jalapenos. This place did not! It was delicious. For the main course I ordered the steak tacos. The meat was tender and the cheese was plentiful. It also came with this avocado (again w/ the avos...can't get enough!) salad on the side. Also very delicious. ROPA VIEJA! The mojitos were perfect. Not too sweet. Not too limey. The right amount of strong (which was pretty!). We had to make sure this was a consistent level of quality, so we got two. ROPA VIEJA! :D
