Fresh yellow watermelon punch with sparkling water and blueberries..so, so refreshing! Great breakfast options like the benedicts, especially the Nanadict, served on a pupusa corn flatbread with homemade chorizo. Or their waffles, like the corn oat with Greek yogurt and fresh raspberries. UGH!! Other interesting options? Banana-hemp cakes and other whole wheat cake concoctions that change out in a timely manor. Great organic food!
