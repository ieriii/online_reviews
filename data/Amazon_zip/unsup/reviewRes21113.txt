As someone who goes out for margaritas EVERY Friday, I found this place to be a very pleasant surprise. I have no interest in going to "high end" Mexican places for my Friday night Mexican fiesta, so I always end up at El Nuevo Mexicano (Probably my very favorite), Fernando's, Las Palmas, El Cid, or Blue Agave (if I happen to be in the Viagra Triangle) or some place similar. Las Palmas is a little different, I guess....anyway. My "premium" margarita at Mayan Palace was REALLY good. I hate when margaritas taste like Cuervo mix...and Mayan Palace's couldn't be further from that. Granted $12.00 is pretty expensive, but with the 1800 tequila, Mayan Palace hit it out of the park. YUM! Now, let's get to the food. Very good salsa but it comes in a small cup, so it's difficult to get your chip in there (that's what she said). Other than that it was very tasty and they always refilled it when we ran low. The guac was also very good. Fresh tasting (it better be!). Our server was very good. He immediately asked us if he could make any recommendations and asked us what sorts of things we liked. He then proceeded to walk us through 4 or 5 menu items each that we might like. I thought that was great...and he really nailed it. The food was really good. It's "normal Mexican", so nothing unbelievably fancy. Burritos, enchiladas, and all the normal things.....plus a few different items. I had a steak that was called Diablo Carne Asada (I think). It was very tasty. Almost like short ribs in a very spicy mole-like sauce.  My only beef with the Mayan Palace is that it feels kind of cold in there. Not the temperature, but the decor. Even though the lights are dim and the walls are rustically painted, it still seems a bit cold. That may keep me from going there in the winter time and also knocks off a star for me. It just doesn't feel especially cozy. Other than that....great.  Great service and tasty food!
