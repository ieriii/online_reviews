We went here recently for my bachelorette party. My bridesmaids picked it because it was classy (in line with the theme of the party, if you get my meaning) and because they know I enjoy wine. We basically ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, along with drinks, and everyone was pretty happy with that. I would probably recommend doing this if you go with a large group. No one went hungry and everyone got to snack on things they liked or wanted to try. A little bit of meat, a little bit of cheese, some quesadillas, some olives... life is good. What really earned them 4 stars was the dessert... It was a spicy chocolate mouse, formed in a pyramid. And there was a liqueur-filled chocolate surprise in the center. Major yum! I'm pretty sure there were a couple other desserts passed around the table that night, and that my friends' enjoyed those too, but I only had eyes for that delicious chocolate confection. A definite above-average dessert. Even though it was my party, I didn't have any wine. I did enjoy a couple different kinds of champagne though ;-)
