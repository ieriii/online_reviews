i WANT to like this place. I want to love it, in fact. And their food is good - their decor/ambience - adorable. But the service sucks. I've been there 4 times now - and I get more disappointed each time. To be fair - I'm picky. I work in the restaurant industry. But service does matter! And my problem is not with the wait-to-be-seated part of things. My problem is not that it's crowded and that you and your friends might have to squeeze in amongst strangers once you finally get a seat. My problem is not with the get-your-own-utensils-and-water part of things - in fact, I think THAT part is genius.  My problem is that the people behind the counter are not warm OR friendly - and don't really seem to want to make it a good experience for you. What a missed opportunity! This place could be perfect. My rating covers the dates of July 09 - Oct 09, so maybe this is just a lull in good service happening, but it's certainly impacting the business I am giving them (or not, as the case may be).  I WILL say their oatmeal is delicious, their french toast is IMPRESSIVE, and their huevos rancheros, also good. I love, too, that they have quality grapefruit juice. Please Milk & Honey - let's work on the hospitality culture. I WANT to love you.
