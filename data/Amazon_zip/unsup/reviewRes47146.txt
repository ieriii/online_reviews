I love this place! The atmosphere is wonderful. I felt comfortable immediately, and even more so as I was drinking my hot toddy made with cinnamon and brandy. I ordered the crispy chicken with broccoli and wild rice. It was perfect. Seriously. You can tell the chef puts a lot of care into each dish and uses quality ingredients (local, sustainable, organic, etc). It's a little bit pricey, but worth it for special occasions. Also, they have live music which is a bonus if you're there late.
