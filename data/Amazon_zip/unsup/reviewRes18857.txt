We finally made it to The Bad Apple, and I'm glad we did. We each ordered a burger, medium rare. They were cooked perfectly, which seems very hard for some places to do. My Slow Burn burger was really tasty and was topped with sauteed chilies which gave a nice easy heat that built up as time passed. My wife had the Belly Burger and it was a good combo of beef and pork. I didn't get much horseradish flavor from the sauce, however. The fries (one regular and one minced garlic) were decent. I'd say they were three-star fries. The service was great. The beer list is amazingly good. I can see taking a cab here and back just so I can try more of the beers. I'm giving The Bad Apple four stars, but if future visits are as positive as my first I'll be revising that to five.
