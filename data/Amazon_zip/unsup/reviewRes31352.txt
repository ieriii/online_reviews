3.5 stars, rounded up to 4. I was debating on just giving this place three stars, but I decided on four because it does have some pretty awesome dishes. Came here for a Sunday night dinner, and the food was either hit or miss.  Pork belly buns were not great. I've probably been spoiled by the great pork belly buns I've had at Momofuku in New York, but the buns here were a bit soggy and too salty. The management removed this dish from our bill, which was a nice gesture - still, these can be worked on. They have potential. The sushi here was good - had tuna, sea urchin, and octopus. About $14-15 for 4 sashimi pieces (so $45 for all three/ 12 pieces), so a bit on the pricier side, but the sushi was very fresh and of good quality. Good stuff. The miso bronzed black cod was decent - my main complaint about this dish was it was a bit too sweet. I read the chef's bio and saw that he had been the opening chef at Koi in Los Angeles - Koi in LA basically does this exact same dish, but just not as sweet. The fish was cooked perfectly though, but the devil is in the details. Less sugar, please. The star of the night though (and probably why this review does get 4 stars) - the Atlantic salmon sashimi "bundles". These were creamy blue crab wrapped in salmon - DELICIOUS. I would go back again just for this dish - it was truly awesome. Well balanced, not fish, and really smooth. $15 for 5 pieces (a bit small, but worth it).  Service was fine. No complaints. Maybe a bit slow in between the sushi and main courses, but wasn't too bad. Tried one of the cocktails here, some berry one, which was good.
