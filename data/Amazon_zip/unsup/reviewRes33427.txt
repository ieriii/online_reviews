Word to the wise... 1. Don't order the coffee. Burnt. Watered down. Not worth your $2.34. 2. Know what you want to order ASAP. They are almost always extremely busy and you'll be lucky to get your servers attention more than just to order and get your check. 3. Be good to your heart. Get egg whites or Egg Beaters...no extra charge! 4. Don't forget to pick up a chocolate covered dinner mint at the cash register!
