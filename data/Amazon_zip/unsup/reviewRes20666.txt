I went to XOCO with three others around 6:15 pm on a Wednesday and the line and wait were minimal -- maybe ten to fifteen minutes. I was expecting to be blown away, given all of the other reviews, but instead found myself satisfied -- nothing less, nothing more. It is warm and cozy inside the restaurant and the food makes you warm and cozy as well. I had the Milanesa torta, which was certainly yummy, but unfortunately nothing spectacular. My mother had the Pozole caldo, which was also tasty, but again nothing spectacular. The chips were boring, but the guac was a hit and we scraped the container clean for the green salsa (3 chile?) The Negro Modelo ice cream was fun and flavorful. Finally, the Aztec hot chocolate and HOT churros -- melt. in. your. mouth. YUM! If I worked nearby, I would come here for lunch all the time and if I'm passing by and in the mood for some Mexican comfort food I will swing in for a bite, but this won't become a destination for me. Perhaps my opinion will change once I try the Cubana torta, though, since all of the other reviews say it is bliss. One final word on the seating, the current set up works because it is a popular spot right now. Perhaps once the novelty has worn off and XOCO is less crowded you won't have to do the whole awkward wait for seats to open up so you can get a number from the hostess -- order your food -- sit where the hostess tells you thing. It is definitely confusing and takes away from the experience.
