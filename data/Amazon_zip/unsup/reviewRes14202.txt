HOLY BEER_A_MOLY! Yuuuuuummmmmeeerrrrrssssss. I visited RevBrew on a Saturday night a little after 7:30pm and it was slammed. The wait was said to be up to an hour and a half but you could snack and drink while you waited. Opted to wait and were happy we did!! Immediately a little bench in wait area freed up and the 3 of us sat down and ordered delicious home brews and some mussels in a blue cheese broth...very rich. Very dairy- be warned. And garlicky-wonderful at the time...not so great the next day for others:) The vibe was great...happening, enegetic, lively, lots of interesting people, very comfortable atmosphere you can be happy in whether you are in jeans and sneakers coming for burgers and beers or heels and dressed up coming for fancier pub food- RevBrew's got it all! Huge beer list....offering home brews and a huge beer list as well with all your old favs or beers you've heard of somewhere and always wanted to try. Great menu...tons of veg and vegan options as well as pescatarian and carnivore opts too!! LOVED: Mussels (although next time I'll try the one sans dairy...bit too rich-but didn't stop me from sopping our bread in bowl and practically licking clean!!!) Fries that came with my brothers burger-seasoned o-so-well! Sweet Potato Pancakes...mmmmm Calamari Steak with Polenta All the beers...wish I could remember them all!(The two I had were Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA and their home brew Samadhi- which was amaaaaaaazing:) I cannot wait to go back! AND kids are welcome- totally awesome. I did see one or two in their- totally lowkey and hip place. All welcome.
