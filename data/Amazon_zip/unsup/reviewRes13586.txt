Pish posh...that's how this place makes me feel. Usually, as in 3 out of 5, it's fantastic, but what about the other two? I love the atmosphere. Trendy, laidback, careful, yet somehow it all works and doesn't seemed pre-planned/pretentious. The food, for 3 out of 5 times, has been superb. I love the selection, the execution, the hardiness of it all. The times it has sucked...it has sucked the big one! Our server was on the dope. Seriously. He had no clue. Things were brought out wrong or forgotten. Mishaps happen in the restaurant business, but this went beyond. He was just straight up fucking up. No apologies, no here's some free breadsticks, just eat it buddy, because I work here and you're hungry. Yes, I ate the mash tates, because I was damn hungry and they were delicious, but the poor service and lack of customer relations put a sour taste in our mouths. I will be back because the food is, in my experience, a taste treat, but if they get too big for their breeches, I'll pass and eat at the Mexican places near by. OVERALL: Keep it up, but remember your roots.
