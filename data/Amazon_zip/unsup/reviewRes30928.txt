The food is mostly organic so you're gonna pay that. So don't be shocked when you see how much they charge for pancakes. The service is friendly and fast. Definitely not the kind of place you expect in Bridgeport but i think its just what the neighborhood needs. I had the blueberry lemon pancakes. No need for syrup because the custard is extra sweet. a little too sweet for my taste but it was slightly balanced by the tartness of the lemon juice. I also had the cheddar jalepeno grits. It was stiffer than I had hoped. Grits should spread out not stick together in a big lump. It was slightly gummy but still tastey My boy had the oat waffle. i didnt think he would eat it because of the way it looked (super picky eater) but to my surprise he scarfed it down! It came with greek yogurt(something else i found in the past he did not enjoy) and fruit-all of which i got on the side to be safe. He powered through the yogurt and picked out the blueberries. The greek yogurt was a little sweeter than i was used to as well but it worked out because my boy ate it.  So if you are wondering why I gave this place a kinda high rating, its because my boy said so!
