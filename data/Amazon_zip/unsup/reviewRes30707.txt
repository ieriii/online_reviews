A black bean burger just doesn't stuff my belly the way an all-meat one would have. To many people, that's a plus, but it was disappointing for me. Actually everything I tried would have tasted so much better if they'd only use that sauce (or whatever) on real meat. Because of the rave reviews of dishes I didn't try, I will probably revisit. Until then, I say this place is no big deal. I've made better vegan food and I'm no chef. Or even vegetarian. Obviously. And a warning, a "10 minute wait" meant close to an hour. ETA: Superb "milkshakes" or whatever they call them. Smoothies. Little glasses of heaven. It's a shame they insist on opening too late in the morning for me and close so early in the evening.
