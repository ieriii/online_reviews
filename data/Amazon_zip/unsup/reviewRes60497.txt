First the waitress (Debbie) forgot my order so the 7 people I was with got theirs well before me, then the waitress had to ask me what I ordered, then she brought it out wrong. I also paid $2.50 for a coke and finished it before eating, and she never came back to refill it. We saw her only two times.  Secondly they do no split checks, so you have to write down how much your total is and the amount of tax you are paying on yours. If you have a card then you have to pay the tax and tip on your card because they don't take it out of the cash. Which can be complicated when you go with 8 people.  Then when you call the dark haired manager with the big glasses over after waiting for LITERALLY 45 minutes after you finished eating and complain about the way things are set up, he will rudely say "it really isn't that hard, it is just simple math". Among with some other very rude remarks. Even the 2 tables next to us came up and told us we should report him for the way he talked to us. When he was done insulting us he rudely walked off.  I have never in my life been so insulted by a manager. I would never in my life return to this place and I would warn people before walking in the door if I am by there.
