Bonsoiree is a great new eatery in Logan Square, just east of California on Armitage. We've only had brunch there and the food is always great. They also have an Underground Dinner that they do weekly. The menu is prix fixe that you can view in the email and respond to make your reservation. As they don't have a liquor license, they have paired up with a local liquor store to offer wines that compliment the evenings menu. This place is a hidden gem.
