I really didn't know what to expect. I mean, I like to judge books on movies, so I definitely had an idea of what the Pasta Bowl was all about: pasta (duh!). I went in with high hopes, a hungry stomach, and my girlfriend. We were greeted by the staff and walked to a table near the "kitchen" (they cook everything in the bar area). We took a while to order because everything sounded delish. We wound up ordering the garlic cheese bread (meh, not too impressed), cappellini pomodoro (classically done), and the day's special: a chicken and ricotta tortellini dish served on a bed of pesto and topped with sun-dried tomatoes. Holy smokes! This was amazing. I mean it looked small, there were three tortellini, but it wound up being quite filling. (Tip: this tortellini dish was a special, but you can customize your own stuffed pasta dish on the menu!) The service was phenomenal. We waited like four minutes for our meal. It was super quick. Our server was very friendly and easy to talk to throughout our meal. He offered a sneak peak at desserts at the end of our meal. Normally we pass, but we said "When in Rome..." and ordered a cannoli. It was chocolate covered, and chilled. Very sweet and a perfect ending to a delightful meal. To round out the review, the prices were great. Super affordable, even for the guy asking for spare change off of Lake Shore Drive.
