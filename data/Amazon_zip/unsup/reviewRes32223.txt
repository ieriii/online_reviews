It's nice to go somewhere where I can eat every single item on the menu. When I went, my brother and I tried their seitan gyro, the jamacian jerk seitan sandwhich, and the nachos. Awesome! Pretty good bloody marys too. The staff reminds me of the one I work with, which was nice. The vibe was similar too, kudos.
