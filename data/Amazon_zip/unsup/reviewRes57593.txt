My husband and I went here for our wedding weekend. Very cute layout, but I don't like the fact that everyone needs to arrive at the same time...5PM. That's a little early for dinner. Food wise, not bad. But when they have the bread and fruit appetizer as the starter, they don't give you an option for anything but a swiss based cheese...which tasted like it was mixed with wine. Not very flavorable. Main course, they use an oil base rather than water (some people don't care, but just something you may want to know when you're soaking all your veggies and meats in oil!). The only reason I didn't give this place a higher rating is because they do not give you options for cheese or chocolate and all that. I'm still happier with Melting Pot.
