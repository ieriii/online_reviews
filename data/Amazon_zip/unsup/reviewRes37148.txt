As darn near perfection as a gastropub gets. Perfection would be not having to choose between waiting 2 hours for a table on a Saturday night or sitting elbow-to-elbow next to fellow patrons in the bar area, but I DARE you to find something that you won't fall absolutely in love with on the menu. They boast an extensive list of draft and bottled Belgians, and while at some other bars obscure offerings inevitably leads to skunky beer, at Hopleaf they either go through enough or care enough that all of the ones we tried (and there are quite a few) were crisp, cold, and fizzy. I've tried the mussels before - very good, but nothing to compose a sonnet about - but it was on a more recent visit that we were amazed. We had the heirloom tomato salad, charcuterie trio, and the Hunter's rabbit. We originally had the sausage plate on the list too, but the bartender took a look at the both of us, sized us up, and told us very gently that it was waaaaay too much food for two. And he was right - by the time we chomped down on the last morsel of the beyond tasty rabbit, we were about to burst. Buuuuut we haven't forgotten about you sausage plate! If you are anything as delicious as everything else on the menu, we will be back soon to try you out!
