Kinzie what can I say, you make a mean steak and it had me standing up and dancing. Yeah it was that good. I hit the Bone-In Delmonico steak. I don't how authentic it is to the true Delmonico cut because it's highly disputed still but it was one delicious piece of steak, cooked to perfection, fell kindly to my knife's edge and the jus was sublime. And that stuffed potato, what a monster, a delectable monster slathered in sour-cream, cheese and bacon, a true king. I will definitely go back and very soon.
