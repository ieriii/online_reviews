Came here for drinks on a Friday night around 10pm - the bar area was packed, but two of us were able to get a table and order drinks only. Service was pretty good, as the waitress was very friendly and accommodating, including being able to replace a drink we didn't like. We ordered their cocktails - I don't remember which one I had, but it was well made. They also have a very diverse selection of scotches and liquor, so if you just want some alcohol straight up, this is the place to go. I believe cocktails were about $11-12 each, which is pretty much the standard in Chicago. Didn't get to try the food this time around, but will probably try to make it back here again for that.
