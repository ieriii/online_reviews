First time here last night. Busy as expected on a Friday night but no biggie. Waited about 30 mins for a table. Hostesses were very pleasant despite how hectic it was. I didn't get to check out the beer selection being that I am 4 months pregnant however I did check out the draft list and it was pretty impressive. The pizza was delicious and came out pretty quick despite how busy the kitchen was. Only 2 small complaints.  1. The mashed potatoes topping was simply disgusting and should be removed from the menu. It was bland and ruined the perfect texture of the pizza. 2. The trays are HUGE! We were seated at a booth and ordered 2 pizzas...and had to dive under the trays in order to eat our slices or find out drinks. Pretty awkward. For dessert we had the Chocolate pizza! Perfect dessert! The topping was similar to Nutella (which I love). The dough was a bit to chewy but hey, it's topped with chocolate so who can complain?!
