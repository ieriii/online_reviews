It was Easter Sunday and we were tourists in Chicago. It was 28 degrees and dark outside, approaching 9pm. Having heard remarkable stories about the Green Mill on Yelp on and on TV, I deplored my friends to come with me. They were skeptical any place would be that fascinating at 10pm on a cold, easter Sunday night, but they had nothing better to do than watch HBO in the hotel, so they agreed and off we went. The Green Mill really surpassed my admittedly high expectations. What a classic joint! The entrance leads you down the long, narrow part of the bar, which makes a sweeping, circular L-turn towards the back room, where there are plenty of tables, booths, and large stage. I assumed we'd be listening to jazz on the large stage, but I hadn't realized there is a small stage, just enough for 2-3 cramped behind the circular turn of the bar. The night's jazz musicians - nobody of particular significance - came on stage and it was lights-out wonderful from there. Almost no amplification, just a drummer, a vocalist, and organist. Silky smooth and jazzy in a cartoony, caricature kind of way. Except it wasn't a romantic movie, it was reality. I didn't fall in love with a beautiful woman, but I almost felt like I was doing so was inevitable had I stayed there longer. An amazing place - the kind of place you dream about and wish were true. It is true. I had no idea.
