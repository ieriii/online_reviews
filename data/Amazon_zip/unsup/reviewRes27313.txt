Not sure about all the hype. Yeah, Rick Bayless is cool and makes some killer food on tv, but Frontera grill was not THAT special. It's good, but way overpriced. Save yourself $30 and head up to Lawrence and Western to Garcia's, or head to Nuevo Leon in Pilsen. Equally authenticate, equally awesome and 1/3 the cost of Frontera. Best part of the meal was the Marisol beer. Absolutely fantastic and refreshing.
