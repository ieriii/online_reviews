I eat meat like there's no tomorrow, but I still absolutely love this place. The past three times I visited Chicago I have gone here. I have gotten lunch and breakfast and it is always awesome. The granola pancakes are by far my favorite. What?!? Vegan food can fill me up? Hell yea, and I will return to the diner on my future trips to Chicago.
