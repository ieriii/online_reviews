Came here last week during my first visit to Chicago ever and as much as I would like to give TRU a perfect 5 stars because of their attention to detail with my reservation, I can't because there are still certain aspects of the restaurant that I was not crazy about. None the less, let me start with the things I liked and appreciated. When I made the reservation, they asked if the dinner was for any special occasion. I stated it was to celebrate an anniversary and to my surprise, when we received our menu after being sat at our tables, our menus were custom made with a "Happy Anniversary" message with our names on it. The hostess and servers were very friendly and they even brought out a special Anniversary Treat for us at the end of our meal. For the most part, the presentation of each dish we had was very nice. As for the taste, it was definitely good, but it did not WOW me for a restaurant of this caliber. Another thing I wasn't crazy about, is that there was a very long wait in between dishes. I've been to plenty of restaurants with Chef's menu, Omakase, and Prix fix menu's but this one tops them all for the wait time between dishes. Also (this is just my own personal preference) I didn't like that every time a dish was served, a team of 2-3 servers would come out, 2 to serve and one to explain what the dish was. Again, I know some people enjoy this type of service at a restaurant, however it is not mine. Either way, I had a good meal with good service and i'm not complaining, it's just that it's not quite a 5 star in my book yet.
