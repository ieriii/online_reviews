Wow, what an amazing restaurant. I met a friend for lunch here at his suggestion. He was familiar with the restaurant and said it seemed up my alley. It's good to have such good friends. He was spot on. To help spread the "cornucopia of deliciousness," as our server so aptly described our selections, we shared 4 plates. On our menu: Mascarpone polenta + ragu of the day, small. The ragu that day included beef cheek. Which is part of the reason we picked it. It was, as I'd hoped when I heard cheek was involved, delicious and tender, though did require a touch of salt and pepper to make it pop.  Hearts of Palm Salad--probably my least favorite dish, mostly because there was so much of it, and while it was refreshing and complimented our other selections, it was a bit bland and I actually got weary of it after a few forkfuls. There was a LOT of it. Truffle Egg Toast. This was phenomenal. Hearty and filling and scrumptious.  The Davanti Burger. I cannot tell you enough, that this is one of the best burgers I have eaten in probably 3 or 4 years. My eyes were glued to it the second I saw the menu.  It has bacon jam. BACON JAM, people!!!! ORDER IT! And the shoestring fries were finger-licking good. Dear God, it was good. I'm salivating remembering it.  So yeah. I am in love with this place. I cannot wait to bring my husband and friends here. Nor can I wait to eat more of that burger with bacon jam. . . Barry Manilow, move over, I have a new crush.
