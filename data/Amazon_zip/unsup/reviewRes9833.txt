It is true what some other reviewers have been saying, Piccolo Sogno does in fact have a snobby atmosphere in lieu of the exotic cars always parked out in the front and the stuffed male Brioni shirts standing around with their wanna-be glamorous wives or girlfriends. The service and food is really the saving grace of Piccolo Sogno. It is fantastic. I often judge an Italian restaurant based on their "Frutti Di Mare", and in the case of this Italian restaurant, its great. I would highly recommend Piccolo Sogno for any occasion. Just because most people who are sitting around you are made of the same material as both the Barbie & Ken doll, does not mean you will be dissatisfied with the food or service. Definitely reserve an outdoor patio seat in advance. It is one of the nicer outdoor restaurant patios in the city.
