Piece has great pizza which isn't dripping with grease for a change and is a fun, lively place to hang out or watch a game. The bar area has high tables and tvs and is very social. Its located in the great Bucktown area just off the North Ave/Milwaukee/Damen intersection. Definitely worth giving this place a try.
