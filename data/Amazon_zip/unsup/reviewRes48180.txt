I miss the Publican already. Insanely indulgent and delicious. The plates are sized for sampling or for table sharing. My advice is order and sample several dishes, it gets pricey but worth every penny. I would give it a 5 star rating if the location was somewhere more convenient. Took a cab ride from Mich. Ave but nothing else in the neighborhood to do after dinner. The communal style seating was also something I didn't expect on my first visit.
