My first time at Coast and it was great! I am a sushi fan and everything was very fresh, not amazing incredible sushi but definitely really good. The atmosphere was great, dim lit, "cool" and a great scene though I wouldn't recommend it for a first date on a weekend night; it was a bit loud. I had some nigiri and it was great! Best albacore so far since I've moved to Chicago, def no Cali sushi but was great. A few veggies rolls and shrimp tempura rolls, also delicious! My miso soup wasn't that hot, but it was good and served in a really nice ceramic mug. Service was great, our server Evan was friendly and knowledgeable, not too chatty but really engaging and on top of it! Food didn't take long to come out, everything looked great on the plate. Everything was super clean as well. Hostesses were friendly and approachable. The busy crowd might set you back a bit but not entirely. No wait when we went but we had reservations. Reservation recommended on a weekend night! BYOB. No corkage fee. Plenty of street parking, valet and places to lock your bike. Price was definitely on the higher side but not ridiculous. 2 people: $60 bucks w/tip, we brought our beers, ate tons. Overall deliciousness, great night! Will go back again!
