This place is truly a hidden gem, it's romantic and inviting. The food is out of control. Our group had the 5 course tasting menu along with the duck duck goose sidekick. Each time a course came out, it was better than the next. It's not everyday that the chef is tableside waiting for your next need or explaining every dish as it is presented, such was the case here. I can't wait to come back. I love that the menu changes seasonally.
