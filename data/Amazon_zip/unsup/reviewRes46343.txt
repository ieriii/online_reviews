Even though this is a sister chain of the Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Caf can't compare. The wait is atrocious. We first had to wait downstairs for a while, then the hostess told us to take the escalator upstairs to the dining area. We thought we whould be shown a table, but we had to wait about 15 more minutes standing next to people eating. I was ready to leave when they finally sat us. I wish I had as the ensuing meal was bland and unoriginal. To top it off, the beer is overpriced. I'll be happy to let the tourists and convention-goers have this place to themselves.
