My mama taught me a few things, and loyalty is one of them. If I love you, I am loyal. Of course, you must earn my love and I do not fall in love easily. That said, once I love you, I will endure trials and tribulations for you. I do not hurt easily and I am not a doormat, but I understand that love often hurts. Lao Sze Chuan, here is what you do to me:First you burn my lips and throat; you leave me with a bloated belly and awful garlicky gingery breath. Then, you wake me up at 4 am by causing violent tremors in my gastrointestinal system. You turn my lower abdomen into a mini Tiananmen Square circa 1989, complete with protestors, marching soldiers, and tanks. I writhe in my bed until I realize there is no more time. I need to move quickly, yet I do not want to disturb the powerful army lest they march ever further down my intestines and out into my underpants, where they surely would continue marching down my legs and spill unto the floor. I -- usually -- make it to my porcelain sanctuary and rid myself of the army and protesters. And despite having evacuated myself of these belligerent troublemakers, they practice a scorched earth policy ala Sherman in Georga, burning everything they pass through. Yes, I realize these are preposterously mixed metaphors. In short, I will endure this because the food at Lao Sze Chuan is so amazing. In the past, I have stuck to a few favorites, but I'm now forcing myself to order random strange dishes I've never tasted before. I encourage others to do so as well. Also, you gotta chat with the dude who sorta looks like a Chinese version of Kim Jong-Il. He's got glasses and is a really jovial fellow. He is a manager or something -- I'm not sure. Basically he just hangs out and looks like a jovial slightly chubby guy. I love his vibe. Check him out in the photo of Tony Hu with Mayor Rahm posted in the window. He is wearing the dopest sweatshirt I have ever seen. For real.
