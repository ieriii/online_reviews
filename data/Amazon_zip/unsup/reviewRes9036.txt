My mom, sister, and I ate here in the afternoon. It was my sisters choice and the day before I checked out the website and this lured me into a french trance and i was hooked by the music on the restaurants website. It was mesmerizing and hypnotizing. Even right now my legs grew weak from listening to the song as i write this review for inspiration.  Its rare that the three of us can get together to do anything since work schedules collide much of the year. Le Colonial was a glimpse of an island vacation dinner place with large green plants and the mahogany colors and white linens for an atmosphere.  The entrance is very narrow and tightly confined from the door to the hostess stand. Right away mom stepped on the mans foot behind her, pretty funny while we waited for our reserved table. They both laughed. We waited for our reserved table and were excited to see the rest of the restaurant while waiting for the hostess. We sat by the windows and viewed the busy State St. like it was a movie showing. The menu was all planned out in dishes of two and three so we ordered one of everything from appetizer to dessert. It was the restaurant week menu and I can only name a few of the beautiful names and presentations of their dishes. Canh Hoanh Ton was the light broth with dumplings. Our appetizers were Goi Cuon, Bo Bia, Chao Tom, and Jasmine Rice.
