We prepaid two nights in advance, called and told them we would be arriving late, and told them we needed two double beds to accommodate three guests. They said "no problem." We arrived a little after 1 a.m. and were told they were out of rooms and they were making arrangements at another hotel for us for the night. They could have called us to tell us that, and we would have driven straight to the hotel they were going to ship us to without parking our car with their $50 valet for that evening. So, we enjoyed a cab ride across town to the Allegro. The hotel they sent us to only had rooms with one king bed - no doubles. So, we had to have the desk person at the new hotel barter with the Millennium to get them to provide us with enough beds to sleep in. Overall, they made things more or less "right," but the manner in which it was handled was really poor, and I really don't expect much. We ended up back at the Millennium the next night. The rooms themselves were nice, and Dave the bartender at the martini bar is a super cool dude.
