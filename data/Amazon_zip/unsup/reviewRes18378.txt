Why is it that I've lived in this neighborhood for a year and have never been here before? This place is on Wilson, just west of Ravenswood. If you weren't looking for it, you would probably miss it. We only knew it was here because we took a walk one day while waiting for Spacca Napoli to have room for us. We brought our bottle of wine with, because it is BYOB. At 7pm on a Friday, it was not yet totally packed. We were seated and given menus, and then told the specials. My husband ended up with lobster ravioli and I got chicken with mushroom ravoli. My husband said that his was good and mine was excellent. Both were more food than we could finish there. We did look at a dessert menu, and everything there looked good, but we were both very full and couldn't manage to eat another bite. This would be a great place to take a date. We will also probably bring our parents here when they come in from out-of-town.
