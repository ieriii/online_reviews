Thai and Sushi, who would have thought that this combination would work. I'm a believer and licking my chops for more. There are two rooms for dining, the gray room which is brightly lit and where the sushi-bar lives. I prefer the red room, which the light is dimmed for more of a romantic feel for dining. We ordered a few Indie specialty maki rolls. Out of the three, I loved the Volcano maki. Yum! The roll was made to perfection, all the flavors melted in my mouth and exploded with love. Yum, again! The second course was Thai Hawaiian Duck curry, it came in a large platter, the duck breast was infused in the curry and was spectacular. Don't worry if you forgot to bring drinks to dinner, Jewel is next door and Indie welcomes B.Y.O.B with no corkage fee. There are plenty of free parking on the side streets and metered parking on Broadway. I would recommend making reservations, this place fills up fast.
