I've dined at a bunch of different spots around the city for brunch. Somehow none of those experiences compare to the famous brunch at Publican. Going in, I asked a friend of mine what he'd recommend on the menu. "(Go for the) oysters & the roasted chicken. Beyond that, go with pig products." Sadly, I never got to taste the chicken or oysters; yet the nice pork-filled tasting menu made up for it. Started off with the pumpkin donut (oozing with deliciousness). Then we had the spicy pork shoulder (very flavorful; the kale and egg sides brought it all out) and poached egg (also pretty good). By far the best dishes were the omelet (with cheese, onions and prosciutto...so delicious) and of course, the slab of maple syrup-braised bacon (there's nothing more you can say to describe how this tastes, right?). The meal was topped off by a generous sized waffle with plums and honey butter topping. Why could I not have another piece?? :( The only hangup about this place is that it can get crazy busy...especially for a Sunday brunch. The crowd noise kind of bugged me as well. Wait staff was accommodating; I also got a kick out of the paintings of fat (and I mean FAT) pigs on the walls. The booths setup was also kind of interesting; they all had a door at the end so it made it look like you were in a pigpen. Would I find that hilarious or intimidating? I dunno. The food itself would would make me want to plan a return trip here. Maybe if I returned on a less busier day, I'd enjoy myself a little more.
