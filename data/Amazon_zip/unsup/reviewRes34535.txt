Lets start with the positive. The Juice was delicious! It was a super long wait and the staff wasn't all that friendly. It was really loud, there was nothing to absorb the sound. (really bad if you are hungover). The food in general was ok? My eggs were a little undercooked... i.e. the whites were runny and my bacon looked like it had been on the grill for all of 30 seconds.  I'd say, not worth the wait.
