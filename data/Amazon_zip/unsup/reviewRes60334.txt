I have had the beef sandwich which was tasty so decided to try the pizza. I ordered an individual pizza, temperature was tepid at best and crust dry and chewy. I later found out these pizzas are "pre-made". Really? I should have realized something was odd when the pizza was brought out soon after we were seated. I'm not sure I will give them my business as I'm wondering where else they take "shortcuts" Yuck!
