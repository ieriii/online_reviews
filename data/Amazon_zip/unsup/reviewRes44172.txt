If you like eating sushi in an IKEA ad, this is your place. It has a nice ambiance and pretty furniture - that is just incredibly uncomfortable to sit on. We tore up some maki rolls, and it was exactly what I expected. There was no 'melts in my mouth' or 'tastes like heaven' or 'OMGGGG' Bonus - Ice cream place next door. Too bad I was on a date with a bunch of gays and not some hot dood that likes to buy me stuff. jk jk
