This place is my favorite. I went there few times. Great food! Great atmosphere, friendly servers. My favorite is seafood salad, and thin crust pizza! the price is very reasonable. nice selection of wines. If you go, don't eat too much of focaccia bread at the beginning even it's very tasty. your dinner is on the way!
