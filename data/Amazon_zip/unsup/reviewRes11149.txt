I must have walked past Piece a hundred times without going in, but on Sunday I had a hangover, and my mom was driving in from Milwaukee and got stuck in the traffic from an overturned truck carrying (for real) greased pig parts so she arrived hungry and cranky and then we had to wait twenty-five minutes for the blue line and by the time we got to Damen we were thisclose to having one of those arguments where you don't talk for months, so I decided to skip the inevitable wait at Feast and head for a place that I was pretty sure would not be crowded. So glad I did, because I had no idea they had New Haven-style pizza (no mozzarella, just Parmesan), which is a favorite of both my mom and me. Thirty minutes later, we were chomping on a delightfully crispy thin crust and deciding on our shopping plan. So, thanks Piece!
