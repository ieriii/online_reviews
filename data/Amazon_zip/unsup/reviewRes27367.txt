Amazing, amazing, Ahhhmazing! The bf took me here for my bday and I LOVED it! We opted for the 15 course meal (which took a little over 3 hours to complete....is that normal?). Luckily, we were having so much fun that I didn't realize how long the dining experience was until we left...happy and very full. We had the popcorn appetizer, which is an unusual starter, but very tasty! White truffle, cracked pepper and parmesan fluff coat these delicious morsels. Then we moved on to a pie served on a cheddar pillow with apple gel, deconstructed ceasar, quail egg with mustard caviar, chicken with carrot marshmallow, sweet bread with chimichurri sauce, hog, sashimi, cod with creamed wheat and swiss chard, bass with smoked leek , marcona almond and tomato marmalade, atlantic monkfish with cheddar hushpuppy, duck (yum!) with jersualem artichoke, bourbon butter and napa cabbage, wagyu with trumpet mushrooms, venison with savory granola and caramelized yogurt, granita, orange on a honeycomb with earl grey and lemon balm, pineapple with caramel ribbon, whipped banana and spiced gelato, and we finished with a cocoa chocolate gel. The entree concepts and food presentation are all very interesting little works of art. I also ordered a foie gras lollipop, covered in pop rocks. OH MY! I've never had foie gras before, but this was delicious!! The texture and crackle of the candy (pauses to relive the moment) were such a strange compliment to each other. I also ordered my favorite drink, vodka dirty martini-extra dirty. Triple points for the tastiest dirty martini I've ever been served. =) Overall a very fun dining experience, delicious food, great relaxed ambiance, AND...we left FULL. =)
