First, the place is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, especially the front room which has a well-appointed, comfortable bar; low chairs and tables (some of which cozy up next to the fireplace), and the kind of dark, clubby feel you might expect somewhere much more pretentious. In other words, good job on the decor. As for the food, not so great and, believe me, for the $34 it set my companion and I back, it should have been much better. I mean, $34 for bacon, eggs, French toast and two coffees? Seriously, I did not detect truffle oil on the eggs and foie gras seemed absent as well, so what the fuck? Anyway, the thing that makes Uncommon Ground a two star joint is the following exchange that we had with the server. My companion hates mushrooms and she wanted the egg skillet sans mushrooms. Our server, a heavily tattooed lad with a slightly imperious manner, informed us that, "Chef won't change the recipe." Really? To say that I was bemused by this would be to completely ignore the white-hot rage that was bubbling up through my chest. Chef won't take out the mushrooms? I looked around for a moment. I looked out the window. Yes, we were in Chicago. For a moment I thought perhaps we had gotten on a airplane and flown to Spain to eat at El Bulli, but no, this was just a breakfast joint on Devon in Edgewater. Oh, well. We sucked it up and finished our meal and had a good laugh about it later. But we will not be back under any circumstances.
