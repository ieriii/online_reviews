I have been here a couple times and both times I am impressed with the ambiance and performances but increasingly less so by everything else. The poetry slams are a fun experience if you've never been. It is also not a cheap night out; even on a Wednesday night, a cover charge and drinks at market price can leave a surprising dent in your wallet.
