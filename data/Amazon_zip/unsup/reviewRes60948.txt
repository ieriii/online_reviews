we ordered all three snacks they offered.... Basket of Gougeres - House Made Parmesan Cheese Puffs, Truffle Honey. These were incredible, soft, cheesy, fresh and I felt compelled to eat more than two or perhaps three, hmm I think it was four or five. They were that good... and the truffle honey - amazing! The House Marinated Olives - Thyme, Anise, Garlic & Orange Zest. Tanguy and delicious with a great mix of green and black.
