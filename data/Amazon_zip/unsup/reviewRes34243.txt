This place is somewhere between three and four stars... It is clean and bright, has a friendly waitstaff, and an extensive menu. The food, though, is pretty average diner fare. I had the peach cobbler crepes, which were ok, but sort of dry (the filling was pretty much just canned peaches). In general, everyone I was there with seemed to like what they got, but no one was raving about it. I do have to say, though, the potatoes were well above average.
