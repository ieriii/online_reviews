The food here is good. The staff rushes you non stop but in their defense there is always a line out the door. I would suggest taking reservations to avoid rushing everyone after making them wait for extended periods. The people working here are never warm or friendly. They have good coffee and fresh juice, just a bad attitude. I like going here and the food is good but I have just had better as the rating suggests. There is nothing that makes this place unique other than a large menu. The chairs are small wooden chairs from a grade school classroom pushed tightly together. If you go here you will not be let down nor will you be impressed they are strikingly average.
