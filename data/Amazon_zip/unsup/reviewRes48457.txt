Loved it. LOVED IT!!! I'm so glad i waited for the kinks to be worked out because it was totally worth it. I've been a few times now and it gets better every time.  The most recent visit, for my boy's bday, i made a res and requested non-communal seating. The host (dead ringer for vince from entourage) was very accommodating with a lovely two-top right by the picture windows. It only got better from there, our server was top notch and the beer list is to die for, if you don't know what you like, ask your waiter, they are bursting with recommendations. The food was amazing: You MUST be an adventurous eater to enjoy the food here, it's a nose-to-tail concept place. MUST TRY: charcuterie plate (the pork and duck terrine, WOAH), pork shoulder/chorizo dish, mussels, oysters, and the fresh ricotta (ours came with fried sage, roasted squash, and pancetta). The seafood dishes hold their own against the meat creations, so don't be shy! tips: make a reservation and be specific about desired seating. it gets NUTS in here, esp on the weekends, you'll end up waiting forever if you attempt to walk in. Also, it's pretty loud but makes for a great place to start the night. The best beers come in 750ml bottles and the women's bathroom all the way on the right has a mirror in it. happy pig time :)
