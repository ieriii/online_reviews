Just fantastic. Went here for lunch today and could not be any more pleased with the entire experience. Obviously, enjoying gorgeous 75 degree weather on their secluded patio sets a positive tone for the rest of the lunch, but everything was great. I started out with Insalata di Pesche - a nice mix of greens and goat cheese on a bed of sliced peaches. Was very refreshing and just the right size to start out the meal. My main dish was one of their specials, a Risotto with vegetables that was also very, very tasty and again, just the right size for lunch.  Service was great. They were attentive but not annoying, and I felt like I could have passed the time there without any issues of them trying to hurry us along. Unfortunately I did not drink during this lunch so can't vouch for their bar drinks or wine selection. But the overall experience was just fantastic all the way around so I would highly recommend.
