While hardcore BBQ fans may take issue with the fine-dining approach to what is usually a picnic table experience, casual diners will be awed by Q's different take on the cuisine. The menu features all the classic BBQ staples with upscale "twists" - the baked beans are served with kobe beef brisket and the mac and cheese is done "brle style". And warm towels and lemon replace the post-meal "wet-nap". Nice. I ordered the St. Louis rack and tried all four excellent sauces; I enjoyed the mustard most of all -- it just seemed to mesh with the smokey dry rub. The "smoke" seems to pervade every dish (even the tomatoes in the house salad). The room is exceptionally well-designed and management has taken the concept of a barbecue joint in a fresh direction. The decor felt like a brasserie. Some of other reviews pointed out the spotty service and I agree this was the one weakness. It took a long time to get our entrees, even though the restaurant was nearly empty. Service aside, I'd call Q a must-try for food fans.
