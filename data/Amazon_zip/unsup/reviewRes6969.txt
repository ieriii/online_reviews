Yelp led us to this place for lunch while checking out the Air and Water show. Great spot! Gorgeously decorated, very attentive, fast/efficient, friendly wait staff and wonderful food. More about the food: bold, smokey flavors with a rustic presentation. For example, the kobe chopped brisket sandwich: tender chunks of meat about the size of dice served on what had to be a freshly baked bun, served with at least four sauces. The greens were mixed with kale and seasoned with bacon--best I have ever had and our kids loved them too. The kids split a pulled chicken s/w. Without the sauces, the chicken might have been a little boring. I think the prices are reasonable for the quality of food and upscale style of the restaurant. Our family of four (kids ages 6 and 4) ate for around $55
