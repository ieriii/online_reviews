red brick's pizza tastes better than giordanos thin crust i have to say. the stuffed crust is overrated too. but if you're visiting chicago for the first time i guess you'd still want to get this part (the part where you find out for yourself what the buzz over chicago pizza is) over with. once is enough though. and one slice is enough. the waitress was very nice. their meatballs were moist, and not overcooked like most meatballs ive tasted. but as far as pizza goes, ive certainly had better.
