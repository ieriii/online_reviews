A city where deep dish is King its nice to explore a place that has great thin crust. My experiences dining in at piece have always been great. Good food, good service good beer. Recently ordered delivery and I was once more reminded of how awesome this place is. The online ordering system is awesome and quick. We were able to make a custom pizza with no hassle. The side salad we ordered was also very delicious and packed with fresh delicious ingredients.
