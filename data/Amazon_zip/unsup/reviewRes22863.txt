I really love Superdawg. I love the decor, I love those big kooky dawgs on the roof, I love the food, and I even love the goofy copy on the packaging ("Hiya!"). It's really a whole experience, and it's all delicious. Okay, yeah, Superdawg ain't cheap, but I think it's worth it. I'd happily give my hard-earned bucks to such an original and independent institution than to some stupid heartless chain. Get a chocolate malt and a dawg with everything (yes, peppers too) and enjoy the view. Worth every penny.
