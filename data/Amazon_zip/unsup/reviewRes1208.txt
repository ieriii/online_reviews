I've been waiting years to try this place and I finally did! I thought I'd be smart and phone in an order at 10:30 on a Friday morning. I waited less than 10 minutes for my order once I arrived. I went with the Merguez lamb sausage with feta and chili-garlic mayo and, of course, the duck fat fries. I kicked myself for not eating here sooner. Delicious doesn't even begin to cover it. The BEST sausage and fries I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try more. I'm hooked, Doug. You got me.
