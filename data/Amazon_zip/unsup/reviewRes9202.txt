The reason Le Colonial is still with us is that they are consistently excellent. We had yet another Broad's Night Out and had an terrific time. A woman who was seated at a table with four men actually came over and sat with us... (We might have been loud again). We had 3 people waiting on us, the drinks & food kept coming. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.
