It's Friday (thank God!) and my buddy DJ A and I decide to head out for lunch. We decide on XOCO, the new Bayles place. I have not been there yet but my buddy has and he really likes it. The place wasn't too crowded when we got there but it sure did fill up fast. As we left I made the comment that the line reminds me of Hot Dougs, as it was snaking out the door. Well we started with a guacamole and chips. This was very fresh and flavorful. It only ran around $4 dollars for the order. DJ A said he thought this was probably one of the best guacamole and chip orders he has got at any restaurant. I would have to agree it was very good. The chips were made that day you could just tell. Next we each ordered a sandwich. I got the Cubano. I don't remember which one my buddy got but he was raving about it. He's not like my family, that I can just sample his food. I thought my sandwich again was very fresh and flavorful. It came with pork and bacon (I love bacon!!). It probably ran around $12 dollars each. It took a little bit of time for the food to make it to our table. We also had soft drinks too. Our total bill came to around $35 dollars. DJ A and I both thought the food was very good, flavorful and fresh. It was a little bit slow and pricey though. But it is the loop and it was a Friday lunch. I know we will definitely head back to XOCO for another fresh Bayles lunch and we both recommend that you give it a try too.
