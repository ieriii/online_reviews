This place left me luke-warm. The food - basic Indian fare, nothing special. I even asked the waiter for a recommendation. He recommended the Chicken Tikka Masala.. It was pretty average. The portions are large and the nan was delish. The service - thumbs down! Our waiter was less than attentive and they screwed up our bill. Tsk-tsk!
