I've been here twice--once for dinner and once for brunch. The dinner was for a friend's birthday party about a year ago. I think I ordered gumbo and thought it was pretty good. Also, the party itself was very nice. It was in a private area sort of off to the left when you enter the restaurant. There was a bar in there and our own tables. There was a set menu for the party, but everything seemed good, including the appetizers. My more recent experience here for brunch was just ok. I came with two friends late on a Sunday afternoon expecting to get lunch, but then we found out they only serve brunch on Sundays. I ordered oatmeal and a biscuit on the side. The oatmeal was fine (it came with milk, raisins, and brown sugar all in separate containers so you could control how much to add). The biscuit was the right consistency, but had an odd taste--almost as if it had somehow come into contact with fish before being served. My friends ordered pancakes and sausage and biscuits. They reported that the pancakes were only mediocre and that the sausage was bordering on disgusting. I don't really eat sausage, but I will say that the patty looked like something you would get at McDonald's. Maybe brunch is not Wishbone's forte. I would probably come back here for dinner, but not for brunch.
