The wife and I went to Alinea several months ago, and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. A relative of the wife works there and so we decided we would try it out at some point. We were not disappointed. From the moment you open the unmarked door, and walk down the hallway, you start to wonder what you're in for. You open the inner door, and voila, the hustle and bustle of the kitchen greets you from the left, and the staff stand in front of you dressed like they are members of the CSO. We sat upstairs and went with the 12 course plus wine. The courses were taste sensations. A thick piece of smoked bacon dipped in butter scotch? Delicious? Yes? Oh yes. I wanted another one. The duck with dark chocolate nestled atop the savory duck. It was by the far the most ambitious flavor combo of the night and it worked. Lobster foam?  Foam that tastes like lobster but looks like... foam. The ambience does not disappoint either. It's very expensive, but it's a meal that regular folks should have once or twice in their lifetimes. I would go again.
