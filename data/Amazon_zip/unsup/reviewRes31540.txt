Mastro's is truly amazing! I went for my first time Thursday May 12th after wine spectators grand tour. We ended up combining my party & some other friends & ended up with a party of 11. They were super accommodating & quickly put a number of tables together to fit our new very large party. Even though it was late the servers were still on point &  they actually assigned us 2 waiters. The bus boys were some of the best as well. They allowed us to bring a number of open bottles from the wine tasting as long as we bought some more wine off the list which we planned to do. Some of this wine belonged to the owner of an amazing italian winery called batasiolo. He spoke very little english but truly enjoyed his american steak. It was great dining here with old & new friends & everyone thought the food was amazing! Some of my favorites are the ahi tuna tartare, the house salad, the double bone in porterhouse, the bone in kansas city, the not on the menu lobster mac & cheese, & their new cherry crisp. I enjoyed it so much that my wife & I went back last night Friday May 20th. We slipped in & got a table in the bar with no trouble @ 6:45. Everything I had been craving was just as good. We both think that this is one of the best places in chicago for great food (not just steak), fun, atmosphere (very modern & chic.) We plan to go very often. I would very highly recommend trying Mastro's, don't listen to anyone that said it wasn't all that, their crazy! LOVE U MASTRO'S!!!
