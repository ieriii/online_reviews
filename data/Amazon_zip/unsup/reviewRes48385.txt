This is a review based on a wonderful brunch experience.  Our server was a delight, walking us thru the menu and giving great recommendations- he was busy, you could tell, but very attentive and helpful. I am allergic to orange/grapefruit/pineapple/citrus juice so he brought me a mimosa made with cranberry juice and I was very greatful-- he knew his beers and knew what to pair with which entree which means either he is really good at his job, Publican has a wonderful training program, or both. He was a great upseller too, as after our group ordered he said "I noticed no one ordered the publican bacon?" to which we responded "ok send us two".. and by bacon he meant maple cured PORK BELLY (way too thick for normal bacon!) and to which my heart melted and my tastebuds did a jig. Um, and then my breakfast? Pancakes with foie gras and cherry compote and sausage? Holy hell, what a way to end a month-long vegan detox. The foie was mixed with rice crispies, and on the hot pancakes the foie melted, leaving behind the crispies and a beautiful flavour absorbed into the cakes. fucking unbelievable. Did not entirely care for the sausage that came with it, it was full of seeds and herbs that made it almost crunchy, but it was delicious tho texturally overwhelming. I also got the onion tartine, which was f-ckin fab. Now the food was great, and I am a fan of the communal tables which easily accommodated my larger group, i enjoyed the waiting area which wasn't so much a lounge or a bar but allowed you to stand, lean on a table and get a drink, i enjoyed the condiments on the table like garlic butter and raw sugar cubes. There was a lot of little detail that impressed me, from the art on the walls (prize winning pigs) to the soaps and lotions available at the communal sink out side of the beautiful bathrooms-- I am a believer in the Publican.
