Was visiting for work and went with Chicago colleagues so I had no preconceived notions/expectations.  We first had a drink at the bar and the tenders are top notch, offering suggested alternatives for traditional brands. It was then I developed an addiction to their popcorn, which I joked must be crafted from free range, corn fed corn. If they sold it at the movies, box office sales in the US would double. As for the food, it was very entertaining. It's seasonal, so don't expect any dishes reviewed to be on the menu. Loved my cuttlefish starter, where the protein was cut to look and feel like pasta, and included flavors such as chorizo, raisin chutney, and saffron. The main was Waygu beef in a broth with shaved truffles and fall veggies. I actually thought some of the veggies were the best things I tasted (a carrot that tasted like carrot essence).  My friend swapped some bites of her braised pork - also delish. For desert we had the whole menu and swapped bites. I can't quite reconstruct the round... but everything was tasty. Be fair warned that it's a pricey place and the portions might be considered small by some... not a 24 oz steak dinner type place. GE is more about refined, unique taste experiences delivered in a series of packages.
