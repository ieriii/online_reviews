All I have to say is that I found my New Thai Restaurant!!! I used to go to Penny's and Thai on Clark, but Opart won my heart. So far I dine there once and order carryout but that food is great. It is inexpensive, easy travel access if you are taking the train and staff is great as well. I would so recommend this place for a large party or for just 2. I am definitely going back for more Thai!!!
