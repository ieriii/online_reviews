"Like DMK Burger, but on the lighter side." I had heard about this place from reading reviews and from experiences from friends; I finally decided to check the place out. Looking at the menu, there were plenty of interesting burger choices: "Red Spruce Springsteen" (cheddar, greens and ale sauce), "Edmund Fig-Gerald" (fig & bacon relish, goat cheese, smoked onion and beer sauce), "Elvis' Last Supper" (bacon and PB...hmm, might have to try that next time). I settled on "The Hangover", which was house glazed ham, over-easy egg, bacon, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup, mayo, mustard, provolone & fries on a pretzel bun. Gigantic burger, lots of ingredients (but a good mix), tasty eating. The burger itself on a pretzel bun makes for a pretty nice pairing. The fries were standard, nothing spectacular. The beer selection was excellent as well. From what I can tell, this place was less on the trendier side...which is a good thing. A little bigger than some of the spots that I've been at, this is definitely a place that you can sit, hang out, grab a beer with friends and watch the game. Not very crowded, either...love that aspect too. Although the heavily tattooed woman behind the bar kind of freaked me out. It was like if I started a bar fight, she'd immediately jump over the bar and smash both of our skulls. Ok sorry, maybe I exaggerated :) To tell you the truth she seated us, she was a very nice woman and the service was good. Another thing that I liked about this place is that the prices are reasonable. The same "Dragons Milk" ale that is $5 here can be $10 and above at most spots downtown. Plus the burger that I ordered only cost me $10 (with all those ingredients, I think it's a reasonable price). Overall, great place.
