If you love nostalgia, this is the place to be. My gang and I go on a Thursday night when we can arrange our schedules. We love Alan G's orchestra, the radio spots and the patrons who come dressed for the era. Maybe I'll invest in some vintage clothing when I get nerve enough to dance. Then, when someone compliments my dress I can really mean it when I say, Oh, this old thing? We are going back in a few weeks. I can't wait!
