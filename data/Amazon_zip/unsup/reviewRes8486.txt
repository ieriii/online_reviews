Had a wonderful lunch here earlier today. Have eaten dinner here several times before. We have chatted with the owner on a few occasions and have found him to be warm, passionate about his business and the quality of food and service and it shows. He has generously comp'd tastes of pizza and aperitifs on several occasions No argument that the prices are higher than your average pizza joint but you get what you pay for. Lovely patio and interior has recently expanded so waits are not as long as they used to be. We'll be back often.
