Wow this is a good restaurant! On the recommendation of a friend and having passed this place many time the wife and I mosied on to here. I started with the oatmeal shake w/ soy milk and this was awesome!! Very tasty as I shared with the wife. She got Ice tea and I normally don't like ti but thought it was good actually. I got the vegetarian sandwich which was full of flavor and portioned well for a meal, not to much but just enough. The wife got a steak that was real thin and she said it was great. We both got the rice and beans which were really good. Flavored with a little bit of lime. Yum! Outdoor seating was a plus but it was a little crowded. Not really a big deal seeing as how everywhere here is like that. Service was friendly and good, they take cash only but have a ATM inside which helps. Would definitely go back...
