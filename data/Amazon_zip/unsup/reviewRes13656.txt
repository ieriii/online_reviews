Holy crap! This is one of those places i'm really afraid to write a review for because the secret is leaking out that these guys really really do everything right.  I went there for a Tuesday dinner with a big crowd ( 12 people) - we had to make reservations beforehand... King crab legs as a buffet.. yes PLEASE! It comes with real corn on the cob slabbered with parmesan cheese and butter. Oh dear lord... They also offer a huge selection of seafood... good portions, quality cooking, a must go for anyone in the area.
