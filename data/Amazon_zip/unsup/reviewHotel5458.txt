Stayed here for a conference recently, and although the hotel was okay, it's really not so great for business travelers. Internet was $9.95/day and a pain to deal with. I was told, upon check in, that because of the way I'd booked the room, the internet was included in the price of my stay. But, lo and behold, the charges were on my bill when it came check out time. And I had to argue with the front desk staff to get it taken off, and they acted like they were doing me a big favor. Also, the last day of my stay, the wireless was "unavailable" and there was no one onsite who knew what to do to fix it. The # of channels available on the cable TV selection was pretty lame. And like others said, the sheets kept coming off the bed, which was pretty annoying. The good points about this hotel is that the staff (aside from the whole internet debacle) was very accomodating and friendly and it was quiet (although the fact that I was on the 21st floor may have had something to do with the lack of street noise). It wasn't a horrible place to stay, but I wouldn't stay there again. There are much better places in Chicago to stay for the same price. Oh well, now I know...
