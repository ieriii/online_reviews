Opart pretty much represents everything I love about Lincoln Square. It's fairly-priced, not uber-trendy, not over-crowded, not judgmental, etc. Even if it is filled with old hipsters/Wicker Park ex-pats in their 30s talking about the good ol' days of the Artful Dodger and telling stories of prostitutes on North Avenue. But that's part of the fun. Lincoln Square is both mature and cool at the same time, and Opart fits the neighborhood like an old shoe.  The atmosphere is laid back, easy, and service is good. The Pad Thai (my litmus test for a Thai place) was really good. They put a lot of sprouts in it so it gives it a lot of crunch that nicely offsets the buttery peanut sauce. Delicious. I'll definitely be back.
