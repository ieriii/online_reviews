I guess I'm turned off by the whole pretend nature of most of the menu choices. I'm all for meatless substitutions and fake foods, but I don't want to feel like I'm eating vegetarian soylent green and paying considerably more for the privilege. My enchilada was excellent, though overly spicy, and the hummus was just OK. A dining companion said his faux chicken fried steak tasted like a sock and the vegetables were overcooked. I was also pissed off that I paid $7 for a fake aa berry shake the size of a child's sippy cup. Fake--yeah. According to my severely-pierced and tattooed server, they use SYRUP for the taste and regular milk (not organic, hm). This restaurant is one of a handful of casual vegetarian restaurants with a great reputation. While our server was delightfully pleasant and attentive, I am embarrassed to request one thing that I would never voice in person: Servers--and this seemed to be most of the staff--please consider hygiene and appearance when working with food. Keep the dangling septum piercing, eyebrow bars and ear stretching to a minimum.
