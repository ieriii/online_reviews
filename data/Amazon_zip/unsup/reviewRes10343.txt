Gorgeous patio space. Seriously, worth going to just for that. I took a few people who were not very appreciative of the small portions, high prices and just average food. I enjoyed my gnocchi very much and the rest was somewhat blah. It was a beautiful evening though and the city looked magical from the softly lit patio here.
