I have been going to Frontera and Topolo for the last ten years. During this time period the food has been consistently great and so has the service. My last two visits have been a bit disappointing though in the service department. At Topolo & Frontera the service was sloooow. We had wait quite a bit for water refills and the the waiter showed up on two occasions at our table with food that was for someone else. Service aside, the food is still solid and inventive. If you are willing to stick your arm up for water and don't mind sending the waiter to the correct table then you really should visit this restaurant. Ten years later I still will and only put down the constructive criticism so they continue to excel.
