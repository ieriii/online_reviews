I had been totally intimidated by this place and put off by the name and exterior look, but I'm really glad I read the reviews and gave it a try anyway. I had the Warden, and it was by far the best burger I've had in Chicago. Some burgers are just a tasty some of their parts--but everything about this burger was perfect--the meat was really well seasoned and flavorful and would have been just as amazing without the decadent cheese baked into the middle. The mac and cheese is also outstanding. Highly recommend!
