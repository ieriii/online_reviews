Conflicted. Great patio. Wonderful wait service for dinner but prepare for a very long wait, almost 2 hours, and friendly but ridiculous slow service on the patio. The food was really good,reasonably priced but you better love pork and bread...I thought I did but even I had a bit of a pork and bread overload.
