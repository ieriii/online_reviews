You have to love Greek Town! This restaurant is very homey and warm, the staff are very attentive and they know all the regulars, and they really take care of you - including removing the crumbs from your table and refilling water often. Their menu has so many options you really can't go wrong with anything you order, from gyro, to the juicy chicken, tender vegetables and perfectly prepared seafood, they deliver great tasty food and large portions at reasonable prices. They also have an abundance of great appetizers including dips/spreads which you can eat with the french bread they put on the table. This place is great for large groups and sharing food here is a must! I love that they valet park for free, and there is always an abundance of people, so it great for people watching. Make sure you make reservations because it can get crowded and we all hate waiting...I personally get VERY cranky.
