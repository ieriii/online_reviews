I would never run back here with so many fabulous restaurant spots in Chicago. To be honest, with such good ratings, this one causes me to lose trust in Yelp. The food was pretty sad and tasteless. Everything lacked seasoning. The menu was highly creative but the execution definitely was lacking. I didn't even finish one of the five dishes I ordered. This is from someone who has rarely missed a meal and LOVES food. Normally, I'd be licking the plate in a place like this. To add insult to injury, I had three different wines. And, none of them I would ever drink again. The hostess was rude with an attitude (despite that the place was empty on a Monday night). Service and ambiance also left a lot to be desired. It's Sad. Very sad.
