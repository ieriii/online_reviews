Hot Dougs takes me to my happy place every time. They have fascinating sausage creations for the adventurous eater, including game meat sausages and all kinds of crazy toppings. For the safer eater, they have classic dogs, such as the Chicago dog, corn dogs, and Polish/Italian sausage. The classic and crazy sausages are all delicious, I usually go for the crazy sausages.  The owner, Doug, runs the cash register, he's super friendly. Duck fat fries? Delicious! They don't need any salt or ketchup, perfect as they are. They're only available Fridays and Saturdays, of course, when lines are the longest. I recommend Hot Dougs during a day off from work, otherwise the line is just too long.  Thank you for being a Chicago staple!
