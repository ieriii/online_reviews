I had a nice time at Davanti's. I wish they took reservations but we managed to get a table fairly quickly so overall I was pleased. The wine list here is extensive so I needed some help picking what I wanted and the waitress was very helpful in pointing me towards wines I may like. The food was all good but the stand out was the cheese and honeycomb jar and the focaccia di recco (very thin, flakey thing w/ creamy cheese on the inside, I've never had anything quite like it - YUM!). I love truffle, i love eggs and I love toast so I ordered the truffle egg toast but unilke a lot of other yelpers for me it was only ok. I've had the same dish elsewhere done better. While I loved the decor and overall feel of the place it was extremely loud as others have noted. Perfect if you're going to have a few drinks and are ok shouting... not so good if you want to have a cozy romantic night with your partner. Overall I enjoyed it and would go back on a night where I know I'm not going to be waiting forever for a table.
