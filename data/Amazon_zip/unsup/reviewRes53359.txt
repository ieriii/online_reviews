Waited 2 hours and 20 minutes in the heat, but it was worth it. The rattlesnake sausage with cheese stuffed hot peppers was exceptional. It had a nice herby taste to it. The Fire Dog could have been more spicy. Italian and veggie dogs were good. The regular & duck fat fries were nothing special and kind of soggy.  Next time I think I should stick to the specials. Would probably give it closer to 4 and a half stars.
