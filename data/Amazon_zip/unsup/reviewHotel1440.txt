Omni Hotel was the site of our committee meeting. We have volunteers fly in from across the US so my review is not only of the meeting room space and service but also on the hotel rooms...or at least mine. The Meeting Space: Just fine as far as meeting rooms go. It was clean. The A/V peeps were available to help us with any issues we were having (which not many). The space was set up bright and early every morning for our meetings. The food for the meetings was pretty decent. You know how hotel meeting food can be. They put on quite the spread for our lunch service and we were quite pleased. The banquet and meetings staff were extremely helpful and even loaded up our A/V equipment and other valuables to be locked up with security so we didn't have to lug it back to our rooms. They took care of it all for us without a hitch! The Hotel: Omni is a very nice hotel. It's in a great location for a meeting or a weekend away. It's a little confusing though as the lobby is on the third floor and you have to take different elevators to get to the lobby or meeting spaces vs. the elevators for the rooms. I'm not a fan of this set up but it's not the end of the end of the world or anything.  The Rooms: This is an all suites hotel. I appreciate having a separate living area. My room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The room itself was spacious and they have a nice turn down service. Our volunteers were quite happy with the rooms as well. I would not hesitate to stay here on my own accord and I would most definitely book another meeting here. Some of our volunteers stayed the weekend after our meeting was over to enjoy what Chicago has to offers. It's location is ideal for the out of towner and the service you'll receive is top notch.
