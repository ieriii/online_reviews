Good location, nice out door seating. I went without reservations and didn't wait long for a seat. The protocol to check in is a little to be desired, too noisy and standing in line in a small doorway is a little awkward. It's BYOB but there is a fee of $3 per person for the privilege. Great place to go when the weather is nice. Don't know where you'd sit if it wasn't? Our server was nice and attentive and the food we delicioso! The black beans could have used some flavor but the meat was fabulous. I'd go again for sure.
