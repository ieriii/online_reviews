A few reviews mentioned the "touristy nature" of the Green Mill. Don't get too worked up over that; most of the clientele is still decidedly local. It's a great hole-in-the-wall jazz bar that still manages to feel homey. Fun history--it used to be a speakeasy during the Capone era--and it still has a lot of that Depression-era charm. Oh, and the music--the real reason you care about this place--ranges from decent to great. Check the bar's Web site before you go to see who's playing. Drinks are a little pricey, the service is slow and they only take AmEx, but hey, it's a jazz bar.
