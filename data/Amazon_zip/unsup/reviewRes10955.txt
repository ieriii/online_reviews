You will wait. You will wait surrounded by hungover hipsters. You will wait surrounded by hungover hipsters who opine on things loudly and mostly without any clue. You will wait surrounded by hungover hipsters displaying their obnoxia and think to yourself: why am I doing this on a weekend morning when I could bring my best friend/new lover/mother somewhere else and we could have a perfectly good breakfast/brunch there? The answer, friends, is that The Bongo Room is worth it. The food is just that loverly when what you are craving is something yummy and related to the pancake, but pushing the pancake outside its comfort zone. Or when you want the perfect eggs benedict, with hollandaise that has just the right balance of rich and citrusy goodness. The Bongo Room takes breakfast potatoes and tells them to up their game. The Bongo Room does not allow its frenchtoast to remain simply egg-and-bread (which can be, of course, delightful) -- instead, frenchtoast must exert itself and become something sweeter, richer, more complicated. You will have coffee that is not for the faint of heart. You will be seated close to others. You may not get instant water refills (remember the hungover hipsters? They require a lot of attention and, even though the staff is great at both locations, sometimes you have to wait a minute). But the food, the food will be rich and indulgent and it will be all you remember the next time someone comes to visit you and wants to go to brunch. So you will say, let's go to The Bongo Room ... and it will be the right thing to do.
