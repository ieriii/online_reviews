Normally, I love Calo. Living in the area, I have eaten here dozens of times. However, this time we decided we to call for a pick up. The woman on the phone was rude and uninviting. When you dine in, you are offered complimentary soup or salad with your meal. Yet tonight when I asked for salad with my pastas, I had to order it separately. As a restaurant General Manager, I am scratching my head trying to figure out why I have to pay an additional charge for my complimentary salad because I had placed my order to go. The woman's attitude about the salad and my order in general made me question my dine in business as well. I'm not sure if and when I will be back.
