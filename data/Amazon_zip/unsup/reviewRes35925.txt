Not good. Really, it was bad. I guess there isn't much competition on the northside, because I can't believe how busy this place was. The BBQ is subpar and relatively bland. Our wontons were fried dough with a single tiny prefrozen shrimp inside. And lastly, the beef and broccoli was indiscernible from any other Chinese restaurant. If your tight on cash and must have Chinese food, then Sun Wah will suffice. If you can afford a little more, check out Silver Seafood down the street.
