Wow. Friday afternoon at 1:30. We get to Hot Doug's and hope that the line isn't too long. We were greeted with an hour long wait for our growling stomachs. But the wait was totally worth it! The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage is hands down the tastiest sausage I've ever had. So rich and buttery... mmm mmm mmmmm! I also had the Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage. It was also delicious but was not as delicious as the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage. The irish whiskey cheese really went well with the sausage, but was only ok on its own (granted I'm not a huge cheese guy). I also had the fries cooked in duck fat while my friend had regular fries. After doing a comparison, the flavor was very slightly different but not really enough for me to say something like "man! these duck fat fries are the best!" Their fries are good though, but not sure if the duck fat ones are worth the extra money. On the sheer awesomeness of the foie gras dog alone, this place gets 5 stars. From a guy who practically has 5 stomachs, I can say that I was pleasantly stuffed after having the two dogs and fries! I had high expectations coming in and left satisfied. Well done, Doug! Remember, cash only!
