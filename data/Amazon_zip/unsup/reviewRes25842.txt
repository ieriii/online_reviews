I like Pequod's. We went again for the second time recently and I liked it much better than the first time I had it. The crust was very crispy, the dough was not too doughy, and it had the perfect amount of toppings, cheese, and sauce. It's a great place to stop and split a pizza with friends before a movie. I can't say I'd drive over here to eat it, though. It's good and I am a fan...but not a fanatic. Skip the small salad and the creamy garlic dressing. It's blah, with 1,000 black olives, 1 slice of a Roma tomato, and 1 tablespoon of shredded carrots. The creamy garlic dressing tasted like sour cream with garlic powder mixed in. We should've split the fried zucchini. :( Oh well, lesson learned. I'm not sure why people refer to this as deep dish - it's not. It's pan pizza, it even says so on their menu. If you want deep dish pizza, don't come here. If you want great pan pizza, come here. We've never had a wait during the week, but we usually go to 7pm movies and get here around 5:30. When we do head out, I see only about 1 or 2 tables open, I can only imagine how nuts it is on the weekend. Great place to stop before heading over to the movie theater.
