I thought this was going to be an update for me, as I have eaten at Big Jones at least 20 times, but I've not yelped about it. Obviously I like the place. I would give Big Jones a higher rating if service was consistently, but its not. The food here is fantastic... both for brunch and for dinner. Here are a few highlights. Brunch: -Beignets are warm and delish -Shrimp and Grits... not the best ever but a solid choice -Eggs New Orleans very good -Burger.... outstanding! Dinner: -Crab Cakes... nice flavor -Fried Chicken (not the best in town but they give you a ton of chicken and its quite good) -Burger is also featured on the dinner menu Dessert: Try the moon pie... very good! As I mentioned the service is not always great... at times it is fine but other times it seems as if your waiter/waitress has gone out to churn the butter. If management of this establishment would focus on training the staff... focus on great service and customer care, this place would easily have five stars.  Big Jones is very good! Do eat here... you will enjoy your meal.
