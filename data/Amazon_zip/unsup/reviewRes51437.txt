This was our first time in the restaurant. We drove from the southside of Chicago. When we arrived the hostess said it would be about 10-15 minutes which it was. We sat down . My wife ordered a virgin margarita and I a Corona. The margarita was good but the beer was room temperature. We ordered steak burritos with rice and beans on the side. When our food arrived it was very hot which is good. my wife bites into her burrito and out comes a long hair, someone in the kitchen wasn't wearing a hair net. That was kind of gross! I finished my meal my wife didn't, we paid the check and left. i don't think we will be going back. I know this could happen anywhere, my wife doesn't eat alot of meat so just getting her to agree to burrito was a miracle. Maybe just poor timing.
