Went around 11 on a Saturday for brunch and didn't have to wait for a table; noticed that it had filled up by 12 or 12:30. Really liked the food -- the tofu in my huevos rancheros was some of the best tofu I've had -- really flavorful and nice texture. My friends really liked the biscuit sandwich thing.  Service was great. My friend had only eaten about half of her food, and then asked for it to be boxed up. The waitress apparently dropped it while boxing it, so had the kitchen cook up an entirely new dish for my friend, and gave it to her to go. Really nice of her, and my friend got an extra half meal for free!
