Lunch menu is small but good for it's price. Dinner salad bar and meat is alot better. the only thing I hate about this place is that they seat customer by race. I was seated way in the back conner in the "asian section" so the good meat rarely make it to us. May be it was just my imagination but it is way too obious. Request a seat if they try to take you too far from the kitchen.
