There's a lot of fence sitters with the Bad Apple. Lot's of people saying they're ripping off Kumas and not quite living up to it. Well, in my opinion, Kumas is an entity in and of itself. I like metal, but I am pretty sure a fair amount of their patrons don't. That being said, if you want to listen to loud music you probably don't like, in an overcrowded space while you wait 2+ hours to have a unique burger experience, go to Belmont and Fransisco. If you want to walk in and sit down right away, not have to fight for a drink, get a really good burger with a good beer selection, go to Lincoln and Cullom. Sure they both do gourmet burgers, but the similarities stop there. The Bad Apple has a comfortable and cozy atmosphere with dark lighting, fun board games, original Pac Man, a shuffleboard game, three rooms to choose from (plenty of space!), and I've never seen it super crowded. Their burgers are smokey, delicious, and filling. I thought the fries were really good - similar to Five Guys but less greasy. Addicting, basically. Their cocktail menu was created by one of their bartenders, and has some creative concoctions. They do have a ton of beers and a couple of ciders to choose from. I do really hate their logo, and it doesn't match the classiness of the inside with rich walls with trees painted on them, and glowing orbs of light with the tables set pretty far apart for more intimacy. For me, this is not the most amazing place in the world, but I really like the hamburgers and fries, and I like not being stressed out with crowds or having to wait for a decent bite. It's a nice change of pace! If you haven't tried The Bad Apple due to some naysayers, I say, do try!
