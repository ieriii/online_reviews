Ive been to Carnivale on several occassions. But this last time DEMANDS that I make a review beacuse it was such an amazing experience. . . SERVICE - They were awesome. They were running a lil bit late with our reservation so we had to wait at the bar for a bit. No biggie. But when they were ready to seat us - they placed us in the balcony (to make up for the wait). It was an awesome place to sit and just admire the restaurant, decor, and the people !! On top of that, our server was phenomenal ! I have to give big kudos to Susana, she was the BEST. She is what made our experience what it was. She was so passionate about the food she recommended. You were almost salivating as she descibed it all. And all her picks were on the money. She really helped make our experience what it was. FOOD - By far the best meal, start to finish, Ive had in a long time. Seafood appetizers rocked. Damn good rasberry mojitos and tequila, too. For the entree - I usually dont order arracherra, but Susana really recommended it over the other dish I was torn about. The meat was so tender, so flavorful, and amazingly cooked. The way the beef was marinated excited my tasted buds from bite to bite. The yucca fries had that perfect amount of crispiness and garlic that made you crave for more. And lastly, the fried banana ice cream was the perfect light touch to a great meal.
