Good fish, great crabcakes! I love the staff here. I wish they would come up with some new specials though. I come here so often I feel like I've tried it all. At least everything I've tried has been good. I love that I can bring my toddler here and not feel like he's disturbing anyone. Just some random thoughts about Glenn's.
