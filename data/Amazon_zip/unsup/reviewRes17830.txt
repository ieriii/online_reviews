I completely love the atmosphere of this place. I went with a girlfriend of mine, and we were mesmerized at the drink making skills of the bartenders. The drinks were to die for - very yummy. The appetizers were very good, just the selection is a bit eclectic and on the bizarre side- try fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches (which do taste pretty good with a dark & stormy drink). The blue walls, the seating, and everything else is pretty cool, there is no smoking or cell phones, and it is actually the perfect place for a romantic start to an evening, as the lighting and decor sets a great mood for romance. I do recommend this place more for a date night rather than for a girl's night out, but we had a great time there just chatting as the music is not too loud like in most other bars. The place is a bit on the pricier side, but you are paying for the ambiance. Nice, classy and sophisticated lounge that serves prohibition-era style drinks. Yum to fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches! You must try it at least once!
