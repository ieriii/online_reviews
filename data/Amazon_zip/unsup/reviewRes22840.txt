Hot spicy food on a cold night. Perfect combination! It was a spicy themed night out for us and Lao Sze Chuan was perfect for this theme. They have a pretty huge extensive menu and a lot of the meals were noted as spicy. I did notice that they have options for mild, hot or super hot but most of the things we order were all between hot and super hot. We started with a couple of bowls of Hot & Sour soup and a bowl of Egg Drop soup and some pork potstickers. The Hot & Sour soup was SPICY!! It was a heartier soup than I expected and had great flavor and a tons of things in it (I couldn't tell you what was in it if I tried.) The potstickers were HUGE, way bigger than I am used to but they were a bit to much for me considering it was only meat inside. For entrees we decided to just stick to what we know this time around. We got Kung Pao Chicken (super spicy), Sze Chuan Beef (spicy) and Moo Shoo Shrimp (not spicy and super refreshing.) They were all super yummy and the portions were HUGE. I have to say that my favorite was the Moo Shoo shrimp but I think it was partly the overload of spiciness on the other two dishes. The service was great. Everyone was friendly and the food came out fast. The place is tiny but they let us enjoy our bottle wine and food coma long after the food was packed up. I would love to go back and try the Hot Pot -- it looked like so much fun. I would definitely recommend this spot!!
