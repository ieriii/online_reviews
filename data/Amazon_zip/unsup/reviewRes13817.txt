This place is BYOB, so bring some spiced rum and go nuts. My first cuban restaurant in Chicago turned out to be a smashing idea (thanks, Interwebs!). The food is awesome, especially compared to what we get in Milwaukee! One word of warning: all the portions are crazy big. I was hungry, got a bistec, and could not finish more than half of it. The bistec (flash fried, stuffed with ham and cheese) came with a side of bread with garlic butter. The food was delicious and the music made the night. Then we went to go see Beirut at the Congress, making it a very worthwhile trip to the Windy City.
