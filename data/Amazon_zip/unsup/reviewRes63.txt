Went here last night with my boyfriend - I can't say that the food wasn't impressive because it clearly was. (If you're into the whole gastronomy scene.) But the presentation, staff and atmosphere were completely pretentious and pompous. The arrogant waiters really took away from the experience of our meal. When you pay $700+ for dinner - you expect to be treated like a king/queen not like a pauper by patronizing waiters! One of the waiters argued with my boyfriend about white and black not being a colors because he learned that in 1st grade. My boyfriend then asked him if something he had learned in grammar school went with what an adult male had learned until now. He got really defensive and then never came back to our table. My boyfriend is a loose cannon and can be confrontational with people that try to make him feel like an idiot. The sommelier also gets extremely close to your face while presenting the wine pairings and that was pretty annoying. This place reminds me of some hip club that everyone tries to get into and when you finally do - it blows and you can't wait to leave.
