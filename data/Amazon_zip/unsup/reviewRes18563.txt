Been to this place a number of times now and I've never been let down. The food is really quite good and the service is great even when it's busy. They aren't afraid to use garlic, and I love that. The only couple drawbacks with the place is that the seating is cramped, and it can be a long wait during prime hours. If you do end up having to wait a bit, PLEASE do not go next door for Cuban. That place is so bad, but I'll save the explanation for another time.  Prices for Caro Mio aren't wacky either...pretty reasonable. Bring a bottle of something and have a great time.
