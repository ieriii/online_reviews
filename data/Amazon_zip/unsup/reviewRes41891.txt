I have to take a moment to highlight a Chicago restaurant, one of the best dining ambiance/stuffing myself with exceptional food experiences I've had in a while. Okay, it was a lot to do with the fact that it was my birthday when I dined here, but that makes it more significant because no one wants to be at a crappy restaurant when they go out for their birthday. Leaving this place, I had a sensation that I usually only feel after eating a Thanksgiving meal. And every bite was worth it, even though I was full to the brim. As for the ambiance, at first when I walked in, it felt like my eyes were trying to adjust to the darkness much like going to a movie theater, but after they did, the space became a place of wonder with magical food. Candle light danced across my glistening food so savory that the three people I dined with ate our meals family style even though the dishes weren't intended for that. Before I visited Chicago, I remember reading reviews for this place on Yelp. I recall seeing one review in particular that had a photo of a woman with a big smile on her face and a giant piece of cake in front of her. I knew that's the look I wanted to have on my face for my birthday; I can happily say it was achieved. The dessert, also shared family style, was something the chef invented I'm sure out of pure happiness. It was a mouth watering orange pound cake with French butter cream, raspberry preserves, and orange syrup. Decadent, does not even begin to describe this dish. I need invent a new adjective ... decadelishsty!!! I have love for Gilt!
