Sunday brunch, our last meal before returning back to NYC. Friend who we stayed with recommended this place. Said that this place offers very decadent and heavy dishes but they have a plethora of healthier options too. I opted for the multi grain pancakes with honey and berries, side of chicken sausage (I need protein in every meal) since I had just spent an entire weekend gorging. Sausage was a wonderful savory companion, flavorful, tasty. The pancakes were a little dry and I wish they were more liberal with the honey! Got an itty bitty drizzle on them although if there was more honey then that would negate the healthful effects of the the multi grain pancakes? Who knows, I just know it wasn't enough. The friend ordered the strawberry stuffed french toast. Although I didn't have a bite, the dish looked phenomenal. Also bordered on deadly since it looked like it could kill you instantly with the amount of mascarpone and custard. "Bigger is better" seems to be Chicago's motto. Would come back and try out their avocado smoothie(I like unconventional things), honey cakes, breakfast quinoa, and vegan pancakes. Great brunch spot!
