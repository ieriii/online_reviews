I decided to give Crisp another chance. I mean after all, there must be a reason why there's so many positive yelp reviews........ I got the bibimbop. It's decent. But the fact that it doesn't come with other sidedishes like any half-decent korean restaurant kinda ruins the whole experience, not to mention they messed up on the rice again. OVERALL I'm 100% convinced this place is the CHIPOTLE of KOREAN food: not quite korean food but close enough to fool the general population, but pretty tasty and definitely popular with the white folks. (my friend got the seoul sassy chicken. I think seoul sassy is the worst sauce on the menu and the chicken quality is still subpar)
