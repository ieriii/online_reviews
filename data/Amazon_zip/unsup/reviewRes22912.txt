Can't believe that it's been a whole year after my trip to Costa Rica, and I'm only now discovering Irazu! A small space in Bucktown, this restaurant has a very authentic vibe. The food was great and was exactly how I remembered it on my trip (got the tico chicken - rice/beans and plantains - my fav). It's BYOB - so great with a group as well. They have a fabulous patio that I can't wait to revisit when it warms up. We didn't wait long and the service was pretty good (although, because it's small, you can kind of hear everything everyone else is saying, especially... the loud table of 10 girls next to us..yeah.. you know who you are)!  I found out they deliver to my hood so I can get my fill of Costa Rican cuisine anytime I need my fill or simply want to pretend I'm still on vacation (sans beach and hammock)! As the locals would say, Pura Vida!
