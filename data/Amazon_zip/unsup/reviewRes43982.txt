I think the food is mostly mediocre and we probably wouldn't go there but its near where we live. They never change the menu either so it gets really boring. If you go there, the best bets are the yogurt and granola, the huevos rancheros and their baked goods. The reason I am only giving them 2 stars rather than 3 is that the staff is sullen and unpleasant. A better attitude would go a long way.
