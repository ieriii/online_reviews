I arrived here with a party of four at 7pm on a Saturday night. We were finally seated a quarter before 10. Yes, we waited for almost three hours. Its really a shame they don't take reservations.  This place is small, packed, and crowded. Big emphasis on crowded. Most tables are communal so you are smashed up against other parties. I can't wait to come here during the summer when they offer outdoor seating. Our server informed us that a couple dishes were sold out for the night. Big bummer. I was looking forward to the fried prosciutto bread balls. Anyway, we still managed to order a whole lot from the menu. I recommend the fried pig's ears, octopus with green beans, and my absolute favorite dish of the night- milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. yum yum yum. The pork shoulder just melts in your mouth.  I had a great time at this place, despite the long wait. I've learned my lesson and will arrive well past the dinner rush hour. Food was simple and delicious and well priced. Nine dishes, two desserts, and 2 glasses of wine each, with tax and tip we paid around $50 each. Not bad, not bad at all for all that food and fun.
