Yolk is, by far, my favorite Chicago brunch location. The crowds can sometimes be a bit much, but if you come early (before 9:30am) on a Saturday or Sunday, you can beat them. I've never been disappointed with anything I've eaten at this restaurant. And my favorite part? They have flavored coffee creamers (a rare find in a Chicago brunch location).
