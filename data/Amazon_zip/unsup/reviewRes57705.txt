Opened in 1962 by the Gutierrez family, Nuevo Leon offers a wide variety of authentic Mexican dishes that are sure to please anyone. Their menu is well balanced with choices of flavorful chichen, steak, and seafood dishes as well as many other traditional Mexican meals. If you like an appetizer before you main course, I suggest their flavorful QUESO CON CHORIZO. This wonderful dish sports chihuahua cheese cooked with onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers topped with their homemade mexican sausage, served on a hot plate with fresh flour tortilla chips. There is a lot to choose from for your main course. The BURRITO DE CARNE ASADA is fantastic and FLAUTAS DE POLLO will make your taste buds go wild! For desert, you must try their FLAN; its tasty and original and some of the best I've ever had. If you are looking for a great Mexican restaurant look no further. Nuevo Leon one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants Chicago has to offer!
