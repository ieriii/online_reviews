It looks like your average Latin restaurant, but Rick Bayless drizzles your meal with magic before he serves it to you. Perfect guacamole. Tantalizing Tocolo margaritas. My date had the Marisquera de Lujo, and I had the Catch of the Day. A-maz-ing. And that was just lunch. Can't wait to go back for dinner.
