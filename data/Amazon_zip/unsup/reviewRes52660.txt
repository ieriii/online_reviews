This restaurant is awesome! The food is very delicious!! The salad bar is great, too. They have a wide variety of cheeses, pasta dishes, breads, etc! The service is awesome! Not to go without mentioning- the waiters are all very handsome!:) I went there last December with my sister for dinner. If I visit Chicago again, I'd definitely go there again! Definitely take metro or a taxi to this restaurant, parking is limited because of the restaurant's location.
