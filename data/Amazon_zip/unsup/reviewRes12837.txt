Amazing!! We went here recently with a guest from out of town and loved the whole experience. Great atmosphere - wonderfully decorated, friendly staff, great drinks at the bar since we were early for our reservation and a great location. There was even a trapeze artist in the wine cellar. We started at the salad bar (which I could live on forever!). You must get the lobster bisque. I would get bins of this stuff if they sold it! The salad bar was robust and delicious. Everything from mozzarella/tomatoes to sushi. Drinks were wonderful. The sommelier was attentive and great at recommendations. The Conundrum he suggested was outstanding. Our server was very accommodating and made sure the whole team of servers were showing us the service we desired. After salad bar they bring on the meats. As soon as your card is flipped to green there are at least 3 servers at your table. Everything was great, but our favorites were the chicken wrapped in bacon and the steak. Go here right now. And go hungry!! It's worth it!
