I was pleasantly surprised with the Silversmith Hotel. Our double bed room was very large compared to most downtown Chicago hotels I've stayed in. The beds were very comfortable and the room/bathroom was clean and well maintained. The front desk staff was very friendly as well. Millennium Park was just a couple of blocks away & the hotel is located just steps from a subway line. It made getting around town very convenient! The price was excellent for staying in the heart of downtown Chicago for 3 nights!  I would definitely stay again!
