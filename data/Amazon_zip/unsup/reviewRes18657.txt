I'll start this party off by saying I did not try their food. Now that's out of the way, here we go! The beer selection is pretty good... both bottles and on tap. Prices are ok... nothing really amazing, not too expensive either. Nothing to complain about here. On the other hand, the decor seems just a little too... forced. I'm generally not a fan of places that come off as calculated or themey (not that the Bad Apple is technically themey) but there is a whole lotta red going on in this place and it's a little too overwhelming.  The space is very nice overall, it's just a little too bourgeois for my ilk. Totally average when all is said and done, not really what the neighborhood means. Will Half Acre please open a tap room?
