Yes, it was THAT good.My friend and I have a weird obsession with pancakes. We love them. We talk about them all the time. Heck, I even bought my friend a pancake magnet as a souvenir when I visited South Carolina recently. Obsess much? Saturday morning, we made our way to the Wicker Park location of The Bongo Room and waited outside patiently for a seat. The sun was shining brightly and our pale faces needed to see the light of day... me especially. After a short wait, we got our seat located at the bar and thus began our flapjack journey. Our waiter was incredibly sweet and accommodating and he even smiled and pretended to laugh along with our witty banter. Friend opted for the Orange-Ricotta hotcakes which were served with fresh strawberries and gingersnap brown sugar butter. Yum! She loved them. I went for something slightly more decadent. When in Rome, am I right? I indulged in White Chocolate & 4 Berry Cheesecake Flapjacks. Ummm yes, please! The pancakes were fluffy and very flavorful. The sauces were in a word... amazing. The berries that topped my pancakes were the freshest berries I've had in a long time. Everything was perfectly executed and trust that when I tell you that I tasted heaven, I am not exaggerating by much. I will definitely be back.
