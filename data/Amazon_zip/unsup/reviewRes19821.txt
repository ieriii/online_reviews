Decent food for brunch, very good service.  I have only been here a couple of times and only for brunch.  Brunch will run you from 10-20/person and you will be able to choose from slightly fancied versions of standard breakfast/brunch dishes.  I think the food is decent, but it is nothing special. For the value, I can only rate it 3 stars. I will note that the service and atmosphere are both worth noting positively.  Service is always quick and attentive.  The atmosphere and decor is pretty upscale.
