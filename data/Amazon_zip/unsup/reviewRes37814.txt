Somehow we got lucky and a nice couple gave us there table as they were leaving at 6:30 on a Saturday night-and the place was packed. Otherwise we might have just turned around and found someplace that wasn't swarming with people- Beers were awesome- I'm not a huge beer gal but I loved the lef blonde and the triple carmelite(sp?) Both were quite tasty...and strong too! The mussels were delicious as were the frites-I'm a sucker for dipping frys in any kind of "aoili"(basically anykind of mayo with garlic and you can call it that:) And OH yeah! The escargot was phenomonal! Buttery salty garlicky goodness! CB and J with mac n cheese? Quite a bit overated, it's a SANDWICH people- get over it! Boyfriends monkfish was really good though... Conclusion: Love the loud fun place... Stick to app's and beer - you really won't even need an entree-everything is quite filling
