Come for the beer, stay for the food. The steak was great and if I am not mistaken, about $10. The sausage plate is a definite winner. But forget all that, this place is in my top three locals in Chicago. Not so local to my neighborhood, but well worth the trek. Be prepared to stand, though. Edit 2/24/06 Returned for a birthday dinner here. Holy crap the onion rings are great! And I hate onion rings. They are so thin and nicely fried that there is no stinky onion juice dripping down or onion smell lingering. They are like french fries! A must get.
