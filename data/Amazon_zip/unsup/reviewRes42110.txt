If you want a table, make a reservation. Walk-ins only have access to the lounge and bar areas. The food was very good, as were the drinks. The bar has a speak-easy feel to it, and the cocktails are very well made, with awesome presentation. The food: I ordered a shrimp cocktail, balsamic roasted garlic on toast, gnocchi and pork belly with braised kale. All of them were tasty, and I would certainly order them again (if I wasn't interested in everything else on the menu). 5 of 5. Ambiance: Very unique. The lighting is awesome (you'll see what I mean) and the lounge seating where we sat was comfortable and relaxing. With the exception of Foghorn Leghorn at the table next to us, the noise level was active but not over the top. 5 of 5. Service: At the bar was fast, pro, polite and jovial. Just what you'd hope for. Our server in the lounge was slow, but it was also a Friday night and relaxing in the lounge after a meal with a glass of wine wasn't the end of the world. My girlfriend's wine was incorrect, but they fixed it immediately. 3 of 5. Overall I would absolutely return here, and definitely recommend it to a friend, but not to anyone in a rush. Take your time, enjoy your food and the atmosphere, and relax.
