I'm personally shocked that I've lived here for almost 2 years and haven't written this review yet! WTF So moving along, Mayan Palace is a concrete jungle where dreams are made of. My girlfriends and I used to love doing Thursday night dinners here with their half of margs special. I am not a huge margarita drinker but theirs are phenomenal, not too sweet and just strong enough that you barely can taste the tequila but 2 glasses and you're donzo. As for food (yes yes liquid diners are no bueno), the chips & salsa are always delicious, and I've never heard of anyone not like their meal here, it's always a safe bet. I usually grab a quesadilla supreme, fajitas or tacos and they're pretty good. The service here is great, waiters are ALWAYS sweet and accommodating.
