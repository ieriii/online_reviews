Burger/Beer nirvana! The Bad Apple offers a beautiful atmosphere dimly lit with red gum drops hanging from the cieling. Maybe their apples, but either way, I find a drinking/dining experience to be more enjoyable under red lights. The bar is beautiful, and stocked with a multitude of beers that you don't typically find at other local restaurants/watering holes. I was beyond excited to see Frambois on tap. (perfect night cap). The menu consists of a choice of about 8-10 gormet burgers. I had the Bad Apple Burger (provolone, lettuce, tomato, and onion). It was cooked to perfection.. a great char on the outside, and bloody on the inside, just the way I like em'! The fries were fresh cut, crispy, golden brown, and delicious. They offer unique appetizers without overwhelming you with over complicated crap. We had fried cheesecurds... I understand it's pretty hard to destroy deep fried cheese, but these curds... MAN oh MAN! The batter was like tempura, very light and crisp, and the cheese melty and salty. Amazing. I can't wait to head back for another beer and burger Friday night. I love you bad apple. You had me at hello.
