We finally came here for our second year anniversary. One of the most remarkable and inventive meals that I've ever had.  We did the smaller tasting menu, 12 course with wine pairing. It took about three hours. The sommelier was a highlight -- he had a story for each wine that was witty and interesting. I would say we liked 11 out of the 12 wines with 4 that we loved. The experience was orchestrated to every detail by a great waitstaff. The food was beyond my expectations of molecular gastronomy as it truly had the perfect blend of imagination, taste and presentation.
