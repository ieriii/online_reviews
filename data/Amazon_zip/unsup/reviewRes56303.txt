reasonable prices and great food!my birthday was here last weekend, crowded night and their dining room was filled to the brim. we had to wait a bit but it wasn't too bad. my party was given free little finger foods while we waited in the bar area. we then proceeded to the dining room, all our food came out on time. i had the beef short ribs. delicious! in the end we were given free crispy fried bananas with ice cream on the side and turned off all the lights when my birthday cake was brought in. 5 stars for awesome place, great food and knows how to treat a birthday girl :)
