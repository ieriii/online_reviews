Love it, love it, love it! I just moved to the Wicker Park neighborhood after living in Lake Merritt Oakland for two years, and was very spoiled on fresh veggies and high quality food. Needless to say, I feel like Milk and Honey has a very Bay Area feel to it. I have to admit I have eaten here 3 time in the last month. The sandwiches are awesome, and are served with homemade (i think) chips and a spiced pickle spear. The breakfast is incredible too. The prices are right for the quality food you get.
