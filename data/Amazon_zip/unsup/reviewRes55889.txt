If I could give 3.5 stars I would. I don't know if this restaurant is owned by the same people who run the India house in Oak Brook but this is clearly the inferior of the two. The weekend lunch buffet is $16.95+ drinks in Chicago and about $10.95 with drink in Oak Brook. Considering the Oak Brook location is far superior in not only selection, (double the buffet size/specifically Lamb choices) but in quality I do not think the %54 mark up to eat in River North is justified. I suppose this can be explained by the fact that the Western Suburbs are home to thousands of Indians and Oak Brook has numerous Indian restaurants and the competition drives down prices. River North on the other hand is full of tourists and rich yuppies most of whom are not Indian. Moreover, India House is the only upscale Indian place I can think of in that area.
