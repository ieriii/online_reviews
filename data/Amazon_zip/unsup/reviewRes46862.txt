This place kills me. It makes one of my favorite things in the world- the Neal Cassady Coffee in a BOWL no less- and still can't wrestle five stars out of me. Why must the service be so crappy? Why must most of the entrees be suspiciously overpriced? Why must there be a ton of kids on there every single damn time I'm in there? Seriously, the food is always great-- last time I was there, I did a duck two ways dish that was SUPERB-- but the service stinks. It is rare that I forego dessert after a long leisurely dinner. After waiting 15 minutes for the menu so I could even peruse my choices, I had had enough. :( I will try your other location for now...
