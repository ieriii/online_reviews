I had been to FDC before. I was excited to bring a few friends, and had been chatting up the place for a few weeks. We got in quickly with reservations. The waiter was not interested in us at all, he never made eye contact with us. The salad bar is really great. Do try the basil dressing, its amazing. The meat was very good. I suggest the lamb...I never liked it before, but the chops were great!!! I was impressed, I came back fron the salad bar and went to sit down and a random waiter pushed my chair in for me...never saw him again. Over all the group I brought enjoyed their meal, we had a nice time, the drinks were great...would I go back again? Maybe. Our server was more concerend with pushing drinks than how our dinner was. Kudos to the guys who actually work...the gouchos with the meat.I'm sure it was a bad night, but we are pretty positive the potatos were instant. No one said a thing until the drive home. I thought they tates peticularly bad, but didn't say a word to the other diners because iwas embarassed. But they were instant, and now I'm mortified! We had a $700 tab, and ate instant potatos...shame on us for not saying anything.
