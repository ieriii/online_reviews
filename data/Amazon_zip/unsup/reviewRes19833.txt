$12 for a torta? Only if it's made at Rick Bayless restaurant. The Cubana was amazing. Topped off with a churro dipped in their homemade vanilla soft serve and I was in heaven. A small, but nice selection of local microbrews and a hostess that was very accommodating. They forget half of our table's desserts, but made up for it with a plate of churros on the house. There's nothing fancy going on here, just delicious food. For what it's worth, I wasn't completely blown away by the guacamole, but the house made chips were light and crispy.
