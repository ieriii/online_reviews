A greasy spoon with the menu covertly replaced by an elite squad of hippie foodie shock troops. Not entirely as fulfilling as the traditional 4,000 calorie diner gutbomb but you're also able to do things with your day after leaving. Kudos for lots of options depending on your level of vegetarianism/veganism. For example: I'm a level 5 vegan. I don't eat anything that casts a shadow.
