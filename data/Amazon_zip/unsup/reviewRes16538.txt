Unexpected find in the west loop after drinks at nearby Lumen just down the street. Walked in and somehow seated the 4 of us at a table up front by the bar, though we peeked back in to the main dining room which was both cavernous and theatrical. Just looking for nibblies, here's what we had: - Guacamole "Kleiner Style" - not sure what made this "Kleiner" but it was pure guacamole, with little else added. On the bland side. - Mixto ceviche - prepared well with plenty of calamari and tuna. This was a risk but worth it. - Local squash with maple butter and pecans - Slightly sweet but more so from the maple butter. Nothing spectacular. Food was average but the festive ambiance and decor was a sure sight amidst an otherwise quiet neighborhood.  Staff was quick with the check and a bit over attentive, but good at keeping the drinks coming.
