As always, incredible service and even better food & drink! Now, I'm a fan of dining at the bar: better service, better chatter, more attention. The service at Longman & Eagle is always superb. The bartender on this particular day recommended the Bloody Larry (Lawrence) since I had been mentioning how I dig me some whiskey - this was a corn-whiskey bloody (Larry) and really hit the spot.  The compliment to my bloody larry? Oh, just a ridiculously delicious Chicken & Waffles with crazy-licious potatoes. They use a sous vide to slow-cook that bad boy and keep it juicy while maintaining the incredibly crisp taste. I highly recommend checking this place out. Supremely good.
