Place has been going downhill lately. Was very excited when the place first opened - awesome decor, great beer menu, and the all-organic, non-factory farmed meat was a huge plus. These factors are still the case, and, taken by themselves, would earn 4-5 stars for this place if it were not for one thing: The kids! Who brings kids to a bar?! The past couple of times I have been here, the place has been swarmed with children, and the waitress said that this has been the case for a while now. I understand that Lincoln Square is a very kid-friendly neighborhood, but there needs to be a line. Screaming toddlers and kids running all over the place completely destroys the atmosphere of a quite clearly adult themed restaurant.
