I'm so conflicted about Big Jones. We had a great dinner here a couple of months ago--rabbit confit with noodles and a very flavorful roasted fish--which was obviously so good that I actually remember what we ordered weeks later. So we returned for brunch recently and had indifferent service and mediocre food. After being seated, it took so long for us to even get water that I asked the hostess if we had a server, and then it still took several more minutes for us to actually see said server; it did not improve from there. Of the food we got, the beignets and the pork terrines were both quite tasty, but both of our popovers were overcooked and some of my potatoes were actually burned. The eggs and meat were fine, which--isn't cooking eggs correctly harder than not burning potatoes? I considered sending it back, but our server was so MIA and the food so slow to begin with that it wasn't worth the bother. So I'm on the fence and I'm not really sure which is real Big Jones. We'll probably return since our dinner experience was so good, but I would certainly not go back for brunch.
