I was really looking forward to trying Garcia, unfortunately, disappointed. We went on a Friday night around 8pm-prime weekend night out. The service left a lot to be desired. Hostess asked 4 times while we waited in the bar for a table, how many of us there were. Wrote it down, but apparently couldn't remember or didn't read her previous notes. Once seated, only received 2 menus. When we asked for 2 more, we were greeted as if we were pestering the help. Appropriate # of menu's arrived without a word and simply plopped down on the table. We accidentally knocked a drink over (tall stemmed glass-pointy menu-tiny table), and while the drink ran down the table onto the floor, 3 waitstaff walked past without saying a word or looking in our direction. We apologized.....you could have heard crickets chirp. Waitress was nice enough and thorough. Food was ok, nothing to write home about. Lighting was a bit cafeteria like, the place lacked ambiance big time - how about some cheap candles and scones on the walls? Lincoln Square is a pretty upscale location. This place looks great, but needs a serious "sophistication face lift" in both help and environment. There are a LOT of options in that area, won't make this mistake again.
