First off, I am a huge fan of the pan pizza. Carmelized cheese is a quick route to my heart. The service can be variable, but is mostly attentive and friendly, and perpetrated by a host of cleverly t-shirted hipster kids (as opposed to the moneyed, less-tattooed and more brand-conscious older variety). I am a sucker for anywhere that can simultaneously provide me with a personal size pan pizza & a beer, as well as recall shined-up, halcyon-days memories of my own collegiate pizza-joint-working past -- for less than five bucks. And it's close to my house. A good option before or after a flick at Webster Place.
