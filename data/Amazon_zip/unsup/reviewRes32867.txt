One of my favorite vegan restaurants of all time. I'm one of those vegans who do it out of ethical reasons but miss the taste of meat...and this place satisfies those cravings without compromising my ideals. Amazing soy meat options, delicious desserts and milkshakes. I like their sandwiches (reuben, philly cheez steak, roast beef and cheddar) and appetizers (artichoke-spinach dip). and cheesecakes! wow!
