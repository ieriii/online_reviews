Simple word, Marvelous. Me & a couple of friends are usually out late night and tried Lahore last year for the first time at around 2:00am. Being as hungry as I was, I ordered a Full Chargha and WOW, was that thing delicious. In fact writing this review is reminding me of that Fresh, Juicy, Spicy & delicious **Chargha**. Its the best you buck can buy here in Chicago if your looking to eat some thing spicy and with true Lahore flavor. The service is not the best but is good enough to order some food and the place in not on main Devon so its easy to find parking and nor is it too crowded inside. Well atleast not at 2 in the morning lol but definitely give it a shot especially if you like spicy food.
