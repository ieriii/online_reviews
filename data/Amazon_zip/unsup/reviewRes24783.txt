I must commend this place on the 'ambiance' - very upbeat, inviting, party-ish. Great place to enjoy a few drinks and eat some food with friends. The 3 stars are for poor service. We arrived at the restaurant at 7:15pm, and were not seated until 9ish. Granted, we had a party of 7, but instead of placing 2 tables together, they waited for 2 consecutive tables to become open. The waiter was rude, and unaccommodating. Despite the reviews on Yelp, I found the food to be so-so. Not deserving of any hype.
