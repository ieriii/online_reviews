Great food, dedicated employees, neighborhood gem...And for the one who left a review questioning the authenticity, I challenge you to a duel! The family who runs this awesome joint are 100% Costa Rican... So what if some dishes are slightly different 2200 miles away?! If all restaurants prescribed to a set of recipes that doesn't change from restaurant to restaurant, then there would be only one large Japanese restaurant, one large Italian restaurant, one large Costa Rican restaurant, etc., to choose from in Chicago.I personally love it when owners switch it up a little bit to put their own flare on the menu. Kudos to Irazu for being AUTHENTIC in their own right!
