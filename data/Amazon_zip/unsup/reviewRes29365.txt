WOW, what a great place for Thai!! Off the Western brown line stop and only a two block walk from home, I'm very lucky. Not sure the food is the most "authentic" Thai cuisine possible, but I will tell you I have never eaten a bad thing from Opart. The Crab Rangoon are THE BEST I have ever had! I usually go for a curry and man is it spicy, mmmmmm, even the "medium". The Pad Thai is also quite good as well as the spring roll apps. Chef definitely recommends for a happy tummy!
