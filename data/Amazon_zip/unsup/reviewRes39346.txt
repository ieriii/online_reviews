The last time I went for Korean BBQ was at Cho Sun Ok, and that was a much better experience for me. When we were seated, our whole group wasn't here yet so the waitress didn't take our order. However, we wanted tea in the beginning and she never brought it. It's understandable that she waited until our entire party arrived but when we tried to flag her or the other waiter down a couple times, they seemed to busy themselves doing other things. The beef and pork that we ordered were great. We got more side dishes here than at Cho Sun Ok, like seaweed and mini korean pancakes with egg rolls. The tempura (fish cake, my favorite) was better at the other place though. We only got two servings of beef and a serving of pork for 5 people and left pretty satisfied. That came to $65, or about $16 each with tip. Not bad!! I think I'd stick with Cho Sun Ok in the future though.
