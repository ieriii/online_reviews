My husbands law firm had their x-mas party here, cute place, they had the room upstairs, which was nice. Its a nicer bbq place and the place is very nice, looks like a home from the outside! Very cute! I am not really into BBQ food, and I usually get a veggie meal and I had the most amazing pasta dish here! It was soooooooo good, very flavorful, served hot not room temperature, usually if you order a veggie meal it sits under a heat lamp and its usually a bland pasta dish! I did have some of the sides, mac and cheese was good, not amazing but good, acorn squash was good, I am not a big fan of squash that is sweet, but it was good, and I think we had a 3rd side and I cant remember what it was. I did like the salad. The drinks are whiskey based-their specialty drinks are I should say, they were good but I do like a vodka based martini vs whiskey. Oh and the shrimp with the lemon grits was pretty good too, that was one of the apps. Fro dessert there was a choc mousse tart, which was good but the bottom tart part was thick and hard to get into with your fork.
