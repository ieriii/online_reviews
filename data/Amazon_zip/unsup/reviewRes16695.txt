I went to the Violet Hour to meet up with some friends. They were finishing up their drinks by the time I got there (it took me a while to find the building since there's no sign). I stayed for about a half hour and didn't order a drink so I can't comment on the drinks but the ambiance was very nice. It is dark, pretty quiet and no cell phones were allowed. The chairs are awesome and very tall, I wish I could have one in my house. The place intrigued me and next time I am in Chicago I will be stopping in for a drink or three.
