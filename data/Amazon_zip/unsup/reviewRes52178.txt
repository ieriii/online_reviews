Be prepared to wait and you wont be dissapointed. There are 3 deep dish places that need to be visited in the city. This is one of them. They open at 11, if you get there on time, you can get a table. It takes 45 mins for a deep dish to cook so if you want to eat at 12 its a perfect plan, no lines. THe pizza was incredible. The sauasage (pick thick) was amazing, and it defintiely lived up to my expectations- comparable to Lou Minnatis. Great atmosphere and location, a bar to drink while you wait. Cant miss if deep dish is what you want! A little pricey- medium sausage was 36$ and pitchers were 16$ but I guess thats to be expected in the city! Dont bother with anything but the pizza, not worth the money.
