For those of you who don't want to get caught up in the hype - This place is the yuppies trendy hot dog stand. There is nothing special about this place. Its costly the fries taste burnt/ Let alone that stupid fois de gras. Yuppy snobs. The line is excruciating most days and you are very lucky to find a spot to sit down. I really was hoping for better
