Once again Graham Elliot puts it out there and doesn't disappoint! I've been frequenting this restaurant/bar for about a year now..The food is amazing and the service is very personal. They really make you feel at home. Great neighborhood after work bar as well..very laid back environment but some not so laid back drinks. It's a must try if you haven't already!
