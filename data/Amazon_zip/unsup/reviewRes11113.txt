If there was a pizza that all other pizzas were jealous of, Piece Pizza would be it. I've been eating here for four+ years, converted dozens of friends to Piece addicts, and even considered moving to WP just to be closer to Piece (dammit, deliver!)- it really is that good.  White with chicken, garlic and jalapenos; move over Chuck Norris, this pizza is kicking ass and taking names.
