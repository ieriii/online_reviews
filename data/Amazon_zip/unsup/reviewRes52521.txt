A combination of Ponderosa and Ruth's Chris. Seriously amazing meat and the best salad bar imaginable (ceviche? oysters? kind of gross, but somehow working for them). Bizarre wine titration devices, Columbians posing as Brazilians, weird rules with colored chips and little tweezers for helping take off the meat. I got drunk on meat, and now I have a meat hangover. I would only come back with a big group with a ton of cash looking for a novelty restaurant.
