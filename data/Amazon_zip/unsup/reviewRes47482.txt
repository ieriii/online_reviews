Just ordered delivery.. I think maybe going there would have been a better idea! The girl who took the order was super friendly.. she said the guy would be over in about 15.. so he calls me 20 mins later and askes what my address is?! So im thinking my burger is not going to be remotely warm since hes late and doesnt know where to go.. ya about 20 later he shows up. The burger was cold, med-well (ordered med-rare!) So it was all not hot, but fries were tasty. Unfortunately after microwaving to warm it up, i dont like cold food, it just was not good. I threw it away after like 3 bites.... boo! Fries were good, although no sauce that i read about. I guess thats what i get for ordering delivery, and maybe ill try again but go there this time!
