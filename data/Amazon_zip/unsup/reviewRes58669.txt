My husband and I really wanted to like this restaurant. We have been wanting to try it for a long time, and then we saw a groupon for it, so we jumped at the chance. We started with the yummy warm bread, and the delicious beet soup. So far so great. But then, the very loud, annoying owner entered the restaurant. I kept hear him saying loudly, THEY LIKE MY FOOD! THEY LIKE MY FOOD! He was going to every table asking if they like his food. So he reaches our table. For some reason, he didn't ask us if we like his food. He asked us if we had a coupon or something. So we said, yeah, we had a groupon. So he says, did you make a reservation? (clearly annoyed) My husband told him we did not, but informed them upon entering the restaurant that we had a groupon, and if we needed to call ahead. Being a Tuesday night, and not the least bit crowded, the hostess said no problem. We informed the owner of this, and he proceeded to SCOLD us for not making a reservation. WOW!! That was a first for us. Although we thought the veal paprikash was very good, the short ribs were just average - we would never ever ever return to this man's establishment. Shame on him for treating paying customers like that. (It was still not cheap, even with the groupon. our bill for the two of us was $45 dollars additional!! Very weird annoying man who likes everyone to know who the owner is, and THAT THEY LIKE MY FOOD!
