Yummy! Liked the Bayless-at-a-cheaper-price option of this place. There was a line, but I was grateful for it, because everything on the menu looked delcious & I needed time to decide! Got the torta with the goat cheese & mushrooms - had them add carnitas to it. It was good - but maybe just a little too much goat cheese? (I know, I never thought I'd say those words) Also, I didn't adore the torta bread. There was a lot of it, and it was a harder type bread - kind of rustic, I guess? Heavy crust. I dunno. It was good, but honestly, I envied my friend's dish the whole time. SHE got the soup (Caldos) with pork belly. I love pork belly but thought, "why would i get a soup here?" Boy was I wrong. It was beautiful looking, and had avocados in it! She let me have a bite.  Anyway - loved the guac, loved the churros, loved the free sparkling water - I felt very classy pouring it for myself and adding a lime ;) Will be back for the Caldos! And for brunch sometime, too! Oh - one final thing, as busy as it was - the guy working the counter by the door made sure to shout a thank you to my friend & I when we left. I certainly didn't expect it - and it went a long way - you can tell they do service training.
