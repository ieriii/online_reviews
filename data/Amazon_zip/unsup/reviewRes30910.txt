WOW! I always liked this place, but I had SUCH a nice experience dealing with the staff here that I will come again and again.  My brother was proposing to his girlfriend, and we were trying to make arrangements for a Sat night at 7 p.m. and EJAY (I'm not sure that I spelled that right) was WONDERFUL! She went completely out of her way to speak to the manager and helped make this a wonderful night. Despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday, she made it happen! I wish everyone I dealt with in life was as smart and efficient! Mastro's has always been a great spot in Chicago (Two words: BUTTER CAKE!) but now it has even more special meaning. Great job!!
