excellent ambience and service...the choreographed waitstaff is something to see... that alone gets an extra star :) The food.. was good, but not great. The appetizer I had I wasn't a big fan of (jalepeno, avocado, apple, something) - it sounded like it would be good, but wasn't (presentation was nice, though). The entree was quite tasty , but you can't really go wrong with salmon. And the "sticky toffee pudding" dessert was DELICIOUS! (I know it sounds scary, but it wasn't at all.. it was really good). Overall, great atmosphere, but just good food. The 4 stars rating is not so much for the food (food would only get 3 stars), but mainly because Tru is far and away one of the best service/atmospheres you'll experience
