This place was HOPPIN! We went at 6pm on a Friday and could sit down- by 7pm the line stretched to the door. People take the BYOB thing seriously (more than one table had a cooler with them). The prices are more than reasonable, the food arrived quickly and was tasty, the ambience was lovely- a fun, active, diverse crowd. We will be back!
