My Aunt Arlene and her husband asked me where I wanted to go for my 50th Birthday Celebration, for me there could be no other choice but Wildfire. I love this place, from the moment you walk in the door there is this wonderful classic old world charm, dimly lit, a lovely bar area as well. We had reservations which definitely is a must for this very happening/popular place, every table and booth were filled tonight. We had a lovely booth and service from our server Jason was outstanding, Jason was a really funny guy, made us all laugh. So, I started off my evening with a Key Lime Pie Martini, it sounded so good but once we all tasted it, not so much.. Shouldda ordered my Miller Lite, cant go wrong with that one ever, It's a crowd pleaser every time. Wildfire's staple is definitely steak and for a great reason, I had Filet Mignon and my Aunt had Prime Rib both of which were tremendous. Had a nice caesar salad which I loved and some red skinned mashed potatoes which were very good and my Aunt Arlene shared some of her broccoli with me too.. Wildfire also has various other choices on the menu but really.. Steak or prime rib are the way to go here. Wildfire can be on the pricey side, be aware, depending on what choices you make. This meal/dinner with my family could'nt have been any better.. Oh, wait... actually it did get better when our server Jason brought me out a special chocolate molten lava birthday cake with a scoop of ice cream, hey, after all a girl only turns 50 once! So, a big Thank You to Wildfire for a great evening. To my Aunt and Jim I love you both dearly. What a wonderful way to start my celebration! 2 more days of partying to go..:)
