We went for a late breakfast and most of the restaurant was empty. They tried to seat us in a center row of seats next to another couple. I asked for a booth. They had many. The girl had an attitude about it.they did seat us there and within 10 minutes the section we were in had filled up. But the srvice ended up being terrible. Painfully slow. The only rwason they get a 3 is because the food was good. The place is beautiful, but the attitude was unacceptable and i would not eat here again.
