This place is adorable. Much spacious than I thought. The outdoor patio is just so romantic. I took Alexis, who's probably the most unromantic person I know. We ate proscuitto & figs, couple pasta dishes, couple glass of wine. That is the extent of what I remember. Generally, attractive people, good service, & greaaaattt suggestion for date night. Tis the season so hurry up and go before it's too late to sit outdoors for a nice dinner.
