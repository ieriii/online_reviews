Started out with a delicious Topolo Margarita and if I were you I would do the same. Then our table shared the guacamole and ceviche. Both were delicious. I had the Thursday special, lamb barbacoa cooked in a banana leaf. This had a great dark, roasty, chili sauce on it and came with a great side of mashed potatoes. But these aren't your typical mashed potatoes they had some sort of cheese in them with bits of potato skin. There were a container of corn tortillas to wipe up the sauce with and make mini tacos with if you wanted.  For dessert I had the grilled white cornmeal pound cake which came with maple crunch ice cream and blueberry sauce. The cake was not too heavy and had the lightest drizzle of cajete (goat milk dulce de leche). The real standout on the the plate was the ice cream which had these delicious chunks of brown sugar and buttery crumble pieces. And the blueberry sauce was sweet with a great balance of lemon to it. It was a great end to the meal. Overall a great restaurant. I am from out of town and was lucky to be able to eat here on my brief one night stay in the city. It has a great energetic vibe and is the perfect dinner location for both locals and city visitors! I will definitely be back the next time I am in Chicago. *this restaurant takes a limited number of reservations nightly. Someone in our group came to the restaurant at 5:30 to put his name on the list for a 7:30 seating. At 7:20 he received a call saying that his table was ready. What great service where a restaurant ACTUALLY delivers on what they say. That says a lot to the management and service.
