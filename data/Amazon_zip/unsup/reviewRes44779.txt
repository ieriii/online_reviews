3.5 stars. I thought Giordano's was the best thing I'd ever eaten. Then I tried Gino's deep dish pizza, and it blew Giordano's out of the water. Anyway, this was my third time at a Giordano's. I'm from out of town, and people have taken me here or it has been recommended every time. I have to say, the pizza is really good, but something about it isn't as flavorful as I would like. We got the ground beef and spinach stuffed crust pizza. I couldn't really taste the beef and the sauce and cheese are kind of bland. This time, the server was pushy and kind of rude also. So all in all it wasn't the best experience. I still think the pizza is better than most I've had, so I'll probably come back.
