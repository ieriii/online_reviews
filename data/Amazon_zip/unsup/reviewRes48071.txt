Went for Sunday Brunch and was lucky enough to have reservations. Wait was minimal and our table was great. They have a great selection of beer that is not on the Brunch menu so you have to ask for the full drink menu. I ordered the sirloin steak and I have to confess that it was NOT cooked properly. I asked for the steak to be mid-rare but the slices turned out to be a combination of medium to well done. The meat did not look to be cut from a single piece since there was such a variation in doneness. The egg on top of the dish was also overcooked. Barely a runny yolk and actually a big stiff, fully cured yolk sitting on top of the meat. The side of bacon was amazing and my GFs dish of pork shoulder was great but I cannot give more than 3 stars to a place that can't properly cook beef or and egg. The potential was there and everything else would make for a great experience but I just couldn't deal with such a big miss on the main dish.
