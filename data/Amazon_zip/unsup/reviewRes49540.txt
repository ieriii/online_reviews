I came here for a friend's birthday dinner, so it was a larger group on a Saturday... very packed! Our party shrunk in size so our table was rearranged to accommodate other tables, and we probably waited 15 minutes between sitting down to ordering drinks to appetizers to entrees. The staff was always friendly about the delays and threw in a free round of sangrias. We ordered the seafood sampler platter for the appetizer, and the baby octopus was wonderful! It had this great charred, smokiness about the flavor. The baby octopus out-shined the squid and shrimp, which were not charred but plainly grilled. Since the appetizer was so good, I ordered the octopus and skirt steak combo. Again, octopus was delicious. The skirt steak on the other hand, had great flavor and marinades, but was surprisingly not of good quality. It was very chewy and filled with ligaments more than meat itself. I couldn't tell you if it was or was not tender because I quite frankly did not have very much chewable meat. Luckily the plantains and yuca were delicious- one of my favs and very well done here- to bring the plate to an overall level of tasty. I would give Las Tablas another try but not on a weekend. I think this place has a lot to offer but would imagine it is much more enjoyable, in terms of both food quality and ambiance, when not as crowded.
