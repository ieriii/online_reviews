Thanks iphone Yelp app! We did a walk in on a Saturday night and got seated outside with no wait to enjoy the last dregs of sunlight on a hot day. We ate our way through most of the menu, all of which was good, and some of which was great. Wine is a bit overpriced but they have a decent variety to choose from. I'll defintely stop back here if trapped downtown for an extended period of time again.
