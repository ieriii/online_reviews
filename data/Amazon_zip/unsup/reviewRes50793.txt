The servers here were very friendly on the day that I visited, if a touch informal and way too unpolished. One of the owners was careful to introduce himself to me, to apologize that things so were hectic in the dining room, and to thank me for my business, though. That was appreciated. The burger, while good, was not the best I have had and it is three or four dollars too expensive for what you get. I am glad that I gave Big Jones a whirl, but I am unlikely to rush back for more.
