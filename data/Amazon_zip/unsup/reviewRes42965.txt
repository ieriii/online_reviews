After going to Curio a few times without eating at Gilt Bar beforehand, I realized that it was time to try the food. I was not disappointed. It was crowded and the tables are pretty close together but the food was tasty. I had a chicken dish which I enjoyed. For a side, my friend and I shared the brussel sprouts (always a favorite of mine) and cauliflower. Both were yum. I don't know if I was blown away by everything but I left very satisfied.
