My wife was very pregnant and today was our anniversary so I wanted to order take out from a nice place. This bar claimed they do accept take out but when I tried calling the number I just got an answering machine that then hung up. Needless to say this isn't very good customer service. If they don't make take out available they should update their yelp section. As for tonight, I will look at other options
