The food here is REALLY good. They don't take reservations and we got there at 8:50pm this past Saturday night and they said there was a 3-hour wait. LUCKILY 2 people were leaving from the bar seats so we jumped right in. Don't take a large party here unless you want to wait. But we were in the restaurant until almost midnight and it was pretty cleared out... meaning that it was more like a 1 hour wait, not 3 :) The pasta dishes are small. We ordered the one with Italian sausage in it as an appetizer to share. My boyfriend also ordered the truffle oil egg toast thing off the appetizer menu... I'm allergic to eggs so I couldn't taste it but he said it was AMAZING! The pasta was down right good too. It's all about the sauce with pasta and their sauce was real good. We both ordered the steak and arugula salad as our main dishes. The steak is seared in butter and the salad is very simple with olive oil, fresh grated parmesan cheese salt and pepper. Seriously DELICIOUS! We ordered a bottle of their dolchetto de alba to share. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Then for dessert we ordered some gelato and sorbetti. Can never go wrong with gelato or sorbetti at an Italian restaurant. This place is worth the trip, especially if you love Italian food. The place isn't traditonal in any means so don't expect white table clothes, candles and Frank Sinatra singing in the background.
