Update: The General Manager of Pasta Bowl contacted me via Yelp to troubleshoot the issue. I can now, in very good conscience, continue to patronize a delicious local resto in Chi.  Original Posting: Under normal circumstances I am a HUGE fan of Pasta Bowl. However, I was recently made to pay $17 for a single (delivered) order. After specifying on the phone that I would be paying in cash, the driver arrived with only $3 in cash. While I had no bills smaller than a $20, I was forced to pay almost double the amount of the meal in tip and furthermore, the pasta was ice cold. Very very disappointed in my most recent experience at an otherwise great place.
