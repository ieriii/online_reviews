This place looks super ghetto from the outside (it's like a big black box). it's right in my old neighborhood so we had decided to walk there one day. When we first approached it and saw the sign my fiance literally stopped in his tracks and dropped his jaw. I persuaded him to maybe let's just go in and see what it looks like. Once inside it was small, but nice. Appears to be a popular take out spot because lots of traffic picking up orders while we dined in. This place is BYOB, has some tasty apps and even tastier rolls. The only thing I don't like about it is some of the rolls are TOO big that you can barely fit them in your mouth to chew and enjoy them. We've been a few times now and learned to stick with the non-signature rolls that are so big. Great place, I'd def recommend!
