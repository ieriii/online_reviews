I used to live right around the corner from this place, and my boyfriend still does, so I frequent it quite often. Honestly, you'd be hard pressed to find a better pizza in the city. They serve thin, pan, and stuffed. All are good but I recommend the thin and the stuffed. It is the perfect amount of cheese, sauce and ingredients. I could go on and on about this pizza, but believe me, just try it, you won't regret that you did. They also have great specials everyday, as well as other meals to try. I am telling you, you won't find a better deal in the city. Most of their entrees come with a salad and bread (it's practically a whole roll of bread). Often times, my boyfriend and I will order the chicken parm special on Wednesday and an app to split. Twelve bucks and we have dinner for two, and we are stuffed afterwords. Another bonus, any order over $11 dollars they give you a free liter of pop! If you live around here and haven't tried it, you are doing yourself a disservice. If you don't live close, make the trip, you'll be happy you did.
