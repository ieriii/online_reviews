Hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Every meal I've had there has been incredible. I've even gone home and tried to replicate a few of the meals I've had there, being an amateur chef. The place is really cute, and the staff wonderful. I had a suprise dinner planned for my boyfriend and was giving him a wedding band...I contacted them ahead and they had everything ready for me...the table I requested, the champagne I ordered...it was perfect. I will come back here every chance I get. Excellent job guys!
