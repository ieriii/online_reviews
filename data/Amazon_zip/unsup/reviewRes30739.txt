It's time I update my Sunda review. I've been to Sunda more times than I can count, and I have yet to have a bad or even average experience. It is one of my favorite places in the River North area, in all of Chicago actually, and the one place I always recommend to friends, family and visitors. The space is gorgeous, trendy and cozy all at the same time (hard to say trendy and cozy together), and the different dining areas provide a different experience. The front lounge is casual, and the place my friends and I spend a lot of time in for Sunda Social (Drink specials & 50% off menu from 5-7, Mon-Fri). The dining area is lovely, more reserved, and the communal tables provide a friendly area to meet others if you're up for it. And if you want to see the Sushi chefs in action, there's the Sushi bar as well. The food is simply delicious. The rolls are creative and fresh, the kitchen items are authentic and well-executed. Everything is meant to be shared, so the entire dining experience becomes a new, great memory. My faves: [Cocktails]: Peared Sake & Chocolate Sensation [Rolls]: Lobster & Wagyu, Golden Child, Firecracker [Food]: Brussel Sprouts salad, Soup dumplings, Spicy Tuna on Crispy Rice, Oxtail potstickers, Adobo, Pork bao [Dessert]: The RIDICULOUS. And Taro Rice Pudding Always lovely service, great management, and a guaranteed great time. Definitely highly recommended.
