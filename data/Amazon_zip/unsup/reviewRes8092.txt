Very good Fogo. The house special with garlic, the leg of lamb, and the beef ribs were my favorites. The green drink with sugarcane rum is good, whatever it's called. The sides are excellent, but don't waste your time on that sissy crap. I love this place. But you might end up with the meat sweats. Also I was really expecting some swordfish, but they didn't have any. Wierd.
