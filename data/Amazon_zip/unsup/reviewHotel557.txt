White, White, White!! Love the decor Great staff Great night life in this hotel Good size rooms I agree... The water pressure is excellent. Everything is white and clean You get what you paid for :) However, we had an issue with the air conditioning... But, we just turn it off and on and done! TV didn't work properly. Will stay here again.
