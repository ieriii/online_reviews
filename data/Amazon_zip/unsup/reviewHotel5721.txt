I was in town on business and was pleasantly surprised when my office booked my room here. This hotel is beautiful and the rooms are nice. Big Plus.... it's in the heart of Greektown, Great food is just a short walk away ( I recommend Greek Islands) Dugan's Irish Pub is across the street on Halsted. Full bar with a great selection of Beers on tap.... This is a great place for drinks.
