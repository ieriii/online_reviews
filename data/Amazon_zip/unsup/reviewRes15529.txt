Downsides: The usual, long, wait Upsides: Everything else.  No name on the door -- super hard to find the place unless you know its there. Drinks are totally top notch and not too expensive at $12 each. Every employee in the place can tell you more about your drink than you could ever imagine.  The menu changes very frequently so don't expect to see the same thing twice. However if you do remember what you like they'll definitely make it again later. Food is OK, but this is not a place to go to eat. Just drink.  Bring a couple people from out of town, but don't go in groups larger than 4 or you'll never get a table.
