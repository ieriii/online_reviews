Been going for years. Went last weekend and the food was horrible. Their new spit-barbecued pork gyro was dry and the meat was burned. The combo Moussaka and lamb I had was sub-par, runny Moussaka and about 5 thin slices of leg o' lamb, probably not more than 2 1/2 ounces. 13 smackeroos for that. VERY disappointing. Waiter was OCD . . . Next time, I'm trying one of the others.
