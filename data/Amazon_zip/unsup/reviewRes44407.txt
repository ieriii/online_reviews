Almost stunning, too-cool-for-school dark wood decor with a DJ loudly spinning. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good. I got three different rolls--the Oedipus Roll, Emerald Roll, and a spicy scallop maki. The Emerald and spicy scallop rolls were okay, but cut too thick, and the Oedipus Roll was just too much--it's made with yellowfin tuna, and the consistency of the fish was really...chewy. I don't know how else to describe it. Overall, everything was also a bit...something like oily, but not exactly that. I wish it was still Valhalla, because they used to carry a very nice Cotes du Rhone. I think the owner's the owner of PingPong across the street, and the sole waitress there was great. I just wish the food matched the level of everything else.
