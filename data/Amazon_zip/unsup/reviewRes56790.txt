This is hands down the best pizza in the city. I know we all feel quite loyal to the classic Chicago deep dish, and while that is nice to put ourselves in a food coma every once in a while, Spacca's pizza will keep you craving and raving. It might seem a little pricey for a smaller pizza, but it's the price is erased after your first bite of delicious dough. The arugula and parm pizza will light your taste buds on fire. And the specials are always to be acknowledged. If you haven't tried this place, it's a must. Leave a little room for a shared dessert and you will be coming back for more as soon as possible.
