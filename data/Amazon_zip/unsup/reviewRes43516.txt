We arrived at 2:25pm on a weekend. Their breakfast is served until 2:30. You would think they would accommodate us, but no. Moreover, why not serve breakfast all day? After all, you are known for that and you are only open until the late afternoon! Lunch sandwiches were mediocre. Staff was unfriendly and rude. Good customer service means giving customers more than what the expect. Just never happened and I found this place to be overrated. Don't think I will go there again.
