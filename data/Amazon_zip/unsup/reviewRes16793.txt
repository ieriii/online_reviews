This is a solid bar with a genius concept. But... I don't like waiting in line for anything. They should take reservations. I also don't like paying $15 for a drink. Trust me, I get it. I work in one of the most infamous, douchebaggiest bars in the city where we charge $13 for a stupid martini. The combination of having to wait, and the expensive drinks is just a little overkill for me. That said, I love the fact that this place is nice and quiet, and your ears aren't ringing once you step outside. It's also great that everyone has a seat and no one is rushed out. Service is solid, drinks are tasty and ambiance is sexy. It's a good date place.  I just wish someone would take this concept and take it down a couple of notches. How about no line and cheaper drinks?? Don't worry, I'm not completely knocking Violet Hour, because there are plenty of other places where you could blow your whole paycheck on drinks and a night out, and I can honestly say that this is still once of the best bars of its type in Chicago.  If you were to ask me where to go on a night out, I wouldn't tell you to go to The Wit, or Soundbar, or Enclave (blah, blah, blah), I would tell you to get gussied up and go to The Violet Hour. Because if you're going to wait in line and spend some money, you may as well do it at some place that's actually good.
