Went here with a few friends after a concert and had an awesome time! Drinks were very fairly priced and the wait staff was friendly however lacked ingredients for some pretty basic shots (dirty girl scout and one other) and when we ordered kamikazes she asked if she could make us "something that tastes better" and we let her but she then charged us $6 for each mystery shot. There were lots of televisions with all different things on, upbeat Saturday night music and a fair amount of room to get your groove on :) Did not order any food however.
