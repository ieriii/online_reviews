By far one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Graham Elliot Bowels is on the cutting edge of gastonomy. He's creative, innovative and hands on! My fianc and I saw him a couple times make his way around the restaurant. He is very personable and approachable - was nice enough to take a pic with my fianc and I and wasn't the least bothered by it. The food: Roasted corn w chipotle jam and a garlic mushroom - wow! Duck breast - perfectly cooked, nice crunchy skin My fiance was having quite the party in his mouth over his steak. Desserts were playful and tasty! The ambiance is energetic and the service impeccable. Can't wait until we go back.
