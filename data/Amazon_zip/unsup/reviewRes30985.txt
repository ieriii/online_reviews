The day after going to Japonais, our group ended up at Sunda, which offered an interesting comparison in sushi and Asian food. While Japonais focused on Japan, Sunda was more pan-Asian. Lemongrass beef lollipops and indo corn fritters were fun and tasty. While the sushi was pretty decent, the rice was overcooked and not as well-seasoned as Japonais. Rolls fared better and the firecracker roll was a nice combination of spicy and sweet, crunchy and savory. The dining room is well-lit and surprisingly quiet, which offers a nice contrast to Japonais. Overall, the food while good still had a few basic problems. But if you are looking for pan-Asian in a stylish and fairly quiet dining room, Sunda will work.
