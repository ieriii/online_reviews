great music, food, drinks, most of all music. :) the music is really unique. I've heard them play stuff such as Bjork, The Postal Service...And they have art galleries there sometimes. Come there for a glass of wine with a great atmosphere, read a book, reflect, whatever. The food menu is great too - Pretty unique yet simple. They have stuff such as...Small plates like: Hummus (with toasted pita, cucumber, & carrots), veggie quesadillas, & crispy potatoes...Salads like: Grilled Calamari (with baby greens & roasted red peppers tossed with lemon juice & olive oil, tender spiced calamari)...Sandwiches like: Coronation Chicken Salad (with chicken, rice, curry, mango chutney, raisins, peas, apple and grilled on sourdough, whole wheat, rye bread or french baguette, & your choice of one side - homemade soup, salad, Potatoes O'Brien, hash browns, or fresh fruit)...(im not too crazy about chicken but other than that it sounds good)...and they serve breakfast all hours of operation.
