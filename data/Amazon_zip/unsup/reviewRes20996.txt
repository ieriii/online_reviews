I believe the term for this place is Gastro-Pub. Whatever it's called, the food is very eclectic and delicious. A large,clean and neat space off Michigan Ave. with an upstairs and downstairs bar, and an elevated dining area upstairs. Good place for a drink or three after work with a nice selection of beers, wine and cocktails. It does get loud though. I went before seeing Jersey Boys and really enjoyed everything I ate. The soup was a sweet potato puree with curry and some delicious calamari set inside the bowl. The salad with pumpkin seeds was good, but the elk I had for an entree was fantastic. Served as a saddle portion, this tender and sweet meat is truly something a carnivore should try. I'm looking forward to eating there again.
