i loved my stay here. my company put me up but i really have no complaints. Let me describe the best night i had there. After a hard day of working 11 1/2 hours, I went to their restaurant & bar. I had a Left Hand Brewery Milk Stout while they made me a patty melt with herbed french fries. I then took my patty melt to their 4th floor outdoor garden and ate under the stars while staring at the Sears Tower. It was quiet and relaxing and beautiful. Very good time.
