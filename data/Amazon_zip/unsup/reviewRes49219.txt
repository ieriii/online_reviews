i will have to come back for something other than just a cupcake and an italian soda. this place was very charming, although not necessarily because of the staff. does it really look like i'm from the suburbs? the cake display in the window looks amazing. i will have to think of an occasion for which i would need an outlandish cake. the display inside was reminiscent of a french pastry shop. even for the end of the day they seemed to have a good selection. i got a banana cupcake of some kind with carmel filling and creamcheese frosting. while the size didn't reflect the price, the taste did.
