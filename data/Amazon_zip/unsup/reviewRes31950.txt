Love this place!!! Good asian food, great flavor. Was a little under the weather the night that I went, but want to go back so badly so I can really get the flavor. It tasted amazing even with my taste buds altered, so I can't imagine what it's like when my taste buds are in full effect. Sushi has west coast freshness (I know live in Cali), but in the comfort of Chi-town. So much selection, will need a few trips back to experience everything.  Was not able to taste the cocktails, which my counterparts said were great...but was able to taste the tea selection. It was served in it's own tea pot with a side of honey. Bar area is swanky with big selection of spirits. Can't wait to go back.
