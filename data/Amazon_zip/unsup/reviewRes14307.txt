So. . .went again about 3 weeks ago, this time tried the sandwiches. Friend had the Cuban version of a "jibarito". LIterally dripping in grease. Seasoning was pretty good on the steak, but he actually had a line of grease (NOT juice) running down his arm that fell onto his pants. I had something different. Honestly, I had to think hard to try to remember what I had, it wasn't all that  -that's not a good sign. I had the Bistec sandwich. I remember thinking I could have made this at home. . Wasnt greasy-flavor not bad.  Meh. Had a dessert too-a type of cake with guave filling. Tad dry-maybe from the day before? Still so disappointed-wanted to go back and give it another try and see what would happen. Probably wont be back.
