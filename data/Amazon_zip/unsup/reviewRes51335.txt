I'm going to piggy back off of the other yelpers... -The restaurant is small. I agree, the place looks like a dive, but that's not necessarily a bad thing....is it? - I ordered the fish tacos, which were huge and reasonably priced. - They also serve breakfast all day. - Now here's the clincher... the margarita's. One word: WoW! Can we say mission accomplished!? - Parking is easy. - The women's restroom is old, but clean. Good place to grab some descent Mexican food and a good margarita!
