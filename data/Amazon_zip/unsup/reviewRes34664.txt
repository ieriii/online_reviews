Don't ever take a first date to Sushi X since the rolls are MEGA and true three-biters. Bring her on the 3rd date and she will love you for life. This places RULES! I'm not dining at "the X" for the everyday sushi staples; I'm going there for the Red Dragon roll with tempura shrimp, mayo, roe, sriracha, jalapeno, topped with spicy tuna and scallions, the White Tiger with tuna, hamachi, salmon, asparagus, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, jalapeno, scallions, tempura flakes, roe, lime-juice, with wasabi mayo and sriracha, the all-veggie Buddha roll, and others. You know a veggie roll must be darn good if it's being ordered by a bunch of carnivores. An ever-changing menu keeps things current and interesting. BYOB is always a nice touch too. Generous portions encourage group dining and friendly staff simply make this place work!  -Chowhound Chick http://chowhoundchick.bl
