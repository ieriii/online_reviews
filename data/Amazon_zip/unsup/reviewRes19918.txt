Yummy! My boyfriend and I live about a 10 minute walk away from this place and this is the first time it struck us to walk down here for dinner! Silly us! Anyways, we have been to the Coast in the South Loop and I had been to this location once before and it was as good as I remembered. We started off with the halibut carpaccio and it was to die for! It was so fresh and the flavor was like an explosion in your mouth! We then had the specialty volcano roll, which was spicy and delicious and a few other rolls. The only downside I would say to Coast is there BYOB rule, of only one bottle per 2 people. And $1 per person for BOYB dessert. It just seems a little nit picky to start setting limits on what people can bring in. Its just seems a bit silly!
