I'm thinking of tattooing the yelp logo on my ass because of the extra five pounds that have been gained due to finding great places like Art of Pizza on this danged website. Okay, I wouldn't really do that. But everything else is true. I found Art of Pizza on yelp, and circle of life, I'm now reviewing it for all of you. Basically, its amazing. Their pan pizza with pepperoni..oh yes. I've had it delivered and have done carry-out, and haven't been disappointed yet. I don't know what they do to their crust, but somehow it transforms from dough to the best part of the pizza - this coming from someone who (still) cuts the crust off sandwiches. I don't know how impressive the dining area is, but if you really can't make it out the door and into your car before ravaging the pie, they have chairs and tables to accomodate your needs. See you there.
