Great sushi! Real variety of rolls and dishes. The ambiance is a little annoying with club music in the background. It is BYOB, which I understood prior to going. They had no mixes for anything we brought, no tonic, no soda, no limes. If you prepare well enough this is no problem, but having some basic mixers seems like it would be any easy thing to do. All in all quite good and I will go back. Parking was not bad and I went on an Thursday.
