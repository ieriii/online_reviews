This was my first experience eating authentic Chicago deep dish pizza, and I have mixed feelings about it. First, this is the flagship store, so I was pretty crowded, likely from all the tourists (self included) near Michigan avenue. We had to wait an hour for a table, which in any other circumstance, I would not have waited an hour for pizza. They have you order the pizza before you sit down, which I would like to give them points for so you pizza is ready when you sit down. during the wait I sampled some Illinois based beers, 312 and Gooseneck, and man I've never been buzzed off of 1 glass of beer, but there must be something special about the 312. Anyways on to the pizza, we ordered a large for 3 people which was a mistake, b/c we were stuffed and we still had half of it leftover. I think a small would have been fine. We ordered a Canadian bacon, tomatoes, and pineapple, and man that thing was stuffed with cheese and bacon in the middle, and it was pretty good, (or maybe everything tastes good when you are buzzed). Also ordered fried zucchini and a chopped salad, both less than mediocre and not worth it. The salad was 7.75 and the zucchini was around 7, the pizza was 21. I think If I had to do it over, I would have skipped the sides, and stuck with 2 small pizzas so we could sample different types. Cheap (by CA standards) and filling.
