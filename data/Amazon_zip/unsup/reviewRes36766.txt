Okay, I never liked this place to much. But I went again yesterday to try the sushi. The sushi was wonderful, very fresh and nicely put together. Had the dragon roll, spider roll and a few others I forgot which, but they were really good. We also ordered the Indie Signature with beef. The curry with it was good, but the beef not so much. I would only come here again to have the sushi.
