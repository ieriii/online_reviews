Went here due to a friend's groupon. It's places like Cafe 28 that encourage me to leave Belmont Harbor more often (sad, I know). It took me 30 minutes to get there from the Loop by way of the Brown Line and then the restaurant was literally right across the street from the el - so convenient!  We had a reservation but contrary to other reviewer experiences, the place was empty. Could have walked in off the street. Our waitress was borderline too helpful. She recommended many menu items, describing them in detail, even after we said we knew what we wanted. Thanks miss, but we're hungry.  My friend had a pama mojito = pomegranite mojito. Very strong and VERY delicious. I went with Castle Rock Merlot. We enjoyed our drinks so much that we opted for refills in lieu of dessert. The butter was sweet and flavorful - but too spicey for my wimpy taste - while the bread basket was sort of sad. Chewy and nothing to write home about. We both ordered and loved the pear salad in a champagne vinaigrette. My entree was the pistachio-encrusted chicken on green beans and mashed potatoes. My friend went with the Cafe 28 superstar pork chops. Both dishes were delish and we happily boxed up the leftovers to bring home. For two glasses of wine, two mojitos, two salads and two entrees our check was $96. I'm glad we had the groupon because otherwise that's a bit pricey for a weeknight friend date. I had fun and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy dinner spot with a creative menu out on Irving Park Rd.
