When I was a young one, driving past this place would drive me into an excited frenzy to see the snazzy hot dogs with light up eyes on top of the drive in. I had no idea where it was, being buckled into a car seat in the back of the car, but oh man my day would be filled with glee each time we drove past it. Now that I am old enough to drive myself I can simply say that Superdawg breeds the quintessential Chicago hot dog. Not only are the dawgs flavorful and snappy, the size trumps all these other skinny weenies in town. If you like girth, you get a lot for your dollars at Superdawg. And not to forget but your dawg comes paired with pretty amazing crinkle cut fries in a box so cute you will want to save it as a souvenir.  And all hail Maurie and Flaurie, they certainly don't skip on the pickle! If you are an aficionado of roadside America, a lover of kitsch, and a connoisseur of encased meats, you have to put a trip to Superdawg at the top of your list!
