I've only heard great things about Gino's and after watching Adam Richman on (Man v Food) stop here, I had to make a food stop here as well. We got here around 6PM and the line was out the door and around the corner down the alley. The wait was only 30 minutes, despite having over 30 people waiting in line.  We were seated on the second floor in a booth. We order the Meaty Legend, along with fried ravioli. The ravioli was great and came with a good helping of tomato sauce for dipping. Nice and crispy and had a generous amount of filling. The pizza arrived about 35 minutes after we ordered (got a small between the 2 of us, more than enough). The crust was a nice golden brown, slightly burnt on the top edges though. I don't know how to describe the crust, other than it was one of the best I had ever had. It wasn't chewy and had a nice texture that worked very well with the tomato sauce and the four kinds of meat that came on the Meaty Legend.  We finished dinner with a cannoli; it was really small, only about 3 bites. The shell was REALLY hard, the cream inside was sweet; I've definitely had better cannoli's. Overall, a GREAT experience; stick to the deep dish and you won't be disappointed! FYI - if you want to write on the walls, buy a white marker and black marker BEFORE you get there.
