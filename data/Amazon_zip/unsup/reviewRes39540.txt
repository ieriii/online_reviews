What happens when you're an american, hungry at midnight, don't speak korean, and don't want to eat at an american restaurant? You go to san soo gab san, and great treated like crap. Really, it's tradition at least per other yelpers, but it doesn't hide that the food is quite excellent. Kalbi was great. Seriously, really good. I think the food came out so fast they may have quite possibly performed a small nuclear explosion in the kitchen to prepare it so fast. The soup my girlfriend ordered was still bubbling and boiling when they brought it to us. I do love korean foods and I do shop at korean grocery stories, so this was a nice step towards that direction. However, go with someone korean or speak it yourself. It'll save you a lot of hassle. This place is open from 10AM-5AM, so you can go there whenever.
