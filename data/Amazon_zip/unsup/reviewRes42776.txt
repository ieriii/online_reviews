Very yummy deep dish pizza by the slice. I usually get the spinach & mushroom. The sauce is spot on! Sometimes the crust has a doughy texture, but I'm ok with it because you really can't beat the price. My bf and I can have a filling meal for less than $10! 2 pizzas and 1 diet coke to share. What a steal! We love coming here when we feel poor and hungry.
