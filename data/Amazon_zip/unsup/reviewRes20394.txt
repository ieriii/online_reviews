Although this was the first time that I haven't seen Rick Bayless at one of his restaurants, Xoco definitely did not disappoint. Last time I ordered the Ahogada, which I loved. This time I ordered the Choriqueso, which was made with home-made chorizo, cheese and roasted poblano peppers. I also had some of the bf's Cuban sandwich, which was good, but mine was definitely better (oh yea). The way to go at Xoco is to bypass the line by ordering your food to go. You may not get the Bayless experience, but you still get to eat some of the delicious food.
