I absolutely love this restaurant. I have eaten at the Chicago location many times as well as the one in Vegas. The last time I was there was last week for lunch. We were seated surprisingly in a short amount of time. This place was packed but we got a card for early seating from concierge. Food was good except for the fact that there was a piece of paper baked into my boyfriend's chicken. literally, baked in. gross. The server took all the appropriate measures though. He offered to bring a new meal. Gave us free dessert and took the meal charge off the bill. Can't complain about that!
