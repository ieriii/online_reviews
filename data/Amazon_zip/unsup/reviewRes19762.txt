Excellent food and service again. We enjoyed the fried chicken livers and tuna tartare (again). Then the whitefish main for my wife and the lamb shank for me. My lamb was excellent. My dessert was crme brulee with mild but tasty ginger snaps and fruit - good not great.  This should be on your short list of good places near the Art Institute. Be sure to be seated in the back room. And listen to the recommendations of the waitstaff - they're really good.
