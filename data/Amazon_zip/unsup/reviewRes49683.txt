Best known as a Wine and Cheese bar, Bin 36 is also home to an excellent hamburger. In fact, it is so good that it was named one of the best hamburgers in the city, along with others, in the September 2009 issue of Chicago Magazine. Packing a great smokey taste and served with your choice of salad or french fries, the Wood-grille Burger would satisfy any hamburger aficionados that wish to indulge in this work of genius. Okay, maybe I'm going a bit overboard here but I highly recommend trying it out. The burger is regularly priced at around 12 dollars but you can try it at half the price on Mondays as it is the featured item on the menu. My suggestion, medium-well topped with tomato, lettuce, onion and a side of the fries.
