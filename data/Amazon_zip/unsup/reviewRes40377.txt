holy crap this place is meaty!! i'm a veggie and i knew that going in, so no complaints. the atmosphere was how i like an atmosphere to be - comfortable, loud from people talking & enjoying their company. a little crowded, but the bartender and host were attentive. once we got seated the service was excellent. very attentive but not overbearing. this may be stupid but i appreciated that the water was chilled with no ice. on to the menu... pricey small plates for the most part. i had the cheese trio. just for the sake of veggies who can't eat much i would've appreciated something really different. but the choices were solid, the chimay cheese, a triple cream brie and something that was cave aged and cow milk. all enjoyable. here's where i can't elaborate much - the rest of the food. my boy got the boar sloppy joe (eww?) but he loved it. with bacon. my salad was good. an amuse bouche of shrimp with something - everyone like it. all in all we left satisfied and really enjoyed the night, and that's the point, right?
