First I need to give a shout out to the bartender... Mojitos = AMAZING!!!! I'm usually skeptical about ordering them at random bars/restaurants because they can either be really great or pretty much undrinkable. Here, they're the best! The bartender puts in the extra effort to make them orgasmic!!! And, the Sangria is bombin as well! Second... the foood is de-licious. Their empanadas are sooo good!! Get the sampler plate to try all three types. For dinner my friend and I both had the chicken and steak combo and it was really good! So many great flavors and really juicy! And last but certainly not least I have to say how wonderful all the staff is at las tablas!! The first time my friend and I went to dinner there we made friends with 2 of our waiters and they gave us a coupon for our next meal. When we came back like 1 1/2 later they both remembered us. It's just such a pleasant and fun environment!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you're in the mood for some bomb food (don't come here if you're in the salad mood).
