My experience of going to Sunda was a bit of a mind fuck, in a good way though. I went here on a sunday, and for the first time ever, I got an industry discount because i too work in a restaurant. (I think my boyfriend and I reek of the "hey! I'm young and i wait tables!" smell). It was 50% off select dishes and appetizers (most of them, pretty much), which made my boyfriend and i happy campers. The food ruled. We ordered ahi tuna, and sushi with american kolbe beef. The tuna was prepared rare and had tasty glaze on it. Overall I've had better ahi tuna before since the one here was a bit flavorless minus the sauce. The sushi was not my favorite, i thought that cooked beef tasted a bit odd with the combination of other sushi flavors. I ordered the pork shank for my entree, and when that hunky piece of meat arrived to the table, i felt like i was feasting in the middle ages. It was very flavorful and had a crunchy texture to it which was delightful, really. Our server was lovely and quirky. I would definitely come back here.
