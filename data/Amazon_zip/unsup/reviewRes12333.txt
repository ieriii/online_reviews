Mojitos, the BEST spiced honey butter in the world, Papas Rellenas, Carne a la Parilla and another Mojito.... followed by maybe one more Mojito. That's what i had yesterday for my birthday celebration dinner. This place is my tried and true regular dining spot in Chicago. Friendly, family owned and some of the best Cuban/Mexican dining in the city... did i mention the mojitos???
