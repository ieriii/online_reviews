Decent, large burritos. Very small menu; great for those that have a hard time deciding. They didn't even offer chicken or pork, just carne asada and barbacoa, along with a few vegetarian options and a chile relleno. The barbacoa is superior to the tougher carne asada. The burritos were a great size, but had way too many onions. I love onions as much (or more) than the next guy, but mounds of uncooked onions can really wreak havoc on your stomach and your breath. Be warned if you plan on going here for a low-key date! I was also sort of disappointed with the lack of preparation. We came on a weeknight around 8, and the cook just got up from his dinner, rolled up a brunch of pre-made stuff, and we were out in about 60 seconds. Would have liked that the meat was made-to-order. I'd rather explore some of the other mexican restaurants on this strip than go back.
