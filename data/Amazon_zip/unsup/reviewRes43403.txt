I came for breakfast, but made an unfortunate game-time decision and opted for a sandwich instead. Big mistake -- the huevos rancheros were taunting me at every turn with their cheesy goodness. I will definitely be getting that the next time I visit this place. Don't get me wrong, though, the crab cake sandwich was a fine sandwich--a solid spicy mayo and soft baguette with some tasty homemade potato chips, but the huevos rancheros is definitely the signature dish at this joint judging from the sheer number of them circulating (and aside from the Orange Brioche French Toast if you're in the mood for sweet). Rookie mistake on my part.  Like other posters below, for such a small place, I am impressed with the Japanese-style efficiency with which they move folks down the line. On an early Saturday afternoon, the line may look daunting, but honestly only waited about 20 minutes or so to be seated--which is acceptable for a place a small as this. Also, be prepared to peruse the menu on the wall (or grab one by the cash register) as you won't be sitting down while a waitress takes your order (a slap in the face of the aforementioned efficiency).
