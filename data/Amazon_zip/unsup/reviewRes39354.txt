Wow, what a gem! I went for dinner on Friday kind of late (10ish). There was a small wait so we grabbed drinks. First the inside is super cool. Way more than what you'd expect by looking at the exterior. The drinks we got were really good. I love the amount of whiskey cocktails you could get. We were served by a rather unfortunate looking guy possibly made better if you washed him of hipster. It took him a while to make drinks but they were good. The guy that took peoples reservations was able to accommodate a traveler by finding a outlet to plug my phone in. Kudos to that. Dinner was fantastic. We started with a compressed melon salad that was out of this world. It was sweet, hot, and nutty in ways I have never experienced. My girlfriend go the wild boar sloppy joe with beef fat fries. Sweet Jesus they were good. The boar wasn't gamey at all. It had great flavor and season. The fries were unreal. So delicious. I got the roasted chicken. The way the deboned the chicken was genius. There were still leg bones but everything else had been removed masterfully. It was simply delicious. Easily the second best roasted chicken I have ever had after Brasserie by Niche in St. Louis. Can't wait to come back next time I am in Chicago!
