My boyfriend and I went here last Friday after work. It was definitely packed, but they somehow managed to seat us without a wait. We were seated on a large table in the middle, along with 8 other people - mostly couples. We got tune & lima beans, artichokes & potatoes, chorizo stuffed olives, and the fried pig ear and kale. Let me tell you, the pig ear was our favourite. We are not necessarily the most adventurous of eaters and had both not eaten pig ear, but we were so happy with our decision to try something new. We also got a wine pairing recommended to us, which I thought was great if you want to try something new, but I wasn't a huge fan of the wine we tried.  Not extremely pricey for such a place on Michigan Ave.
