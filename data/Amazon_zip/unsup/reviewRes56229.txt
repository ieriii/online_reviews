This place used to be a favorite of mine and a couple of coworkers for after-work dessert and drinks. Never again. The last two times that I went were enough for me to refuse to ever go back again. The first time, the waiter took our order, brought out our side dishes and then promptly disappeared for 30 minutes without letting us know about our main course. After awhile, we got up, paid for what we ate, and left. The next visit, we had a different waiter who was incredibly rude and actually swore at me. The salad, desserts, and coffee are all great, but not enough to make up for the horrible service.
