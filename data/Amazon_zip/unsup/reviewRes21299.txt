My neighbor and I wanted to get brunch and she had heard amazing things about Xoco. Since they only serve breakfast items until 10:30, we left around 9am to get there in time. Parking was easy which was surprising for downtown. Being the first time coming here, we had to stare at the limited breakfast menu before making any decisions. The woman behind the counter wasn't the friendliest or the most helpful either. It seemed that they had started to run out of the breakfast items. We got the last egg empanada thankfully, as well as the open face poached egg sandwich and the Mexican pound cake. I got a large coffee and my friend got the chocolate with chili drink. The food was good but not great. I expected more since it is a Rick Bayless restaurant. If I come back to give it another shot, I will try the non-breakfast items on the menu.
