that's right.. 5 stars. Master cooks, master managers, master atmosphere. There is nothing to say about this place except GO. Pork, Fish, Beer, and Wine served. NYC has nothing on Chicago and I truly believe Chicago has finally moved to #1 position in Food in America.. to compliment the #1 music scene.. The city is sooooo good at doing Urban America.. EAT HERE!  I am a food snob and proud of it. Ok the oysters/ muscles are better in California's better restaurants but I really believe very few people are good judges of good and great muscles and the minuet sauce is wonderful here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
