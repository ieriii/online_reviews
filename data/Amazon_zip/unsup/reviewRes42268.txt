Are you people fucking high? This pizza is fucking gross and cheap. You might like this shit if you shop at Walmart or think a delicacy is a disgusting hot pocket.  The Art of Pizza is nothing but a dilapidated soup kitchen serving Sbarro. Nothing says classy like eating as adults like children would at a birthday party at the bowling ally. Mmmm dignity... it's what's not for dinner.
