I used to grow up eating fire. So when some coworkers were going to this place I was skeptical, but alas I remained a victim to conformity and went instead. Atmosphere: When you walk in you get hit by the pungent smell....ahh just like being back on Devon. However, inside is more upscale than any place you will find in Rogers Park. Wooden decor and traditional indian artwork adorns the wall, along the busy and heavy packed seating area. Service: Unlike some peoples impression, our wait staff was stellar, able to memorize our order. Granted we waited longer than I would like but it was a busy night Food: Actually surprisingly good. For most trendy restaurants Indo-Pak food is a bad bastardization of the original, yet this place stayed more true to form. I was with some vegetarians and didn't want to partake with the meatery, but overall everything appears pretty good. Menu options offer a wide array of very good vegetarian and non-vegetarian options.  Mommy Factor: Well my mom might not like this, well because she cooks authentic, but your moms might dig the "exotic cuisine" and upscale feel. Date Factor: Its nice enough for a dating event, however bring a lot of Mentos if you plan on getting close later......you will definitely take more than just a doggy bag home with you. Bling: About 13-19 bucks a cuisine, a little on the pricey end for Indian food. If you are willing to head down to Devon Avenue you can get the same food for less, but its more of the "hole in the wall atmosphere". This is a safe bet for those who want to venture into the world of Indo-Pak food, but might be a little faint of heart.
