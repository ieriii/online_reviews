I have eaten at Gilt 4 or 5 times and never had a good experience. I go back because the food is good (until last night). I alway keep hoping that the service will be better but it never is. I have always enjoyed the food but last night we ordered the lemon meringue and they made the meringue with salt. We called out waitress over told her that it was salty not sweet and she did not believe us so she tasted it at our table. How do you make a mistake like that? The chef did not even come out to apologies, that is just common courtesy if you just made your patrons eat spoonfuls of salt. They will make you wait 30 mins at the bar for your table and then seat you at one that has been empty the whole time you have been waiting.  The music is LOUD we asked the hostess to turn it down and she blew us off then we asked our waitress twice before they turned it down enough we could hear each other. I am not going out to eat to listen to your songza station, I am out to enjoy the company of my friends and I dont want to have to shout at them. I could wright a novel of all the little things that they do wrong. If you are looking for a place to go in river north there are so many better places to go dont waist your time and money here. I used to say that Gilt has great food and bad service, now all I can say is both are bad.
