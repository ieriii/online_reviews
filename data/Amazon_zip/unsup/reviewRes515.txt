Food: 10*'s Service: 10*'s side note: started off a tiny wee bit bumpy but eased up and became spectacular Ambience: 10*'s Chef and staff- thank you for you dedication to this industry. It was an honor to be taken care of by you all. I had my menu signed by the entire kitchen staff (I asked that the porters sign as well)-- I will frame it and hang it proudly in NYC.
