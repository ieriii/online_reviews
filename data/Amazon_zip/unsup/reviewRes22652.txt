If this place ever closes down, I will cry. If only for the years of joy brought to me by those giant, smiling hot dogs on their roof. Man, is this stand popular. The food is good and the milkshakes are pretty special, but it's mostly because it's so unique, and a throwback to the 50's. I expect to see Richie and Potsie pull up next to me every time!
