The name "Chicago Diner" doesn't do justice to what they do. I would never guess from the name or the storefront that this was a vegan establishment. Thanks to previous Yelp reviews, we were able to find it. I should first point out that on the Saturday evening that we dined here it was incredibly busy. The staff did a really nice job of efficiently managing their customer flow and keeping everyone happy in the meantime. I had an excellent vegan shake and the "BBQ Bacn Burger," both of which were so convincing I didn't care that I wasn't drinking dairy or eating meat. Don't be freaked out by the "V" Word. Even if you're a red-blooded meat eater you won't be completely disappointed by the vegan food at Chicago Diner.
