This is my favorite Italian restaurant on the north side of Chicago after eating here 5 or 6 times.I'll start off with why it only gets 4 stars from me and not 5. This place is EXTREMELY and RIDICULOUSLY loud. It is a big restaurant and they are trying to seat way too many people in the main section, when they have a lot of room outside. I feel like a SARDINE in that section, and basically some stranger next to me can hear everything I say, because they are literally a foot from me.On the positive front, every main dish I have ordered here has been good except for one. They have an excellent pasta dish with eggplant in it that I absolutely love. The servers are generally pretty good.Please turn down the music and the volume Mr./Ms. Owner.
