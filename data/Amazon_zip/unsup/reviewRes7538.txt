Okay, so the inside of the restaurant is pretty cool. Good decorations and architecture and stuff. But thats the only good thing I can come up with... This place was nasty, and scary. I felt like I was being accosted constantly by the waitstaff trying to force food on me. And the food really wasn't that great either! At the end of the night, we felt like we had to take as many of the little hostess stand chocolates as we could to get our moneys worth! But even that failed, because the chocolate was so old that it had turned a weird color and crumbled up.
