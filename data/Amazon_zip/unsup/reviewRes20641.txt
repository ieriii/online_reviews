So I'm not going to talk about the sandwiches (which are decent) or the hot chocolate (which is amazing).You can read all about that stuff in the over 1,000 reviews already posted on here. I'm writing about the one major flaw in this place. Tourists, tourists, TOURISTS! Every time I come in here, there's a deep line ahead of me, and it seems to be full of tourists who not only have never been to this restaurant before, but who seem to have never been to any restaurant at all. None of them think about doing apparently ridiculous things like looking at the menu while they're in line, or perusing the drink case while they wait to order, or maybe even getting their means of payment out before it's due. No, why do any of that when you can wander around the city obliviously as if no one might be waiting on you. They make it really difficult for native Chicagoans to pop in and grab something and get on to where they might need to go, like work. Please tourists, helps us native Chicagoans out. Here's what you can do. 1. Read the menu while you're in line. Don't wait til you get to the register and make the cashier read the whole thing to you. Heck, maybe get on your smartphone and look at the menu before you even get there. It's a world famous restaurateur's place after all. 2. Don't insist they give you something they're telling you they don't have. None of the nice people working there can make special cups or food not on their menu appear out of thin air. 3. Don't ask a hundred questions. They're not your waiter and there's people's waiting on you. If you're there alone, fine, then ask about how they roast their own cocoa nibs. If there are people in line behind you, look it up on the internet. It's there. World famous. 4. Get your money out before they tell you to pay. Don't just stand there looking flummoxed. That this whole deal is going to cost you money shouldn't be a surprise. Thanks, we appreciate it. -Big City Folk
