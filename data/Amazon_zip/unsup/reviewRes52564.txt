This was my first Brazilian Steakhouse experience and overall it was ok. I was there with family and we had a great time, which is why I deemed it 3 stars instead of 2. The food was really hit or miss all night. The first piece of chicken I got was raw. Many of the filets were more rare than medium(which I requested) or were "well done" which were awful. But their house special, top and bottom sirloin and shrimp were amazing. So were the fried bananas. The buffet was also good. I enjoyed the oysters, shrimp salad and ceviche. My biggest gripe about the place was the service. Our evening started off great. The service was excellent and slowly as the night went on, it turned to the worse. The guachos were good at the start, but later on in the meal, were no where to be seen. I waited more than 15 min for one to stop and never did. I just went to the buffet for more oysters instead. Our waiter spilled wine a few times on the table and covered up the spots with napkins so the manager would not see them. After we finished with dinner and he was telling us about the desserts, he was just going through the motions, not even looking at us while he was talking looking annoyed to be there. Then we waited another 30 mins for our check after dessert. Would I go back, probably not. Dinner for 4 and 3 bottles of wine will run you around $400 before tip, so I will probably try other places. For that price, I expect better.
