I absolutely love this place! Best smoothies EVER!!! The signature Costa Rican oatmeal shake(with soy) is a must. However, the mango smoothie(with water) is an everyday favorite of mine. Their gallo pinto(rice dish) is amazing as well. Great sandwiches and great steak tacos! Give Irazu a try. You will not be disappointed. Great food, great service, great people, and a great atmosphere all in the heart of bucktown!
