It's all about the duck. The appetizer duck dish with the buns and pickled onions haunts my dreams. It's that good. The whole process and each round of duck really make a solid meal. The sides are alright, but a little greasy. Still good though. BYOB, but they want to charge you $2 a bottle....per bottle (for those of you doing the math, that's $12 for a 6 pack, which is absurd in my opinion). So, bring a bottle of wine or just buy from the bar....or do what we did, and just open your own bottles to avoid the comic overcharge on BYOB.
