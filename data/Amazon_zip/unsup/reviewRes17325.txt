It's expensive, but they have my favorite mixed drink in the whole world. The way that they make drinks can be compared to alchemy. It takes about 20 minutes for them to make you your drink, but that's because they are made with love. My favorite drink is a mix of orange pekoe tea, beefeater gin, honey suckle, and egg whites that make it a frothy and delicate. I'm not a light weight, but one drink gets me tipsy. It's an enchanting, magical, fancy, pre-prohibition style cocktail lounge with chandeliers, velvet curtains, and bartenders with mutton-chops and vests. It's better to go on weekdays when it's less crowded, but if you go on a weekend, make sure that you get there before 7pm or else the line could take up to 45 minutes. Also, request a seat at the bar -- it's much more fun to watch the bartenders make drinks than to sit in a big chair staring at the person across from you.
