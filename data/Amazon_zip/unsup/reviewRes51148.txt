If I could eat here everyday, I would. Southern-style vegetarian food is one of my favorite things ever, and Wishbone does a great job of making authentic tasting, super healthy dishes that satisfy the tummy and wallet. The decor of this place is really fun, especially the back room where the bar is located. Try as I do to mix things up, 9/10 times I end up ordering the black bean cakes with mango salsa and red pepper sauce, spinach and hoppin' john - too good. I recently took my boyfriend here, and he cleared a huge plate of macaroni and cheese, plus some of my food (this is saying a lot, since he's one of the most light eaters I've ever known.) The staff here is always really attentive and willing to accommodate any dietary needs. As a gluten-free vegan, this is pretty important to me. Oh, and the strawberry lemonade? Do yourself a favor and order it. You can thank me later.
