I am a big fan of Thai food. My wife and I have been to at least 20 different Thai restaurants throughout the city. She is more of the adventurer and I usually stick with the basic Thai dishes. We find that Opart Thai is reasonably priced, the meals we have tried over and over are consistent and the food is always delicious. We order out from Opart probably once a week and have been ordering from them for the last 4 years. It is always good for us! Don't forget it is a BYOB and with no corkage fee! I agree with service is not the best but the food makes it up and our bill is always under $30 with two apps. Service is rated at 3.7 for dining in.
