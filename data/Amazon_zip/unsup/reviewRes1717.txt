So I ventured to Hot Doug's yesterday with a friend for the first time. We went around 1pm on a Tuesday. There was a bit of a line, but big deal. How many times have you sat in traffic for 2 hours and not been rewarded with a delicious sausage. Our wait was about 30-45 minutes. Not that bad really, you can talk with the other people in line, see what they recommend if they have been here before or chat about what you are going to order. The wait also gives you some time to mull over what the heck you are going to get. While I was in line someone had mentioned that the bacon sausage was the best dog they had ever had, so at that point I was quite unsure of what to order. As we got in the door I had decided to go with the Smoked Apple Chicken Sausage with Spicy Citrus-Apple Salsa and Sartori Raspberry Cheese and I grabbed a honey lemonade because I thought it would be a nice complement to the other citrus flavors. Having Celiac disease I was forced to ditch the bun, which actually was no big deal because the sausage was big enough that the bun didn't matter. So I settled in with my knife and fork like I always do when I eat hot dogs or sausage because gluten free buns at any dining establishment are a rarity. The sausage was quite delicious, it had a nice smokey flavor and the apple salsa gave it just enough a kick. And the cheese was a nice pairing. This could just be me being American, but I would have liked more cheese and apple salsa. I also got the fries, no duckfat fries since it was Tuesday(I'll be back). So four stars for now until I go back again and try something else. I don't care about the wait, not a big deal to me. Food was good. Lots of options. Someday I hope there will be a hot dog place that offers gluten free buns...
