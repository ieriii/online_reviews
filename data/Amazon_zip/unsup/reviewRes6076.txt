One my first trip to this Wildfire location I instantly liked it more then the one on the North Shore. It was much cleaner and vibrant. Quick side note the coat check lady does not like her job. I didn't even realize it was a coat check until we were way past her, I thought it was the carry out desk or something. We sat down and were quickly served water and delicous hot onion bread. We ordered teh Calamari (don't do it). It was tough, stale and teh sauce we medicore. We then split the Tomato and onion salad which had a surprisingly health share of tomatoes and the bleu cheese crumbles were balanced nicely witht he dressing. For dinner I ordered the Horseraddish encrusted Filet. It came out cooked right and looking great. However, the quality of the meat wasn't great any part that wasn't a darker shade of pink was dry. The mash potatoes I got though were good, heavy in butter and cream but I don't mind :). My girlfriend got the Scallops again not great the lemon butter sauce was OK and the Scallops were somewhat rubbery. We did order one hell of a bottle of Stags Leap Petite Syrah, it was lighter than I was hoping but damn good. I'd got back and try them again, I had a good time and enjoyed the staff. I'm not sure I order a filet again though.
