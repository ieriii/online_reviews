One of my favorite places in the city to dine at. Its pretty much my weekly spot. I usual go when the weather is nice(which is rare now a days) and the patio is open. I've dined inside once during the many times going to Irazu and i have to say that was my least favorite experience, That's not Irazu's fault I just love their patio. Staff is awesome, I'm always waited on by either Omar or Amanda(Sorry if i got their names wrong.) Both are super awesome and friendly. From what I observed, It's a great place for family and friends, definitely a nice place to bring a date too. I always roll here solo, It's my private place to have a peaceful quiet meal, relax and enjoy the breeze. It's BYOB which is a big plus but I've yet to take advantage of that. I usually get the Vegetarian burrito and a Soy Oatmeal or Papaya Milkshake pretty much every time i go and that adds up to be around $10.50. Thats definitely within my budget and i walk out with a belly thats about to explode.My only issue with Irazu is Cash Only. I'm a debit card man, i almost never carry cash. Whenever I plan to come to Irazu i always have to make an inconvenient stop at the bank of america ATM. One time i forgot to bring cash and their atm kept declining my card. I thought i was gonna have to do the dishes to cover my meal but they managed to work something out.
