The food was very good, the service was great and the drinks were tasty too. The onion and potato soup was to die for! My only complaint was the bread, it overpowered the delicate flavors of the meal. But I know that is a really picky comment. The manager was nice enough to even discuss my comments about the bread and told us they're using a new bakery. I'm very happy with my meal and customer service.I"d recommend it to anyone wanting a hip place for a meal in the Loop
