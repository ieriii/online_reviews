This place is fantastic!! I'm so glad that we went to Glenn's last weekend. It's a small place, so I would recommend a reservation. We came in with our res and were seated right away. There's two menus - a regular ol' fashioned menu you can thumb through at the table (pastas, chicken, beef, typical diner food) and then their fish menu, which is written on the blackboards that line the walls. Go for the fish menu. I'm pretty sure their selection changes daily, our waiter mentioned that they get their fish in fresh everyday. There was around 17 different types of fish up for ordering - Arctic Char, Salmon, Trout, Marlin, Walleye, oh my! To start, my fiance ordered a cup of the clam chowder. Clam chowder creeps me out sometimes (consistency thing), but this was delicious. Order a cup if you go. You won't regret it. Now for the main course... I ordered the rainbow trout that was pan fried in brown butter and topped with some sweet pecans. My fiance ordered the bass that had a lemony flavor to it. My friend ordered the Scottish Salmon, which was a salmon with a honey mustard type of thing going on. They all came with roasted potatoes and asparagus. Oh my...it was fantastic. It felt like you were eating....GOOD food. Great food. The kind of food that makes you happy. We finished our meal off with brownie pie and rolled out the door. It's a little pricey, but totally worth it. Really excellent seafood - one of the best I've had in Chicago.
