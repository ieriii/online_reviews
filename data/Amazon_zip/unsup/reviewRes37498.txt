I want to hug the shit out of this bar and never let it go. I have never had a bad time here. I have never had a bad beer here. I have never had a bad meal here. The ham sandwich--fuckin' bonkers. Pumpernickel bread? Yessiree. Hook it up. Had the duck reuben the other night, and it was similarly delicious. Kraut all up in my guts. Lovin' it. The french fries are off the hook and I basically would eat spoonfuls of the aioli if I couldn't feel my arteries hardening at the moment of impact. Prepare to hear blasphemy: I've never had the mussels. Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, kids, sorry. Soon, soon. I love this place so much I came here on my birthday and called and invited people to come to this place. I never do shit like that. I'm all like--whatever you guys want and... yeah. But screw that. Hopleaf, kid. Keep 'em comin. Order up. I mean, even when we've had to wait for a table, or been given the forceout to the upstairs bar, there's always a ledge for you at Hopleaf. And all those hops seem to make the clientele--and the staff--pretty damn friendly. Hearts for Hopleaf.
