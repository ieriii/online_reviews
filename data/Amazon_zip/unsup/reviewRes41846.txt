Low lit, understated glitzy place. If you know what I mean. Came for a triple date with the hubby and his bff cousins with their respective significant others. We ordered several entrees and sides to share. Everything was excellent, except for the bone marrow. The bone marrow was kind of nasty, and it's not because I don't like bone marrow. I LOVE the stuff but the bone marrow here was too thick and. . bulbous. Ick. My favorites of the night were the two veggie sides we got: - blackened cauliflower with pickled red onion, capers & chili ($7) - caramelized brussels sprouts, pork belly, maple & parmesan ($8) They were both phenomenal! The truffle pasta gets a shout out too. :) Lastly (and what bumped this up to a 4 star review) is that their $6 glass of house red was delicious and affordable. After dinner, make your way downstairs to the speakeasy for more delicious drinks!
