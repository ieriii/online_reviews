I absolutely LOVE Gino's. I live in AR and have been to Chicago several times. Every time I go I make sure we get to eat at Gino's. I just realized that you could order the pizza online and have it shipped to anywhere in the U.S. I am soooo excited! Will definitely be doing this. It is THAT good! :)
