Kind of thinking about going back, like today. After reading a few other reviews that mentioned poor service, I am going to have to disagree. We were there on a gorgeous Saturday night and had absolutely no problems. We were a little worried about how long the wait would be however, we were seated promptly at one of the communal tables (not usually a fan, but it was fine) as soon as we arrived. Our server was very knowledgeable about the wine and food and I speak for everyone I was with when I say we were all pleased with her suggestions. Here's what we had: Fried green olives, stuffed with chorizo. uhhh, yum! Raw corn and tomatoes with arugula pesto Shrimp and clams with Rosamarina (my least fave, but still good) Deviled egg with arugula and caper berries Pork liver pat Truffle tremor (goat milk and truffle cheese) :-) omg Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes-def fave There wasn't a dish that we tried that we didn't like. You should know that they do small plates, some very small, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Too many places serve you too much. I cannot wait to go back! My goal is to try everything on the menu. Who's with me? :-)
