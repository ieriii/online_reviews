I enjoyed my stay at the InterContinental, which is where my work chose to host a huge meeting. Pros: - Modern, comfy King bed with 5 large, plush pillows - Decent 2-story fitness center; more extensive than other fitness centers I have been too -Downtown location; perfect for people who want to be blocks away from major shopping and running along the river Cons: - Water problems with my shower- my water would go in and out - It's REALLY big- two different "towers" and it can be a little overwhelming for people who just want to have a relaxing stay in Chicago - The ongoing drilling that occur ed during our meeting; completely unprofessional and disturbing (we should have been warned) Overall, it's a decent venue to hold a work event at, however, I would not recommend the InterContinental for a personal stay in Chicago (go to the Affinia!).
