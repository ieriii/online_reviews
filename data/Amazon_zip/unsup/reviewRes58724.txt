I was just here earlier today (thursday afternoon) and I left disappointed. For starters my server (an Asian lady who should be fired) was really rude and made me feel uncomfortable, and ruined my whole dining experience. I wanted to leave immediately, but my friend felt bad about leaving so we ended up staying. However, she did try to make up for it later by being extra fake when it was time to pay. Secondly, the food was not filling and definitely not worth this much money. Stay away from this place!
