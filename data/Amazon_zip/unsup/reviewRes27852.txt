Just went back to Graham Elliot for the fall menu - what can I say - I'm a Graham super-nerd. Although I was sad there was no Tuna Sashimi, they have great options... we did the Tasting Menu - so here goes: Two things to try: Butternut Squash Soup (thai-ish style) was excellent! Lemongrass marshmallow and curry 'chips' make this a really unique take on a butternut squash. I tend to like spicier dishes, so I could have done with more of the curry pieces, but overall enjoyed the soup. Scallops - prepare yourself to want to lick the plate! They were perfectly cooked/seasoned and paired with a fennel salad (can't recall exactly what was in it) that was perfect harmony Unfortunately our meal was cut short due to my sister getting a migraine mid-meal :( BUT the staff was gracious enough to pro-rate our bill. One other note, when you do the tasting, you have the option of having them do drink pairings. The pairing with the ceasar salad was great - a Sauvignon Blanc that was spot-on; the drink with the squash is made with bitters, which my sister was not a big fan of. I thought it paired nicely. The third wine was kind of oaky white, which wasn't the best wine ever, but an okay pairing... Wish I could have finished the meal! Hats off to Graham and his team again :)
