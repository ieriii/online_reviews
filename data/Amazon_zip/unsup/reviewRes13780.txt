If you're a big fan of seafood and/or cereal, then Glenn's Diner is the place for you. They offer some of the best seafood in Chicago and the atmosphere is very laid back. Also, if breakfast is your thing, you can't go wrong with most of their dishes. In particular, they offer up an awesome sour cream-infused potato pancake as a great alternative to your run-of-the-mill hash browns.
