Wow, over 300 reviews, so I'll only comment on the specific dishes we ate. Mapo tofu served in a huge bowl was brimming with soft tofu swimming in delicious, spicy, not too thick sauce. A sure winner, and an easy choice for someone who wants authentic Sichuan flavors but is unfamiliar with this restaurant and its tome of a menu. Chinese broccoli was crisp stir fried, with huge garlic pieces that let the sweet, somewhat bitter flavor of the broccoli shine. A really lovely vegetable dish. Lamb with pure cumin was amazing. The lamb was tender, bursting with earthy cumin flavor and not chewy or gristly. This dish would be a good bet for someone who didn't like spicy foods. The fish with spicy house sauce was equally delightful, with tender fried chunks of fish and cabbage in a not-too-spicy sauce. This place seated myself and four friends at 8:30 p.m. on a Friday night with no wait at all. Service was great, with fresh tea and water when we asked for it. I will definitely return.
