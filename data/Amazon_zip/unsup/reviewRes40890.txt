Sigh. What a let down. I've been here three times now, once good, and the other two, well... First visit: There were two out of control druggies sharing a glass of wine screaming at each other in the tiny restaurant, and no staff member said a thing. This went on for over an hour while everyone else looked at each other, more than a little worried and uncomfortable, and did their best to not flip out. I don't even remember the food, so figured it could deserve another chance. Second visit: it was great, see my previous review. Stark contrast. Third visit: The server began our meal by having us stand in the middle of the restaurant for 10 minutes, carrying 4 bottles of wine, directly next to our table. When seated, we waited, minus our wine (the white, sitting unchilled on a counter), for another 15 minutes before I eventually got up to retrieve the red, and poured it for the table. When we finally saw our waiter again, "I hope you don't have any additional dietary restrictions or allergies, because I'm not sure the chef will accommodate them." What?    - #1 We made the reservation weeks in advance.    - #2 Our "restrictions" were hardly rare or unique: one vegetarian, two pescetarian. The other diner ate anything/everything. The food was detailed extensively by Crystal M's review. eegads. In summary, they didn't even accommodate our needs, resulting in multiple salads, lukewarm food, clumsy preparation, and then being scoffed at, any input brushed off, as we were leaving. Bringing friends here was embarrassing: - The food itself, most importantly, wasn't good. - The service was probably the worst I've ever experienced. - Their lack of response to our after-meal concerns was infuriating (including an email that received no response). So, 2 out of 3 experiences here were ABYSMAL, and I'm not using the word lightly. Not a good ratio. I'm not sure I can accommodate their poor performance and lack of integrity again.
