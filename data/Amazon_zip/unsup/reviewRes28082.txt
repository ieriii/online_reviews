My first experience at Frontera was about two years ago when I was taken around the city by a Boulder chef friend of mine. We started at Frontera and ended at Avec, with special little stops on the way. Frontera is the perfect fusion of street Mexican and the upscale "gourmet" establishments. Go here with friends or co-workers to get a funky Margarita and awesome guacamole. I would almost hands down recommend any of the taco al carbon and the frijoles charros (amazing!). The last time I went I had the Milanesa de Puerco which was also fantastic.  The atmosphere is what really makes this a great place to chill and hang out. Wonderful, vibrant colors, great artwork and great service, this alone makes coming here a treat. Anyways...go to Frontera...get a Coin Margarita...order some guac and tacos....side of beans...and party the night away!
