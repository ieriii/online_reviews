Across from the fountains of MilPark in the 1898 Gage building, built back then by one Louis Sullivan. Finally some competition for Park Grill, the Gage just opened this weekend. Billy Lawless from Irish Oak and the Grafton was a real charmer on his hands. Very classy interior, long bar stocked with expected draft beer and some better belgian style bottles, lots of whisky too. Second bar downstairs, across from big private party rooms.  The big surprise is the food, Dirk Flanigan is responsible, he of Meritage fame from years past. If you've been wondering what all the fuss is about "Gastropubs", this is our fair city's finest example to date. From the best in class scotch egg to the house cured salmon, tasty mussels and camembert topped burger, it's all fab.  come quick before it's overrun with touristas this summer
