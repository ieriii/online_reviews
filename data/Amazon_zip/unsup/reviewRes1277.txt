I need to make a list of "Places that do one thing and do it well." Hot Doug's would be the apex of that list. If I ever get hitched, Doug will cater my wedding and instead of eating bone dry chicken cordon bleu and stringy beef my guests will consecrate my union at the temple of savory encased meats. My favorites are the Loukaniko (greek-style sausage with tzitziki and crumbled feta) and the Ribeye (with crispy onions and horseradish or chimichurri) but you can't go wrong here. Whether you want to spend a couple $ on a perfectly grilled red hot or spring for one of the gourmet links of the day (listed on their website), you will leave happy. Go during the week for lunch if you want to beat the long lines, and drop a buck in the tip jar for goodness' sake. Were you raised in a barn?
