As soon as I walked in, I immediately thought "This place sucks." The Jersey Shore factor was at a level usually reserved for shitty Viagra Triangle "lounges". And there was enough fake blonde hair and tits to fill a year's worth of Hustler. I was not impressed. I made my way downstairs to where a table of friends were having drinks for my friend's birthday. They had menus already on the table. $9 onion rings? $10 beer cocktails? What a bunch of overpriced crap. Speaking of overpriced, my double Ketel and soda was $16. Seriously?!?! And the cherry on top of the suck sundae was that all the popped-collar dress shirt fucktards had 40oz beers, complete with paper sack wrappers. Oh, how ghetto fabulous of us! Let's play 2 Live Crew on repeat and swig rancid beer from 40's, yo! ( Even though they cost $8 a pop) It's all good, son. Just as I was about to look for a gun to shoot myself in the head, one of my friends mentions that there are a bunch of athletes that invested in Fifty/50, one of whom being Brian Urlacher. So, please ignore everything I may have said up to this point. The Fifty/50 is a very large, well designed space with very friendly service and a fun, kitschy menu. While somewhat pricey, the quality does make it worth it, as everything tastes delicious. I will definitely be making this one of my regular spots (and perhaps will have the chance to catch a glimpse of my favorite investor.)
