Since this place doesn't accept reservations (not sure why, but that's a huge pet peeve of mine), we decided to risk it and go there for dinner on NYE. Surprisingly there was no wait at all! We sat at one of the high tables adjacent to the bar. The atmosphere was 'active/lively'...not super loud but not dead either. We ordered a cheese plate--we picked 2 cheeses (pictured) and a pizza for appetizers. The cheese was slightly disappointing--they were both 1oz/each and one of them had a little over 1/4 rind on it. They were tiny pieces for $5, but didn't expect 1/4 of it to be the rind. The pizza was good, although not as crispy as it should have been. My bf ordered the strip steak ($14) which he claimed to be average and a little fatty. I ordered the pasta(pictured) (Cacio e Pepe) which was tiny and a bit to over-peppered and over-creamed. Overall this place was decent. I definitely would come back here for wine/appetizers---but just not for ordering a main meal. Also, this place seems fun for groups. The service was friendly and helpful. I think I mainly disappointed with the portion size.
