Despite all the hype about Mia Francesca, I have had much better Italian food in the same neighborhood over the years. The food is good but the atmosphere can be tough. It is very crowded and loud which is fine for group dinners. However, I stopped going after the last time when pretty much every 10 minutes, a waiter would bump into my chair because it was so crowded. The Mia Francesca on Bryn Mawr is less crowded (more space) and seems to offer more options. I recommend going there instead of the Clark St location.
