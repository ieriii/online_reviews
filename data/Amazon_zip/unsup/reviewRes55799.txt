My favorite place to grab a bite, a drink and relax. I have been going here for years and it just keeps getting better and better. The atmosphere is great and the workers are friendly and very pleasant. The manager here is quite nice and makes sure you have a good time and meal.My favorites are the baked clams, the garlic mashed potatoes and the thin crust pizza. I also love the grilled chicken mediterranean salad. Thanks Calo!
