good overall experience. .. i probably will be back. . service was just adequate. . but the food is worth it .. doubt i would make a special trip to go. . . but next time i have a meeting in the south loop it will be on the short list .. .jose garces has created a fantastic menu and i look forward to seeing how it evolves. .. i was surprised though that they didnt have licor 43. .. .. i didnt get this feeling of catalan. . .which you apparently are supposed too. . i guess the barcelona influences went over my head. ..
