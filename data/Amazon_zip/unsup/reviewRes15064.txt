The atmosphere here is amazing. Super dim candlelight, cozy high back chairs, and velvet. My friend was a fan of the rum soap in the bathrooms! I had two rum drinks: Coffee and cigarettes - which was amazing. I wasn't sure I was going to like it since I'm definitely not a smoker, but it was awesome. Tobacco bitters? Of course I had to try it. Tattooed floozy - which had egg whites in it. Really wasn't sure about that, but it wasn't bad...made the texture of the drink kind of interesting. Foamy on the top. At the end of the night our server brought us a small sample of an artichoke bitter to try. It interesting to say the least. But still very cool of her to bring us something new to try!
