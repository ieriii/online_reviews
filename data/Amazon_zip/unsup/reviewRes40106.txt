I only gave one star because I couldn't give no stars! I live near this establishment and have tried it not once, not twice but three times trying to find the goodness that everyone raves about. The food was consistently bad, the service was consistently RUDE and the staff (who I often see in the neighborhood) rarely has a kind word or even a smile. Don't bother.
