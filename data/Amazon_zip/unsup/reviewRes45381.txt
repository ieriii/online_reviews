I had a very disappointing experience coming here for Sunday lunch today. I hope that this isn't the norm, but the fact that it happened at all is unacceptable. After being seated (in the front of the restaurant, in a very high-traffic/visibility area), my friend and I sat and waited for - no joke - 15 minutes before anyone even brought us water. We watched the girl who was to be our waitress flirt with the people at the host stand, and considered leaving. After all of this, she finally came over and took our drink order. Sensing that we weren't pleased, she says, "you know, sorry if it took me awhile to come over here, ok? Sorry," in the snottiest.tone.possible. I was shocked at her attitude; it was like I had just denied a 16 year old the keys to my car. When she came back with our drinks, she slammed them down with such force that they spilled! After that she had the bus boy do all of the rest of her work, which is a pet peeve of mine. I was only appeased when our food finally came. I had the "blue on blue" burger, and my friend had a normal burger. The burgers themselves were good (hard to argue with blue cheese in my world), but not great. I had ordered mine cooked medium rare, expected it to be medium, and it came out medium-well... Meh. And, I'm not saying this was completely their fault, but I definitely got a stomach ache like 15 minutes after eating the thing.  In all, this place has the potential to be fun and tasty, but it's going to take a major attitude adjustment!
