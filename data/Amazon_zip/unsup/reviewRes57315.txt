I am just starting to get into eating Sushi, and a friend recommended I take this girl here on our first date. The atmosphere couldn't have been any better and our waitress was really friendly. It's a byob place, so I brought 2 bottles of wine. The waitress said that normally they only allow one bottle per person, but opened our second bottle anyway. Aside from that, the food was EXCELLENT! We started out with a crab cake special and it was really good. We ordered 4 different rolls: Maine, Dragon, California, and another one, but I can't remember...must have been that second bottle of wine! The Dragon was so good that we had to order another one! They were all pretty good, but that was definitely the best. If you like crunchy on the inside, just the right spice, and delicious...I recommend that one. Oh, the other one we got was Una Avo with eel. That was also pretty good. Definitely recommend this place!
