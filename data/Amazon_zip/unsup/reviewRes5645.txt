YUM YUM YUM! I wish I ate enough to be a pig because I want to eat (and drink) everything on this menu. I only tried a few things, but each was so delicious. I cannot wait to go back and have the milk-braised pork shoulder (I think that's what it was) and the deep-fried brioche dessert (oh. my. god.). I love this place! I was surprised how small it was. I was there for a late lunch during the week and it wasn't very crowded, but I could imagine this place being packed in the evening (for a good reason too!).
