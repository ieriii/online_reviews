Best Vietnamese food. I ordered Pho but accidentally ordered the kind with raw meat. They were so nice and brought me the kind with cooked beef. They have the best pork fried rice and lemon grass chicken. Can get pretty busy but not overly loud. Fast service. When you go to a restaurant and there are a lot of Vietnamese eating there that must be a good sign.
