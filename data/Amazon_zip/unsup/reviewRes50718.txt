This place is superbly executed! From the ample cocktail menu to the starters to the entrees, everything is cajun to the core! I had the pleasure of dining here last week, and very attentive and knowledgeable service helped us sample of bit of everything. In terms of starters, the shrimp is not to go unnoticed, nor are the ribs or gumbo for a main course. If you are looking for a solid cajun experience from cocktail through desert, Big Jones cannot be beat!
