I am not a fancy schmancy cocktail drinker. I will almost always favor a glass of wine or something simple like an extra dirty martini. But when I booked my trip to Chicago, a friend insisted that I go to "the bar with the best cocktails in the world," and he was absolutely right. We sat at the darkly lit bar with the mysterious ambiance and let Patrick, a seriously talented mixologist, guide our decisions. My stomach was feeling a little off from 3 nights of revelry, so he suggested a shot of fernet to soothe my belly, which was perfect. We had the Juliet and Romeo, Dark and Stormy, and a custom Patrick creation which was a variation on the Manhattan. Watching Patrick do his thing, I realized that the presenation of each drink was markedly unique, from the individually broken ice cubes for every champagne cocktail (yes, he broke each ice cube with the back of the spoon), to the precisely placed rose water drops in my Juliet and Romeo, to the adorable tennis ball sized ice cube in my Manhattan. Relative to LA, Vegas, SF,etc., I think the $12 cost per drink is actually very reasonable. Yes, it's hard to find and our cab driver had to circle the block a couple of times before we realized it was where a bunch of people were standing against the wall. And yes, there are no reservations, but it is absolutely worth the wait.
