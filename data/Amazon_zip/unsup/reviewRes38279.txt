I like thin crust pizza. But before I get Yelp rocks thrown at me, I am proud to say I dove in whole heartedly into a famous deep dish with no signs of slowing. We got a stuffed cheese and sausage pizza and it was divine. The crust was amazing (like a pie crust and dinner roll) and it was a perfect compliment to the ooey gooeyness of the cheese. The spaghetti and meatballs should also be noted. Yes, I ate that too. In the same sitting. We went at 3:30p and didn't have to wait very long to get seated, served or to dig in.
