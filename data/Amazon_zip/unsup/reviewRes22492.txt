I'm heading back here to try more things, especially the specifically Costa Rican dishes, but what I've had here is terrific. The vegetable burrito is really outstanding, far superior to any veg. burrito I've had in Chicago (the plantains, for instance, aren't something I customarily see in a veggie burrito). Service is good and fun. Really can't go wrong here.
