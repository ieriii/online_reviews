Any place that servers Brinner [0] has to get crazy mad props. We've been meaning to come here for ages, well since the Damen stop closed for the Brown Line Project renovation. I always found it curious that a restaurant would go through some much pains to promote their cereal box collection. It was one of the many odd things about it. The other is the name diner. My expectations were thrown completely off. The kind of food they serve is ANY thing but dinner food. I am not keen on seafood but our dinner companion really loved his tuna. I devoured *gracelessly too I might add* my steak -yes it was that good. Glenn's diner is a hidden gem and I am sure the Damen Line stop closing has helped improve its stock. I wager that a lot of the people that frequented it hate my kind but that's par for the course. I have lost many a good restaurant to "the hordes" so its fair for me to inflict it on others. I will return because the dessert looked tempting... but they serve you a VERY healthy portion. They lose half a star and its nitpicky but I like to remain consistent. Your beer selection could be improved but kudos to you for letting me bring my own booze. Also the seating does suck on heavy nights. [0] Breakfast at dinner.
