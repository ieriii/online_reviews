Best chicken tikka masala in town. Seriously. The naan bread is super awesome as well. Outside is a little crunchy and flaky but inside is so soft and moist. service is great as well. I've had the same busboy every time I went here and he never lets our water glass get empty. The lunch buffet is a great deal with so many options to choose from. Atmosphere is great, drinks are dangerously strong, and service is wonderful. What's not to love?
