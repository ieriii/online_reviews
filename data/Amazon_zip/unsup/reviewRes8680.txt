I knew the second I walked in and saw the wood-fired oven that would cook my pizza, that I would be in for a treat. They had a impressive list of combo options for the toppings, and the crust was perfectly thin. Normally, I'd say their pizzas could feed two, but my friend and I were both hungry and polished off one a piece.
