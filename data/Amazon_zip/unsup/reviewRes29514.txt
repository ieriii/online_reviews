opart is consistently delicious. cheap, fast, & yummy. my fave is the sweet potato curry. i get it with brown rice, tofu & chicken & i'll tell you what....that is some good chicago winter comfort food right there buddy. & who doesn't like a byo? i mean....... p.s.- they have the best tom ka kai-sp in town. oh my goodness...it's the most perfect balance of spicy & sour & coconut milk....i could live off of it if i had to have only one thing for the rest of my life.
