I was very disappointed with this place! From the crazy loud atmosphere to the people bumping into you as they walk by. I felt like I was in a frat house back in college. We waited forever to sit down, I don't care how good the mac and cheese is. No food is worth having to scream to talk with your friends you are sitting at the table with!I thought the food was average and for all the negatives I'd rather skip this place all together!
