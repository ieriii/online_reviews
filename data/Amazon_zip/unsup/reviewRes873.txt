I dragged my whole family to Doug's on a 95 degree day. The line was well around the building but fortunately we were in the shade for most of the wait. The menu is pretty impressive with various meats (dogs and sausages), cooking methods, toppings and specials. My son and I each had the Fanny Valette (a special with Chicken Chorizo, Mole a la Carlos and Queso Asadero). I also had a Chicago Style Dog with everything plus peppers. My wife had the Blueberry and Merlot Venison Sausage with Blackberry Mustard and Smoked Gouda Cheese. And we ordered cheese fries and regular fries. The dogs/sausages were outstanding. Very creative and flavorful. The fries were very good, especially the cheese fries, and the portions were very generous.  We spent about $40 on 4/5 people (one of my daughters just picked on fries) and we left quite full. The wait was pretty brutal and while I wouldn't do it in that heat again, it was worth it. Doug knows dogs!
