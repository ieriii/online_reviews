Wow, was this the same place I wrote about before? I had the big texan - definitely enough meat to satisfy me. great beer selection, although my lambic was a bit smaller than I expected (i expected larger from the tap... oh well). The fries are hit or miss.. girlfriend had the truffle fries (amazing) but I had the chipotle. The chipotle had a very strange taste to them... not spicy or salty, just strange.
