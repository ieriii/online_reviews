Year after year I seem to find myself celebrating my birthday at Wilde. Not only do I always receive great service, the atmosphere is perfect for the time of year my birthday falls on. The restaurants Irish theme is something that a boy from the south side can appreciate :) . From the kids menu for my younger sister and the corn beef and cabbage special on St. Patty's day, Wilde is a place where the food selection fits every member of my families needs. Every year in early March my family will continue to visit Wilde for my birthday.
