We have dined at Longman several times over the past 2 years. I keep coming back (and recommending to others) because, despite the increasing wait times, the cocktails and food have been extraordinarily delicious. Well, my opinion has changed. Two Saturdays ago we went to L&E with another couple for dinner. When we arrived at 7pm, we were quoted a 2 hour wait time. Fine, we have come to expect this, so we went around the corner to another fine Logan Square wine bar to have some noshes and wine while we waited. We returned promptly at 8:50 to check on our table, and at this point, the host quoted us another 1.5 hour wait. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? If it was going to be 3 1/2 hours at 7pm, we would have left to go elsewhere at that time (or stayed at Telegraph). But instead, we were screwed by the incompetent hosting team who can't estimate time/demand. Thanks for leaving us in the lurch, Longman. Such reprehensible service.
