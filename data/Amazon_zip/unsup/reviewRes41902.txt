As part of Restaurant Week, I took my family that was in town to try this place out. We were seated shortly after we had gotten there, which had not been the case for a couple other places that I made reservations at. We were taken upstairs where it's a bit more quiet and secluded. I liked it better than downstairs on the main floor because we were actually able to hear each other talk and have conversation. The prix fixe menu was quite good with a choice of the lobster seafood gumbo and the salad. I felt that the gumbo might be a little heavy and opted for the salad. It was slightly bland, but the filet more than made up for it. My dad's chicken dish was also good, and my sister seemed to enjoy the prime rib. The mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mushroom sides were very flavorful as well. We could barely fit anymore in our stomachs, but made room for dessert. We had the chocolate mousse cheesecake and the bread pudding. My mom liked the bread pudding so much that she wants me to look up a recipe for her. The portions were huge, so we took a couple of them home. Our server George was super sweet and very on the ball. He didn't rush us, but got our food very promptly. The prices are very fair for steak and if I would come at any other time I don't think I'd feel overcharged like some other places.
