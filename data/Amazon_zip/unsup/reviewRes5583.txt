With 300+ reviews already, Purple Pig really doesn't need my vote, but I'm posting anyway just so my friend see that we have eaten there. We met an out-of-town cousin there for dinner, and the three of us all agreed that it was an excellent dining option downtown. The wine list had a lot of interesting (and some reasonable priced) options, and the 8-9 dishes we tasted were consistently fantastic. I also agree that the noise levels and no reservations policy are cons, but the food warrants all five stars. You're going to pay higher prices downtown in general (unless you eat at the Marquette Inn), so you might as well go somewhere that takes its food seriously.
