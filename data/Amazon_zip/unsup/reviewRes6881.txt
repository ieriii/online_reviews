This place is fantastic at a pretty good price. The best course may have been the appetizers that they provide every table: chips and pickles. I was really hungry, but the chips were fantastic. I had the Kobe sliced brisket with just the right amount of fat around the edges. It was average, but the four sauces served with it were fantastic. I took half of the brisket home and they gave me a sauce cup to go with it. The sides of cornbread and coleslaw were better than the brisket, but I always tend to like the sides better than the meat. I left in a coma and I will be back.
