They tricked me. It was a combination of the words "World Famous," as well as seeing the huge line-up. I fell for the trap as most tourists do. I came in and had to wait 1 hr and 15 mins to be seated. You order the pizza 45 mins before you are to be seated, since it takes 40 mins to heat up. We ordered the Special, as its supposed to be famous, and I've had the exact same pizza at Patxi's Pizza in San Francisco, and wanted to do a comparison. Patxi's Pizza kills this place, by far!!! The pizza we got was cold in the middle. Can you imagine chewing on just a brick of chewy, cold mozzarella cheese? The sauce on top was thin, and only the cheese on the top was stretchy, but in the middle was cold. The crust was ok, nice and flakey, but who eats just the crust?!? We complained to the manager, who made us bring our pizza down to him in the front, through the crow. He then said "Well what do you want me to do with this? Do you want me to re-heat it?" Um....Dumb A$$, well if you dont reheat it, you tell me what my options are?!? I should have made him eat it in front of all the patrons, so everyone could see him struggle to swallow it with a smile. Anyways, needless to say, we left there without even eating 1 slice each, as the reheated pizza was only warm on the exterior and top, but once again, doing nothing for the cold middle. $28 out of our pockets, no apologies, and a stomach full of just mozzarella; and the sad part was, this was our only experience with Chicago style pizza in Chicago. If I had to vote San Francisco vs Chicago and who makes the best Chicago style pizza, my vote goes to San Francisco.
