Let me start by saying that I wish I would have reviewed this place the two times I've been there for drinks before because they would have been 4 star experiences. But last night was ridiculous! Inexcusable! It was 7 PM on a Tuesday night. My friend and I met there after work,. We sat in the comfy chairs like we always do and 2 other people were sitting at the bar. We waited 25 minutes and no one acknowledged our existence. We tried to catch someone's eye. Servers walked back and forth, the bartender mindlessly wiped the bar and started into space.  And for the prices they charge I should not have to flag down a waiter and beg him to get me a drink. "Excuse me, sir? Can you please get me an overpriced drink. Pretty please? I'll be your best friend." Um, no way. You should be Johnny on the freakin' spot at an upscale hotel. Especially with a whopping 4 PEOPLE to serve. Not that it matters probably, but my friend and I were dressed appropriately. Jeans and a cute top.  After 30 min. of waiting. We walked over to Bijan's across the street. The waitress remembered me as I used to go there for lunch quite a bit last year. The drinks, food, and service were fantastic, as always. After I finish this review, I am going to write a STELLAR review for Bijan's.  Dana... you have a lot of making up to do.
