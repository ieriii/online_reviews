Okay, so I'm from the south. I'll say it. I am! We brunched at Big Jones, largely because the lines everywhere was long. So...there were good things and bad things. With a mobility impairment, getting around Chicago...especially in the rain...isn't the best, and the owner was acting as hostess and he was really nice. Our waiter stunk to high heaven, and we waited a good 20 minutes for a coffee. Black. No cappuccino...black coffee. He was nice though, so he felt bad...the beignets, were engulfed... The food was good, but being someone that really loves southern food and is thereby critical of it....no heat. Smidge of heat off the sausage in my omelet, but you look at anduiolle sausage you're looking for heat. Perhaps too much old bay in the veins, it's hard to say. Okay. Back to the highly critical part? I waited 45 minutes for my desert. Now, they make it to order, so I can deal with a wait...25-30 minutes. I think our waiter forgot about us. For someone that loves red velvet cake so much she had it as her wedding cake. I wasn't impressed. Overall good place, would go back, but it wasn't really worth the crazy prices.
