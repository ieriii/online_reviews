this business has declined in customer service!! i have been a faithful customer to this restaurant for many years even before they had remolded it. i went to garcias with my family and as soon as we arrived the waitress saw us and didn't acknowledge us! a waiter who was taking a order from another table saw us and apologized on her behalf, he said she had just finished arguing with another coworker. how unprofessional was that!, i was still listening to them argue in spanish, and to make matters worse she ended up being our waitress. she had such a horrible attitude, and got our orders mixed up. the worst part is i went to talk to the manager about the experience and it was this young guy which i don't think he was the manager, and he said was "i'll talk to her". so unprofessional, the food really isn't worth the horrible customer service. i have visited a restaurant called quinta de los reyes located in ber wyn il after this experience, and wow!! , what a difference authentic food and the best part is fresh guacamole and salsa prepared at your table!!, and not to mention amazing customer service!
