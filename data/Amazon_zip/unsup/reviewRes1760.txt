Waited in line for 1 hour outside the door (on a Saturday, at 2pm, in 30 degrees + blowing rain/snow), then waited about 1/2 hour inside, just to get to order. The waits were absolutely worth it. Traditional dogs were the best I've had in the city. Exotic hot dogs were also fantastic. The BLT Dog tasted just like the sandwich. Duck Fat fries are, as everybody else is saying on Yelp, amazing and are a must try. The owner is extremely friendly and made me easily forget how cold my fingers and toes were. You must go. Bring a group of friends whom you need to catch up with, because you'll have plenty of time.
