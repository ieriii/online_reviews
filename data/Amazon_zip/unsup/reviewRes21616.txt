I have to admit, Mexican food is not usually my first choice when I eat out. But, when I am in the mood for it, this is the place I go. The food is great, and reasonably priced. And the drinks--I don't think I've been to a place with more margarita choices... lime, mango, peach, raspberry, strawberry, tamarind, jamaica flower, and banana. I haven't tried them all, but the ones that I have are great! Fruity, but very strong--absolutely perfect.
