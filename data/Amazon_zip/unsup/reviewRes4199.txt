This might be my favorite restaurant ever... It's a tiny, simple unpretentious place with food that can compete with the best of them (think Alinea quality). Plus it's BYOB! I've been here 3 times with groups from 4-8 and it's always been unbelievable. I was lucky enough to go with wine connoisseurs each time, which made this place even more amazing. They have an open kitchen and the whole staff interacts with you. The owner, Michael is so friendly and has always been so hospitable, they make you feel like you're a guest in their home, they are that welcoming! I guess I should touch on the food a bit... I've had so many things here, but my favorite that really stands out would be the beer and cheese soup served with a pretzel... so heavenly! Everything I've tasted by them has been fabulous, but it's been over a year since my last visit so it's hard to go into detail. This is my #1 place to visit next time I'm in Chicago, hands down
