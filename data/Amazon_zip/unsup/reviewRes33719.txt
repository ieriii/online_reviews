About the only thing I remember about this restaurant was that it was extremely noisy. The noise level was so high, it almost hurt. The music is played very loudly so everyone has to yell to be heard over it. I asked the waitress to have the music turned down, and if anything, it got even louder. I could barely understand what was being said by the other three people at my table. I don't know how anyone could enjoy their food in this type of an atmosphere. Update: I have gone back a few times and agree they have good food. But I would recommend going during not peak hours because of the loudness. Everyone I go with agrees that the noise levels are unacceptable
