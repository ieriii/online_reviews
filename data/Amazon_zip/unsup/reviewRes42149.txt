It was a Tuesday at about 6pm that my boyfriend and I decided to check Gilt out. We were reservation-less but figured - it's a tuesday and it's 6pm so maybe they can fit us in? Well they did, at a "table" that measures about 32" in diameter, is two feet from the ground and is scalloped at the edges (I ate holding my plate -as if I were at a street fest). SERVICE: Our waitress was too busy sampling wine to bother with us. When she did decide to take care of us her attitude could not have been more careless: "Did you guys want to order some food?" --uh yeah, that's why we're here. FOOD: I gave Gilt two starts because my bf enjoyed his meal (pork belly - so how can you go wrong?). I ordered the salmon, which was incredibly salty (or was it just some of the attitude this place emits?).  AMBIANCE: Dark.
