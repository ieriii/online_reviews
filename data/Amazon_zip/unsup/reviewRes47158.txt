I am being generous with three stars, because the food is fresh, the waitstaff friendly, and the atmosphere is hip, airy and cheerful. It's a nice, upscale addition to the 'hood. But as other reviewers have mentioned, the prices are downright unreasonable, a very poor value. My husband had huevos rancheros and coffee and I had mac & cheese for brunch, and the bill came to about $40. We both ordered sides of potatoes (I had fries, he had breakfast potatoes), and that tacked on $8 to the bill. Breakfast eggs should come with potatoes, and a small side of fries should not cost $4. The mac and cheese was very pedestrian, bland and $12...I can make a whole pyrex of cheesier, tastier stuff for probably less than that. The prices all seem about a third higher than what they ought to be.  It was a nice special date for Mother's Day weekend, and we would love to come back and try other dishes and enjoy the atmosphere, but who can afford it? Sticking with Tre Kroner instead...
