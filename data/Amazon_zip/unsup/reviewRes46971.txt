I didn't hear about Uncommon Ground until I actually went there for a Fair Trade Mixer a few months back. The cozy atmosphere was apparent, and even though I only had a plain salad to eat (wasn't that hungry) I knew this place was a winner. I came back a month or so later with my girlfriend and her parents and had a WONDERFUL meal. The help was friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu was full of awesome locally grown items. I had the fish and chips and the fish was so tender and full of flavor. My girlfriend had a burger with some kind of bacon that was just ridiculously good. Whether you're out with a group of friends or on a date, Uncommon Ground is going to satisfy you.
