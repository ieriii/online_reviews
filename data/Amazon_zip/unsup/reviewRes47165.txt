I've died and gone to burger heaven. I enjoy a good gourmet burger now and then and the Lockdown has satisfied me. I met a couple of buddies for an early dinner and enjoyed a pre meal alcoholic beverage. They carry a weekly choice of Three Floyds suds on tap, but they seemed to have run out fairly quickly and we missed out. I didn't panic, I ordered one of my favorite stouts, Left Hand Milk Stout. Delicious. Luckily, my first trip to the Lockdown was on half-priced burger Tuesday. Score. I opted for the Electric Chair, a burger topped with bleu cheese, jalapeo relish, and buffalo sauce. Score again. I enjoyed my meal in their small, but cute patio. The weather couldn't have cooperated any better on this particular day. Score once again. With all this scoring, who wouldn't want to go back. There's plenty of other gourmet burgers to try, so you can count on me being a regular at the Lockdown. That's right Punk Bitch, I'm coming back for ya (with my personal shank)!!
