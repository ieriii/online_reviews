I am truly impressed, not only with the venue but also the management here !!!! I had the pleasure of being a guest as well as one of the vendors on their Farmer's Friday market here, and they truly went out of their way to make me feel welcome and supported. About the venue as a guest ; Enjoy the food here and the out door seating, great waitstaff and beautiful room. Love the intimate live concerts room, great place for a date. About the management as a vendor : I have never felt more welcome and supported during an event, ever!!! I always dread setting up during outdoor events, especially when I know I would be doing it alone. They were well organized, help me unload the car, set up, take down and everything in between, all without me ever asking for help. Many Thanks to the owners Mike and Helen for your hospitality. I have one small suggestion, please make sure the guests in your concert room know NOT TO TALK during performances. Love this place, highly recommend it and looking forward going back.
