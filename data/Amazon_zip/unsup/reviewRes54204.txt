On the weekends we like to drive into the city and hang out with friends and boy are we glad we walked into this place!They have a colorful and cozy little place with this awesome outdoor enclosed and heated seating section decked out in lights. The best part is that they're BYOB. I went with the Casado, a delicious dish with grilled onions on a bed of Costa Rican rice and a cracked egg. That's right, juicy yellow egg goodness drizzling on my rice and plantains. And it's $12. A giant plate of meat and grilled peppers, onions, rice, egg, plantains and cabbage salad. I want to go back every weekend!
