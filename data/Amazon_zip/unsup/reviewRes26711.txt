It was the boyfriend's birthday last weekend and we had lengthy conversations about where to head to dinner. Our ultimate conversation went like this: BF: "I recently decided where I want to go to dinner. I can't remember though..." Goes silent as he is deep in thought. Me: "Is it Pequod's?" {I know this man and he loves his pizza.} BF: Shakes his head... still thinking. BF: "I know! I want to go to Pequod's." Me: Ah ha! Our visit did not disappoint, either. We had a sausage and green pepper pizza and it was amazeballs.  Pequod's has such tasty pizza, due in large part to the fresh ingredients and the caramelized cheese on top. It is simply delicious. On this visit we were surprised to learn that Pequod's has an ENORMOUS upstairs dining room. Seriously - it's huge.  It doesn't get much better than Pequod's. Yum.
