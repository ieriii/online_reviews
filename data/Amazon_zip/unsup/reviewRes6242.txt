My husband and I went on a Tuesday night. We were able to get seated right away but by the time we left it was packed! Food was unique and all were tasty! We had the bruchette with the ragu of the day, a venison dish and 2 different pastas. I rated this as ok since I have had better pasta on Taylor Street but it is a cute restaurant and I would go again with my husband and a group of girlfriends. Food is meant to be shared and it was explained that food was meant to be served "tapas" style. Waitress was great and as explained in other reviews, all were in street clothes and hard to know who was serving and who was a patron.
