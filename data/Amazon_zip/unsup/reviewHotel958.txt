The three major deciding factors in choosing this hotel over others in the area were 1) free wifi 2) free continental breakfast and 3) proximity to all the popular Chicago sights. Wifi was spotty in some areas of my second floor room but I can't complain because other hotels in the same price range were charging $10-15/day. While many hotels that boast continental breakfast end up having meager offerings, Amalfi's breads, pastries, fruit, yogurt, and drinks were abundant and helped us jump start our days of sight seeing. This also helped us save a money instead of going out every day to buy breakfast. My boyfriend and I do not have any finicky requests when staying at hotels. All we need is a comfy bed to sleep in at night to recharge for the next days activities. If you're a tourist this will be the perfect hotel for you. All of the major sights are within walking distance. Magnificent Mile (5-10 min), Sears Tower (20 min), John Hancock (15-20 min), Millennium Park (15-20 min) - all VERY walkable (which you should do to walk off all that yummy Chicago food!). Also, Trader Joe's is a mere 5 minute walk away if you need to stock up on 17 cent water bottles to keep yourself hydrated as you explore Chicago. Walk south for about 5 minutes and you'll be at the Blue line which gets you to and from O'Hare in 45 minutes. The Red line is also very close by. Although we did not ask for much, the staff was very nice and helpful. We had an issue with one of our keys not working and they were apologetic and immediately helped resolve the problem. Very satisfied with my stay here!
