If you visit Lao Sze Chuan, YOU MUST TRY the mayonnaise shrimp, best i've tasted, DELICIOUS. If you like and can handle spicy, the mapo tofu is really good. I've tried various other dishes and they've all been really good. You should def come here with friends and do family style, so you can taste all the different dishes. I always also get shrimp fried rice, and a vegetable dish such as the garlic spinach or watercress. I think it's kind of pricey if you come in 2, compared to the other chinese restaurants in chinatown. The wait is pretty long and there's a lot of people, but I think its worth it. I didn't really like their hot pot. But if you're craving their mayonnaise shrimp, I can suggest no alternative.
