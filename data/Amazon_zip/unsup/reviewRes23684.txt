I've lived in the neighborhood for 5 years and have driven or walked past this restaurant and always said, "hmmm, I want to try it" and finally I went. We had a table of 5 on the covered patio on a June night. Service was bad. I don't know if our guy had an off night, or what but he was a total space cadet. We'd ask for a plate and an extra set of silverware and he'd bring just the silverware. He didn't check in on us and our waters were never refilled. Finally management must have noticed because they switched servers on us. The food was good, but it didn't blow my mind. I got the spicy fish tacos that our server RAVED about and when it came to the table, I thought it and the cuban rice was pretty bland... not spicy at all. The salsa was great but it was a little weird to have to squeeze it onto every chip from a bottle, rather than having a bowl. The empanadas were delish! Two things to note:BYOB and they only accept cash and there's not an atm very nearby (big negative in my book). I might go back here to give it another chance, but it really didn't live up to my hopes.
