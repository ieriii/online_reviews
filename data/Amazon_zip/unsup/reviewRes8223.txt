DELICIOUS!!! The pizza is super fresh here! And they have outdoor patio seating! I usually never order pizza at restaurants, but this pizza was great! Was a great lunchtime place~ Each pizza is like personal size and quite big. (Haha but I still finished it.. :D) It was thin and light, but flavorful! And you could tell the ingredients were very fresh. I got the pizza with the mushrooms and Italian sausage which I highly recommend. Also there were several vegetarian options as well :) The only thing is that the menu is simple and doesn't have anything super creative or fancy, so keep an ear out for the specials!
