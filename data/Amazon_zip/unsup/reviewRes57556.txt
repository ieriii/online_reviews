John and I have been here at least five times in the past year or so now and it's great every time. It's wonderful just the two of us to have a nice long delicious meal. But it's also a good place for a special dinner with friends. If you go early in the evening you can get a booth (which is much nicer than the tables) without a reservation. Otherwise definitely call ahead. The service is always top notch when we've been here.Once things pick up there is a live Spanish guitar performance up front (which you can hear through out the restaurant). That always sets the mood for a relaxing night out.The food and wine list are always great as well. I won't stop recommending Gejas!
