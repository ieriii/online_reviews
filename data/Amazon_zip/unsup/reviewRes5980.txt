Excellent meal, great ambiance (though a little loud), and good service. I had the encrusted halibut and my husband had the trio of tenderloins (encrusted with parmesan, horseradish, blue cheese respectively). Both dishes were beyond this world. We also had the Wildfire Chopped Salad. You must try this salad... it is unique and oh-so-delicious! Parking is difficult, given the location. Also, you absolutely must have reservations. I have called a week in advance and my desired timeslot was unavailable for my party of 2. I have heard great things about the martinis here, so I will trying those next!
