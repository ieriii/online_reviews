This review is only for lunch as I have not eaten brunch or dinner there. The lunch was great. The crowd was very lively and a mix of tourist and business people. The space is great, long bar in the front and a side room. I had the Gage Burger and it was fantastic. Since this was the first time there for both of us we did have some questions and I felt the server was very professional and gave great suggestions. I will certainly be back and would bring clients there as well.
