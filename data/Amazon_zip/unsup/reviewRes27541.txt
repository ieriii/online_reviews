Amazing! Great ambiance and memorable food. Wife and I shared sopes rancheros and guac for appetizers. Sopes were full of flavor and the guac was "interesting" with the addition of sun dried tomatoes I think. Main course 1. Pescado en Mole Chabacano with swordfish. Wow one of best fish dishes ever. Perfectly cooked and I quote my wife "flavors were dancing in my mouth" 2. Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. just what I expected. Mole was earthy, sweet, savory, etc...... Waitress was also kind enough to give some extra mole cause it was so good,
