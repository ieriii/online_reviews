Demera was doing a nice business the night we visited -- they've been getting into "daily deal" coupons to the point that the server asked if we were using a Groupon (which we weren't) so that she might explain our options. Ah, the times. We did enjoy the food, but the service was so-so (possibly due to the full house). We chose to eat indoors, but I would probably choose outdoor seating if I had a do-over because the air-conditioning vents along the inside walls were blowing frigid air down on the perimeter tables. We ordered a meat/veggie sampler with appetizer and dessert, but the server must have misheard us, so we received just the sampler. No big deal -- it was plenty of food for the two of us. Everything was flavorful, fresh and pleasing, though the food did take longer than I expected to arrive. Our server was rather reserved, not what I would call cordial. We had a bottle of pinotage from the compact, value-priced wine list -- it was a good match for the food, but was served warmer than room temperature (a sign that it had been stored in a hot part of the building -- not helpful for the wine's flavors). All in all, it was an OK meal. The food was as good as any Ethiopian fare I've had in Chicago in the past couple of years.
