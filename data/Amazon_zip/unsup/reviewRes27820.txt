Absolute best deep-dish pan pizza in Chicago. Caramelized crust adds some char flavor and saltiness but doesn't overwhelm the pizza itself. Think Lou Malnati's times five (LM x 5 = awesome). This is just Chicago pizza done right, at an affordable price, with an incredibly large serving of food. A large pan and a few beers could easily feed a half dozen happy people.
