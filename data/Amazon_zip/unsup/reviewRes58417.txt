Wish I could give 4.5 stars. I have yet to try the whole menu, but cafe 28 has my favorite dish in chicago - the duck tenderloin with portabella mushroom sauce. Mojitos. Awesome food. Great cevice. Good service. Go here for an awesome night (where the price is definitely a bit lower than downtown, yet you'll have a great experience). If I were ever on check please I would do this place, but it has already been done. Take friends/ dates/ whomever you please to this place and you won't be disappointed.
