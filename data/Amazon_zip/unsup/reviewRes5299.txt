I'm not quite sure how to describe this place. It's like little pieces of awesome deep fried in delicious with spicy bits of outrageous tastyness (that means it's good). It was described as "Soul Food", but only if that soul food went to school at Le Cordon Blue and spent a wicked summer in Italy getting wasted on wine and eating late night cheese sandwiches with it's junky room mate (that means it's eclectic). The servers are fun and laid back like Jack Tripper meets Mr. Belvedere (that means they are cool). You'll like it (that means you'll like it). Actually you'll love it (that means I was wrong last time. It means you'll love it...unless I'm wrong this time). (stop reading parentheticals and go to The Purple Pig. It's delicious)
