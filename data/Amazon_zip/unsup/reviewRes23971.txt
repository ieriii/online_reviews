You have to try their double-fried green plaintains with roasted garlic! They are savory, crispy, salty bites of garlicky-goodness...mmmm. I usually order the Gallo Pinto, which is white rice mixed with whole black beans, served with eggs or sweet fried plantains. I ask for BOTH eggs and sweet plaintains (trust me, it's really good). I've had their Oatmeal shake with milk. It's tastes like a sweet oatmeal horchata; loved the cinnamon mixed in. The Pepito sandwich was yummy, as well. It consists of rib eye steak, sauteed onions, cheese, pinto beans & Lizano sauce. You can't go wrong with that combination. My only complaint is that the guacamole is bland, lacking salt and acidity. If you're going to order it, try it with their green salsa :)
