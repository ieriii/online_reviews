We went here for a birthday dinner. I saw it featured on tv, I believe on Check Please, so I made sure I put it on my list of places to try. In summary, I thought it had good ribs, with 4 different sauces to try. I didn't really taste the difference in the signature competition ribs and the regular ribs, but maybe my palate is not refined enough. I also tried the brisket which was good. We had appetizers too, which were good. Shrimp and grits were awesome.
