When I first moved to Chicago I was somewhat off-put about the Mexican food I found in the city that was until I found Garcia's. Now the food is pretty good but the price is just right. The salsa is actually decently spicy which is saying a lot because I'm from Texas. You get a ton of food for the price. This is about the closest thing to Tex-Mex in Chicago, but even then it is a bit on the bland side. Still I always came here when I was missing my hometown when I lived in Chicago. The margaritas while not the best in the city will totally kick your butt at least. The price is really what sells this place, the food is good for the price.
