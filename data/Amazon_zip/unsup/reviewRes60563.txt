This is one of my favorite restaurants. I am big on restaurant appearance, cleanliness and presentation of food. They score 10+++.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and definitely Grand. The location and views are excellent for those in downtown Chicago. The menu is Grand, and every option is available Grand in size. The staff are always good but can be a little too fast paced or appearing as though they don't have a second to spare. Although, I'm very petite, when I like something... I love it... and don't like to be slighted, so I love there portions. You don't feel slighted in the portions when it comes to appetizers, drinks or your entree. Most often, you're full before your entree if you order an appetizer. I am always guaranteed to take some home with me and rarely make it to dessert. But I will have to say that the desserts are excellent and rich.The prices are uncomparable and very affordable. The taste of each dish is memorable and filling. I've never left unhappy.
