If you're looking for pretty good wings this is your place. You don't get your typical wing sauces, and if I had to recommend one go with the Seoul Sassy. But be careful because the wings are split here. So if you order 5 you actually get 10 and ordering 10 gets you 20 wings. Also the buddha bowl was ok. The egg was kinda small and the veggies seemed a little soggy in the rice. Not the best Korean, but I came here for the wings not the bowl. Wait was actually pretty quick for 7pm dinnertime- took about 10 minutes and a communal table was available by the time our food order was ready, and no line surprisingly. But don't expect that every night. Highly recommend for a different change in wing.
