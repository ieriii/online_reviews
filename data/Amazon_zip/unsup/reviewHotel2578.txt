I will preface this by saying I am NOT a club person, but it was a 30th bday, so I was stuck. It was extremely loud, and extremely crowded, and the setup didn't help much with the getting out of the way of either of those things. Odd crowd, very Jersey Shore, but that could have been the night. There was some weird fashion show thing going on. All in all, not my thing.
