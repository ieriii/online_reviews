Always the busiest and most packed restaurant in Argyle. Not only because of its great location on the corner of Broadway & Argyle, but because of their size and splendid menu. The menu is full of pictures is very descriptive. A majority of the food I've eaten here has been tasty, fresh, and true to Vietnamese cuisine, albeit a little spendy compared to other places in the area. My only complaints here is that this seems to be the "in" spot for the non-Vietnamese crowd and service can suffer.The place is crowded nearly any time of the day and when you walk in you're shuffled into any spot they have, even if you end up sharing a table with 2 different groups of strangers. This can be fun if you're an extrovert, but isn't for everyone. I always feel rushed when I eat here. I get in, get whisked away to a table by someone. Someone else later comes to take my order. The food comes out in 10-15 minutes, even for more complicated dishes. This is exceptional, but just as soon as I'm done, I've got a check waiting for me. Because all the servers are interchangeable, even if one is a regular customer it can be hard to build up one of those friendly relationships that one can form from a smaller establishment. Tank Noodle is an example of heavy Vietnamese commercialization at its best. The food is great, the service efficient, but the place is devoid of the warmth and hospitality that Vietnamese people pride themselves on.
