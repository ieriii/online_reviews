As we lay lazily comfy, knowing that there was no way we were going to get up and leave the house for something to eat, we discussed our options. So, smugly saying no to stuffed pizza when the option was thrown out, I was informed that our neighbor Pizzazzeria (yes, pizzazz) made one of the best Spinach-stuffed pizzas in the city home to the Cubs. Stuffed means stuffed crust edges right? Au contraire mon frre, or in this case au contraire ma petite amie, stuffed crust is when...well, you just have to try it. Alright, I give in. After a quick routine phone call and a 70 minute wait, yes, I was surprised about the wait, but I learned this is not abnormal for a specialty stuffed pizza, we were greeted with a small round bundle of mouth-watering deliciousness. Refraining from gluttonous behaviors, I enjoyed my one slice, taking pleasure in every sinful mouthful.  Okay, now I get it :-D
