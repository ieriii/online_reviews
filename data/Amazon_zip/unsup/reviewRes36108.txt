Of course my mind would go to Sun Wah BBQ as I prepare to write my very first yelp review, ever.. it is, simply put, THE best Chinese restaurant you'll find in this extraordinary city. It's what you call, a "gem" in an otherwise sea of abject wannabes. You don't have to have grown up with daily East-Asian meals to know what I mean. When you have the hankering, how difficult is it to find really good bbq pork friend rice? -Or really good stir-fried noodles? It's darn near impossible to do, with all the corner food-to-go's replacing good old fashion sit-down restaurants that once served jasmine tea at the table and condiments not irritatingly sealed in impossible-to-open plastic packets. In a city that boasts an increasing number of award-winning restaurants, where does one go for a cheap eat that's worth the splurge, but doesn't require it?? In comes Sun Wah. The menu selections are seemingly endless, but accessible with the help of colorful depictions. Prices here are unbeatable.  Particularly notable is the peking duck dinner -comprised of a whole roasted duck, carved at the table and artistically served with warm sticky buns, spring onions, fresh carrots, and delicious hoisin sauce. It's served not once, but transformed into a second winter melon duck soup and a third duck friend rice. If gluttony had a name, thou would'st be called "Sun Wah!" On several occasions, my boyfriend and I have attempted to tackle the entire meal between the two of us. It's no surprise, our attempts have always been to no avail. For anyone out there interested in a highly memorable culinary excursion, give Sun Wah a try -and don't be afraid to break out last year's pair of stretchy pants -you'll thank me for that later! Happy eating!
