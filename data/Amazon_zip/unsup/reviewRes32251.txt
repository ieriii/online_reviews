Why can't everyone cook fish the way they cook it here?? Was it freakin' ridiculously cooked extremely well and did it taste phenomenal? Why yes it did!! Let's get the bad down and dirty stuff right away, but then get to the greatness of this restaurant. Cons: Service - slow. BUT hey, Friday night, trendy, awesome restaurant, the place was packed!! BUT they made up for it as you will read. It was loud in there too. It was one big large room, music playing, voices bouncing and echoing off the walls... but towards the end of the night, it wasn't so bad anymore. Food - it took a while for the food to come out and it came out sporadically, our side dish came out before the entree ... weird huh? Pros: Since it took us about 30 minutes to sit down since we had 10 in our reservation and the table that we were waiting for was taking forever to leave, they compensated us by giving us appetizers on the house. How awesome is that?? Pass the Rock Shrimp Tempura please ... that is what they hooked us up with and the edamame. The rock shrimp could have been my entree alone, this dish was so good. I generally don't eat too much shrimp, but my god, I could eat this all day long. I ordered the Cod ... it was like eating ice cream ... it just melts in your mouth. They cook their fish perfectly and it tasted amazing. Since food took a while to come out, they gave us more rock shrimp and FREE desserts!! three kinds to be exact!! molten lava cake, thai ice cream puffs, and a custard/flan like dessert. SOOOO good!! The only way a restaurant can make up in bad service is by giving free food away, giving a future gift certificate for use, or by not charging for some items. Sunda went above and beyond in correcting their mistakes and it definitely makes you want to come back!! Of course only restaurants of this caliber are willing to fix their mistakes like that ... mediocre ones just apologize, but do they have repeat customers? I will definitely come back to Sunda.
