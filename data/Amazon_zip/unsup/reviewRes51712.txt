Garcias is a solid 3.5 stars. 3 stars if I'm sober and 4 stars if I'm drunk. The bathrooms are really nice and it's open fairly late, all plusses when intoxicated. I had the spinach burrito, because I think that's the best thing they have. It doesn't taste Mexican at all though. It needs to be drowned in salsa because it's a little dry otherwise. But it was tasty, and hot. I'd eat it again sometime. Basically, I wouldn't travel out of my way to come here, but it is good enough that I'd come back for the spinach burrito if I was either A) right there or B) drunk and hungry in this general area.
