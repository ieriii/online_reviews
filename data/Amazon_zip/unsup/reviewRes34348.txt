Be warned--you'll be waiting in line for a long time to get in here on a weekend. And it gets crazy loud and super crowded in the waiting area. I guess the appeal of the place is that they have very reasonable prices and frankly there are not enough breakfast places downtown. I ordered the huevos rancheros which is an eggs/chorizo/potato type skillet and it was good--not great--but just average. I'd give the service 4 stars. I don't know if the food is worth going back and waiting in line for though.
