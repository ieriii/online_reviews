The burger was great, not the best I've had in the Chicago, but still really good. The brioche French toast is like...an artistic expression from God. I don't know how else to describe just how amazing it is. Other people in our group enjoyed their meals immensely (the beef tongue omelet got great reviews) and the drinks were great. Our server was polite and nice but clearly had little knowledge of the menu (asked her for her opinions on things and essentially looked over our shoulders at the menu and reread the item description) and the food took a while to come out. This place is new and is probably dealing with the problems that most new restaurants have. However, I would highly recommend this place, hands down.
