Tonight was the third time I've been to Big Jones. On the whole the food was still quite good, but not as good as last two times. The menu also seemed to be a lot smaller than when I went before. Their gumbo tonight though was absolutely first rate. Unfortunately the service was pretty horrendous. Took us 45 minutes to receive our appetizers. The manager did give us some desserts as an apology, but we were there almost 3 hours which is way too long for that kind of place. 4 stars for the food, 2 stars for the service.
