A few friends and I took off from work one day last summer to watch World Cup games and get rocked while the rest of the city foolishly labored away a beautiful Wednesday. What started out as a few pints at Christina's turned into something of a North Center bar crawl.  Fortunately Bad Apple was there to provide some much needed sustenance (not before we perused and ordered from their solid beer list, though). As this is a burger joint, I got a salad. Actually, I went with "The Hangover", which, with ham, a fried egg, and bacon, is basically a full breakfast on top of a burger.  In keeping with their elaborate burgers, the fries are excellent. Fresh cut and with a bunch of different seasonings to choose from. Remember when it just seemed cool that you could get seasoned fries at a place? Bad Apple laughs at that simplicity; they offer five or six different seasonings. Recommended: sweet & spicy chipotle.  Few people have bad meals after a full day of drinking, but Bad Apple is solid fare. Beers and burgers will always do the job.
