This is a fantastic place to go--I would recommend that everyone try it out once. (But not on a Friday or Saturday night, of course....unless you want to have to wait forever!) I went on a date (good date place for conversation), but I have not felt the need to go back and pay $12/cocktail again. If I have friends coming from out of town, I might bring them. It is a pretty cool place. I'm just not dying to get back in.  One more thing: The entrance is on Damen...not in the back alley! Learned that the hard way. :)
