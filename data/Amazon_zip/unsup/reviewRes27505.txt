i've only been here once but OMG good food. Would go again it's a hike for me though. It's BYOB I don't drink and i was at a table with many drinkers so that's good for me since we split the bill i didn't have to pay for a million drinks that gets added into my portion of the bill. Parking sucks around this joint though and the parking lot fills up fast and sometimes cars get blocked in and takes forever to get to yours.
