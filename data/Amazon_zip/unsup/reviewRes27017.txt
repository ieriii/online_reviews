If you have $10 in your pocket and you want a really good, huge Mexican meal, this is your place. My grandfather used to take my family here. I have seen James Woods, Eriq LaSalle, and Adrianna Margolis here. (Obviously they were taping ER.) BUT it will attest to the deliciousness of this place. It is also BYOB and the liquor store next door has tons o beer and wine. Beware, they do not accept credit cards and the nearest ATM is a block jaunt down the street.
