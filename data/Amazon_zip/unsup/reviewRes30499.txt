I live the American capital of hippie vegetarian/vegan food (San Francisco Bay Area) and there is nothing here to even compare to the Chicago Diner. All of our veggie restaurants here are either a) Morningstar products heated up and put on a plate or b) the most fanciful, expensive and outrageous vegetable concoctions you could ever imagine. Neither is very fun. The Chicago Diner is the perfect, amazing veggie restaurant. All of the food is original and prepared well. I had the seitan medallions over Asian noodles and it was freakin' amazing. And the vegan mint chocolate shake that my boyfriend ordered (and I stole half of) was quite possibly the besk shake (milk, vegan, etc) I had ever tasted in my life -- and I don't even like mint! Seriously, if you are vegetarian and/or vegan make it a goal to eat at the Chicago Diner sometime during your life. It's really that amazing.
