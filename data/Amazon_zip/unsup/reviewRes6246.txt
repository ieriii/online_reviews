Davanti Enoteca had smaller portions, but all delish! I didn't feel overly stuffed and gross after eating. Burrata vasi: fresh mozzarella with cream and evoo.... great! Risotto carbonara...... very tasty (little on the salty side, but i like salty) Sausage rigatoni: My boyfriend loved the quality marinara used in this dish Dessert: Salted caramel panna cotta: Very sweet, but amazing. I am definitely going back and want to try all the other dishes. Yum-o!!!
