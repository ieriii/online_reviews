I have always loved this place. I have been here 3-4 times and the food has always been wonderful. Unfortunately, this last time was different. I ordered an appetizer, which was pretty good, although some of the fresh herbs were starting to go bad. I also ordered a salad, which came with lots of onions that were not mentioned on the menu. I politely told the waitress that I don't eat onions and she offered to bring me another salad. At that point I was full, so she packed it up to go. When I opened it at home, I realized that the onions were in the dressing, which they still included in my salad. Besides that, I found pieces of dirt in the salad and many of the vegetables were not as fresh as I would expect. For this kind of place, I would expect much better quality of food and dirt in my salad is just unacceptable!!
