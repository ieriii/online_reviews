I had never had Cuban food before going to this place so, I was very excited. I had a pork sandwich with plantain chips that was to die for. Full of flavor, fresh- very tasty. I would definitely go there again for the FOOD. Love the atmosphere and decor. Very colorful and interesting. My only reason for 3 stars was the service. Our waiter was extremely rude. I don't remember his name and I don't know if he was having a bad day, but he was very short with us for no reason. We were sat, not prompted about the menu at all and then basically ignored for about 30 minutes before he came back. Our water was empty for most of our meals. Frequently tended to all the tables around us, but NOT me and my 2 friends. He was never engaging or even smiled. He just said, "mm-hmm" anytime we told him something. Needless to say, he did not get a generous tip.
