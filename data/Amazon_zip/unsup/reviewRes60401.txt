Wow... can't believe how many reviews Wakamono has already! It makes sense though- this place is always packed whenever I walk past.I finally stopped in here the other night with a friend to see what all the fuss was about. Well, there's a reason for the fuss. This place is great! Talking about the atmosphere sounds kind of lame, but the design really is calming and beautiful. Even if you sit outside, you still get a really calming experience.Ok, so to the good part- the food! We ordered the crab rangoon (has a slightly different name- but that's what it is) and it was delicious. The edges were crispy but the center was moist and yummy.We aren't big sushi people, so we played it a bit safe with our selection. We ordered a regular tuna and avocado maki (my fav), the sweet potato maki, and a spicy trio roll. I wanted to compare the tuna to other places I usually get sushi (Whole Foods... yeah, I know). I can safely say the basic tuna roll at Wakamono is the best tuna I've had. The sweet potato was pretty unique, and definitely was a good choice for breaking up all the fish. I recommend it if you're unsure about getting a bunch of fish.They also had a special on house wine, $4 for a glass was not too bad. Overall, I had a very enjoyable dinner at Wakamono and recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable yet great sushi experience.
