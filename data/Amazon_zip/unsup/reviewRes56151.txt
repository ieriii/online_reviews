Authentic, flavorful Algerian savory and dessert crepes, wonderful soups, fresh OJ and fresh roasted organic coffee.Ingredients are fresh, the lamb sausage wonderful.It was in the crepe i ordered with sauted multicolored peppers and goat cheese. Nicely decorated corner storefront, so natural lighting in the day timeand you get to feel the hustle and bustle of Andersonville.The wait staff are polite and professional.I have been there for a casual lunch as well as a small family graduation celebration....they are accommodating, you can turn it intowhatever level of formality you want.Great place to take out of town guests for the food as well as the ease of sitting, talking and getting waited on professionally, for reasonable prices.
