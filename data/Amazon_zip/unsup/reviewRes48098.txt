went for a late dinner, so we didnt have to deal with a wait. service was good and helpful when we were trying to decide on what to order. we went for the spicy pork rinds, fish stew, pork belly and frites (with a fried egg, of course). a lot of food for 2 gals, but we powered through it. pork rinds were light and not greasy. fish was fresh and flavorful. pork belly was extra tender. frites...well, you cant ever go wrong with a fried egg!
