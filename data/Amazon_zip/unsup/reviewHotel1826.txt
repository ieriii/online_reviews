I've never stayed at a W Hotel before and we decided to on this occasion, because surprisingly enough, it was the cheapest rate. Upon entering the lobby, you do feel like entering a club. You may even miss the small check-in area to your left as your distracted by the seats in the center and all the people lounging around. Service was really friendly and efficient. I was impressed at how nice the girl behind the counter was. When we got to our room, we were so surprised. There was so much room (even in the bathroom!). Coming from NY, you're not used to a lot of room where you can spread out. Our room had plenty of walking room and a one person couch as well as desk. The only thing I wasn't pleased about was that you could hear the train from our room. I'm not sure if every room was like this or if we were just closer, but even at 4:30 AM (when I started drafting this) I've heard the train go by many times. Make sure you bring some ear plugs and maybe that'll help? Location is good and I would definitely stay here or at another W Hotel! We used the complimentary Acura car service they offer and that was pleasant (they offer a one time usage of a car ride within a 5 mile radius). I loved the Bliss products as well!
