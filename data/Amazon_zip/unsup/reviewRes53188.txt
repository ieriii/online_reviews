I really like this place! I try to frequent this place as much as I can. I love the sandwiches more than the dinners. I love that is BYOB and a great outdoor patio. It's such a great bargain. But sometimes the kitchen can get backed up and it's a bit slow....but it's well worth it! If Cuban food is not your thing, at least try the cafe con leche and a guava filled pastry.
