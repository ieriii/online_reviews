Loved it! Agree that it may not look so great but the food and service were wonderful. Small family owned, only open till 1:00 pm. Breakfast was 2 large pancakes, 2 bacon, 2 sausage and 2 eggs for $3.95! Coffee was delicious and only $1.25. Seemed like lots of locals enjoy the spot. They do have lunch specials... Reuben sandwiches and stuffed cabbage the day we were there. Nice to eat from outside the golden arches!
