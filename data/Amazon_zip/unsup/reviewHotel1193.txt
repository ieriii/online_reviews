I have never been so disappointed in a hotel before until I stayed here. First of all I was staying here for the Chicago 1/2 marathon this past August. I stayed here last year and didn't have this many problems until this stay. First of all, they let you check in early online which is nice and then print out this barcode that you can scan at their kiosk near the front counter to get your room keys. When I got there NONE of the 4 kiosks were working. When I went to stand in the LONG line (which is why I checked in online to avoid this) the front desk attendant told me that i should check all the kiosks. I said NONE of them are working, shouldn't you know this? They didn't have a clue what was going on. Second, right near the breakfast/starbucks area to get coffee smelled of BO! It was horrendous. It smelled like that last year and it was worse this time. How can they NOT do something about that. It was just disgusting. You felt like you wanted to throw up Thirdly, at around 4am we heard drunk guys outside our hallway screaming obscenities at either other for about a half hour. It woke us all up and we were trying to get a good night sleep for our race the next day.  Finally, you have to pay for parking, which we get. BUT it was a hassle leaving b/c they were so congested and the scanner thing wasn't working on the way out so we had to wait for assistance. I received a survey from the Hyatt asking how my stay was. Well I filled it out and let them know I wasn't happy with things and will not be staying there ever again due to all the issues we had. Guess what? I NEVER heard back from their management. Disappointed that they do not care to better their services and keep customers coming back. I will NOT be staying there again!
