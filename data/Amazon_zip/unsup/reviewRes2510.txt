Doug is the true sausage king of Chicago. If you like lots of different animals ground up in a sausage, this is you place. The menu has some staples like Brats and Italian sausage and specials may include chicken, duck, deer or Buffalo sausage(menu varies). What you get is sausage made with love and gourmet toppings. Everything that I've ever had has been great.The regular fries are also good. A few days a week they have fries cooked in duck fat. The corn dogs are also great. I was once told that you can get a regular hot dog, but why wait in such a long line for that? Doug greets each customer at the counter with a friendly manner and spend as much time as needed helping you decide to what to order. The bad news is that the restaurant is only open 10:30 -4 Mon-Sat and closes for anything resembling a holiday. The line is absurdly long and an hour wait would not be usual. The line is also outside the restaurant, this is bad if the weather is bad. There always seems to place to sit and eat in this crowded madhouse.
