I've been here for lunch a few times now and the food is pretty good not the best. I had the Farmhouse and Workingman's burger which were just average, the fries are tasty though. The only dish I truly enjoy here is the Fuji apple, hard cider, leek, and blue cheese mussels. Revolution has a fantastic guest beer selection, for house beer go with their Anti-Hero IPA. Will come again only for a afternoon session of mussels and beer.
