This place was much better than I had expected. I feel guilty for doubting it in the first place. In the warmer months they have a lovely patio where the chance to see a cutie puppy is very high. The drinks are pretty fabulous... they are a bit pricey but not for what you're getting. I have found that their special isn't actually that special. Like if they have a drink on special you'll be getting more but you'll also be paying more. Exp: Let's say Blue Moon 12 oz is $4 then the special might be Blue Moon $16 ounce for $7... you do the math. The staff are all very attractive and in the Summer months the female servers wear very little clothes and put their junk in your face while you order- SCORE! The food is surprisingly delicious and defo a step up from bar food. I highly recommend it all. Go in the warmer months and sit outside, bring sunglasses.
