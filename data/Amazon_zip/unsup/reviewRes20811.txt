Amazing sushi! Of the places I've been to in Chicago, Coast offers the tastiest sushi. The ambiance is comfortable and elegant, but can feel overcrowded at peak hours. Expect a large forum (seating for 70) at this Wicker park spot, which is a sharp contrast to the smaller sports commonly found in the north-side.  Recommended for a couples and small groups willing to pay a little extra for a chic dining.
