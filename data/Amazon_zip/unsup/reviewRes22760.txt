I went to Greek Islands this weekend because I had a craving for saganaki that just wasn't going to go away on its own. I was a little afraid that it wouldn't be as fun because for the first time I wasn't going with a huge group -- just the bf and me. Turns out, I was wrong. The two of us did the family style meal and even though we were a small group, it was still a great way to go -- for $20 per person we got saganaki, taramosalata (which I thought would tase how it looked -- strawberry cream cheese but I was actually way off base and it was delicious), plus gyros, lamb, stuffed grape leaves, mousaka and meat balls. After all that, we got three desserts each. We were seated after about 20 minutes (at about 8 p.m. on a Saturday) and I didn't feel left out not being with a group of 25. Thank goodness for the free parking, after dinner I was able to sit shotgun in the car while I was in my food coma. Sure, Greek Islands is a little cheezy, but the servers are very friendly and it's a great place to cure your saganaki -- and now taramosolata cravings!
