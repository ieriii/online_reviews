So great! I don't even know where to begin with the 4 or 5 course extravaganza ahead of you when heading to Geja's. The environment is very intimate and romantic, reminded me of some uber rich person's wine cellar. The fondue is amazing chocolate, cheese, otherwise, all of the above. For a btdubs make sure your not wearing or jacket or anything you would like to wear again before cleaning because the oil frying all over the place will fully penetrate any attire.
