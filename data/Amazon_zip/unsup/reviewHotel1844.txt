Personally, I am not a fan of the W Hotels. Personally, they try too hard. They love to deck out their lobbys, put velvet plum pillows on top of beds, adorn their bathrooms with Bliss products, make sure music playing when you get back to your room, and play out all the Hotel Costes chillout-esque music possible in their lounges. But their service is crap, and you know when the service is crap the hotel's pretty crap also no matter how nice it is. Which is why it's so ironic they have their infamous "Whatever. Whenever." motto. They don't stand by it.  Anyway, besides that, my stay was nothing special. Yeah the room's nice but gosh every time you flush the toilet you feel like you're flushing an airplane toilet; talk about high pressure. Then you wonder if the rooms around you can hear you and you feel bad at the same time if you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night, which brings me back to the service. They're so lazy they don't want to bother having plumbers on staff to fix a clogged toilet so they equip each room with the highest pressure toilet they can find. Genius.
