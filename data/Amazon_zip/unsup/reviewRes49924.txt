Came to watch a bulls game, which wasn't going too well, and ordered 16 wings with a couple of guy friends who can eat. We weren't starving, but after a while we realized we hadn't been served. The waitress told us she had forgotten to put the order in and gave us some free guac and chips to make up for it. When the wings did come, I realized they were worth the wait. Crunchy, juicy, huge, and just spicy enough. The 16 were enough for the three of us. I recommend the spicy garlic. Came on a Monday and all domestic bottles were $2... not bad. The bulls lost, but I won't hold that against them.
