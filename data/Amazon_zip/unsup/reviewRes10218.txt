i like this place even though it's too crowded and service is a little sub par. I guess those two go together though. the pizza is really good. normally i dont' think pizza can range that much in deliciousness but usually the sauce is what makes the difference for me (on a thin crust at least). so the sauce is really great and makes it tasty. i also like that they are a microbrewery. i tried the hefeweizen, which was really good and the alt, which was not bad. overall, just a good place to have some pizza and beer.
