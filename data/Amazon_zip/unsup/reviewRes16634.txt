I hate to compare Violet Hour to their Nashville relative, Patterson House, but I just can't help it. I knew what to expect of the menu and price but I honestly expected better than what we were served. The Pimm's Cup was made with Sprite and was clear. Hmmm...that's different. I cannot recall the name of the gin drink I tried, but it was insanely sour; reminiscent of lemonade concentrate. My boyfriend and I agreed that the drinks at Patterson House are far superior. Ah well. I'm glad we went and I absolutely loved the atmosphere. The service was also fantastic.
