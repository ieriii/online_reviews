This place is Meatastic! It is a little expensive, but hey, what do you expect when you get to eat as much delicious cuts of beef, pork, and chicken as you can handle. Not to mention the amazing salad bar..I try to stay away, but I never can. Even the sides are delish. Grab a $50 and head out, but don't eat all day...get your money's worth.
