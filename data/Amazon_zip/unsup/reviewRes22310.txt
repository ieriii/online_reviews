This little place was recently featured on Check Please, so if you go, prepare for a wait. Also, this is in an outdoor shopping mall, so plan to wait outside! That said, it's totally worth the wait. Food was delicious and the menu offers a load of options, including a decent number of vegetarian options. The staff is friendly if a bit harried, and I think we completely lost our waitress for a while there, but the meal was excellent. My only complaint is that the staff seemed a tad disorganized, and that I would swear we received the wrong dish. We ordered ginger chicken and the chicken dish we received (among several others) didn't appear to have any ginger in it (despite a confirmation from a passing waiter that it was indeed ginger chicken). Still totally worth it. There's plenty of parking around there (metered), and you can wander around the mall while you wait (or digest).
