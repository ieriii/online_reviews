someone else stated this too... just because you have fancy toppings does not make the burger better or equal to kumas... and i agree annnnnnnd i doubt this place buys their meat and other products responsibly and locally like kumas, but i could be wrong. i had the black and blue burger... which was overcooked notthing special at all... same goes for the goat cheese fondue which i was super stoked about but let down.. there were chunks of something in it.. maybe onions i couldn't taste or see what it was.. mystery!!!! and i had 2 bourbon drinks and didn't feel them AT ALL.... neither did my friend. sadface. who also wasn't impressed with his selection.. the slow burn or something oh shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeet FLAME WAR i do know for a fact about kumas meat .. had a convo about it one night with the manager... don't be salty because the BAD APPLE doesn't have a 2 - 3 hr wait. THIS IS YELP IT'S FOR OPINIONS.
