So...One of the items in our Chicago list was to try the famous Deep Dish pizza... we were walking downtown and I decided to ask to a couple of random people about the pizza... they recommended Gino's east and Giordano's..glad I've chosen Gino's... after that we had to find the place...a little too far,but worth it.... the line was huge but when we took our first bite we instantly forgot the line..lol... delicious pizza!!!!
