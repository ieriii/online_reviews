Very close dining space, but the perfect fit for somewhere to take the in-laws for dinner when they were in town. Lovely italian fare, with generous portions and great specials. I love the idea of the menu changing every few months. Our waiter was nice, but I saw more of the backwaiter staff than I did of our actual staff. I hope that they get a good portion of the tip. The food was scrumptious and the whole experience would bring me back again.
