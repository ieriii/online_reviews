NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM... Imagine a lil boy covered in sticky sweetness all over his hands and his face and the table... That was me!  My friend was talking and all I heard was WAH wah wah, bah bah wah, la la la... I was absolutely entranced, mesmerized, bound on a spiritual level with this chicken divinity! First the place is nice, the people are even nicer, Thanks Howie for an off the hook fried chicken affair! The food is nearly indescribable but I will do my best... My friends have been not so quietly whispering for quite some time about the religious experience that is CRISP... The day had finally come to pop my Crisp cherry, I was meeting a friend he was talking about how good all the bowl preparations were, and I was like, what about the fried chicken, He said this is a Korean place they don't really have Fried Chicken...  I ask Howie what are your two most popular dishes.... He quickly responds with Two Fried Chicken preparations, my friend who Howie knows by name looks bewildered, he had no idea... Now he does! I said do it up how you would do it... Howie did it up good! Crispy, Gooey, Savory, Sweet, Hot, Juicy, Freaking Perfect!!! I had six enormous wings, I mean these are some big Chicken wing!!! You will be rocked! Two BBQ, two ginger soy garlic (Seoul sassy), two Buffalo, and one plain... Yeah that, good good, great shizzzam! This place rocks on every level!  I was noisy, I was dirty, I was sticky, I was ram shakkle digity digity bing biggidy bam boozle bong dooey de happy dizzle shicky dee booby la la! Fazzooom! Speaking, eating, loving, getting lost like a child in a happy heavenly hearty flavorful foody fantabulous bomb digity atmosphere! DA BOMB! Oh yeah Ill be back!
