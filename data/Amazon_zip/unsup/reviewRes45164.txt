i hate to split hairs, but i would give this a 3.75 overall rating. all the food we ordered was above average but to me was not amazing. fingerling potato appetizer was kind of bland. just a little egg and a lot of celery in there. i liked the homemade lamb sausage with ravioli type deal, but there was barely any meat at all. the brsiket special with brussle sprouts and polenta was the winner of the night we would probably go back
