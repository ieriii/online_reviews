This is my favorite Sushi place in Chicago so far. It doesn't top the best Sushi I've ever had but no place in Chicago can. Its cute, consistently good food. I just wish the Sushi chefs stayed on the same page with portioning on the rolls, a tad bit less rice. However the taste is always on point, although that is key. The fish is always fresh. However, dinner time usually requires reservations as it can get busy and it is BYOB. Oh yea... Great date place!
