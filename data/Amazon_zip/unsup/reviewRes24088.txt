I love Irazu so much that sometimes I can't find the right words to give it the perfect review. Although I don't go here as often as I would like, this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The casado, my entree of choice brings together rib eye, brown rice stuff, fried egg, and plantains together on one plate. It is simply amazing. The shakes they make are delicious but I usually go with a large horchata. It is the best I've ever had. Other things to sample are their sandwiches and burritos. Oh and do try the guac, especially the spicy. Most importantly don't forgot the cash, cos this place doesn't take plastic!
