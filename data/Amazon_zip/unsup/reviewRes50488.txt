I went to this restaurant awhile back with a bunch of friends. The place is great. It's definitely family friendly, but the staff does a good job of making sure all parents keep their children in line and not run around turning the place into Kiddie land.  The food was excellent. Our server brought out cornbread for us to enjoy. It was delicious. You just don't get good cornbread like that in Chicago. For our entree, I tried the turkey, which was nice and tender, and the potatoes which were delicious. The best part, however, was dessert. I had the key lime pie, which was decadent. The crust had a perfect consistency, and the filling was perfectly smooth. It was fantastic, and there was nothing left on my plate. Also, their drink specials are great. I tried the margaritas, which I would definitely recommend.  The service was great. Our server was quick, courteous, and checked on us just enough times to make sure we were all well taken care of.  Overall, a great restaurant.
