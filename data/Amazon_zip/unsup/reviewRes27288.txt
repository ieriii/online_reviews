I used to like this place a lot. Then I realized it's not that great, but it's OK. I like the horchata. Yum. Oh, and the fact that they always give you free food as an appetizer. I imagine they just make too much of some things and then need to get rid of it before it goes bad. It's always something tasty. Good place.
