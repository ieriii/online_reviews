Expensive hotel with no amenities. Crappy staff at the Concierge desk. Maps in the rooms directory books didn't include any floor above the 5th I was on the 14th floor. "Historical" means small and old here and not always in a good way. Bathroom was micro sized. Bath tub drain was plugged. One dresser drawer broke apart in my hand when I opened it.Windows opened but had no screens. And I do believe this is the only Hilton that does not offer coffee in the room. I won't send my worst enemy to this hotel. Stay anywhere but here!
