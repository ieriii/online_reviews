Ever since I moved out of the Bay Area to the Midwest, I've been missing a bowl of pho like crazy. When I came to Chicago for the very first time and came to this particular restaurant, I had tears of joy in my eyes not just for the fact that I was eating a bowl of pho again after six months but because this place is just so damn good. Prices are about $6-$7 per bowl (or most general dishes) and it's very filling. The service here isn't the greatest, but the place is packed with a diverse customer base. The pho here is great stuff -- Good broth, good noodles, decent beef, and they get my beef on the side just the way I like it. Menu options are actually quite numerous and it's pretty refreshing to see "cow's penis" as an option too (Never saw this once in S.F.!). I also had a white cut duck (forgot the exact name) there and that was some good stuff as well. My biggest issue is their sandwiches. The sandwiches are okay/average; the breadwas too soft, but then again, the bowl of noodles trumps all. Parking is also a pain in the backside in this area but it's close to the El. Highly recommended if you're in Chicago.
