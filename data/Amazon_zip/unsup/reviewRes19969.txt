Yum! This was my first stop after my red-eye flight into Chicago. For a place that had just opened up two days earlier, I was rather impressed. I expected a line, since previous posts said there would be one, luckily... no wait... The menu for breakfast is pretty slim.. but that makes the selection easier. I opted for the scrambled egg empanada and the boyfriend picked the chorizo torta. I thought I'd be bored with mine, but there weren't many vegetarian options... to my surprise, I loved it. The bf enjoyed his torta and we were hoping to make it back to try their expansive afternoon menu. We also got 3 churros... YUM. Added bonus: a picture with Rick Bayless.
