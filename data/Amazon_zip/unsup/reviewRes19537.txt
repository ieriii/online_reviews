Okay, I know I'm review #49089880...but I figure I'll give it a shot. Fondue app was delish, bread service kicked ass, martini...well, it's still in effect. My fish and chips, kinda dissapointing, but it's okay cuz I filled up on all the carbie goodness beforehand. My friend loved his burger and the service was a little slow but very friendly. I would definitely go back in a hearbeat and try some more adventurous things on the menu. Oh, and PS, this new little Open Table reservation application that Yelp has is kick-ass!
