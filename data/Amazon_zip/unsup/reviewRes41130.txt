Ambiance: crowded, noisy Service: they won't bring you a pho veggie plate unless you ask for it, will sit strangers at your table if there are extra seats....can you say awkward? Food: Papaya salad was not good and obviously not made fresh to order. Soggy veggies. Beef over rice: beef was clearly previously frozen and had freezer burn texture Ph Dac Biet: Par, but here's the thing kids. There are a ZILLION Pho joints(and viet restaurants that serve great Pho) within 1 block which never get any busines. Why does everyone go here? I'm seriously really confused about this. If someone could PM me and tell me why they go here instead of : Hai Yen(best for taking people out), Pho Xe Lua(Bare bones but best tasting Pho on the whole strip), Cafe Huang(good pho, best all around menu), it would be greatly appreciated.
