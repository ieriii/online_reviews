Well, I admit my sushi leanings are extremely tough to garner, but this place was pretty darn good (if a little pricey). Very cute spot on a neat stretch of street - friendly staff, and well-prepared sushi. The jalapeno miso doesnt do it for me bc i love the comfort-food aspect of miso. Tho I give them props for actually making it spicy - and I know my sister is excited to try it whenever she visits :)  The Maki Mexicano is where it's at! I loved this roll! The lime isnt overpower, it just gives it enough unique flavor. And why don't more rolls use cilantro? Yum, guys! The Oedipus roll (name alone sold me) was just ok. The salmon roe on top was so divine I thought I would be falling in love here, but once you get past the toppings, the roll itself is rather dull. All in all a good, safe bet for satisfying sushi.
