This is one of our favorite places to eat.... We try and eat in there at least every few months. The Food is absolutely spectacular and service is fantastic. I strongly recommend this place. Matter of fact if you go ask for the server by the name of Quinn he is great. We go here because of him... He takes great care of the his regular customers. Prices are very reasonable and they have daily specials. Make a reservation however because the pllace is always busy... My partner and I are very tough on servers and like I said this place is the best... I guess I should also mention they make one of the best Mojito's that I have ever had. Matter of fact they are all good so try all their Mojito's you will fall in love.......
