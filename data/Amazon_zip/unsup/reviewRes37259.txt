Sushi - wow! Sometimes its fun to wander into a store like F&O. Lots of expensive things in cool packaging, shimmering like beacons of all that is delicious! We wandered in here from off the street right before a free movie at the AMC. Went straight to the "deli" area and decided on some yummy-looking and somehow-still-affordable sushi. We took it down the street and happily scarfed down our finds while sitting on the waterfront. It was beautiful.
