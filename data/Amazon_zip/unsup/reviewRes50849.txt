I've been twice since my last review, and I must say, it's still a great place to eat. The last time I went I actually got the exact same thing as my original review. They don't have a TON in the way of vegetarian food, but I think even if they did, I would have still ended up with the Veggie Burger. It was just as good as the first time, just wish I had asked for BBQ sauce. I also got the mango lemonade, which was pretty decent if you like a lot of mango. The time before I took a friend from out of state and we actually went for the late breakfast. We sat outside and both had the Crunchy French Toast (covered in Capn Crunch!) and it was delicious. I got mine with fresh fruit and a cantaloupe lemonade. It was a great meal to send my friend off to California on. If you havent tried this place, I suggest you do. Sit outside while you still can! And they still do the discount for bikers who bring helmets in for all meals Monday thru Friday!
