Went this Saturday for dinner... Made reservations the same night. Surprised we were able to get a table. Wondered if the place was any good considering my reservation was made on the same night. Hmmmmm.  It was totally worth it. Everything was great! Ordered: *several oysters a la carte - they were excellent! you know what they say about oysters - aphrodisiac for shizzle. *half of chicken - huge portion, it was just okay, I make a better one, just saying. The fries with it were excellent though. Don't eat the sausage that comes with it. It was tough and gross (maybe it was there for color/presentation?) *kale - soooooooooooooooooooooo good! *b sprouts - cold salad like mix, very tasty *scallops - very good, buttery and yummy *mandarin sorbet - light, refreshing and very mandarin in flavor. I had wine, a great pinot noir. $12 a glass, can't remember the name... very good with my dinner! Crowd was big, bar was weird, staff excellent. Antonio was our waiter. Hotness!
