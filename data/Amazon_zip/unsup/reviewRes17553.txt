We checked in with the hostess at 9:15pm with reservations at 9:30pm with 15mins to spare, we walked over to the bar and found it a bit difficult flagging down a bartender with only two bartenders working behind the bar.. We were a bit confused to see so many waitresses and waiters and only two bartenders??? We were then lead to our table by the hostess and after ordering our food.....we noticed that our table was slanted...haha..Oops! Overall, the food was amazing, the meat was tender....the raspberry mojito was delicious! This place is worth going back!
