Although I'm no vegan and cannot fully appreciate what that all entails. I will say that the only way I can understand this restaurant receiving 5 stars is if I were starved from all meat and dairy products for the next five years. I have been promised by many, that although a non-vegan I would still enjoy the fare. I can't tell you how false this statement is. The only redeeming quality of CD was their chocolate shake, but that could have simply been attributed to my unhealthy obsession with anything that resembles ice-cream, and well-it was chocolate.My friend and I split a BBQ bacon burger, sweet potato quesadillas, and sweet potato fries. I will say, the burger had amazing flavor, but I would much prefer a burger that wasn't terribly dry. The quesadillas were not impressive, and the sweet potato fries were good, but nothing I would rave about. Beyond the meh food, the service was terrible. Server was MIA for most of the night. We sat there for the bill for a good 20-30 mins, and then he gave us hell because we wanted to split a shake. If I could allow myself to give a poor tip-I would have.I must end on a positive note-I did enjoy the mood and ambiance in the restaurant-small and friendly atmosphere.Will not go back. Unless someone bends my arm to go for a shake:)
