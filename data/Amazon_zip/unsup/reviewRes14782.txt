I'm with the 3-star or less Yelpers. And 3 stars is generous. I went there growing up for "special family events" and now I live a block from it. Go figure. The place just creeps me out. It's old, dark, windowless, stale/musty smelling, and packed with old people. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a body or two in the basement. Just saying. (IMO, not factual) The food is okay, but for mediocre italian food it's certainly not cheap. I love their minestrone soup. That's about the only thing worth commenting on. My husband and I have dined in and ordered carry out. If you must experience Sabatino's, I recommend carry-out - cheaper bill, huge quanitites and you avoid their less than appealing ambience.
