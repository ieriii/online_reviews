Great food, great service. Does any other restaurant bring you a complimentary appetizer and ginger tea while you wait for your table? Then, bring a complimentary dessert after dinner because you had to wait? And the wait wasn't even that long (20 minutes, max). I've been here a couple times now and will definitely be back for more.
