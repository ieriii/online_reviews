Excellent food - beautiful presentation and delicious. POrtions were small, but it's not about stuffing yourself, anyway. I went to the "underground" night on Friday (menu is emailed to restaurant's distribution list a few days prior) and called immediately to make a reservation. I called... and called.... and called... and when I finally spoke with someone, I could only get 5pm. We went earlybird-style, but were surprised to find we were the only ones there and no one starting showed up until after 7pm. Oh well, the food was wonderful and the waiter very informative (and not too "hover-y" considering we were his only table). I'd go again for a special occasion.
