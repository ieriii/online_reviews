I would have given this place only one star but I reserve that for places that make me sick. To start off I just want to say if you want a gyro or something simple like that just plain skip this place and go to any of the greasy place down the street and I don't mean greasy in a bad way - just that it will be much better than this place. Service was good in the beginning but quickly trailed off with empty water glasses and a check that took over 30 minutes to get. I usually look right past the service if the food is good. That was not even close to the case. The only things that I found enjoyable out of the four dishes we all ordered were the pitas and the tzatziki sauce. If something I can make myself and buy at the store is the only thing that is good we are all in trouble. I personally had the roasted leg of lamb that I was tempted to send back but I believe you cant judge a book by its cover. It was a few slices on a plate that looked like it had been sitting in a holder somewhere. Not an ounce of juice anywhere and just dry as cardboard. We also ordered the combo platter which was some of the same dry leg of lamb, mousaka that wasn't too bad, and the dolmades which was so salty that I had to spit it out. We also had to try the gryos just to compare to the small grab and go places. If you have gotten to this point you know that it would be better to just go down the street and get yourself a cheap one. I really wanted to like this place but everything was just so-so. Service was not good at all and the food needs to be more fresh or just seasoned right. NO OPAAAAAA......
