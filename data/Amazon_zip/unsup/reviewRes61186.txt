Hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. The buttery crust and cornmeal touch really give the crust an outstanding flavor. Also, there ingredients always seem to be fresh.They do not serve stuffed pizza, only chicago deep dish, so I'm not comparing it to places like edwardo's or giordano's that serve stuffed.No matter how many times I go, I end up eating about half of what I think I will eat, just because the pizza is so filling.The sausage is very tasty. You can either have crumbled sausage or an entire patty on your pizza. As for the pepperoni, I am not a big fan. Some places have a very greasy type pepperoni with a waxy taste and that's how I felt it tasted.Overall, though, I will keep coming back for the quality and taste of their pizza.
