5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the service. This is probably my favorite pizza in Chicago- I love their sauce and the crust is crispy. I've ordered it for delivery and dined in, and while the atomosphere is fun delivery is much more reliable if you have a time constraint.  Went here on a Friday night with a reservation but still needed to wait for a table (which is fine, but some indication of how long we'd wait/an apology would have been nice), and our pizza took about an hour an 10 minutes when we were told it would be 40. I understand that it was a busy night, but our server avoided contact with us during that time without any explanation. I think there may have been some mix-up, which again is fine, but don't ignore us. Definitely plan on around 2 hours for dinner if you're eating there. It wasn't ideal, but the upstairs part is great and the pizza is worth it.
