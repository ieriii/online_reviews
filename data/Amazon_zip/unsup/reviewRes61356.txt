Food 3/5Drinks policy 5/5Service 5/5Ambiance 5/5 (for a nice summer evening)We ordered an empanadas appetizer, a chicken dinner, and a steak dinner. The empenadas were amazing, especially the goat cheese variety. I would easily order that again. The dinners on the other hand... my steak was thin and cheap, the chicken was thin-cut and cheap as well, and even worse for it than the steak.I find that it doesn't really matter though when you're sitting outside in their outdoor section on a great summer evening, pouring your own rum in front of you. If you found this place because it is BYO, then you're like to get too drunk to care much about the quality of the food anyway.Its $10 for a pitcher of Mohito mix. I think this is an essential part of the experience.I had a lot of fun and would love to go back... if I'm in the neighborhood and its a nice enough night to eat outside. If I do, I think I'll end up splurging the extra $4 or $5 for the full "churrasco" skirt steak dinner that I noticed a lot of people ordering. It had a much nicer looking piece of meat on it than the regular "bistec" dinner.
