My husband and I went to the Publican and we were both pretty disappointed. We ordered a tasting of three hams and the portion did not match the price. It was nothing that you couldn't find at Caputos. I did enjoy the oysters, but when it comes to oysters, unless the oyster is bad, you can't really mess them up. The duck fat french fries are being done everywhere, and I'm just not sure about the communal table and communal bathroom sitch. The table is communcal, but the attitudes of those around you=not so much which led to awkwardness. For those prices, I would like full size portions, and a full size table to myself. I WANT to like the Publican, so I would try it again, because the staff is friendly and the space is nice. I love cured meats, I love beer, let's make this work people.
