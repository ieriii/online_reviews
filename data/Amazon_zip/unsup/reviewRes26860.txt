Great Pan pizza, I agree with Steve R, the thin crust is pretty weak-needed more sauce in my opinion, and think crusts should be crispy not doughy, they should call it hand tossed not thin crust, I would definately go back for the pan if was in the neighborhood! our service was pretty good... can't complain about that...
