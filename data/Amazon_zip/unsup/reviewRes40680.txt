This restaurant or restauranT'S have gone from being my first choice to being my last! ..... some of the meseras are rude!!!! and serve your food with attitude! ..... I started coming here at a very young age and clearly remember how delicious the tacos and tortas were back then... now they barely have flavor the salsas are not spicy at all! which doesnt surprise me because all you find there now is white people and they dont like very spicy salsa ....... all that is left of these restaurants are the fame of the name  ....
