Had a chance to dine at Mercat this past weekend. Dinner was great, would definitely return. We ordered calamari, barramundi, mushroom soup, salad, croquettes, spicy potatoes. Everything was amazing, along with the drinks. I would definitely recommend this place, and can't wait to go again. Nice looking space as well.
