No sir, didn't like it. Maybe I just like the hood spots, but this gourmet $11 torta was not what's up. The bread was hard, not enough stuff in it, and again it was $11. I had the Pepito. The wife had some chicken torta and did not like hers either. We are used to the tortas with a big avocado piece in it, plenty of meat, lettuce , etc. and buttery soft grilled bread. The next night we went to El Burrito Mexicano on Addison in Wrigleyville-Way better and it was $5.
