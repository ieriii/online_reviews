I had only been here once before. And that was for a private function , as it was my friend's 50th Birthday. On that occasion I was pretty impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the quantity of food.  Therefore, when the opportunity to enjoy another Prime Rib dinner arose, I immediately jumped!  The downfall was having 6 Larger than Life characters packed into a sphere shaped booth more perfectly suited for 5. But aside from the special closeness we all shared, we were completely "Wowwed" by the professionalism exhibited by our waiter Phil. he had the charisma, charm and detail of the makings of a Rock Star--but then again, he was trained by the best in the business---Ms. Susie Southgate Fox!  And how do I know that? I was trained by her 20 years ago. Tucci Milan, hmmm. We all experienced an enjoyable meal complemented by unobtrusive service. We will certainly be back!
