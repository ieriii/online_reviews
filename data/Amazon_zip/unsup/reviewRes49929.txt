Went here on Sunday night for a birthday dinner. I loved the atmosphere and the artwork. There was a Spanish guitarist and singer to add to the ambience. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Now, about the food... delicious. I had the grilled skirt steak, and it was easily one of the best cooked, best seasoned steaks I've eaten in my life. I opted for rice and beans instead of yuca and potato, both of which were quite good. Our table shared empanadas and chorizo, which were all terrific. Also, all of the food was made even more delicious when I smothered the fantastic chimichurri sauce all over it. I think I could have drank that sauce by the gallon. For dessert, they brought my mom a free order of coconut flan and the singer did a special redition of happy birthday for her. It was very sweet and the flan was quite good. Overall, it's a bit pricey but I would go back.
