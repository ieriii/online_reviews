2 stars, plain and simple. I just don't feel the experience was worth the money spent that's all. I mean the pizza doesn't taste bad or anything. In fact I'd say it's fair but I think that other places like Congress or John's provide a better pizzeria experience for a cost that is similar if not slightly less. This place is more of a bar than anything. Their service at the bar isn't bad but you better bring a wad of cash if you want to drink here. Overall there's better pizza and there's cheaper bars with just as much eye candy.
