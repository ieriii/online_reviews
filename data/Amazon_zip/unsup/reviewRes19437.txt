so i only go this to-go, but seriously amazingly fresh sushi. it's hard for me to eat a ton of nirgiri/sashimi, but this place really hits the spot. try their (+) sunrise roll, mango w/tuna, SUPER good (+) even their california roll is superb- from the thinly sliced cucumbers, to the way it's sliced, etc. just try it! (-) appetizer - chicken udon soup, a little too sweet. tastes like there's msg :( definitely will have to come back and try more stuff here!! make reservations in advance
