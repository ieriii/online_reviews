A friend just brought me here for lunch last weekend by saying, "I hear they have the best falafel ever." (She doesn't eat falafel, so she wouldn't actually know.) And I can say after eating it, some of the best falafel I've ever had. Mainly, I loved the price. A gigantic falafel sandwich, a container of hummus and pita, and a soda for $7? I'll take it! Bonus points for: easy to get to off the Blue Line and it wasn't *too* crowded when I went.
