Best Thai in the city. Okay... sure, there may be better but when you factor the very low prices into the mix, nothing beats this.  My 4 stars is based on the taste of the food. There are many things wrong with this place, but the food is awesome!  While I like Arun's, I think you can have a meal that approaches Arun's taste (though service and ambience at Opart isn't great) at a fraction of the cost. 1 person's cost at Arun's easily feeds 4 here. My only two gripes about this place are that the spice level is inconsistent. Hot on Tuesday may not the same as hot on another day.  The other gripe is that the kitchen doesn't know how to flow the food out to you. Your entree will come out minutes after the appetizers.  Still, this place is fantastic.
