Delicious seafood! I'm a Houstonian so I really know good seafood. This place is top-notch. I would compare it to an Eddie V's type restaurant if anyone's ever eaten there down in the south or southwest.  Had the amazing oyster sampler. I liked every single one. A great way to start off dinner. We also shared 1 soft shelled crab. It was the best one I've ever had in my life. No heavy coating. No extreme breading. It was just perfect. You could taste the sweetness of the crab.  The River King Salmon was delicious. It was fresh and you could seriously taste "where it came from" if that makes any sense. I don't remember our other entree but no one was disappointed.  Great experience with a wonderful attentive waiter. A great place to splurge in Chicago.
