Saw some cops leave this place as I stepped in, always a good sign! Chalk it up for the "Black and White Approved" List! Also, a Persian family sat down nearby and proclaimed: "This is our favorite restaurant in all of Chicago!" I love the beautiful tile murals at Noon O Kabab. And everything is extremely clean right down to the nice bathrooms. We decided to skip straight to the entrees and my Adass Polo with Kubideh was all that the menu said it was and more! A seasoned-beef skewer served with an aromatic mix of rice, lentils, onon, barberry, raisins, and saffron, it was incredible. My friend's sirloin skewer was meat-eater heaven. They've got an attractive website with easy online ordering. Definitely worth the trip to Albany Park. Or if you live nearby, lucky you!
