This is not my first review of Cafe 28 and I am sure it will not be the last. Just got home after meeting my daughter for appetizers and a drink on the patio. The cevicheis the best I have ever had , I have given up ordering it anywhere else because I am always disappointed that it is not as good as this place. The staff is knowledgeableand accommodating especially with my wine selection this evening.  I have been working my way through the menu for years and have not had anything I did not like. The fact that it is a family owned establishment makes it even better.
