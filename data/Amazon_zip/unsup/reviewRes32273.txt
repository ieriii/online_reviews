I thoroughly enjoyed my first meal at Demera. Having never tasted Ethiopian food before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was happy to see lots of ginger in the menu's offerings. I went with a dish consisting of shrimp marinated in honey wine, rosemary and Awaze sauce, then pan fried with onion, tomato and green pepper. Simply put, the meal was outstanding. The injera (instead of utensils, you're given rolls of sourdough bread with a spongy texture reminiscent of Swedish pancakes) was, admittedly, hard to use gracefully. I made a mess of the first few attempts to pick up my food, but after getting the hang of things I had no further troubles in that regard. The only thing that prevented this from being a five-star review was the wait for our food, which took slightly longer than I'd have expected. Never the less, I do recommend Demera and will be returning.
