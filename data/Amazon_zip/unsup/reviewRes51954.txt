With a party of 19 we were escorted upstairs to the larger tables. We ordered 7 pizzas including meat lovers, vegetarian, peperoni and my favorite sausage and jalipeno. The oil from the peppers had permiated into the cheese so every bite was a spicy bite of heaven. The pitchers of beer were a rip off at $27 each but we needed them. Great atmosphere and great pizza. Deffinatly worth stopping in for some real Chicago pizza.
