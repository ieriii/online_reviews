Really loved my dinning experience at Geja's. The decor inside is so fun and romantic. A great place to go when you want a unique dinning experience. My two friends and I sat at the bar to wait for our table to open up and the bartender was really great, we enjoyed talking to him while we were waiting. The sangria we had at the bar was probably the best I have ever had in Chicago. The fondue was delicious and everything I had hoped for. The only part that I felt was lacking were the sauces that they brought with the main course. I didn't really love any of the sauces and when you are boiling meat/seafood its important for the sauce to wow you because its what will be giving the meat extra flavor and taste. The service was attentive yet relaxed, we never felt rushed and we stayed until they closed. I would love to go back here, just a tip though this place always seems to be really crowded. It took a few attempts to get a reservation and when I did it was for a Monday night at 9 pm and the place was still jam packed when we got there at 9.
