I have never had a bad dish or a bad time at Calo. Everything on the menu is spectacular, from the seafood risotto to the chicken parmigiana to the house specialties to the BBQ ribs. They serve up a hefty helping of food, with all entrees coming alongside salad or soup, and all grilled entrees coming with potatoes or pasta. The meat sauce could probably foster world piece. Victor, the owner, is very knowledgeable on wine, and his wine list is impressive. We're having our rehearsal dinner here. Nora is the best waitress in Chicago!
