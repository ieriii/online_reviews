OK... I haven't been to Nuevo Leon in over a year and maybe I remember it better than it was... and OK... any restaurant can have an off night. However, last night the guacamole had the most off-putting taste, texture and a very unnatural sheen... like it was blended with vegetable oil or something. The chicken in my enchiladas looked and tasted like distressed shoe leather. The mole and the green salsa were excellent but the red salsa had no flavor at all. My dining companion had a somewhat tasteless pork dish that she wouldn't eat... although since I've never had it before, I had nothing to compare it to. This certainly wasn't the Nuevo Leon I remembered.
