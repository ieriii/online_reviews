A couple of friends and I attempted to go here for dinner on a Saturday night around 8:30. They don't accept reservations so we assume that there would be a wait but we were stunned when the hostess told us the wait was 2-3 HOURS for a table. Needless to say we did not go to dinner here so I cannot comment on the food. However, we did end up back in the bar three hours later and it was still packed but we managed to score a table. While the food remains a mystery the beer list was quite impressive. They have three different floors of bars with different beers (and number of beers) on tap. The place has a great ambiance and we will definitely be back to work our way through the beer list.
