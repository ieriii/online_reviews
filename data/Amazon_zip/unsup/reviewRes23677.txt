I must have gone past Irazu a million times before going in for a bite. I'm SO glad I did. The small dining room in back surprised me when I arrived on a week night to meet a new girlfriend. We ordered the fried yuca in garlic for our appetizer. It was good - especially the garlic part. I don't think yuca has much flavor! Next time I'm going to try the plantains instead. I ordered a veggie burrito with hot peppers and have been dreaming about it ever since. The price is nice too. I like the oatmeal shake, but don't know if I agree with the super-rave reviews from some other Yelpers. Someone want to go on a veggie burrito run to Irazu? Any time, any day friends. Just do it!!
