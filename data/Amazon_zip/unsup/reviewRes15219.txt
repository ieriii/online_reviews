If you don't mind waiting and waiting and waiting for a table, then by all means, head out to Revolution immediately. I'm not the most patient of people so a 1:45 wait on a Saturday night already lost them a star. The beer is good though, although hard to decipher which each really is and if it's worth trying. My first beer was ok but my second (mother's something) was much better. The infamous BACON FAT POPCORN is gimmicky but good I guess. Its bacon on popcorn for goodness sake. What doesn't sound good about that?!?!?! Burger was surprisingly better than I thought- the pizza was a bit worse than expected. Everyone enjoyed their dish, the atmosphere, etc but an hour and 45 minute wait it is not.
