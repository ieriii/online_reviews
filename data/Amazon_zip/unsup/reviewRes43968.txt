Nice little brunchy/sandwichy place on Division. Crabcake sandwich is tasty and they have a nice beer selection. The kind of place you might find in say, Madison or some other posh college town. I like it, and it could be a wonderful place to kick back if the crowds weren't such a pain. No food is worth that kind of wait. Other good eats are to be had in a much faster time. Five stars minus one for intolerable waits (good for them, though!)
