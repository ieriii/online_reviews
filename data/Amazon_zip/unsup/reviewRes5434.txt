Salt-roasted beets with goat cheese (Amazing), Tuna Prosciutto (salty but awesome), Sopressata (I don't usually like cured meats but it was good), Pig's Tail (really good but don't get it if you're not down with sucking pork off of bones), Pork Shoulder (AMAZING, don't miss it), Sepia with cherry tomatoes (9.5/10). It's all pork; don't go if you're Kosher or Muslim. Communal tables; sort of loud but not too bad. Great desert. Amazing service. You put your order in and the food comes when it is done.
