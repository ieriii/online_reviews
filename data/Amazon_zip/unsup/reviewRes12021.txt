love love love this place. I have to say that everything i ate made me happy. Started with the Mojito- I would say there was a little too much sugar in there, but that was totally fine with me. You may find a couple of granules on the glass and in the drink. Moving on to the apps. The guac and chips was just ok. The dates with bacon were perfectly made, with just the right combination of textures to make the flavours stand out. The salmon tartare was well prepared and presented, but I dont eat fish, so didnt enjoy that as much. The Papas Rellenas were incredible and I would recommend you get them every time you go there. The Taste of Cuba was interesting to look at but I wasnt a fan of that dish. The coconut shrimp was good- not superlative, but good. For the main course I got the pistachio crusted chicken. mmmmmmm SO good. I never thought chicken would be so moist and delicious. From the website: Pistachio Crusted Chicken 19.50 Sauted & baked pistachio crusted chicken breast, served over garlic white potato puree & sauted Swiss chard, topped with a goat cheese porto wine sauce. Yes its high for chicken. Yes you want it. Dessert was lemon gelato- great texture and flavour, and chocolate mousse - too dark for me but well made and excellently presented. The place is well suited to both small and big parties - I would say it's a place that's great for dinner, as well as dates. The decor is minimal- a few paintings and one painted wall. A note of caution- if you buy at the bar you pay at the bar. If you buy drinks at the table, you can pay for them with the meal. Thanks for the dinner Cafe 28, I'll be back!
