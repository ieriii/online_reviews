We live in this neighborhood and thought we would give it a shot. La Tache was already booked for the evening, which was our first choice. Anteprima has one thing right-the food /inventive menu. I had the salmon with cauliflower puree, my date had the NY Strip. With the side of Brussels sprouts, SO none of us tried pasta. The flavoring of the food was amazing. My date reported the NY strip as being slightly overdone. I loved my salmon. Also-the drinks were good, and we tried the laurel drink which is made at the restaurant-very interesting and good. Kind of reminded me of absinthe, but better. For dessert...We finished the meal off with the apple fennel bread pudding. Fantastic!!! So the food really rocks...my appreciation of the food is what made me give this restaurant 3 stars. HOWEVER....... What Anteprima gets an F for is the fact that they try squeeze as many tables into as small a space as humanly possible. We arrived early had a reservation, and there were several tables available. We got stuck next to the station by the bar where the servers fill up the bread and olives for there table. I saw that and thought "ok I hope this will not be a problem"...it really wasn't.. until my date was bumped. My date was bumped by the waitstaff...and not just bumped pressed into and his chair actually moved...Oh and not by the busboys but the really tall, older -looking woman waitress.  Fine... I get it, its crowded but...no  "Excuse me" or "Sorry."  NADA! So..we alerted the manager and he didn't say sorry, anything. It is one thing when its other diners doing this but your own waitstaff?? We asked to move as there were still 3 or 4 other tables for two and acted as though it was a huge deal that we wanted to move, We moved and long story short..got bumped yet again. by a busboy mainly and the actual manager once. We ate fantastic food, but Anteprima. get your act together!! Either take a few tables out , or teach your inconsiderate staff and manager some manners!!!
