seeing as i prefer indian food in buffet form, i am a big fan of india house. it's a little bit pricier than other buffets ($14 i think), but i think its worth it since the food is good and you can eat a bunch of different dishes. i'm semi-obsessed with the mango ice cream dessert and usually have to cab it back the 6 blocks to my house cause i am too full to walk. the best part of lunch at india house can be summed up in two words: unlimited naan.
