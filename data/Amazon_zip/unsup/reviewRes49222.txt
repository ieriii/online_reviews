Good coffee, but not great. I have only had savory here, so I may be skewed... but they microwave their quiche into a rubbery mess, and their bread is scratch your throat dry or worthlessly soggy, their wrapped sandwiches are very displeasing and expensive. The staff was not specifically ruuuuude but kind of snotty and impatient, and charging for refills at the price they charge for a cup? Ok, it's $.50, but still! I seem to be the worst review on here, so if you like the sweet stuff this place seems to be where it is at.. As for the free wifi, Filter and some Starbucks still charge, but there is a ton of free Wifi all over the city now; Even laundromats have it!
