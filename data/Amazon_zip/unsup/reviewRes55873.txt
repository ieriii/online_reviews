I have been to India House many times. The food and service have always been supurb. However, recently I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and was very disappointed. The service was good but not great. The worst was the chilli chicken masala. The dish while very tasty was barely edible because the chicken itself was extremly tough, chewy and dry. We informed the server when he finally returned to our table. He could see that we couldn't even cut the pieces on my plate, so he offered to remake the dish, but at that point we had already waited a very long time for our food in the first place, and then again for the server to come back by our table. We took home the left overs but ended up tossing all the chicken. I think for the caliber of restaurant this is and with the prices it charges it can do a much better job of using better quality ingredients.
