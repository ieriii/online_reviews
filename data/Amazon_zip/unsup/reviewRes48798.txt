Brunch was great: Bloody Mary with 16% stout - Good morning! Cashew sticky buns - should have ordered by myself. The fried egg on top of french fries - destroyed. The extra thick cut bacon -awesome but i wish the plate came with 3 slices, b/c they are small. Country ham snitzel - share with someone but very good.
