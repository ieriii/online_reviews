The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I want to reserve that rating for places that absolutely blow me away. This place is great, but since I'm not into very sweet pancakes, etc. I created my own omelet, consisting of mushrooms, muenster cheese, and bacon. The bacon was cooked and crumbled perfectly. The mushrooms were extremely fresh. And I was thrilled to find muenster cheese as a choice!!! The menu says the potatoes are hash browns, but they arent: They are similar to roasted potatoes but are excellent. Definitely a great brunch place if you are adventurous or if you'd like a traditional breakfast.
