I have been back to Xoco two more times for lunch and pleased enough with the food to move it to 3 stars. I would like to give it 3.5 stars but that is not allowed. On my first return visit I went out on a limb and ordered a beef tongue sandwich. The bread was fresh and crunchy while the cubes of beef tongue were tender and spongy. I appreciate any menu that rewards my trust with an unusual but tasty experience. On my second return, I ordered a special, tiger shrimp sandwich. Like my first experience, I take issue with how the seafood becomes lost in the bread. I love bread but not when it overtakes the main ingredient. I will be back to Xoco for lunch and look forward to trying more of their diverse menu.
