We've lived in west loop for 4 yrs and just recently tried Artopolis. After the 1st visit, we went back there 3x within 24 hrs!! LOL. After trying their almond baklava and cannoli, we went back there the next day for lunch and had their artopita (sandwich but in a flakey dough) and pick up more desserts as gifts for friends, then back again with an out-of-town friend for more desserts!! I put on 5 extra lbs within that 24 hrs. So far, my favorites are mango yogurt mousse, eclair, raspberry chocolate truffle and of course any of their baklava is awesome! Desserts aside, they also have a wood burning oven for pizzas, sandwiches. I noticed they even have lunch specials on weekdays, which is pretty cheap. For the alcohol lovers, don't worry, they have a full bar. So, go! Put on your fat pants and go!
