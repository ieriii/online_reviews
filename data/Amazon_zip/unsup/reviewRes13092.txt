I have taken guest to dinner there on two different occaisions. Everyone really loved it both times. The "salad bar" has some excellent choices, like seared ahi tuna, artichokes, heart of palm, fresh cheeses, lobster bisque, and many others. Don't over do it there though- because the meats are great. and the service is ridiculous... in a good way. If you search around, you can find coupons online. I did, and saved about 10 bucks a person.
