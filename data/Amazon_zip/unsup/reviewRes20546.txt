Went there for lunch with a friend and were seated right away. Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes for anyone to come by to take our drink order. Both of us had the cup of soup and 1/2 sandwich. First time I tried chilled watermelon soup and it was delicious. Unfortunately, the guy who dropped off the food threw it down and disappeared without a word. We didn't get any soup spoons so I had to flag someone down to get some. The 1/2 sandiwch was OK, nothing earth-shaking. For dessert we split a sour cherry pie-looking thing with Sichuan peppercorn ice cream. It was good but the ice cream tasted like vanilla. The bill was $42 for 2 cups of soup 2 half sandwiches and one piece of cherry pie ala mode? I don't mind spending money but I hate wasting it. Oh, the tables are sooooo close together you can't help but to be involved in everyone else's conversations. I didn't mind that but I did mind the open-mouthed, smacking chewer and belcher sitting next to me.
