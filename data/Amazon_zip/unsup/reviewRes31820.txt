I like the Chicago Diner although I wouldnt say is my fav place to go out for vegan food. I really like the "Radical Ruban" and the Dagwood sandwiches, I like their mac n "cheese" and they make good vegan shakes. Ive never had a bad experience with any of the wait staff, they have always been nice and friendly. My only beef with the place is that there are a few things I love there and I dont really care so much for the other stuff. I have tried some of the other dishes other than my regular choices and have been underwhelmed . Oh well... Anyway it is still a great place to bring your non vegan/veggie friends. had to enjoy a tasty treat when down in boystown. yeah!
