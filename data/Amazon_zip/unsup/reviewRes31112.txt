The ambiance here is great, I loved the Asian decor and it was a very fun place to eat. My girlfriend and I split a total of four dishes and I enjoyed each one (Loompya, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Adobo Braised Pork Belly, and the Firecracker Sushi Roll) I can't wait to go back to try some of the other options; there were so many great things listed on their menu. One dish that MUST be ordered here is the Rock Shrimp Tempura. Our waiter mentioned that it is the most ordered dish and I can definitely see why. One word... AMAZING!
