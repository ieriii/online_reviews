I implore you to come here on a Wednesday and get the torta of the day. It's pork belly - and it's divine. As was the torta ahogada that my gal pal got. The chicken posole, on the other hand, was just fine. I think I just expected more, or something different than the posole I get from my friends' mom's kitchen. We sampled three different hot chocolates. I loved the almond one and the one with all the spices. And my agua fresca was super refreshing. Other than the weird ordering system (how does one tip properly in this situation?) and the posole - everything was fabulous. The only hard part is going to be coming here on any day other than Wednesday.
