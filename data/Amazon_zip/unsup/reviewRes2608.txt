Meh, not a fan. I went there with my boyfriend one afternoon because he heard that this place served rattlesnake as a hot dog. I, myself, wanted to try it out as well, but they ended up not having it that day. The owner or manager said to check their website to see when they'll have it--that's if I go back there again. I got the elk hot dog--or whatever it's called something along those lines because it won awards according to one of their frames on the wood panel wall. Truthfully, I've had better and would eat a ballpark hotdog over what I had there anyday. Fries were alright. Didn't get to catch the fat duck fries that their famous for either. I'm sure it was just slightly better. There was a long line going out the door, but the service wasn't too horribly long which was good. I don't know Doug, I wasn't too impressed. I'll have to give you a second chance some other day but not today.
