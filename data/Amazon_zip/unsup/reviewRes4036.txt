I know I know--the word is that the food is fabulous and worth the price especially since you can bring your own wine etc. And the chef has great talent with a smashing ravioli like none other and chestnut soup but some frankly-wierd combinations that don't play with old foodies like us. But the worst thing is the arrogance--the music is loud and crashing and unsuited to enjoying the food. But the waitstaff don't give a hoot--the chef likes the music--but so what if the customers don't.  And what kind of stupidity is it to charge $5 fee for BYO and not provide appropriate wine glasses--don't they know that wine should be served in decent glasses to get the full flavor?  One more thing. Lining up (#2 in the line) for the rst room, which necessitated standing aside the kitchen,which promised to be a worthy wait--we were shuttled back to our tables with a promise that we would be called when the restroom was vacant. Have they called you? They never called me. I will NEVER return to this restaurant. The food is excellent but there are far better places for food and none of them are as expensive or as arrogant and un-customer-oriented...try another place for good food. One Sixty Blue, A Tavola, Copper Blue, Tizi Mellou--don't go there and be treated like unwelcome family members.
