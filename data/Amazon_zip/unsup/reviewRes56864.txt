The thin crust pizza was so-so, but I'd go back to try another and give it a second chance. The beer from this brew-pub was good, and I love the fact they don't distribute, which increased my rating to a 4 star.Seating was very nice (we sat down at the garden level). It was lunchtime on a Friday and there was plenty of room for our large group.
