I got take-out here a few weeks ago, and was impressed. It wasn't cheap, but five rolls were more than enough to fill two ravenous people. They have lots of interesting, non-traditional menu items too. The restaurant itself looked cool -- quite small and dark with Japanese cartoons on a projection screen.
