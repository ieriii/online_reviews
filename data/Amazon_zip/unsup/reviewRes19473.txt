I'm happiest when surrounded by fantastic, authentic food, in a cafe atmosphere. Xoco brings all these things and more, to one space. Each of the three times that I've dined here, my meals were superb. I've had lunch at Xoco on 2 occasions, never encountering a line. I walked straight to the staff at the register and ordered the 'Caldo' consisting of woodland mushrooms, zucchini, potato-masa dumplings, black bean broth, spinach, avocado, and serrano chile. Amazing!! Right then and there, I told myself that this would be the soup that would get me through those chilly Chicago days. My second visit, I had to have the 'Caldo' again!! Third visit to Xoco, I returned with a friend. Although I wanted to get that amazing 'Caldo', I figured I should try something else on the menu, so I ordered the 'Woodland Mushroom torta'. The wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, Prairie Fruits Farm goat cheese, black beans, wild arugula, and 3-chile salsa, stuffed between bread, was absolutely delicious and quite filling. Took me a minute to nosh on. I also had 2 drinks - The concoction of raspberry and lime (can't recall exactly) juice and ended up ordering one of the hot chocolate's to go. Delish!! Everything about this food is exceptional. A wonderful addition to Chicago and for all that enjoy eating great food!
