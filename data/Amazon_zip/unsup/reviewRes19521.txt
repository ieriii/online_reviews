Can you please tell me what 20% of $125 would be? $25 you say? Right. So can you explain why our waiter, John, got up in our grills for leaving a $24 tip? Apparently he considers that to be only 12%.  I'm not sure where he took math. Everything leading up to this was wonderful. Some of the best sushi I've ever had - fresh, flavorful, wonderful indgredient combinations... Excellent service... almost. So we camped at our table, this much is true. But we also order $125 worth of food.  When the waiter thought we had left the 12% tip, he came up to the table and said "Um, I'm sorry, was there something wrong here? Because it's my job to ask. You only left me 12%."  We explained - we split the tab between 3 cards. $8 tip on each. That's $24. Which equals 19%. Okay, so maybe it was 1% less, but are you seriously insulting us like this? I tried to explain the situation and he got very huffy.  "Well, the standard is at least 15%, but if that's what you guys are USED to leaving, that's fine, but I'm just saying..." Uh, didn't I just explain this to you stoopie pants? I dropped another $10 in cash, even though I knew we were in the right. Why? Because I had a buzz and had no desire to argue with him anymore.  This seriously put a damper on what would have been a 5 star experience. And further more, I really liked our server up until this point. And having been a server, I completely understand his frustration HAD we actually left a mere 12%. I'm just upset that he chose not to listen. So he ultimately received a 24% tip. And we received a major insult. Fair trade? I think not.
