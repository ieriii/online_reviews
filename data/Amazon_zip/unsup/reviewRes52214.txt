I'm usually a thin crust pizza kind of a gal, but for lunch this weekend we went to Gino's East and decided to try the deep dish. The buttery crust was delicious and the pizza was so good that I ate two pieces- which is a lot when you are eating deep dish pizza! The mozzarrella sticks were good too since you have to wait 45 minutes for the pizza to be ready- and they hit the spot!
