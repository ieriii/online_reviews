For a restuarant in Bridgeport, this is as good as it gets. The owner, staff, crowd and vibe is all 5-star quality. Had the leek soup, pork shoulder entree, onion rings (!), smores puffs and apple, cranberry and walnut pie. Everything was fresh, intensely flavorful and made you want to marry into the family. Recently featured on the Food Network as well. Will be back for the brunch everyone raves about as well as the Sunday Night fried chicken dinner ($22/person with all the fixin's) If you don't mind going a bit out of the way it is completely worth the trip.
