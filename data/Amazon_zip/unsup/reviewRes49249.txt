I love this place. Their wine selection is excellent. I'm not a huge wine connoseur, so I can appreciate the staff's knowledge of different wines from around the world! Our bartender picked out a great red, and was totally on point.  I also really the cheese plates and the little retail section. I don't think this is a great date place, but fun for girls night or with a group. I don't think the ambiance is quite romantic, but fun.
