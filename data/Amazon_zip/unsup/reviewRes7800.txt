This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I love it. I'm totally biased. I've known the owner for years. I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never eaten anything that would get less than four stars.  They have great outdoor dining along Schubert, which is relatively quiet. I'm a huge fan of their veal osobucco, but for this time of year, try the milk and honey ribs. I used to think ribs could only be slathered in barbecue sauce -- Anthony is the Tyler Durden of my personal Rib Club experience. Other great warm weather meals are the rigatoni caprese and the lobster cappellacci. And, for starters you can't beat the crostini di avocado or the grilled calamari. Also, if you're dining out and its really warm, you have to have the insalata stella. It's sweet and cold and I think I might one day just have that as my dinner. (Who am I kidding? But I might have it as my first dinner of a two dinner line-up. The perfect follow-up would be the spaghetti barese. Veal meatballs. Best meatballs I've had in the city.)
