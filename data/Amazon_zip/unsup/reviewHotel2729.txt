I've been to most every hotel in Chicago, and the James is my favorite. Our room was very large (and I believe it was just a standard room) and had a completely usable sitting/reading area. Everything was beautifully appointed, the bed was fantastic, and the TV was huge too. I'd say it compares to the Mercer in New York, except for 1/4 of the price and without the pretense. The James is the best boutique hotel in Chicago, and if you can stay there for less than $150 as I did, you'll feel that you got a great deal.
