Absolutely fantastic place for lunch! I know that it is well known for dinner (as there are no other comparable restaurants in Old Irving Park), but it is just too long of a wait at dinner time even with a reservation. The food is really tasty and reasonably priced for lunch, but I had a pretty inexperienced waiter the last two times. The service during dinner is much better but I feel that the food is a bit on the expensive side for what it is.
