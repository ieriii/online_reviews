It was late. I was hungry. And Grand Lux is less than a block from my office. Although I've never had a bad meal at The Cheesecake Factory, it's not my first choice - in fact, it probably doesn't even make it into the top 20 - when choosing a place to nosh. Simply, I'm not a fan of chains. To my surprise and delight, however, the Duck Potstickers appetizer I ordered was fantastic. Truly delicious. I also got the Coco-Mac Chicken Satay - chicken on a stick rolled in coconut and macadamia nuts. These fell a little short of my expectations, which was not a surprise. Every time I order a "something-crusted something" I always expect giant chunks of the delectable crusty goodness - and every time I'm faced with a thin coating, a semblance of the mouth-watering ingredient I ordered the dish to taste. Other than that, it was another successful meal from the Grand-Cheese Empire.
