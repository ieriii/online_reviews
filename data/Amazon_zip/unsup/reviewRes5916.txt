My husband and I are big fans of this place! We've been twice now, and it just seems to keep getting better as we try new things! The food is just outstanding. The service is always knowlegeable and friendly. The place has a great, cool vibe. They don't take reservations so we always go prepared to put our names in, take a walk down the street and have a drink while we wait for them to call us. (Considering it gets a little crowded as people wait at the bar). Definitely go, definitely try things you normally wouldn't... you'll be pleasantly surprised!
