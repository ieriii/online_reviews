My wife loves this as a lunch spot, especially the chicken salad sandwich. I think looking at chicken salad or tuna salad alone makes me think of not eating, but hey, who am I to judge. Salads and breakfast food are great as well. Used to be able to sit outside and enjoy good food, but heavy construction in the area makes this an inside place. Try it on your way to Grant Park, Navy Pier, or Ohio Street beach
