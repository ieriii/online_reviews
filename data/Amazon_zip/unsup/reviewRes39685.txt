If you want to see the most interesting effort to brand oneself as an ampersand, then Longman & Eagle is the place for you. A small group of us had dinner here on a Saturday night after an accurate heads up for a 2 hour wait. Quick note, but it may help to call ahead here. For groups of 6 or more, they may be able to hook you up with a reservation, but they're scarce. Still, friendly staff that were polite, efficient, and friendly. Moving on to the bar, we enjoyed the full range of beer (nice variety on tap), 3 buck whiskies (the list is also comprehensive for the price), and a few cocktails to round it out. The cocktail list was lighter than I thought it would be, maybe 6ish choices. But, some were interesting takes on more traditional cocktails without selling out for shock value. While it wasn't my favorite drink that night, there was a gimlet-ish drink with an interesting mix of Tanq, lime, and chartreuse that is worth a look (thanks Molly O for the heads up). Felt more like a summer drink than the arctic Chicago evening we were out in, but a good drink is still a good drink. Someone also tried the Manhattan and the hot toddy with yuzu... that one may become a new cold remedy. I think somewhere in the evening we sat down and ate dinner. I couldn't pass up the pork belly and pumpkin risotto; pretty good, but fair warning that its as heavy as it sounds - twas a bit fatty, even for pork belly. Bring an appetite. For me the buzz was worth it. Its not original, or some crazy new place - it does a few important things really well. High marks for value - great food at a competitive price versus other similar places. The friendly laid-back service sealed the deal - I'll be heading back soon (well, when the snow takes a break).
