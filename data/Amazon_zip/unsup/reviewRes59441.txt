I had a chance to visit the cold Windy City in October 2011. I asked what is to try out here, and everybody said Giordano's. I was told to try the pizza however I opted to have the Italian Beef sandwich instead with the Antipasto salad. Excellent. Very tasty food and the service was very good too. Met some other people there that was also their first time eating at Giordano's. Great vibe environment. I had planned to come back and try the pizza there the next day. Too bad I had to travel out of Chicago unexpectedly the next morning. Maybe next time. Now that I think of it more, the Italian Beef was so good that there is a big chance that I will choose it again before trying the pizza in the future :-P
