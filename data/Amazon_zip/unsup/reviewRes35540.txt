This place kills it. More specifically, it kills over 1,000 ducks a week including 1 for me. And mine is always incredibly delicious. With a focus on roast meats (aka BBQ), this place is a welcome change from the usual Chinese. The Peking duck here is outstanding. No visit is complete without one. The roast chicken (soy sauce chicken) is out of this world and so is the roast pork, although get a larger portion of the latter or skip it as smaller orders just get you boney little chunks. The beef chow fun, walnut shrimp, stir-fried Chinese broccoli with garlic, stir fried bok choys (both versions), and Chinese eggplant are all delicious as well. In fact, pretty much everything we've tried here has been a hit. Come with a big group and leave fat and happy. 1,000 deliciously dead ducks per week can't be wrong!
