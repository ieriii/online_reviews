I would give this a five but they took my fave sandwich off the menu. I've been here numerous +30 times for lunch in prob a 9 month span, but it's been a while now. The only annoying thing is every time they give their spiel and ask if you want their 30 minute dessert(granted they ask before your food arrives) The food is consistently great. Their menu can be overwhelming but everything I've had has been awesome from sandwiches to enchiladas to Chinese to pasta...I think you understand. Highly recommend for lunch and a cheap casual dinner. Oh yeah portions are huge.
