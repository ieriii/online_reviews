This place just opened in the last month or so and I've already been three times! Great hand made pizzas that they make right in front of you. Delicious grilled chicken that might be even better than the pizza, and that's saying alot. They just put in some TVs so sitting at the counter you can watch some sports or watch the chef assemble pizzas right in front of you.  The guys that run the place are really down to earth too. I had friends from out of town visiting and I wanted them to try one of the more than 20 different varieties of gourmet pizzas. My friends didn't want to delay our night of drinking even for an hour so we called and asked if we could BYOB (I didn't notice any signs saying that we could on more earlier visits so I was weary) and they had no problem with it!  Great place and great food. Very small location so unless it's groups of three or less plan on carry out. Located in the shadow of the Diversey Brown Line.
