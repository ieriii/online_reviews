You know I'm just using you for your pool, right? OK, cool. Now that we're on the same page, can I contradict that by adding "and your wine bar"? Yeah, well yours is pretty great. And noshing delicious cheese and amazing wine does not prevent the swimming, so it all works out. The wine + cheese flights here are inspired, especially if your thing is to nerd out on wine and cheese. The thing that impressed me, although it could be considered overly corporate (whatevz) is that they added a printout of each cheese and wine's description right next to the thing. So instead of bugging your server to remind you which-is-which, you get a cute little card that you can tear out and bring home to enable future wine + cheese awesomeness.  They had a cheese flight that had "coronary" in the name. It's this amazing brie flight. I informally renamed one of them as "Orgasmic Cheese." That should tell you something.
