Bufalina pizza with fresh tomatoes, basil, mozzarella di bufala, and olive oil is my #2 pizza of all time (my #1 is completely different, so it is hard to compare)! Plus the owner (he acted like it) was so extremely nice, he made you feel like your friend that goes there every day...he gave us pizza dough when we left, which we baked later for another meal...so nice!
