I love the atmosphere and have always had really good service (been there around five times now). BYOB is a bonus. They are crowded and noisy on the weekends but we usually get a table pretty fast. The portions are very large and on the pricey side agreed. BUT the problem I have with Caro Mio is the last two times I have been there my dishes were way, way too salty. Now, I am a huge salt freak. I salt everything, liberally. But Caro Mio has managed to insult my desensitized taste buds, not an easy feat. This is also not a place for a light meal. There is a lot of oil and cheese in everything and not very many veggies to be found. Overall the food is very familiar to what my sicilian grandfather cooked us all the time growing up so I disagree with people who say the food is not "authentic".  It is a place you go to for large, heavy, hearty, meaty, cheesy dishes and BYOB which is sometimes just what the doctor ordered :).
