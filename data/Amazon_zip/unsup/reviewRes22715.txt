51...52...53...54! I counted 54 chili peppers on my dish of dry chili chicken! My mouth is watering just thinking about how good this dish is. The chicken has a light crisp texture on the outside, is moist on the inside, and is bursting with chili flavor. My only complaint was that I wish the portion was bigger as I practically inhaled this dish.  I also loved the dry chili string beans and the eggplant in garlic sauce. I requested that they go easy on the oil as eggplant is sometimes be deep fried before it's stir fried, and it came out perfect.  I only wish I didn't have to go to Chinatown to enjoy Tony's food. Tony, if you're reading...open up shop on the North Side!
