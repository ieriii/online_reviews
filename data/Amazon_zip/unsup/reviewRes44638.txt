I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could be more specific. But it's not worth a 4 in my opinion. Our service was decent, not bad at all. If you are in a hurry though, might wanna skip this place. It was 2:30pm on a Thursday, no lunch or dinner rush, we didn't get out of there until 3:50pm and just ordered a small deep dish pizza (canadian bacon, peperoni, and black olives). The small was enough to feed 3 adults easily and we were stuffed. The pizza was good... the cheese was amazing, but the sauce was just not to my liking, maybe it was just me though and my taste buds because my boyfriend and son really liked it...
