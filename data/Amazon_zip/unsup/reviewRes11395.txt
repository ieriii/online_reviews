If i was giving a rating based on pizza alone, I'd give this place a 3.5 or 4/5. It's not the best in the world, but its pretty good. What really makes this place is the great atmosphere and the good beer selection. Coupled with the great location, and you've got yourself the building blocks for a solid night out in hipsterville. I usually find myself disappointed with microbrews, but the beers here are solid. Other highlights include the live-band karaoke.
