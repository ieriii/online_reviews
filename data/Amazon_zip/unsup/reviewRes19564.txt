Thank you Rick Bayless! You saved my foodie vacation after a horrible trip to Graham Elliot. I was in Chicago for 4 days, and I ate here twice. Your tortas are to die for. Everything was perfectly spicy, juicy, saucy and flavorful. Any line is worth the wait for this food, even in the humid, hot Chicago summer. And your prices at XOCO are soo reasonable! Homemade churros with soft serve - a triumph. There is a reason you were Top Chef Master, Rick. And anytime I am in Chicago, you can bet I will be here.
