This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've been here more times than I can count, and I have had maybe one or two "OK" meals. Everything else has been good to excellent. The servings are generous, but not overly huge. The quality of the food is very high, and everything is usually very tasty. The menu is hand-written and then photocopied. I am not sure if it changes daily or what, but the selection is always fresh. Despite not being very big, there are always multiple things on the menu that sound good to me and it's tough to make a decision! They do a standard brushcetta and a special one that is always changing. They always have several pizzas, pastas and entrees. They are accommodating of special requests; if there is a chicken dish that is not boneless, they'll gladly make it with boneless chicken breast if you ask. The prices are in line with what you get. The service is generally pretty good. The staff is friendly but professional, and they're not attitude-y or stuck up. Now, the downsides: There can be a long wait for a table sometimes, especially on the weekends. In fact, last time I tried to go they said 2.5 hours! Needless to say, I went somewhere else. But that was uncharacteristically long for them, so I don't penalize them for it. The upside of the waiting is that they have three bars (main dining room, coach house and upstairs). The other downside is that the main dining room is VERY loud and VERY crowded. I don't really like to eat down there. Insider tip: Ask to get seated upstairs. Same food and service, but more spacious and less noisy.
