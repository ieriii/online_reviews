If I could give 3.5 stars I would. Or more specifically: 2.5 stars for a weekend evening, 4.5 for brunch. Alas, this is not an option. I've been here for several a-meal. I really don't like coming here for weekend dinner or even drinks later on. It's just too darn loud. I don't appreciate having to yell to my dinner companions to be heard. I understand that it's a bar but it's just too crowded and noisy, especially since it's decorated like a library or study. However, brunch is spectactular. You can get a proper English breakfast or something less traditional. I've always enjoyed myself when I've come for brunch and the noise level is appropriate. Service is great too.
