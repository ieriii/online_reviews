Coast is one of those places where the quality of the food can never make up for how stupidly packed it always is. On the plus side, it is moderately priced and the fish is of good (but not the highest) quality. And it's BYOB. Then again, because of its BYOB policy and location it is always packed. It's loudly obnoxious and even though the place takes reservations, you'll have to wait longer to get your table and food. Given the other sushi options in the city, I don't think Coast is worth the wait. Try a place like Tsuki which offers the same quality fish at similar prices, yet fewer crowds.
