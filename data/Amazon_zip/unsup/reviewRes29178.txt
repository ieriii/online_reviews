It's eensy weensy, and somewhat crowded, but wow is the service fast. Waiter chap was going on all pistons. So was the kitchen, which is right in the middle of the joint, so you watch the cooks making your food while you wait for it. And the food is uber cheap ($6 generously sized entrees; small salads that can pass for larges, yadda yadda).
