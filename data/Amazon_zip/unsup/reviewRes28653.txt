It is with good reason Pasta Bowl rates their Farfalle Pollo as the customer favorite. It is as good as it is simple and straightforward. This bowtie pasta comes with grilled chicken, sun dried and fresh tomatoes, mushrooms and basil in a tomato cream sauce. It's a dish that's probably been done at a million other Italian restaurants, but Pasta Bowl totally gets it right; near perfection. Outside of that, a great spinach salad and Grilled Chicken sandwich too ...the chicken has an amazing wood grilled flavor to it.
