I can not believe all these reviews I read about this hotel. And you shouldn't either. This hotel has lots of charm. I, never been to Chicago before, looked for something near sights and close to the Mega Bus stop I had to find the next day.. I completely enjoyed my stay. I was alone, they upgraded me to a king on the 7th floor. Almost a corner room overlooking the park. I was not visited by any ghosts but had I known this hotel was known for ghosts, I would have chosen another. I'm glad I did not know.Yes, the room looked old with beautiful antique furniture, a safe in the closet if needed I could vividly imagine how it was as years ago. It was quiet and warm. I later learned I could open the bay-like windows and my view was amazing! I could see the Ferris wheel lit up on Navy Peer and the beautiful park across the street. I did not need any Internet access nor did I need HBO. My room was absolutely perfect! I got lost in the bed because it was huge and comfortable with 4 or 5 pillows. It felt luxurious. The bathroom was small but clean and had everything I needed. The Kleenex box was fluffed up to look like flowers which was a nice touch.I used to clean hotel rooms and I am in the service industry so I am probably over critical. I would have liked a mini-fridge for my leftovers.The bell boy was so helpful. He offered suggestions on where to go and what to see. Told me I could catch the 26 bus on the corner which took me right to the Union Station. He told me Navy Peer was 2 miles away so I decided to walk there along Lake Michigan and it was awesome! I took a cab back to the hotel, hopped the bus as instructed and took a ten minute ride to Union Station where I took the Mega Bus back to Minneapolis.
