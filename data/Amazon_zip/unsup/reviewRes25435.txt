Very nice and cozy spot for fondue. It's is dark and smells of hot oil. Don't wear anything you don't plan on washing right away. The smell will seep into your clothing. Also, make sure you check your coat to avoid a trip to the dry cleaners. The portions are nicely sized. It is a perfect date place. The complaint here is there isn't a lot of options like the Melting Pot. You have one kind of oil, one kind of salad, one kind of cheese and one kind of dessert chocolate. They do it all very well but just not a lot of choice. Have a reservation or don't plan on getting in. I would not recommend for a large group. Just too cramped in there.
