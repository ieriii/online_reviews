Excellent service, great tasting food, perfect spice, and quality of all items were amazing. Ordered a drink as well and bartender was very helpful. Several employees made sure I was happy and comfortable. I last night had dinner which I really enjoy, but buffet I have gone to a few times too and really enjoy. I prefer dinner time, but it is matter of preference. I believe one should try both though. Thank you for a great evening India House, I plan to continue to come often.
