It's definitely obvious this is a place set up by some prosperous businessman friends, because its extremely comfortable and aesthetically forward, with a sumptuous spread and fun cocktails - and because there are a comical number of folks employed. The restaurant and bar were nearly full, and there may have been more folks working than dining. This isn't to fault this place in any way, but I hope you see how it could be quite funny. One more note - all of the meat is very good, of course, and in particular, the short rib was a real treat.
