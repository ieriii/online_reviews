I am so glad to live close to this Ethiopian spot. The servers are helpful, professional, and possess a dash of humor. The space is open, so it is a great spot for groups. There is live entertainment on the weekend. They updated there wine list and have tastier choices. The sambussas (and spicy dipping sauce) are super tasty. There are several vegetarian meal options to share that are fantastic. Bottomless injera (Indian bread). Steps from the red line. Yes, please!
