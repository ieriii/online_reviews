In (the other) Michael S's town for a conference and we're at the Drake. Desk staff is the reason for the low rating. F&B staff first rate, housekeeping kept their mocking to themselves. But concierge and desk service was very uneven. Case in point: One of my companions had her purse stolen during lunch (in the Drake room). Desk staff does very little to assist her in getting money, i.d., submitting police report, etc. but focuses on how she'll pay for her (overpriced undersized) room. I cannot emphasize how utterly uninterested these people seemed in the needs of their guests. Recommended to conference officials that they find another Chicago venue. Thank you for your attention.
