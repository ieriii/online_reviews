The atmosphere is pretty dark so keep your eyes open. I have dressed both formal and casual here and always feel better about fitting in when I dress up a little more- but not necessary. With that said shorts and flip flops would not be recommended. The steaks are very good. If you are a steak snob or have very high standards you probably will say its not the best steak in Chicago but it is very very good. The sides are excellent. I recommend the lobster mashed potatoes for sure and prepare for a coma. Finally, if you leave not trying the butter cake, then you missed the point of going to Mastro's. It is excellent topped with a side of homemade whipped cream. In fact I know people who eat a light meal here and order two of the butter cakes! Nice place to go and celebrate a special occasion (note it is pricey). Noise level is a little loud even though the atmosphere is intimate. So sit close to each other if your seeking a more romantic conversation. Service was excellent both times I attended. Waiting in the crowded bar watching the live entertainment- the hostess always seems to find me (with no buzzer) to let me know my table is ready. Reservations were received on time for both my occasions. An excellent night out.
