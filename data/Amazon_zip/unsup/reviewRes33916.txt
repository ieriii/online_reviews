This is a favorite Friday night stop for me, especially when it's cold outside and I need some food FAST! The falafel sandwhich is terrific but often I prefer the lamb shwerma served in a pita pocket and a bowl of lentil soup. The prices are great except for the beverages which often run between $1.50 - $2.00 for a can or bottle of soda. And I'm now addicted to the date-filled cookies sold near the register! The decor is bright and colorful, with filligree lamps and hookas setting a comfy tone and the staff is engaging and courteous.  Hours: Monday - Saturday  9AM - 9PM Closed Sunday
