So im a big fan of Hells Kitchen and they always make Risotto and I have never had it, so I decided to go to an Italian restaurant and try some. The food was was pretty good, the service was exceptional, the staff was all really nice, The manager came over to make sure everything was going good. (I love service like that) They brought us pizza break on the house (yes free food lol) I think my only complaint would be the atmosphere, it was extremely dark in there, you almost wanted to ask if they could cut on a few lights. Besides that everything else was good its white table cloth dining the prices for dinner is $16 - $25 average for an entree. So good for what you get. Oh one funny thing is they have a parking lot right on side of the building (attached) so like you walk out and the lot is right there. But it's valet parking, Its weird just park your car on the street.
