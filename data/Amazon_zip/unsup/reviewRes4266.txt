Went on a Saturday night to see an out of town band from NYC. There was a small cover charge, but that's no different than any other jazz club on the weekends. Gotta pay the musicians! The music was top notch but the Quartet, billed as being from NYC, was 1/2 filled with Chicago ringers. Great players, still, but a bit misleading... We couldn't get a seat anywhere and it was only 8:30pm. That's my only beef with this Club, it gets crowded, and people end up standing around. The owner did set us up with two flimsy folding chairs, but as soon as bar stools opened up, we made a break for it! I love the wide age range of the patrons, and the club filled up with young sexy club goers as the night went on. But as full as it got, getting a drink was never a problem! I hadn't been to the Green Mill in a long time, and in my mind this place has kind of a "tourist attraction" "speakeasy has-been" reputation that's not quite deserved. Well, save for the German tourists that requested "Chattanooga Choo-Choo" from the band playing modern jazz... We stayed long enough to see the changing of the band guard and the local Deep Blue Organ Trio blew away the "NYC" cats. Kudos to them! I would like to see LESS "shushing" here. I've played jazz plenty of places in the City and it's not like jazz standards needs pin-drop quietness from the patrons. Jazz is not a museum piece and need not be treated as such. Still, everyone at the club was very nice, and the high level of service and the talent of the musicians will bring me back.
