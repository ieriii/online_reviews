One cannot say enough good things about the diner. Almost everything is vegan, all vegetarian, and it can all be made vegan. The desserts are all vegan and I highly recommend the cookie dough milk shake with a slice of cookies'n cream cake! The reuben is a must (and sweet potato fries, and mac'n cheese too!).
