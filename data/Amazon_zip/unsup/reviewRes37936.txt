I'm just joining the bandwagon here, but I don't care. Hop Leaf is worth the 3 day wait for a table, the crowded bar area and the rest. I can't remember where I've had tastier mussels, a more intriguing selection of appetizers or a better selection of beers... OK I can't remember where i've had better beers because I probably drank too much wherever that was! If you are really hungry, eat something first, then go. Last time I ate here we waited about 1 hour 45, so make sure you really like your company! Just BE CAREFUL if you get seated and order a ton of food, because you might end up in a coma. Serious.
