Honestly, how do you people eat here and enjoy it! My boyfriend and I decided to try somewhere new to eat and since this place had such good yelp reviews we decided to give it a try. I wish I didn't. As some people have mentioned before our food came out really quickly, but way too quickly. There is no way that our meals could have been prepared in the time that it was brought to our table. Our waiter was flighty, my food was lukewarm and overall I found the place to be very odd and uncomfortable.  I would never recommend this place to someone nor would I ever return. Their food = not authentic
