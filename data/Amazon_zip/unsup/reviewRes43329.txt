Milk and Honey is a great brunch place (love that there is outdoor seating in the warm weather months). I agree with Rachel that the walk up and ordering system is a bit annoying -- but the food makes up for this in spades.  I highly recommend their granola. It's ridiculously good.  So good that they've started selling it at Whole Foods! It comes in different flavors too (Cinnamon, Pumpkin Spice). You can also get it as a topping on your keifer down the street at Star Fruit. I highly recommend Milk and Honey. It can get really crowded on the weekends, so maybe try to go during the week.
