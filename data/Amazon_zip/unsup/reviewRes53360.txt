Having eaten at Michelin 3-Star restaurants all over the world, I can easily say that Alinea leaves all the others in its dust. It was worth every penny not only for the exquisite and unique food, but for the entertainment value. Where else can you go for a meal and never eat off of anything that looks remotely like a plate -- and where every item that is used to hold or contain each morsel of food is something you've never seen before? Where else can you go where you feel like you've died and gone to Heaven after every bite? The word inventive is wholly inadequate to convey how off-the-charts the food is. I spent the entire meal with my jaw on the floor, so to speak, and was utterly depressed when the meal was over and we had to leave. Save your shekels, and then run, do not walk, to Alinea. You will have a meal you will be talking about for the rest of your life. Wishing Grant Achatz good health and happiness for decades and decades to come.
