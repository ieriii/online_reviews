Started our restaurant week extravaganza off at Brazzaz. We went on a week night and got reservations for the same night we booked. Didn't have any of the waiting issues a few people seemed to, as we were seated right away, even though we were a bit early. Our waiter started off super nice and attentive, but kind of disappeared and never came back - not a huge deal, since the men with the meat were our main target! We ordered an overpriced bottle of wine (seriously, I google-ed it when I got home... 75% markup!) but it was a decent suggestion. The salad bar was amazing - but I was careful not to fill up on the healthy stuff... I was in the market for beef! Nice selection though, from capresse salad to mushroom risotto to sushi (sushi didn't look to hot though). The meat... ohh the meat. Every piece was my favorite piece. The chicken was not too bad, but nothing like the meat! You certainly couldn't eat like this all the time, but every once in awhile (and especially at the discounted price) this is a wonderful indulgence!
