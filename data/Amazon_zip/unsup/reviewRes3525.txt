I had the opportunity of dining here this past Saturday with two good friends. I thought it was absolutely fantastic. I never realized it was there. The owner was super cool and full of enthusiasm about his restaurant. He spoke to everyone and had a great demeanor. The food was delicous. I had the chicken sandwhich with BBQ sauce and my friends had the chicken strips and a korean burrito. The service was great, atmosphere great and I cannot say enough good things about it.  I would go back for the service alone. I work in a hotel and oversee the concierge department and have told my concierges to check it out since we all live in the neighborhood. Send your friends...we need to make sure places like this survive!!
