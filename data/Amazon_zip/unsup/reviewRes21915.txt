I always get the cheeseburger meal. So so so so so delicious, and who can resist sport peppers AND neon relish? Not me. Real nice staff, too. Last time my friends and I were eating at the drive-in, this swine creature parked next to us and we heard her yelling into the intercom and complaining about her food and FREAKING OUT and SCREAMING at the employees, and then she scarfed down as much of her meal as she could before asking them to "make a new one" upon the employee's arrival at the car. When the employee called her out on eating ALL OF IT, she said "You took long to get to my car, I got hungry!" If I weren't in my friend's car and afraid of her fucking up his car, I'd have flung some pickles at that beast.
