The Purple Pig has been another place on our long list of places to visit. It was a really cold night that my husband and I decided to have a date night. We never did make it to the movies since we ended up in a food coma! lol We had ordered several dishes Fried deviled egg was one of the firsts. We ordered one egg to share but after tasting it I knew I needed one of my own! So I ordered another for myself. Bone marrow smear.- This was something I had never had before and OMG boy have I been missing out. It was delicious. When the Marrow hit the bread it melted like butter. Neck gravy with ricotta smear- So typically I am not a fan of Ricotta but this was unlike any ricotta I ever had in my life. It was so delicious. Thanks to the Hungry Hound for this recommendation. Milk braised pork shoulder- This was so tender they served it with a spoon. So you think spoon and pork no way. Umm Yes Way! The spoon was able to get through the pork shoulder and then was so soft and tasty in your mouth. Dessert panini- Now this was ordered just because! We were already full but I just can not leave without dessert. I took one bite then saved the rest for later. It was so good I kept opening the bag all the way home. We did have some wine and beer which was really good. My first wine selection I did not care for but the second recommendation was right on target.
