Dirty, poor service and poor value.1. Dirty. The place is just not clean. The food preparer didn't wear gloves and was fingering my food. There were bugs on the floor (ok, sometimes that can't be helped) and a fly was annoying me the whole time I was there. It is very dingy inside.2. Poor service. The order taker had a bad attitude. Period. Spoke English with a heavy accent, and seemed ticked off at me for not understanding what he said. 3. Poor value. For over 5 dollars for a simple hot dog and 5--yes, count them, 5 french fries, the hot dog was very soggy and messy, the pickled tomato juice got all over the bun and fries making them soggy and ruining any flavor that might have been there. Five cold and tasteless fries? Seriously? The box it comes in squishes the hotdog and fries--poor presentation which made the meal unenjoyable. The nostalgia factor remains, especially for those who grew up with Superdawg (living in West Rogers Park and Skokie and Niles). But nostalgia isn't enough in this economy to have people coming back more than once. At other establishments, we could get the same meal for half the price and better quality in a clean environment with personnel who like their jobs or, at least treat their customers with respect and do their customer service jobs well. No friendliness here. Just what do you want, here it is, bye.
