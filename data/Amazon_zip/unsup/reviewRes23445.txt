Greek Islands consistantly has really amazing authentic Greek food. From the soup to the fish to the meats to the desert, it will not disappoint. It can get crowded here during meal times and there is sometimes a wait, which is one of the reasons I don't frequent the place as much, but overall it is a reliable place to get Greek cuisine.
