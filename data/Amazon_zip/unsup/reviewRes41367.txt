Tank Noodle anchors the corner of Broadway and Argyle, in the uptown neighborhood. It has very minimal decor, with tables surrounding the dining area, and a few larger ones in the center. But, You don't go for the decor. You go for the huge selection of menu items. There is a literal book, full of many entrees, appetizers, and beverages to choose. But, it is daunting, because most give very few details on what you'll receive. In my few times there, I haven't picked poorly though I might just be lucky. The wait staff was kind, and attentive, but constantly distracted. The place is usually packed, so keep that in mind. Also, don't expect any detailed explanations about all the menu items. Overall, a bit chaotic, and not much to look at, but delicious food, good service, and inviting atmosphere.
