I'll keep my judgments to myself about people preferring the Cheesecake Factory to GLC. The aesthetics AND food are waaaay better to begin with. The hot bread. The bread is so good, and In my many years of frequenting this place the bread AND food is always fresh and hot. For breakfast or Brunch I've only tried the chicken and waffles which are awesome btw, and rivals my grandma's. I like the beignets too. I do feel like this IS a 4-5 STAR Family spot, if anyone knows of a restuarant of this same caliber that even kids will enjoy please advise. IMO The Cheesecake Factory is not nearly as good as GLC. I have been back to the Cheesecake Factory once since this place opened and they are just not as good to me anymore since I discovered GLC..
