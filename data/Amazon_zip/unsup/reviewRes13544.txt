Sooo good! Sooo good! If you plan on visiting this place on a Tuesday night be sure to make a reservation. The place gets slammed. All you can eat crab legs and byob don't aide in turning tables quickly either. I don't really think you could go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. If crab legs aren't your thing - here are a few other recommendations that are pretty sensational. The chopped tossed cob salad with the warm bacon dressing ... phe nom enal. Seriously every perfectly chopped bite of spring mix was coated with this warm delicious goodness. Mussels are divine. The portion was very nice and they were all a decent size. Just when you get bummed that you've made it to the bottom of your bowl - you realize, you've only finished the first half. You still have 4 large pieces of fresh texas toast to sop up the flavorful broth. The scallops are divine and my husband really enjoyed his Rainbow Trout. We can't wait to go back. However, we will make sure we have a reservation. Too, an fyi to enjoy the all you can eat crab leg special the initial order must be placed by 9PM, but they continue to serve reorders until the restaurant closes. So eat up!
