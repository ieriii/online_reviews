I have only been to India House during lunch when they offer a buffet for around $15. Its not the cheapest lunch/buffet but it is well worth the cost. The food is really good and they have plenty of vegetarian options. The wait staff is very attentive so much so you never have an empty basket of naan or glass of water.
