I don't know much, but I know a good steak. And I can tell you you'll find one at the Kinzie Chop House. At least I did. I went with an associate a few nights ago and had a wonderful evening. The sommelier was fantastic and recommended a wonderful pinot noir that went great with the calamari app we had. The calamari was probably the best I've ever had - it was cooked perfectly. I mean PERFECTLY. The spicy aoli and marinara served along side it didn't disappoint either. The staff at Kinzie knows their stuff - our waiter patientely answered all of our questions and gave his best recommendations on cut, temparture, flavor, etc. I got the bone-in Delmonico (rib eye) cooked medium and it was quite tasty. I think next time I'd select medium-rare, but the flavor was still really great and the meat was tender. My associate said nothing but wonderful things about her filet and the sauteed spinach and mushroom side we split was tasty and enough for 3-4 people. The great thing about the KCH is the atmosphere - it's dark, woody, classy - very Chicago-steakhouse-esque. They take the time to explain things and allow you to really enjoy and savor a fantastic meal.
