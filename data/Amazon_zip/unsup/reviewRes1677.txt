Came on a Saturday thinking to grab lunch. Lunch ended up as early dinner as the line took 2.5 hrs!! By the time we got to the counter, I was starving and wanted to order everything on the menu to make sure I didn't miss out. I couldn't even finish 2 dogs. I love duck. Foie gras over duck sausage is amazing $9. Might be the most expensive encased meat out there. Other specialty encased meat is around $7.50 a pop and regular hot dogs are around 2.75. Alligator one was superb. Atomic bomb was pretty high up there on my list. Nice kick that wont burn ur mouth. Remember to get the duck fat fries offered Fridays and Saturdays!
