This was my first Fondue experience and WOW was i impressed! Our server, Kathryn was great! and the food was delish! I would recommend getting the premier dinner b/c the cheese and chocolate are definitely worth it! The decor is perfect...great for a date night (maybe not a first date b/c I kept dropping food off my skewer and had to fish it out...haha)! Will definitely be back!
