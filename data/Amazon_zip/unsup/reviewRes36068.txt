decided to have breakfast food yesterday, so me and a friend came here around 1 pm and of course there was a wait like most breakfast restaurants.. the wait wasn't too bad.. 20 min wait.. i ordered the Mana mau skillet and a large fresh squeezed orange juice.. i was kind of disappointed with their orange juice.. i was expecting it to be cold and in a decent size glass.. instead it was room temp and was in a skinny glass that can be finished in a few small gulps.. the mana mau skillet was pretty good.. it had grilled Black Angus steak, portobello, red onions, bell peppers, topped with Provolone, and 2 eggs on top the way you want it.. the steak was flavorful and tender so that's a plus.. oh and its a decent size portion too.. service was good.. waitress was attentive.. however..i think the food was just ok.. it didn't wow'ed me..
