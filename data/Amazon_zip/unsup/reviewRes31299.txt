My wife and I just went to Mastro's to celebrate our anniversary and I have to say, it was outstanding! It blows Ruth's Chris out of the water!! Everything was perfect. One of, if not the best steak I have ever had, and I have tried all the famous steak houses in Chicago. Highly recommended. The butter cake is out of this world, you might think you are filled after the steak, but order it anyway, you will finish it!
