Where have I been. I'm only the 1000th person to review this place. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. A tapas place with some nice surprises. Loved the Blue Fin tuna and you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped anything - I had dates and lamb wrapped in it...the fruit date, not my real date (darn it). I will be back.
