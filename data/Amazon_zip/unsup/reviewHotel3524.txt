Nice mid market hotel - the rooms are clean and comfortable, about what you'd expect. The real winners are: Service - genuinely helpful and pleasant. I travel a LOT and sadly, it is rare to see this. Location - half a block off the best part of Michigan ave. You can't beat that with a stick. I hosted a conference here for 30 people and they did a great job. Pricing is competitive, so I would certainly come back without hesitation.
