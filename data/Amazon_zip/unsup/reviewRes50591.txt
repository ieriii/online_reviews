Relish tray, get the relish tray. You will love the pimento cheese, okra and pickled watermelon rind. I tried my husband's duck and it was quite tasty. My brother and my friend both had the chicken and dumplings and nothing was left on the plate. My mom gave me some of the picked fried okra that came with her burger and I wish I had more. The amber jack special I had was scrumptuous. The parsnip puree that came with it was so good I wanted to rub it on myself. Unfortunately my entree was very late to the table but Big Jones redeemed themselves. The comped my glass of wine, my entree and when asked if we needed anything else my mom blurts out "champagne". Soon after a bottle of bubbles appeared. Nicely played Big Jones, nicely played.
