I really want to give this place 4.5 stars....but yelp doesnt allow for 1/2 stars. I was lucky enough to get in for dinner last night. We did the 9 course menu. My collegue/friend and his wife were dining with us - obviously they are big fans. Because my friend is sort of a "regular"...we did get a few extra courses (honestly we lost count but the wine could have had something to do with it). My favorite dish hands down was the quail egg ravioli drizzeld with white truffle oil - it was decadent. My next fave was the poached lobster dish with fava beans and something else - I can't remember what the something else was but it was damn good. To round out my top three - the dessert which was a take on meat & veggies. Sweet breads & a parsnip custard. It was really tasty and unlike any sweet breads I've ever had - it reminded me of caramel corn! My least favorite was the chicken liver - but that is more of a textural thing for me. The place is small and unnoticible from the outside. The chefs look like a bunch of roughnecks in the kitchen jamming out to some heavy/industrial music...and I loved it. One of the most memorable dining experiences I've had. If you are adventurous you should give it a go.
