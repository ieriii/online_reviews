I have been to Demera a few times and I think it is a good place to eat something exotic, and have a communal dinner with friends. However, last time (a Tuesday night), the service was really poor. Our reservation was at 8:30pm and, despite the place was half empty and everybody were almost done, it took the waitress 10 full minutes to come take our order. The wine arrived at the table only 30 minutes later and we waited 45 minutes for the food. We ordered the Family style messob sampler, specifying that we didn't want any spicy option. Unfortunately, there were at least 2 messob that were spicy hot. When I pointed that out to the waitress, she didn't apologize and she said that only 1 messob was spicy.
