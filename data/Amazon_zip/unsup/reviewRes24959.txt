We went with the other yelper suggestions and tried out the chef's tasting menu (without the pairings). Overall, the food was absolutely delicious and abundant. I felt that the portion size was just right, keeping in mind that it was both tapas, and a tasting menu. I appreciated the more creative spins on tapas classics like the papas bravas, and the bacon-wrapped dates with almonds and goat cheese fondue. We split a pitcher of the while, seasonal, sangria, which went very nicely with our meal. Out wait staff throughout the meal were fantastic, with a perfect awareness of when they were needed, and when was best to not come by. All our courses came perfectly spaced, and were nicely presented. My husband and I both agreed that the one off part of the night was the fact that dessert was not included in the tasting menu. I guess we kind of figured that at the price we were paying, all courses of the meal would be included. We decided to try out the desserts regardless, and were delighted by what we ordered - he had the rum cake (I think), and I have some sort of chocolate croquettes, which were delicious. Aside from the food, the space itself was a treat in itself. Housed in the former ballroom of the adjacent hotel, the dining room is high-ceilinged, colorful, and comes complete with a wonderful view of the park (and probably the lake during the day). I also really enjoyed the very open layout and modern decor. I would love to get some of their window decals designed to look like the pavers on las ramblas.
