This review is based only on their breakfast food, which is served all-day. We had high hopes based on other Yelp reviews but we were disappointed due to food that was poor to mediocre. The buttermilk pancakes with blueberries were too tart -- almost sour -- some bites tasted like we were sucking on a hard candy. The french toast was better, a little dry, we would rank it as fair to good. The side of bacon was perfectly average -- we're spoiled by a diner where we used to live that serves bacon double-smoked -- and the potato pancake was under-cooked and thus soggy with sour cream. (We hope that was sour cream.) The coffee was good, we'll give them that. I wouldn't go back for breakfast but might give their lunch or dinner a shot.
