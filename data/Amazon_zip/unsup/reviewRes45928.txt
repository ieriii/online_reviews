Grand Lux is a MUST if you're visiting the city. I like the ambiance and just being whisked away to enjoy the city lights of Chicago. Service is friendly and the dim lighting makes it seem so elegant and relaxing. I ordered a pasta and double espresso. Portions are filling, but there was no noticeable chicken in it. Haha. When I heard it was associated with Cheesecake Factory and that really turned me off since I can only think of it as 1) overpriced and 2) ubiquitous. I like Grand Lux a lot more :) Will definitely return back.
