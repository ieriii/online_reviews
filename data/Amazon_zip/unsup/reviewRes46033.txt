I have pretty fond memories of this restaurant. The first time I visited this spot was actually my first time in Chicago. Fresh of placing in the finals and presenting for a business plan competition,, me and my business partner went to celebrate.... Grand Lux is pretty damn good. Its like Cheesecake Factory's bigger more mature sister that even has a better body! The hostess stand is downstairs, and an escalator leads you up to the main dining room. Be careful coming up here, b/c the dining room floor is slippery as hell! The dining room over looks Michigan avenue and gives you an incredible view of the most popular street in Chicago. As far as the food is concerned, for appetizers you gotta make sure you jump on the Asian Nachos. They drizzled with warm cheddar cheese, grilled chicken, and they are covered with a sweet hot peanut sauce. Definitely a good look for an appetizer. The two entrees that we got during our dinner were a) Shaking Beef- Pieces of Beef Tenderloin, Red and Green Onions Sauteed with a Mildly Spicy Marinade. Served with Steamed White Rice. This was excellent, the beef was tender, the flavors were wonderful, and it went well with the assortment of veggies that came with the meal. B) Lemon Chicken Piccata-- covered with capers, mushrooms and served atop pasta, this is a wonderful dish that really works. I am always impressed at Grand Lux. this is a great spot for a business lunch, or a late night dinner. I cant really think of anytime where I have had a bad experience. The service is always crisp. Definitely a good look in the Chi.
