This hotel kind of reminded me of the casino hotels in Biloxi,MS to give you a reference. Some of the staff was nice and some not so much. It was weird no one offered to bring our bags to our rooms but only helped with our bags on our day of departure. I liked the complimentary lemon cookies from Maggiano's Little Italy which greeted us at the welcome desk. Although their breakfast is not as great as the ones served at Holiday Inn it was very sufficient with it's yogurt and bagels with various condiments such as cream cheese and peanut butter. The location could not be beat within walking distance of Michigan ave and Wacker Dr the dock for the Architectural Boat Tour and Xoco Rick Bayless restaurant! Next time I'm in town I definitely wanna check out the complimentary happy hour.
