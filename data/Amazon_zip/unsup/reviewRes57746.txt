I moved into the neighborhood recently and had been wanting to try this place. Now I dont know what took me so long!No surprise I ordered the turkey club. I am just a creature of habit. This was different though- on a grilled fresh italian baguette and the kicker was the piece of dill havarti. YUM. My mom had a veggie sandwich that was equally delicious. My brother ordered the bean soup and a piece of apple pie a la mode (he is so weird) We all left stuffed and very pleased with the meal and the service. I will definitely be back to try the breakfast as well as carry out. Very relaxed atmosphere and everyone in there looked like happy locals. People either seemed to linger or be able to get in and out quickly. The 3 of us got out for under $40 since we didnt drink any booze.
