I have in fact stayed at some great W Hotels...this is NOT one of them. I may be from Hollywood, but save the game of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for someone else...thanks but NO thanks! Let me start off by saying that this is my first ever Yelp review (first of many to come)...the sad part is that such a horrible experience is provoking my first motivation to actually critique a hotel establishment. I'll keep it short and sweet. I travel on a weekly basis for work and pleasure, have stayed in both fantastic and terrible hotels around the world. No story is necessary...when I fly across the country from LA on a weekly basis, I would like to arrive with first class treatment late on a Friday evening after a long work week, especially at $400 per night. Customer service is most important, and non-existent at this establishment (as pointed out by previous Yelpers). Even when I had a "good" stay in weeks prior, service was mediocre, room service blah, bar service...yikes. Oh, and hotel staff at the front should probably know a little something about the surrounding area, restaurants, etc...despite the fact that visitors can see the shadows of Navy Pier from their windows between the lake fog and the windy rain, a little "local knowledge" may go a long way here. Save yourself the $$, there are too many other options in the city of Chicago...when weather permits, you can walk to the lake from many other better options!
