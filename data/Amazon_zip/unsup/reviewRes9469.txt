Like everyone else, we had been anxious to get a table at Sprout. We finally went for my last birthday. It was great. All of the food was beautiful, expertly prepared, and delicious. The room is cozy but not too loud and the staff was very nice and knowledgeable. Initially, we found the menu a little confusing, but we were over thinking it. I had the delicious scallop appetizer and the steelhead entree. Both were fresh and delicious. My wife went adventurous and ordered rabbit, which she enjoyed. My dessert was the pistachio napoleon, which was slightly too sweet, but the puree was great. In between, we had a potato leek soup that was warm and creamy, with just the right amount of flavor and a small grilled cheese sandwich for a clever "cheese course." Our only little complaint was that the kitchen "lost" one of the appetizer orders, so we had to wait a bit for it to catch up. But, they made up for it with great service for the remainder of the meal and a free round of Port at the end of the meal. Excellent all around.
