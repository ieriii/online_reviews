My husband and I visited Geja's for our wedding anniversary. We'd always wanted to try fondue but never got around to it until then. I found the cafe on http://Restaurants.com and from the moment we walked in I was in love! The staff was excellent the place a was cozy, the wait staff was amazing that the food was a wonderful experience. The neighborhood added to the ambiance and it made for an enchanted evening. We plan to go back in a few weeks!
