Hellooooooooo hot cherry beer! Typically beer is best served cold, but I'm willing to make an exception. It's seasonal, so I have to be a good little Ericka and wait until holidays to get it. I guess it only makes it that much more special when I return next Christmas. And I fully intend to repeat Crunkmas annually. We had a huge group and took over the back room for most of the night. It made it a bit of a brew hike to the front bar, but grabbing our own drinks and paying right away made things so much simpler than if we'd attempted to have a waiter split it later. Why 4/5 stars? $6 for a small glass of warm beer is a wee bit ridiculous. I get it. It's cute, it's different, it's special. But even a blind man could see that it is overpriced.
