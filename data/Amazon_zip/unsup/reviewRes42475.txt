My favorite for deep dish/ stuffed pizza. I started going here for lunch with my hairdresser (before he left me for San Fran). If you're stopping in the restaurant you'll be able to get just a slice. It's a great deal and they always have several options to choose from. Don't know what to get? The Art's Special is a safe bet, makes for a great cheap lunch. If you are really hungry, as me and Josh would be after hours of highlighting, get some fries too! I would skip the salad as it tends to be all iceberg. If delivery is more your thing, call em up and get it hot to your door. If you order over a certain dollar amount they will throw in some free pop. Nice little incentive until you forget to tell them you only like diet and you end up with some bright red, radioactive, where is a 12 year old to drink this, mountain dew. If you like Chicago style pizza be sure to check out The Art of Pizza, you won't be disappointed!
