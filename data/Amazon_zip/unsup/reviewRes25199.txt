Restaurant Week at Geja's = epic win! The atmosphere was dark and romantic and perfect for a dinner date. Kind of has a Middle Eastern vibe to it as well. Initially, I was disappointed that they had run out of the scallops on the Restaurant Week menu, but that did not affect my experience in any negative way at all. The $32 prix fixe menu included a cheese fondue appetizer with a salad (the dressing was delish), entree (we got the chicken breast, beef tenderloin, and jumbo shrimp), and chocolate fondue for dessert. Can't really say too much about the food since we essentially cooked it ourselves, but the ingredients and dipping sauces were impressive both in quantity and quality. I've been to a few places for restaurant week already and I would have to say that Geja's definitely gives you the most bang for your buck!
