Seven of us enjoyed a delightful breakfast with great service. Banana bread french toast changed my life- fluffy, melt in your mouth deliciousness, with eggs, fruit and sausage on the side ("combo"). Good fresh fruit, too- pineapple, berries, none of this out of season honeydew/cantalope b.s. Lemon poppy seed french toast combo also ordered, smothered in fresh berries. Irish benedict was popular. Even the oatmeal was deemed outstanding! Highly recommended!
