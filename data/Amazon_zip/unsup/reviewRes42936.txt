Been lazy and haven't written a review in a while, but I've taken two trips to Gilt Bar the past two months, both terrific as always. A bit of a wait the first time, but had that not happened I would not have discovered Curio!  The more I go to Gilt, the more I realize how much their servers stand out among other restaurants in Chicago. About two months ago I believe it was Mike. I was there with a group of 4 and we probably ended up ordering half of the menu based on his recommendations. I'm not usually a dessert person, but I was so happy he convinced me on some cookie dough ice cream. Last week I went on a date and my server was zach. I didn't even need a menu with his in depth descriptions of the food. He had my mouth watering at the table. And again, they got me on dessert! I can honestly say I will be getting the carrot cake many times to come. My favorite item still is the foie gras and I love the changes to the gnocchi. Two awesome visits...more to come!
