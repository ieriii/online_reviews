Q has a great atmosphere with attractive interior design. It's VERY reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food that you're served (bottomless chips and pickles, a strange yet addicting combination). The pulled pork shoulder wasn't my favorite dish, but I loved the wings, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The baked beans also had generous amounts of meat in them, which was refreshing and a bit different. I also enjoyed all of the sauces that came along with my meal. I definitely recommend the milk and cookies for dessert (candied bacon maple cookie... so good!!). My Tanqueray and Tonic was a bit too strong. Had to add more tonic! When I feel like loosening the belt a few notches, I'll definitely be returning.
