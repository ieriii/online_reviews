I've been here twice and I've greatly enjoyed both experiences, but I would agree with some of the reviews that the food isn't spectacular-it's good, some of the items are really great, but nothing that stunned me into absolute admiration. Their home-brewed beer, however, is delicious. They also have an impressive array of other beers to choose from. As for the food, I've sampled quite a lot on the menu-the tofu sandwich is not so great, the burgers are good, the fish and chips is excellent, and the appetizers are to die for. The sweet potato cakes, the bacon fat popcorn and the cheddar ale soup left me salivating for more! Still on the lookout for another entree that truly wows me-definitely recommend giving it a shot, but try to go at a not-so-busy time, the wait can be brutal. I will definitely be going there again, even if just for the appetizers and beer.
