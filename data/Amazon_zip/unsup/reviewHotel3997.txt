I was privileged enough to experience Chi town for the first time in only a one and 1/2 day/short stay for a work convention I was coordinating. Our event took place at this hotel so how convenient is it that we got to actually stay here? :) I absolutely LOVE the location of this hotel because it's right smack dab near all the best restaurants and touristy spots in Chicago. And since we didn't have a rental car, my coworker and I got just a tiny bit of downtime to enjoy a nice stroll downtown and have my very first deep dish Chicago style pizza for lunch! And we had this event in May so Chicago...wasn't really the "Windy City" that it normally is. It was like summertime. My room here was amaze-balls! I had a huge comfy King-sized bed all to myself and I remember the pillows being marshmallow heavenly snuggle bunnies. The bathroom and the room itself was very modern contemporary, just the way I like it. The BEST thing about the room was the actual view that I had. Such a gorgeous view of the city and the water! I also liked the bar they have here. It was a pretty happenin' spot. I actually enjoyed a few strong drinks here with coworkers at the time (mind you, I don't think I turned 21 yet then...sssh!). They had this HUGE fishbowl of a margarita that came out and after sipping down more than 1/2 of that, I was quite impressed with the rest of my stay. ;) I also like the promptness of the customer service here. Especially when ordering room service. They brought up some late night snacks for me so quickly since I was straight buzzin after that margarita. LOVE me some room service baby. All in all, a pleasant stay here. It would have been nice if I to stay a few more nights and explore. Oh wells, next time I have a huge amount of random cash rollin' in, I'ma make my way back out to this city and hopefully get to stay here!
