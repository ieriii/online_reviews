On my recent visit to Chicago from Los Angeles I was so excited to again visit Ginos East pizza. This visit just didn't impress me as much as my past visits. It is definitely a good place to eat deep dish. But I think on my next trip to Chicago I will try another place. If you have never been then I do recommend you trying it. The atmosphere and restaurant is great. You can tag your booth or on the walls. But if you have been before and don't get deep dish often then I would recommend you try another place.
