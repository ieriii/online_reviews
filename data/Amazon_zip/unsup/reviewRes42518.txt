Great concept. This place was on my list for a few now, until last Tuesday. I was there with a friend and did not really what to expect in the sense that I had never been there so no idea as of the kind of service how big the place was. We get there, grab a couple of menus and check them out. Every thing seemed appetizing. We go to the counter ordered. Half a chicken with corn and potato salad as the sides, one large 4 cheese pizza, and a Marguerite slice, and a kibe and a coxinha as app. The girl taking the order was a little confused and asked if we wanted everything for there and at the same time. I replied "we'll take it as it comes out and yeap everything is for here" We sat down and the food started coming. The kibe and the coxinha were just ok, never had them before so maybe they are just not for me. Pizza slice was great, so simple and so delicious and flavorful. The chicken was just awesome, perfectly cooked with a little hint of lemon at the end, just amazing. Then we got the 4 cheese pizza, it was rich, very rich, too rich, and just as delicious. We each had a slice and could eat no more. I took the rest home and it made for a perfect breakfast the next day with some veggies and dried fruits that go perfect with cheese. They have many pizzas ready for slices and that is always a plus when in the run. Service is nice and the place is small with a few table, I did notice that most of their customer were to go so I guess it works. F2G Great, can't wait to go back
