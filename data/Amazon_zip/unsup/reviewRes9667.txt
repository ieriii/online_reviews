Well.... I wanted to love this restaurant but I just didn't care for it that much. Perhaps if I have ordered different selections on the menu it would have worked out better. Very romantic atmos. Very cozy. Staff was excellent and knowledgeable. We did the prix fixe menu selection. Dinner for 2 with 2 cocktails only and the bill was about $180 bucks. Yowsers. I had the "egg" choice to start - Not a good choice. It was basically french fries (chewy and dry), a poached egg (no flavor), pork belly (no flavor, very bland to be pork), argula (no taste whatsoever) and green beans (flavorless). I don't get the concept with these together. Wasn't tasty and it wasn't hot in temp. I had the "quail" selection for my 2nd course. This was tasty but the textures of the foie grais and the potatoes didn't cut it for long. After a few bites I felt like I was eating a bunch of grease. For desert I had the "popcorn" dish. Gelato with corn? Again, textures and combos together made no sense to me nor to my tastebuds. The grilled cheese sandwich was excellent! This was my 2nd intermezzo. Paired with the cider? Excellent!!! I loved it. The 1st intermezzo was a type of squash soup. I am not a sweet food fan so it didn't taste good to me at all. Gin Bucket martini was just okay also. I don't think I will be returning but if I do, I will definitely select different dishes. It wasn't memorable. There was a couple there that tried to pay with a Discover card (Note: They don't take Discover). The waitress was nice enough to let BOTH of them head to an atm to pay for their $200+ meal. WTH? So, I thought that was excellent customer service. They would have been washing dishes while they waited for the cops on my shift. :) I think I have a pretty good palate and my taste buds weren't awakened.
