Overall this place fails to impress me. I've had dinner here, and part of my chicken was not fully cooked. I've had brunch here. I liked their coffee and the crab benedict was delicious. I wouldn't mind trying to hang out here for drinks one evening, but I would not go out of my way for the food. Something about this place just makes me say "meh".
