This place has a line before doors even open!! The first day we were going to go but since I was hungry we went to the place next door and had the buffet. So the next day we decided this place is crowded for a reason. It must be the best and after that 20 minute wait we realized our assumption was correct. I got the countryside skillet with pancakes and my friend had the cheesy egg sandwich. This was a challenge and clearly food beat man this time!!! I was full til 5 pm!! I also tried the strawberry orange juice but it was too sweet for me...The pancakes had powdered sugar on top and they were good and fluffy. I would get that same dish again but definitely share it! I like yolk and will definitely go back if ever in Chicago again
