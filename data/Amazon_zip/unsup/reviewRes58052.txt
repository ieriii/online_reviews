Yes, I really love the food here. It has the best mapo tofu in town let alone compare to many other chinese restaurants in other cities. I really think chicago has some really amazing chinese restaurants. They also have a really good vegetarian dish called tong cai (it's a vegetable that they sauteed in garlic) that I always order when I am there. The food comes out right away and is always hot!! Their hot and sour soup is really amazing too. My husband enjoys the wonton soup a lot. We also really enjoy the beef with green pepper (it's not spicy unless you ask for it). The only thing that I don't really like about this restaurant is that it can get really busy and you would have to wait for a table especially when you get their around 830-900 pm. Be prepare to wait but the food is worth it.
