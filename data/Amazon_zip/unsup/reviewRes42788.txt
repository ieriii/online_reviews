Craving pure deliciousness, we decided to order some chicken from Fogo. Afterall, where else would one satisfy such a craving? Hmmm? So, we decided to split the whole chicken special and their veggie salad with fontina. It was mouth-wateringly-kickass-awesome-yummmmmm, and as usual, I wanted another whole chicken immediately after consuming half of said whole chicken. This is the 7th time now I have eaten here, and I am the type that prefers to cook my own meals most of the time. I'm just sayin'. this place is worth sacrificing the "I don't do take out" principle.  Ooops, I drooled on myself. P.S. I have also tried their pizza, and it's the perfect accompaniment to any chicken dish. =)
