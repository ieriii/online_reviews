One of the best omelets I ever had, and the potato pancake was to-die-for. However, I must add that the waiter, Brad, wasn't the most pleasant person to deal with and had an attitude. I had to keep asking him for coffee refills (only had 3 cups), and for a breakfast joint, this is not a good thing. I was speaking with another person about the diner, and they said the same thing that the service wasn't good.
