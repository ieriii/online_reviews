My boyfriend *loves* this place, and will probably kill me for not giving the full five stars. It only loses one in my book because it's not that veggie-friendly, but what can I expect from a place that focuses on its delicious meats and seafood? Three of us went on a busy Sunday night and were treated to tasty food and stellar service. I really wish I could remember our server's name because he was amazing- very on the ball, happy to make recommendations, personable and charming. Our food came out quickly and was tasty and very filling. We'll be back!
