What a pleasant stay! We were just here for a weekend but we were very impressed. The staff was courteous and accommodating. When we asked the valet for a cab, he offered to take us since it was only a mile or so away. The room was spacious and clean. The only drawback is that it's not really near a lot of "touristy" activities.
