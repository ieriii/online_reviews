i came for the imported canned italian tomatoes (i was making amatrciana), stayed for the twice-baked almond croissant. good grief, that croissant was life-changing. fox'n'obel is the bastard love child of dean&deluca and whole foods. you can find a wide array of specialty items, including genuine spanish jamon serrano. it all comes at a cost, of course, but well worth it for the perfect amatriciana.
