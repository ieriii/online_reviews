Woo hoo! I finally made it to Violet Hour! I'm used to throwing out suggestions and having them shot down, so you can imagine how excited I was when, after some sush and cocktails, the girls agreed to go. Thanks cocktails! So anyhow, I was kind of nervous that we would have a long wait, so I was really happy when we approached the door and there was no line. That was, until we opened the door and saw about 20 people crammed in the doorway. I convinced the girls it would be worth the wait so we waited. It really wasn't too bad, after about 30 minutes, we were in. I love that this place stays classy and hasn't budged on their "rules". This place is like a dream for me. Big girl cocktails, no cell phones, no standing in puddles of spilled drinks while drunks run you over. Hooray! I'm used to people asking me if I'm an old lady when I drink my manhattans, so I was really excited when 1) no one asked me that 2) I saw the amazing cocktail menu It was a tough choice, but I went with the Guyana Flip. It was so delicious, but I hated the fact that I finished it so fast! Yummy. At the recommendation of a self proclaimed Violet Hour veteran, we ordered my friend the Spanish Margarita while she was in the ladies room. He he! He was right, it really was the best drink we had. My other friend ordered the Etiquette, which she liked, but probably our least favorite. Yes, we shared...you gotta. By the end, my friends were raving and we all vowed to come back. I think I'd rather go on a weekday, though, when we might get a chance to sit at the bar and watch the cocktail action.
