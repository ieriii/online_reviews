I re-visited Wishbone after quite a few years, yet in the past I've made many a trip to this southern-fare, Rooster and Cabbage art comfort food destination. I had forgotten about all the good menu choices:a good variety of Po' Boys, and decent fish and seafood at reasonable prices.Servings are usually generous. What also slipped my mind was the variety of solid vegetarian choices, perhaps not what you'd expect from a southern place. But the veggie platter, the back bean patties and many of the sides are veggie or vegan-friendly. And good. On this lunch visit, both I and my companion chose the bowl of soup/salad combo ($6.95) The seafood chowder was featured and it was a flavorful red creamy thick chowder with potatoes and chunks of fish, shrimp and maybe (fake) crab? Hard to tell when it's all mixed up. The salad was OK. Nothing to write home about. Both were accompanied by a corn muffin. Always have to have the cornbread here. The service on this occasion was awful. Why one would hire a server who could not actively listen, who spoke really fast and with a thick accent is beyond me. Especially when I had to ask him to repeat "corn muffin" three times before I understood. But we got everything we ordered eventually. And a couple things we didn't. Wishbone doesn't have great food, but it is a good value, the atmosphere is usually festive with the place being popular and busy, and it's not as if there are one of these on every block. So it is really unique. I can see coming back for a quick (if I get a different server next time) lunch, a special Po' Boy, or some good comforting soup on a rainy day. Probably a solid 3.5 star-wise for me.
