Sprout scored big points in every category--food: stunning, service: perfect, ambiance: beautiful. We were seated promptly when we arrived for our brunch reservation in the dining room closest to the street which had huge windows and was flooded by natural light. The seating was a bit cramped but I didn't mind it because everyone around us was very serene and subdued (translation: no screaming kids) and we were able to have a normal conversation at an audible level. Our server took great care of us. He gave me some good suggestions and I decided to try one of his recommendations, the steak and eggs. Didn't know half of what I was eating, but it sure tasted good. The steak was tender and juicy. My eggs had what I thought was salmon in it (but according to the menu it was crab, apparently). Whatever it was, it was delicious. Fingerling potatoes and sambal (chili sauce) rounded out my dish nicely. My dining companion liked his marengo omelette. My bloody Mary went perfectly with the meal. The food here was 5-star worthy because it was done well, presented well, packed with flavor and creative (you won't find rabbit and lamb on a brunch menu in too many places). This is how brunch should be done--a little bit of the traditional with something unexpected, or with a twist. I will definitely be back to try some of the other yummy dishes.
