It's hard to not address up front how off the chain the food is, because it SHOULD NOT be missed by anyone, but the service is what makes Sapori truly amazing. I hate to be cliche but when the shoe fits: They really do treat you like a guest in their home. A very popular, hard to get into home, I admit, but once you're in, it's worth the wait. This place has Date Night written all over it. Dim lighting, exposed brick, cozy atmosphere. Aside from the random TV in the bar (??), the vibe is pure intimacy. Everything I've had has been incredible. Risotto. Gnocchi. Ravioli. Lasagna. You cannot go wrong. It's not the most inventive Italian dining you'll find in Chicago, but why mess with what works: Bold sauces, lots of cream and perfectly made pasta. This is a pricey night out, especially if you add wine. I think the bottle list starts at $30 and go up (way up) from there. But the nice thing is that there are usually specials and discounts if you look. Plus, they mail you coupons for your birthday...and half-birthday! No kidding. Top my list of places to bring dates, parents, carb-loving friends....that covers just about everyone I know.
