This place offers decent Cuban food. I miss Cuban food being from Tampa, FL. It's nice to find a place where I indulge my cravings. It's not as good as Tampa, but it's still pretty damn good. My hubby likes the pulled pork. I tried some of it and thought it was very good. I ordered a chicken dish and was unimpressed. It lacked flavor. I usually order sides when I go (i.e. empanadas, black beans and rice, plantains). Their mango shake is awesome! I'm not much of a fan of the guava and cheese pastry. It's all pastry and barely any guava inside. The food doesn't take too long to come out. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I wish they'd give you Cuban bread with your order. At home, in Tampa, you're given buttered Cuban bread with your order.
