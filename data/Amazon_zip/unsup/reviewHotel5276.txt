The room was less than $60 a night, so I wasn't expecting too much.Then I waited over an hour for the shuttle to pick me up from the airport.Its website presents itself as an upscale hotel: definitely, definitely not. The place is in decent condition but it certainly needs some fixing up.I was particularly annoyed by its lack of central WiFi: there's only WiFi in the lobby.My room was fine but nothing special. There wasn't an iron, alarm clock, or coffee maker, and the curtains couldn't close all of the way. The shower would occasionally get super hot and scald me.I didn't stay too long (less than 12 hours) but one thing to note is the shuttle service: if your destination is in the area, the shuttle driver will take you there. There seems to be rather flexible rules about this; in the morning, the driver said he'd take me whenever, but later in the day, he said he ran it on the half-hour. I obviously know there are other guests who need transport, but I wish he'd told me about the half-hour rule earlier.It really is very close to the airport, so only stay there if you need to be in that vicinity, not downtown.
