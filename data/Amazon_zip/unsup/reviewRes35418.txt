Normally when I think of Peking duck, I see myself hopping on a plane to ride 16 hours to get Asia. Luckily Sun Wah saves me. They can slice the crispy skin succulent Peking roast duck table side and that you can enjoy it wrapped with white steamed buns.  They give big portions and are authentic. You can order congee, wonton noodles (they have the biggest wonton dumplings in Chicago), roast duck, roast pork, and seafood. They moved to broadway from argyle several feet away a much larger and modern restaurant. Verdict: this place never disappoints and has delicious roast duck and roast pork. I personally recommend this place.
