There's not much to say, other than that it's too expensive and not that tasty. The pizza crust was bland and had the consistency of a freezer section ready-made pie crust, and my cannoli was rock hard, with overly-sweet and somewhat greasy filling. I didn't go in expecting the greatest pizza experience of my life, but considering how popular Giordano's seems to be around here, I at least expected everything to taste like they put some effort into it.
