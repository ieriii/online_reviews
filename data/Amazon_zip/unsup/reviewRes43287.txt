I have to give Art 5 stars if I gave Lou's 5 stars. This place's Chicago style is awesome. It's def one of the best Chicago pies around. So, when I'm in the mood for Chicago style which one do I pick to order from?.... Lou's or Art? Well that comes down to the mood I'm in. I would say all around Art is the better pie. But nothing trumps Lou's sausage deep dish with the sheet of sausage on it. It's a tough call though. Also an Art deep dish weighs something in the neighborhood of what feels like 25 lbs. Try and eat more than 3 slices of that and I guarantee you will explode on the 4th slice.
