Well, our meal was tasty, though I would have to say that some of the dishes were a little off. The decor is beautiful but there is pulsing, loud music the whole time. If you don't like eating to a beat, you better not go in this restaurant. We had paella negra, which was very tasty and seafoody, but much too salty. However, when I bit into a big chunk of octopus I felt like I was hanging out in a tide pool in the sun. It was a most delicious feeling, though I got only two big chunks of octopus. We also had some goat's milk cheese with green apple slices and garlic dulce de leche. I know, garlic? Dulce de leche? It was so good that I didn't understand why no one else was putting garlic in their dulce de leche. We also had rabbit in homemade pasta. Mike had to convince me because, you know, rabbits, but this was my favorite dish. It came out with foam (I love that, Mike doesn't), with brandied cherries under (I was worried they'd be too sweet but they were not) and brown butter sauce and pureed chestnuts all over. It was delish. It was so delish that I sat there and ate the sauce with my fork while my boyfriend sat there and judged me. The only issue was that the rabbit was a little tough, though I understand that's the name of the game with... game. For desert I had chocolate mouse with some sort of crackly hazelnut and sugar shell, espresso hanging out in the shell, and sweet cream gelato on top. It was good, but unlike all the other dishes it was too big to finish. So, a good meal but I would have been happier paying about half as much for it, as it had issues. Mike and I each had a (pretty small and unremarkable) glass of sangria, we had three dishes, dessert, and an after-dinner cocktail for Mike. It came to around $80 without tip. By the way, the service was really stellar. But don't get indigestion or drink too much water, because the bathroom is all the way downstairs.
