In my opinion this is the best restaurant in China town. When we go, we try to always choose something new and the worst I've had here is still really good. Most of their food is absolutely amazing. The green beans with fermented black beans, the 3 chili chicken, ALL of the eggplant dishes, the spicy cabbage, garlic spinach, Twice cooked chili pork, chili pork, the ribs, the okra. The dishes here are something special. If you don't like spicy food though, this is probably not your gig. Although the food is awesome, the service is relatively lame.  One of the guys is ok and seems to take up a lot of the slack of the other servers. You get the feeling that they don't like you - at all. It's sort of like being waited on by that one aunt that came over and looked at you disapprovingly all night at a family gathering when you were fourteen because she knew you'd started masturbating.  I knew this about the service and still brought my entire wedding party here after being married because the food is that good. I made advanced reservations and they seated us upstairs in the catery looking area of the restaurant. My stepmother, who eats nothing but microwaved garbage was the only person who was unimpressed with the food.
