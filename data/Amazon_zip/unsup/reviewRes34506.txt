The service at this place is fast and friendly. I'm not a fan of this place because the menu is really unhealthy and laden with fat and sugar. I got the multigrain pancakes, but they were sugary and bitter. The portions were huge and we were charged $2 for sharing. I don't understand how you can charge $2 more for the same amount of food. My dad and I could barely finish the pancakes and our companion didn't even eat half of his crepes. Service=A+, food=:(
