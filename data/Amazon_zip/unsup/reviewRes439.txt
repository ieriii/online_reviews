What else is there to say? Exquisite. Loved everything about it. Was going expecting an amazing "experience" but got ridiculously fantastic food to go along with it. Would go again in a heartbeat (as soon as I can save up some $$)!  I bought Chef Achatz's cookbook (which I use as a coffee-table book -- the photos are gorgeous and who are we kidding, I'm not going to be able to recreate any of the dishes) and would highly recommend this as a way to fondly remember a great meal.
