DO NOT STAY HERE! I had booked this hotel last minute as every hotel within a 5 mile radius was booked, I was desperate so I had to stay there. When I checked in the staff was very nice and helpful. The rooms hadn't been cleaned in I don't know how long, I had to walk around in shoes because the carpet was wet everywhere and I was afraid to let anything touch me directly. The room was hot and stuffy and the air conditioner didn't do much. I even had to put towels down on the bed because the sheets were disgusting. However, I was charged not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR times for parking. I had to call three different times to get these charges taken off. And the last time I talked to a manager she acted as if she was doing me a favor by not charging me for parking, even though I didn't park there!At first I overlooked the charges because the staff that checked me in was super nice. However, the General Manager was very rude and unprofessional. They had charged me so many times I was even charged overdraft fees on my debit card and when I asked for him to reimburse me he said he would transfer me to the Accounting Department and then proceeded to hang up. When I called back he said he was the Accounting Department and said that he wouldn't talk to me. I asked if he could transfer me to someone who would try to help me but he refused. I paid almost $200 for this room, minus all the extra charges, but I still cannot believe how terrible I was treated. Very unprofessional and rude. After having to stay in my dump of a room and to be treated like I was the one causing all the problems was just astonishing to me. As a General Manager I feel as if you should handle problems instead of handing me off to front desk staff. He spoke to me very condescending voice and instead of trying to help me he did everything he could to not speak to me (even hanging up). Everyone keep your money and spend it in a much better way.
