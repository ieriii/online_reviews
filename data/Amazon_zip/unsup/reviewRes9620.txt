I had dinner here last night and forgot how awesome this restaurant is. It's very romantic, which makes it the perfect destination for a date. I had the seabass for dinner and it was awesome. Dinner included an appetizer, 2 entrees, and a bottle of wine and it came out to a little over $100...a bit pricey, but definitely worth it.
