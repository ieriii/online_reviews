Not only was the chicken crisp, but so was the attitude I got from the guy behind the counter. My husband and I arrived a little after 8:30 and despite the fact that there was a sign indicating that the dining room closed at 9:30, it was made pretty clear that we were not welcome to stay and eat. We found a bench a few yards away, outside, to enjoy our meal. Unfortunately, more disappointment ensued, due to the fact that the chicken just didn't live up to the hype. Poor service and lackluster flavor sum up my review.
