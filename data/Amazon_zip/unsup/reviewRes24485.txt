this was my 1st time inside an authentic greek bakery, so i was very excited about seeing their selection of pastries. unfortunately, i was too full after dinner to eat anything else, but that didn't stop me from picking up a few things for breakfast the next morning. after much deliberation, i chose: 1. galaktoboureko ($3.50) - thin phyllo dough pastry with lemon custard filling. the phyllo dough wasn't as flaky as i'd have expected, and it was slightly soggy from the honey. the lemon custard was delicious, thick and creamy and not overly sweet. 2. walnut baklava ($2.95) - rich and dense chopped walnut filling inside phyllo dough. the chopped walnuts mixed with honey were delicious, maybe a touch too sweet, but delicious. the phyllo dough shell was flaky and laced with honey. note they also serve sandwiches and american desserts. delicious, authentic greek desserts that were a tasty breakfast treat for me. this is another place that i'd visit on my return trip to chicago.
