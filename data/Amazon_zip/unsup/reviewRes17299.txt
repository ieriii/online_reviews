This place is a first, there's not a lounge or bar that I can compare to violet hour. Yeah, I waited in a line for 25 minutes to be seated but it definitely worth the experience. This is not your typical lounge its visually captivating..  the huge Alice & Wonderland chairs, warm blues, and glass chandeliers create the perfect ambiance
