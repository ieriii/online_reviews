It took us a while to get a seat but to be fair we were a six top and it was 11:30 on a rainy Sunday so I can't really hold it against them. Also, the wait gave me a chance to sit at the bar and enjoy a fantastic Bloody Mary. I don't know if living in China for so long as made me easily impressed or if this was particularly good cocktail but I loved it. My meal, on the other hand, just so-so. I went with the biscuits and gravy and while it was good I felt my biscuits were over cooked, a bit too crisp throughout. The sausage gravy was perfect, big chunks of sweet and smoky breakfast sausage swimming in a creamy gravy, they need to step their biscuit game up thought. The two other guys at the table also went with the b&g and felt the same as I did. Two of the ladies had omelets, asparagus and ceso blanco, they looked fine but neither raved. The other gal went with the french toast with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and watching her eat from across the table she looked like she was in heaven. From the first bite she had this "kid in a candy store" grin across her face that didn't leave until the last crumb was cleaned from her plate. I think she liked it. I want to try the place again, maybe lunch or dinner and see if more typical pub faire is more up their alley. With all the other places nearby I can't exactly recommend them for brunch, other meals we shall see.
