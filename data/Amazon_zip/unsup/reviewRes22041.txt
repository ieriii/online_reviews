Superdawg is a Chicago icon. I've never really had a good experience here, but did return this past weekend and can actually write that the chocolate malt was fantastic and made up for the odd style in which the Whoopsiewhatevercheeseburger thing that I have was prepared. Eat in or take out; the car service is slow.
