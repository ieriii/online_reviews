I really dig this pizza - it just hits the spot. There's something unique about it, it doesn't taste run of the mill. Even if you are stopping by for a piece by the slice, it's not like it's been sitting out all day under a heat lamp with grease coagulating. I appreciate that. The cheese is exceptional. The crust is spongy and tasty. I like a little more sauce, but that's just my preference becuase it's so good. Buy two slices, get a drink free (unlimited refills) for $7. Not bad, big slices, good selection to choose from. I need to try their chicken and salads, heard they are amaze-balls. There are about 4 tables inside, it's very cramped. Not a dining in place unless you are just on the go or being super casual.
