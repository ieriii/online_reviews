After I try the food I'll update more, but after having New Belgium's tasty new sour beer for $5? More, please! It definitely can get pretty packed, but I came here with a bachelorette party of about 12 and after squeezing in, we headed upstairs for a bit more breathing room. After a few minutes, we found seats and some obliging patrons even gave up their table so we could all sit together. Very nice. I was expecting hefty beer price tags like you might find at Local Option, etc. but was super happy with my $5 craft brew. It was too crowded on the Saturday night to really talk to the bartender or be served, but I was waited on pretty quickly and efficiently. The beer is amazing, the food looked good as I walked through the dining room to the bar upstairs, but the atmosphere seems like it would be a lot better on a weekday when you're not fighting for a spot. I'd even go here for an early dinner to stay away from the crowds. Still, their beer selection cannot be beat, and with such reasonable prices, I'll be back as soon as I can drag my man up to Andersonville.
