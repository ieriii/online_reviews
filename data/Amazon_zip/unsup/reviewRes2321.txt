It was well worth the hour wait in line! Very affordable and quick. You have to try the duck fat fries. Its crispy, thin, and pretty tasty. The employees there were real nice esp the one guy that was cleaning up and helping people find a table! Great sense of humor. Love the decorations and how the menu was set up! I'll be sure to stop by here again when I'm in Chicago!
