Honestly I didn't stay long here - just one drink... but wow... I mean talk about a saaawwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeeet place. Very cool atmosphere - swanky for sure. Probably filled with higher class d-bags than Wrigley, but aren't all d-bags the same? I would go here for sure for a ladies night out. I would imagine the food would be good, but I have no idea... basically I just am in love with the building. I will definitely go back for a full night out.
