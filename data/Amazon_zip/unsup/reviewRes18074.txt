The Bad Apple is truly kick-ass. There are so many things I love about this place. The main reason I go there is because it is right in my neighborhood, but I have had so many delicious meals there I would travel across the whole city to eat there, honest. Highlights: *Fabulous beer selections. I am not an uber beer-geek like so many of my dining companions, but I was thrilled when the server convinced me to try a raspberry ale that was easily one of the most delicious beers I've ever tried. *Pretzel buns- and a burger called "The Frenchie". Brie on a burger is absolutely sublime. *Cheese curds, and homemade ranch-style dipping sauce. Perhaps I am the ultimate fat kid, but if the shoe fits... PLEASE TRY THESE!!! *Everything is homemade. I know that more and more restaurants are committing to it, and for this I am so glad, but this place does it WELL. It's in the details. I can tell- I've been a cook in the industry for several years now. *Great service, atmosphere, and people. I've yet to have a bad experience in this restaurant. I really like new, dare I say, "trendy" restaurants, but I think the thing I love about this place the most is that it's the kind of place you could bring ANYONE, and not only would they find something delicious to eat on the menu, but they would fit in. Sure, I'd rather go eat there with my tattooed, twenty somethin friends, but I just appreciate cool restaurants that aren't actually "clique-y". Bravo, Bad Apple. I am one of your biggest (literally and figuratively) fans.
