I organized our company holiday party at the Sheraton. The staff was so helpful! A number of my co-workers and I decided to spend the night at the Sheraton and had mixed reviews.  I loved it. I was placed in really nice room with a great view of Navy Pier and the lake. The bed was divine! I almost wanted to skip the party and stay in my comfy bed. They also left me a little basket of fruit and nuts along with a bottle of water. It's good to be a VIP. ;)  My co-workers complained. The rooms that they were in were of a very poor quality. The hotel explained that they are in the process of renovating the rooms on this floor. Also, one person said that when he entered his room he noticed hair all over the bathroom counter. EW!!! I'm glad that I was the party planner and could live the "high life" while everyone else was stuck in the "slums."
