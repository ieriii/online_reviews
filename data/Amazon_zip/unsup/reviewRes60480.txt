The ambiance of this place really sets the stage for a relaxing experience. The liquor and wine lists are extensive and the menu is full of amazing comfort food options. Every time I've been here, I have loved the food. The fireplace and "Library" area are great options for smaller groups looking for a relaxed setting.
