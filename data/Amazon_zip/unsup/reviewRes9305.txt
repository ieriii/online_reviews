Came here for restaurant week but when we got there, I totally went rogue, ordering with abandon off the menu when we only had an hour for lunch. Oh well-it was worth it! Where others attempt to spruce up their restaurants, Le Colonial oozes a comfortable class without trying. The white tableclothes and simple fresh flowers blend in so naturally and I enjoyed the professional and unobtrusive service. I started off with the yummy, crispy shrimp and chicken beignets. For my main course, I had the waiter-recommended shrimp and asparagus. It was a generous portion and looked beautiful but unfortunately it was too spicy for my wimpy tongue. No matter, my lovely friends shared their chicken and ravioli dishes, respectively. I'd go back but probably order a bit less!
