I adore Indian lunch buffets, so when I discovered this one within walking distance of our hotel, we made plans to head on over... unfortunately they don't open Sundays until 11:30 so we had to circle the neighborhood for a while, but it was worth the wait! This is probably the best kept, tidy, buffet I've been to in a long time. And they're well staffed, so your every whim is attended to promptly. Still, even though service and the food were great, I don't feel like I can rate at a 5 just based on a buffet experience. The atmosphere was quite nice, and the place filled up fast when they opened (always a good sign), but beware the tables near the windows... while they're nice for gazing outside, they're quite drafty. Though the qualms stop there. When we came back to the table after loading up our plates, there was a basket of naan and sizzling tandoori chicken, both of which come with the $15 lunch buffet, so take note, tandoori chicken lovers, because it too is all you can eat.
