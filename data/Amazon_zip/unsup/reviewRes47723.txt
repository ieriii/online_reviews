This is a great place to go for drinks - summer or winter. The cocktails were wonderful and the atmosphere was great. This not the best place to go for food. While the salad /appetizer table was nice, the main courses weren't all that appetizing. I tried 6 or 7 of the meat dishes, and I didn't feel like I wanted a second helping of any of them. Additionally, we felt as though we were being ignored by the staff as they took 10 minutes to make it to our table (caught us just as we were getting ready to grab our jackets) and didn't give us their full attention when there were at the table (looking away from us, gave us the short explanations, made the experience awkward). I didn't feel I got a meal worth anywhere near the price that was paid.
