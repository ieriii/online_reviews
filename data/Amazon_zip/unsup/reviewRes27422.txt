Was it worth a 4 month wait for a reservation on the weekend? No. Was is very good? Yes. I shared the Ahi tuna ceviche, it was wonderful! Couldn't have been better with just the right amount of spice. Chips and salsa were excellent and perfectly fresh. For the entree I ordered the garlic shrimp in a white mole sauce, it was a pretty perfect dish. Spicy rice was balanced perfectly with the sweet mole sauce.  The biggest disappointment was my husbands steak tacos. The steak was cooked and seasoned well. However there was nothing special about this dish and the portion size was tiny. He left hungry which shouldn't be the case with tacos.
