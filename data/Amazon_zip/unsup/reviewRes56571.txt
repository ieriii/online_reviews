Delicious steak, and great service. The place makes you feel like you are in Las Vegas...but I guess that has to do with the fact that it's an East Coast Chain. Very different from the other Chitown steakhouses.Leave room for dessert though, because they are famous FAMOUS for their butter cake. It's amazing, no joke, and a huge portion, topped with ice cream. Don't miss out on this aspect of the experience. They also have a live piano player and singer most times. I ate dessert ON the piano with my date (using the piano as a table, no laying on it!)Worth checking out.
