Can I get an AMEN?! I picked this place out of a hat - Was visiting Chi-town from the California Bay Area. Started with Avec for dinner (see my recent review) and moved the solo party to Green Mill for some Chicago style blues. I was traveling solo but didn't let that stop me from having a good time. They had a $6 cover and it was well worth it for the awesome instrumental jazz/blues organ band. The band played 3 long sets and I walked away thinking I had got my money's worth.  In addition to the music, the 1940's speakeasy vibe and the colorful history of this place made me just want to pucker my lips and bob my head in a slow chicken like motion to the music. Oh yeah baby! I am coming back here again. My only point of feedback (I always have to list at least one improvement area)... keep the classic vibe classic, but for godsakes you guys only accept Amex and cash. Keep everything else the same, but retire that 1940's credit card machine.
