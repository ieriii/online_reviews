Upon the suggestion of my friend, we met up at this cute little brunch nook in Greek town. I got there a bit early, was greeted and seated promptly and noticed the cutest little bouquet of fresh flowers on our table. Fantastic first impression!  Since we were here on a weekday, there were only a couple of tables seated, so my lack of five stars is due to our seating close to the waitstaff stand in an empty restaurant, but I'm sure that had something to do with sections for the waitstaff being evened out. No biggie.  Meli has a GIGANTIC breakfast selection to choose from and it was a toss up for me between banana pecan pancakes and the cajun scramble. I went for the scramble with toast and my friend went with eggs to order, bacon, and toast.   The food was fresh, prompt, portioned well, and pleasing to the eye. There are a couple varieties of fresh jam to choose from and our water was regularly filled to the point I had to stop them.  After finishing our meal, we noticed the neighbor next to us ordered the banana pancakes. They looked phenomenal! I'll definitely be back to try them. If you love brunch, this is the place to be. Server and hostess wished us a great day as we left. All in all a great experience!
