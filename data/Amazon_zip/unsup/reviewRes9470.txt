I used to work right across the street from this place and never gave a second thought to what type of restaurant it was. Finally three years later I decided to check it out. We went on a Tuesday night and even thought a reservation may have not been required I made on just to be on the safe side and we were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival time. The seating space was a bit tight as is the case in a lot of the good restaurants downtown but it was doable.  The menu literally has something for everyone, if you are vegetarian, picky, adverse to spice or want it to be so spicy you sweat they can and will accommodate.  We ordered the spring roll appetizer, two entrees( I can't remember what they were called) and shrimp fried rice. Needless to say we had way more food than we could handle but enjoyed the leftovers the next day. At first glance the menu may seem pricey but for the amount and quality of food it is worth every penny and more. My only gripe is that they could take out 2 or 3 tables and make it a little bit more comfortable.
