I LOVE THIS PLACE. We were meeting a friend for dinner and she suggested we go to Mia Francesca. When we arrived, I asked to be seated on the patio (beautiful weather!) and they happily accommodated. The waiter was so nice, not fake nice, genuinely nice. He didn't rush us at all even though all we had was one appetizer, entrees and a bottle of wine. We got the calamari which was a nice start. It wasn't anything mind blowing but it was good. All of us got different pastas as entrees and they were ALL amazing. We all enjoyed it so much. My linguine al Sugo di Gambari was sooo good. The shrimp was juicy, plump and fresh. The scallops were so sweet and perfectly cooked. It was amazing. I attempted to eat everything but alas, I only have one stomach. They're incredibly large portions so all of us ended up with leftovers. After we were done, we sat there and chatted and they let us! Probably because it wasn't as busy and it was a Wednesday night. Since we were on the patio, we started seeing helicopters everywhere. One of the waiter then announced that the Blackhawks had won the Stanley Cup. IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT! Delicious food at great prices, friendly waiters, and a quaint patio. We'll definitely be back!
