I want to preface this review by saying that not a single word is hyperbole in any way, shape, or form. I want Piece's pizza to have my children, and then I want the social norms of our country to be more accepting of cannibalism, because I would eat this stuff every single night of the week, and I would most likely not even be self-conscious about it. I had a pepperoni pizza, and it helped me find spiritual enlightenment. There's something to be said about a place that brews its own beer, especially if said beer is the nectar of the gods. The Cameltoe Pale Ale stands out in my mind as being the most mind-boggingly delicious. I love that the selection changes. I love that the next time I go there, I won't be disappointed if they don't have a particular brew, because I have complete and utter faith in their ability to make a beverage that absolutely requires imbibing. And I'm sort of shocked that this place doesn't have more votes for dessert, because the chocolate pizza could spread peace throughout Gaza, and I don't even really care for chocolate. If I had one complaint? The noise. It gets far too loud as the evening wears on. Yet, if this place can still manage a four star rating in spite of it (those who know me know full-well my extreme distaste for unnecessarily loud establishments), you know that there's something going on in there that absolutely has to be experienced.
