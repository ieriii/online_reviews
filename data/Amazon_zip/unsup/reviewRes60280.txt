I love this place! I went with a couple friends after yoga at Ruby Room, which is just a couple blocks down, and YUM. The french toast is among the best I've ever had. Terrific coffee. We did have to wait (brunch on a Sunday, of course there's a wait everywhere you go!) - but it wasn't exceptionally long. Chill out, enjoy the people watching, and relaxxx. Everyone was pretty cozily hanging out by the bar, patiently waiting their turn and enjoying the coffee. The crowd was mellow and the staff was super friendly. This is going to be a regular spot for me, for sure. Fabulous easygoing vibe.
