I like the layout of Bin and feel but I'm not sure the quality is quite there. FYI: Check into foursquare so you can get your first wine flight for only $10. That made the experience more worthwhile. While our server was fairly knowledgeable, she was really awkward. I couldn't tell if she was just shy or antisocial but neither of traits are appropriate for someone in the service industry. We had two red flights and a few cheeses since we'd dropped by on a whim after having dinner. The wines were good but I've definitely had much better. For flights that were normally $18 for approximately 1.5 glass worth of wine, I expected better. The cheeses she recommended were very good, the one I picked based on the delicious sounding description was bland and dull. I'd say definitely ask your server for as much help as possible unless you're a real cheese connoisseur.
