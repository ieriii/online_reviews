I am not completely sold on the food, but the environment, the beer, and the atmosphere makes me want to come back again. We went here for my BF's bday. He loves his beer so I thought it would be a fun surprise for him. We were both amazed by how classy this restaurant was when we walked in! Loved the decor, especially the Revo arms that act as the columns for the standing bar in the middle. Service is both friendly and laid back. We came here on a Tuesday night, grabbed a beer at the bar and sat down in their nice waiting area and waited less than ten minutes before our table was called. Started with mussels which were good. I had their pulled pork sandwich, loved loved the bbq sauce. The pork could have been a bit more tender for me, I do just love when the meat just meats in your mouth, but I would say the delicous flavor of the sauce made up for it.  My BF got the chorizo pizza, which I think he was disappointed when it was kinda just eh. We ordered the apple crumble for dessert, and I think they were trying to make a deconstructed apple crumble but it didn't quite come off quite right and we felt like we were eating ice cream with some weird crumbs on the side.  I think they should just stick to the old fashioned apple crumble. Their beers are pretty good, my BF loved them. He knows his beers so if he likes them, you know they have to be pretty good. This place is definitely worth a visit :)
