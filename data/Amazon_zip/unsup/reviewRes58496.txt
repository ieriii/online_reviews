I would give them 6 stars if possibleI first met Kim and her brother, the owners when I was a student at Loyola and they had a modest storefront place on Chicago Ave. Can't believe that if was over 25 years ago. Then one day as I was meandering down Lincoln Avenue, there it was Simply It.I was treated like royalty. The wait staff is so kind. It wasn't until I went to pay the very reasonable bill for the tremendously fresh and good food that I realized who the owners were. What a nice re-union. I have consistently ordered delivery for family and friends visiting at home as well as with friends at the office. The other reviewer was right when they said that Argyle Street serves kibblle. Simply it continues to simply serve fresh, reasonably priced, tasty Vietnamese food in a warm and welcoming manner.
