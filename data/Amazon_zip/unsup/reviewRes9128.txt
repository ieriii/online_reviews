Le Colonial: The SEXIEST restaurant in Chicago. Have you seen the movie "The Lover" (Original novel written by Marguerite Duras) starring Jane March? Le Colonial is like that movie. The atmosphere, darkness, lazily spinning ceiling fans, and tropical plants. PERFECT. I mean, SEX IN YOUR EYES. Now food. SEX IN YOUR MOUTH. I kinda forgot how good their dishes are. I took my friend for her birthday dinner. She ordered Japanese eggplant and shrimp curry (EXCELLENT), and I ordered egg rolls, awesome tuna appetizer, and a little bowl of pho. Dessert: coffee and creme brulee. (I don't even know how I should spell it) It was like an afterplay. This place definitely makes your panties moist (If you are ladies). Very sensual, sexy, yet very comfortable. GO THERE. AND SCORE!!!! Tee hee!!!
