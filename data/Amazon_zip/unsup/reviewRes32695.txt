Great energy, sweet people and fine food make a diner go round...and round. The service and the clientele are always cool, polite and unique. Entering this locale is like entering a fun little world with a great, conscious menu. They offer a wide variety of options to satisfy your cravings. Though they use quite a bit of wheat meat, which I'm not so high on, they do it well. Actually, everything is done well each time I've visited. Which has been 2 times. And guess what? If I lived there, I'd be a regular. If I could be so cool, polite and unique. Go forth and enjoy!
