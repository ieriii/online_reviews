I went here for an early lunch last Saturday for the first time and I am officially a fan! I'm gonna start out a little nit-picky, so bear with me. The restaurant is huge and when my friend and I arrived, we were told we could sit wherever we wanted and that was great for us, but not so much for the ONE server that was working! There were five tables with customers and we were all seated pretty far apart from one another which made the service...messy. Now the good parts and there were many of them. Our server, Adnan was friendly and very personable. Since it was out first time there, he made several (excellent) recommendations and we were very pleased with his picks. We ordered the sampler of empanadas and they were crispy and delicious. We were told most people liked the beef, but we liked the beef and cheese and LOVED the chicken.The empanadas came with a bowl of chimichurri and another yummy side that I never caught the name of that was fantastic. We also ordered the combination skirt steak (medium,natch) and shrimp skewer which also came with potato, yuka (is that spelled right?),and plantain. My stomach is growling just thinking about it! For dessert we had the cocoa flan.Let me just say this,it was beyond sinful, it was beyond yum it was fan-**cking-tastic! We will definitely go again and try some of the other selections. They do offer BYO wine Monday-Thursday, so maybe we will be back during the week.
