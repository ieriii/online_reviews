For those that know me, they know I adore Breakfast. I can eat breakfast food for any meal, at any time of day. My cousin and I went to Meli after weeks of delay in our plans. Amazing is all I have to say about this place. Walking in, they were totally packed. We were seated as soon as we walked in and water was automatically brought over to us just as we were sitting down. My cousin had never had coffee..this I just couldn't belive, neither could the waitress. So then we ordered..after much debate about the coffee he decided on a regular cup of coffee. It was funny, he was like "what do I put in it?". i couldnt believe it. he is 22 years old and never had coffee. So after choosing his coffee he chose his food,. He got 3 scrambled eggs with cheddar, english muffin, canadian bacon, and red potatoes..with his first time coffee.lol. I had an amazing..and i mean Ammmazing Vegetable Omelette with eggwhites, whole wheat toast, red potatoes with cranberry juice. Both of our meals came with a wedge of Honey Dew Melon..mm. The omelette was so amazing and fluffy. The waitress brought out a little tray which contained 4 little glass serving dishes that included orange marmalade,strawberry preserves and the other two with whipped butter for our toast. I simply just smashed on the orange marmalade which was amazing. No I didn't just sit there and spoon the marmalade into my mouth.lol..i used it for my toast, which I only ate one piece of because I was so full. The portions are huge as well, I possibly forced myself to eat it all because leftover food is never as good.. The ambience was nice as well, even the waitresses were beautiful..this place was just overall awesome.. I will definately go back.
