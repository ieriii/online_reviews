Two words: Poblano Cream. Both my boyfriend and I had Mexican-inspired brunch dishes (I with Huevos Rancheros; he with the "Nana-dict" with chorizo). Both had this lovely light green pepper sauce. I'm not the world's biggest fan of peppers (I'd give them a 2 or 3 on the Yelp star-scale) but this sauce was fantastic. As a running joke we had with our server: it was the tits. Both dishes were beautifully presented. Not fancy-schmancy sculptural, just good-lookin' plates. Boyfriend got the bloody mary, as per his usual on brunch outings, and seemed pleased. He said it had real kick and liked the added element of cheese. I love that Nana is a.) family owned and run, and b.) organic/local. Their interior is bright, cheery, has unique art on the walls, and was very welcoming. Cheers, Nana. We got there around 11 on a Saturday and although we waited in line, it was no longer than 15 minutes. Easy, free street parking off of Halsted. I was surprised to see on their menu that Guy Fieri from "Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives" had showcased Nana on his show. Not that he shouldn't have, Nana deserves all the publicity it gets, but it seems like a nicer, more upscale place than is typically shown on his program.
