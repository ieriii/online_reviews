Artopolis was awesome!!! My girlfriends and I were going to have dinner at Pegasus, but the rooftop dining didn't open until 4:00pm so we had a bit of time to kill. We stumbled onto this place and...cha-ching! Charming, quaint, and amazing desserts! We looked at the menu and couldn't resist...one signature and one traditional: killer chocolate mousse and finger-licking-good baklava! No Joke! This place rocks...you must go!!! :)
