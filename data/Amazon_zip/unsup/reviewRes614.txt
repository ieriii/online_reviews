Quite an experience and we talked about it for weeks. I thought it would be too hoighty toighty and that I'd walk away hungry. Wrong on both accounts. Very knowledgable and friendly service. We did the wine pairing and it was totally worth it. You go through nearly every varietal of wine (from champagne to desert wines) and we never had a dry glass. I decided to see how many refills I'd get was never disappointed. Make your date happy and go with the full tasting menu and wine pairing. You probably won't be coming back for awhile so do it right.
