Sapori has longtime been one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city. I used to live in the area and visited so frequently that we were friendly with Anthony the owner. Its been a while since I'd been there but I was so excited to head back for a romantic Vday dinner. Well, romantic this restaurant is, but now I remembered too just how crowded it can get. I will in the future beware of Valentine's Day and Saturday night reservations here. The small intimate dining space can be overly crowded and you will be eating in your neighbors lap. You'll also get to enjoy their conversation. Onto the good news. The intimate space here makes it more authentic. In the summer I long to visit here and eat outside under the twinkling lights. The portions are tremendous and I dream about the Stella salad or the large portions of asparagus. On my past visit I enjoyed the fried calamari. I always eat too much of the fresh bread with olive oil and Parmesan cheese. The butternut squash ravioli is a staple and maybe I should have stuck with it again, but I ventured to try the stuffed chicken tortelloni in a cream sauce with broccoli and carrots. The entree was good but not fantastic. The lasagna is always good and I enjoyed some of the BFs on this visit and he has a good portion for leftovers too.
