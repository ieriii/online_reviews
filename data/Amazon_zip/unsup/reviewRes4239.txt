Thursday night. If you're looking for some place to take a date, I can't recommend this place highly enough. Drinks are great, music is wonderful and it's an easy, light situation to get to know someone new. Don't be intimidated by the little old couples dancing their hearts out on the floor next to you - but don't interfere with them either. I got an eye full of stink more than once for not knowing what I was doing. That being said, it was my second date with my now boyfriend of two years and it was hands down one of the most memorable of our entire time together.
