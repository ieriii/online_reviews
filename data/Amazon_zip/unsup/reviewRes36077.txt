Great for breakfast! Whatever you order, it will be delicious. My friends have something of a Meli fan following, and we go for a treat when we have a free morning. They give you fresh preserves with your meal, and the juices and smoothies are wonderful. It's always jam packed on weekends, but you still get attentive and polite service. It's such a bright little cafe, you can't help but feel happy there. And the menu has staples, but the specials change daily to include fresh fare. One star less because although it's lovely, I think it's still slightly overpriced for breakfast.
