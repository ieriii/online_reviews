I got the regular pho because ... well, that's what I always get when I go to pho restaurants. Tank Noodle gets 3 stars because it's a) more expensive , b) less quantity and c) less meat than I'm used to. They're not super legitimate reasons because I haven't had pho at other places in Chicago, so maybe this is actually really good for Chicago. I just think I've had better and cheaper pho in NY. When it comes to evaluating the actual pho, though, it's quite good. The broth is delicious, though I had to add some hoisin sauce to make it exactly the way I wanted. They have this interesting cilantro on the side, which was a surprise. (It doesn't look like normal cilantro). My boyfriend was vaguely dissatisfied because the server looked him up and down and recommended that he get the regular size, instead of the x-large size, lol. This was mildly insulting because he actually can eat a lot. (He ended up eating my leftovers because he wanted more). Right, even though I said that there's less than what I'm used to, it's still more than what I can finish. I almost never finish my food, but even I could tell that my leftovers were less than uh ... my normal leftovers. The service is good and the ambiance is well, that of a normal Vietnamese restaurant. It's not spectacular, but it's comfortable and familiar. Ba Le is across the street, if you want snacks / Vietnamese sandwiches to go. Apparently, there's a duck place across the street that has the best duck in Chicago :O
