I have high expectations when it comes to sushi. The fish has to be extra fresh, the rice on maki has to be perfected packed and the appetizers and miso soup need to complement to main entree. Coast is by far the best sushi place I've been to in Chicago because of its affordable prices, BYOB standing and a cool decor. I highly recommend trying the daily specials!
