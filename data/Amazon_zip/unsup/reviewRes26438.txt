Been here several times - and the food is always good. Today's food was no exception but the service was just so poor that it ruined the entire experience. Over 15 minutes from the time that we sat until someone came to our table. The server spilled sangria on my sister - no excuse me, no apology - just sent the bus boy over to clean up.  Water glasses left unfilled. Needed to ask for bread. Ordered a group of tapas, finished those - order another group. Our plates were dirty - needed to ask for clean plates. I finished my wine (only wanted one glass) - it sat on the table for over an hour empty - still there when we left. Not offered coffee. Maybe okay in a low end diner - not in this caliber of restaurant. Since the service component is as important as the food - i have rated it this low.
