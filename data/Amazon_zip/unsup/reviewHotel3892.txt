It's obviously an old, classic hotel from another era. Inherently is not the most modern offering in the area. For my needs, it was clean and conveniently located to downtown. It was interesting to stroll through the halls where so many interesting things have happened in the last 100 years. It was just fine for 2 nights, but any longer and I probably would upgrade to a Marriott.
