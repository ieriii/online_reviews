Irazu is...decent. I will say, I do not get the hype. Yes, it has a nice little patio area on a stretch of Milwaukee where that's a commodity. Yes, the food is cheap. But it also looks and tastes cheap if that makes sense. Yes, it's BYOB, which is always a plus. It is so so food but unless there's some hidden dish waiting to wow me I certainly don't think it deserves any culinary accolades.
