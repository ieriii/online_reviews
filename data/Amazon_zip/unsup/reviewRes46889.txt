I.Love.This.Place! Wonderful ambience. Excellent service. Awesome food. I mean, really? Can I ask for more? Oh wait, you mean they have a full bar and great beer selection too? Well hot damn! This is a really great moderate priced restaurant with a huge and varied menu. There has to be something for everyone...they even have vegan items and specials. The sweet potatoes fries are the best I've ever had, crunch and salty and sweet, oh my! I will totally come back here!
