Honestly? I have no idea what "authentic" Ethiopian food tastes like, because, well, I've never been to Ethiopia. That being said.... DAAYYYYYYUM DEMERA, YOU ARE BITCHIN' IN THE KITCHEN. I think Demera just dethroned Ras Dashen and the Diamond as the #1 Ethiopian spot in town. I met my friend here for delicious foods last night. Demera is in the middle of Uptown, on the corner of Broadway and Lawrence. It's in an up and coming spot - there's all sorts of post-dinner activities around here. Fun stuff. No one was in Demera when we were seated. We opted for the veggie combo for two - we got a towering tray (complete with injera) of potato/carrot, red lentils, yellow lentils, cabbage/carrot, spinach and collard greens. The flavors were seriously popping and I've never tasted this kind of depth in Ethiopian food. Bliss on a plate. We didn't get tea because it was sweltering outside, and the last thing we needed was hot, steamy tea. Next time, though. The service was good, but really, I was totally obsessed with the food. Very good stuff. My husband made me promise to take him back here. Oh, twist my arm.
