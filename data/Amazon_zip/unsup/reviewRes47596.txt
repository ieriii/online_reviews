A group of us went to ZED451 for brunch last weekend and were quite happy with our brunch pick. There are 4 different buffets set up, that include fresh fruits, pastries, meats (salami, etc), smoked salmon, veggie sides, and breads. Once you sample a few, the servers come around to offer more food at the table - sirloin steak, salmon, crabcakes, frittata, cinnamon rolls, bacon... It's almost never-ending. But oh, so good. They also has $3 Mimosa and Bloody Mary specials, which was a nice surprise. We left about 2hrs later, full and happy. Will definitely go back for brunch again, and would like to try the dinner selection as well. P.S. Love the classy approach for "Yes/No" server selections. Ya know... it's the "green card/red card" approach versus what Zed does - sleek river stones on a plate. When you're ready for server selections, place your stone in front of your plate. Very nice.
