I had previously dined here when the restaurant Thyme occupied this space. It is definitely some of the best outdoor seating in the city. If the food had been decent then I would have probably recommended it for the space alone. However, the service and the food was so far below par that it is not worth your time. The waitstaff was overstretched the night that I went and they did nothing more than profusely apologize (which got old pretty fast). Something on the house would have been a much nicer gesture and typical of the caliber of restaurant that they are trying to achieve. I had the mushroom risotto. It was watery and bland. I make a better risotto at home. They had used porcini mushrooms which are an expensive ingredient, but $36 still seemed steep for market price risotto. Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time on this place and predict it will not make it through the fall.
