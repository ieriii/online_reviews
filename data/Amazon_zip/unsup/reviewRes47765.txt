I am in love with Zed 451! Well, with their brioche pudding dessert to be exact! I went here with a friend on a Wednesday when it was pouring out.. so needless to say no rooftop seats. Anyhow, I really like the decor and the service was grrreat! The dressing that came with the food are to die for. We only got the harvest option which serves no meat. The dessert was soo good. Made with melted marshmallow in a brioche.. light and perfectly sweet! I would go back there and just eat that.. yummmmy
