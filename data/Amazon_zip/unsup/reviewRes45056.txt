I had heard excellent things about Anteprima, but was worried by the low average rating. After eating here, I have to say I wholeheartedly disagree. My meal was fantastic! I chose the weekday (Sunday-Thursday) $29 Prix Fixe menu. You get to choose any starter, entre and either a 1/2 pasta dish or dessert. Here's what I got: -grilled polenta starter - this was recommended by Yelpers. It's served like a grilled dense cake (looked like a filet of salmon) atop boiled down greens. It just went against the creaminess I love about polenta, but it's exactly what it purports to be. There was a nice smokey flavor to the dish. I liked it, but my other two courses were much better. -orecchiette with lamb sausage - this was delicious, the pasta tasted fresh and the spicy crumbled lamb sausage was so good. The bitter greens complimented the dish. It was a winner. I could have ordered the full plate as a main course and been happy. -slow cooked pork shoulder - OMG, I died when I ate this. The pork was superbly tender, the flavors from the pork drippings and roasted vegetables were so amazingly perfect, I just couldn't stop eating (though I was pretty full at this point). I cannot recommend this highly enough. It was the perfect cold weather dish without being too heavy. I am knocking off a star because the service was lacklustre. I arrived before my friend and they were happy to seat me. However, my waiter seemed to avoid me like the plague. After about 10 minutes, he came over and asked if I wanted a drink, but I didn't have a cocktail menu. Once he came back with one, he waited another 10 minutes to return for my order (I got the "For a Good Time...", gin, lemoncello and sage, it was good, not great). I thought he was going to take our orders when he brought the drink, but, no, that took another 10 minutes of waiting. The courses came out back-to-back-to-back. It would have been nice had they been spaced more attentively. Overall, though, it won't stop me from returning.
