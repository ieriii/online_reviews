Some friends and I went here one night when the wait was too long over at Great Lake. We were dead-set on pizza and gave this place a try based on it's proximity to home. We ordered 4 pizzas, were given a free glass of Prosecco and before I was done with the drink, the pizzas were ready. Holy Moly! Wood burning pizza ovens still amaze me! The buffalo mozzarella and arugula are outta this world.  I want it in my mouth now.
