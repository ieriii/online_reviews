If you have found this entry, chances are you have already have heard of the reputation of this place. The most complaints you might see about this establishment is the wait. WELL WORTH IT. The pizza is beyond your dreams, and I am pretty sure if you go solo and eat over half they will call you a complimentary ambulance.
