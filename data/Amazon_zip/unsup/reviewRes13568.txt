I like Glenn's, and I'll be back, but I'm not sure it quite deserves the raves. It's fine for some basic seafood, but I've been twice and was a bit disheartened to find that the seafood specials were exactly the same as before. Same fishes, same sauces. I ordered the mahi mahi both times, since I really didn't want the cream sauces that came with most of the others. This one was grilled with a fruit salsa. I'd like some of the other fishes offered that way too... especially the tuna. The veggies on the side were fresh and good, and they let me swap out my potatoes for a potato pancake. All for the very nice price of $18.  My husband tried the meatloaf the first time and the burger the second time... both were fine but not amazing. He also tried the clam chowder. It was served in a mug and was the thickest clam chowder we'd ever tried!! A bit much, I'd say. My daughter had the smoked cheddar mac & cheese... a bit tepid, please warm it up a bit next time! So... overall, it's good not great, but a very good choice when you want some basic fish and you don't want to go to a fancy place.
