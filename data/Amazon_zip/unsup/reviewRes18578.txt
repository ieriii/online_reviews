On a quick trip to the city, I used YELP to pick this place. It was 11 am and the YELPERS said arrive early so I did and thank goodness! I was seated by 11:15 and when I left at 11:45 the line was LONG!  I only had about 90 seconds to read the menu and while my Pepita sandwich was good, I did not see or taste the jalapeos that were described on it. The green salsa made the dish. Good but about as good as the O'Hare offerings, though the line is shorter at the airport and the awesome margaritas are also there! Beer and wine only at XOCO.  The churro with chocolate shot was AWESOME! I promised myself to eat only half, but could not stop until it was gone. Dining in is a tight affair, but they handled the counter dine in service perfectly!
