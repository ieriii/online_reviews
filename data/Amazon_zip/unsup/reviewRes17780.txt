I went to Violet Hour for drinks after work. We got there about 6:30 and I wouldn't suggest getting there much after if you don't want to wait in line. They only let the number of people in that there is seating for so don't expect lots of people or crowds.... in fact the only crowd you'll encounter is at the door. This place is great for relaxing, enjoying a well crafted cocktail, and chatting. Check it out!
