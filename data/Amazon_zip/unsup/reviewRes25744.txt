Stayed at the Blackstone back in February and decided to try the hotel restaurant. I have to say this is the first time I've had a fantastic dinner at a hotel! Cool, hip place with good food. Great vibe and ambiance. Waitress was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Loved the Serrano ham and fig salad. I loved the sangria. The potato and rice dishes (sorry forgot the names) were delicious, too. Everything looked so good. Come here with a group so you can sample more dishes. Since I'm from LA, I didn't think the prices were too high, especially since the portions were a decent size.
