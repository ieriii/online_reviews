Entirely overrated. The decoration is cheap and kitschy. It's too loud for conversation, which I think is important for a place set up as a restaurant. On substance, the beer they brew is not at all impressive. I'd rate it a little higher than Moonshine's beer, but still somewhat below Natty Ice. The food itself is fine enough, but the menu doesn't inspire much of an appetite. The server didn't seem to know much about beer, despite working at a brew-pub. Also, he billed for the mediocre cupcake he brought out when we told them it was my friend's birthday. Not that it's absolutely de rigueur to give things away gratis on birthdays, but any little pleasantness from the waiter would've been welcomed, and would've bumped them up a star or two in my opinion. I really hate this place.
