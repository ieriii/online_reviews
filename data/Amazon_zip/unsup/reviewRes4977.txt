The place was packed. We ended up sitting at the bar and eating dinner there as well.  The wine selection is excellent and it looked like there were no domestic (e.g. California & Oregon wines). The bartender provided very good wine recommendations from Portugal, France, and Spain. The food is good but I noticed they put lemon on everything.
