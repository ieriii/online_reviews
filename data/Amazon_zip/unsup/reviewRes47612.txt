I have now been here 3 times in the last year. But this past weekend was the first time I had been for brunch. It was the same disappointment that it was for dinner. Again, the atmosphere is fun and trendy and the food is good. But the problem with this restaurant is that you can never get the food. After I got my first round at the salad/ cheese bar I was ready to dive into the meats and breakfast dishes that I had heard about. Yet my plate said empty for 15-20 minutes. literally. We put our little rocks out on the table to let theservers know we are hungry and ready for some serious food. The only thing that came to our table was turkey. 4 times. We kindy said no thanks we had already had turkey but we would love to try ANYTHING else. Finally, we said something to our server who claimed to tell the chefs but we still waited. I will admit when the food did come, it was tasty but at that point I was so annoyed that it had already ruined brunch. To throw salt in the wound a manager came over to help clear plates and he asked how our meal was. We said "meh, okay, tooks a really long time, very slow" He didnt apologize or say anything just nodded and moved along. 3 strikes and you're out.
