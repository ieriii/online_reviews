The Bad Apple was a very solid establishment on a number of levels. I went with my family, who are notoriously difficult to please - I am a hardcore foodie, my sister has a 6-year-old's taste in food and doesn't eat red meat, my mother is on a Gestapo low-carb diet, and my father has pathological difficulties ordering food. Nevertheless, this place had something to please everybody. My "Happy Belly" sandwich had perfectly seared pork belly (crispy, and with just enough fat rendered to keep it from being greasy), a delectable tarragon mustard dressing, and was served an above average pretzel roll. My sister's veggie burger was a crowd pleaser (how often do you see that in writing?!), my mother's eggplant salad was great, and my father managed to find a brisket sandwich on texas toast that was very good, and they even had a superfluous bowl of olives that pleased his obsession with small plates. The beer list was exceptional - I had 2 beers (Great Divide Yeti, Ska Decadent Imperial IPA), both from Colorado and both delectable. The service was also great; our server managed to come off as being legitimately enthusiastic about the offerings without sounding cornball or contrived, which in my experience makes him the waitstaff equivalent of a unicorn. I was unaware that such people existed. I actually accepted his beer recommendation, which my friends will tell you is almost unheard of. My lone gripe is with the fries. The garlic fries were excellent and crack-like in terms of their addictiveness, but the truffle fries were too scantily truffled; I felt like when I ate a fry, I had a 50/50 chance of tasting truffle on the fry. A common error, to be fair, but it's enough to earn the place 4 stars rather than 5 from my vantage point.
