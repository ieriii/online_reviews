I just tried this place with my friends last night and it was absolutely amazing!!!!Avocado Wontons, tamarind shrimp soup, and the ginger mahi mahi all were scrumptious! To top it all off, I ordered a vietnamese hot coffee at the end of my meal. Seriously, this stuff is fierce!all the ingredients were fresh, service was very attentive, atmosphere was very nice and they gave us little complimentary fruit plates at the end of our meal. There's no way I'm going back to argyle for my vietnamese-fix after trying this new place! five stars!
