I went pre- renovations, The rooms were a bit to be desired but what gave them the 4 stars was the friendly staff! A bellman gave us a tour of the hotel that many guests do not get, seeing an old speakeasy on a floor that was only discovered in the 1990s. fantastic history in the hotel and worth seeing. i did not care for the hidden fees in the stay, but again, the history of the place is amazing.
