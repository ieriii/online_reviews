Tank Heavens for Tank Noodle. I'm not 100% that your fresh n' tasty Veggie Spring Rolls and luxurious Veggie Curry Rice Noodle Soup are entirely vegan but you are sooo darn tasty that I'll continue to delude myself into believing you are vegan and gluten-free friendly. I stress no soy sauce and no dairy and everyone seems to understand my concerns and address them - so far no reaction which is more than I can say for other restaurants that advertise GF. They also make simple vegan mango and ice smoothies upon request. Tank is also a the sensible place to bring a large group of friends with wide economic disparities as the menu goes easy on the wallet while providing ample nourishment.
