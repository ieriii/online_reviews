Dear Hopleaf, I'm your 732nd reviewer...whatever. This doesn't mean I've succumbed to becoming another one of your beer groupies. Just setting the record straight. Let's rewind some 8 years ago. You see, I was a new kid on the block and not a big fan of consuming anything with hops. I still kept it simple...vodka soda without fruit. Do you remember the snarky comments you would make about how my preferences didn't match your expectations? How about the time you simply ignored my presence? Oh, the best was when you accidently broke my glass in the sink and scolded ME for not just ordering a beer. I remember all of it clearly. Yes, my bad for returning---but my ale-loving friends fell for your nonsense. Fast forward to present day. Been a while and I see you've picked up some mad game. You now cater to the avid wine sippers, fruitless vodka folks and mussel aficionados. Your CB&J sandwich with side of stilton mac n cheese (yo!) is a crowd pleaser and would keep even the prudiest of food prudes loyal. Since the expansion, you seem cleaner and more attractive...love the brick walls, patio and 2nd level space.  I've had a decent time with you since our initial encounters but have yet to be totally sold. Your crew is upbeat and has given informative wine suggestions (with a smile)....impressive turn around since the old days. Speaking of turn around...Belgian beer has been going down pretty easily lately..maybe we can meet half way.
