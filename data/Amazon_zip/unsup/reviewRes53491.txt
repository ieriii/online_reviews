I'll be honest and admit that while I don't eat out very often, I've eaten at many places in different locations and countries. Tru is my most memorable and favorite meal. Keep in mind that you're not just paying to have your food cooked, you're paying for your experience. If you have plans for after dinner, you'll want to allot the appropriate length of time. My dinner took literally three hours. My favorite part of the meal was definitely dessert and their cart with homemade treats was the best way to finish my meal. You may be like me and can't afford this type of dining experience all the time, but Tru is definitely the place for a special meal.
