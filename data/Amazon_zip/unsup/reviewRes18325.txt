While waiting in line at X0C0 (Thursday at 700pm), my friends and I began joking about the odds of Rick Bayless actually being in the kitchen plating our food. We worked our way through the line, ordered food and drinks and found our way to a table. Near the end of our delicious, worth-the- wait tortas, my friend nudged me and directed my attention toward the food prep line. There was Rick Bayless. He was on the line helping to plate food and overall checking on standards. It would have been a lovely dinning experience on its own, but the Bayless sighting really put it over the top. XOCO is a great urban dinning experience- the small space has communal tables so you might find yourself dinning with new friends in addition to the old. It gets crowded and the beers could be cheaper, but the food is good and the churros with ice cream dip are even better!
