I have been here several times with friends and it all went well. Love their papaya salad the most! However, there were one experience that killed all my positive energy for this place. It was about half a year ago when it happened but I didn't join Yelp then. It was on my mother-in-law's birthday and our family came here to celebrate. Everything was great until I found 2 cockroaches next to me. One was on the wall and the other one was on the table. Everybody felt so disgusted and we called the server out to show him the evidence (my husband killed them with the napkin). But there were no apology coming from him or any other staff later and the server also looked at our family as trouble makers since we said it out loud. Because of this experience, I haven't come back here and I don't think i will ever again. I also told my friends not to come because cockroaches in the front house is seriously not acceptable!!!! So everybody when you come here and you sit next to the wall, watch for those disgusting creatures.
