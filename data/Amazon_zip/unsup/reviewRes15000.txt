Maybe I had too high of expectations of this place, but after staring at the pictures of the popcorn rolled in pig fat for a week prior to going to this place I was pretty juiced. We got here, had a short wait, and sipped on some of the Belgian Wit. It was simply delicious. Super crisp and refreshing and subtly sweet, the perfect beer for me. Came here with a pretty big group so we shared two orders of the popcorn and mussels. I think the idea of popcorn in pig fat got me more excited than the actual thing itself. Don't get me wrong it was delicious but it didn't taste super cohesive. LIke the flavors didn't "meld" together that well.... it tasted like the bacon was just thrown in with the popcorn at the very end. Yah I'm from California and I have high expectations for food. The mussels were freaking delicious. I wanted to literally sip the broth straight up but wanted to "keep it classy." I also had the pulled pork sando which was good but i was expecting more. They didn't put quite enough slaw on and the pork was a little on the dry side. I also shared the cheddar ale soup with my man boo which was hella thick and worked well as a dipping sauce for our fries but dos muchos as a soup. The man boo also got the duck confit pizza which just tasted like shredded chicken on top of pizza. bleh. The gorgonzola cheese took over the entire taste of the pizza.  Next time, I will come back here and stick to the beer and appetizers.
