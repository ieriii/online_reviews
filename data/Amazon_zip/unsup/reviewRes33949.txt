I think I have been here before. In fact I am sure I have. I remember the inside, but I was probably 16 and more interested in sneaking a cig when my parents weren't looking then actually eating the food. Anyway, I decided to give this place a shot and made a reservation for 12 on a Saturday evening. I was not impressed with the woman who booked the reservations for a few reasons. A) You are a restaurant; I am not trying to book an appointment to meet the Pope. Get over yourself. B) Yes, it's a birthday and yes there will be kids there. That is why I am coming early. Booster seats please, and I will pass on the attitude. And finally C) You seriously want to charge me $2.50 per person to bring in a cake, then you proceed to tell me to call your preferred bakery, Sweet Mandy B's, and spend 35 bones on a cake, bringing the total to a cool $65 to celebrate my mothers 6 and a half decades of life? Ummm, no.  Needless to say, going into this I was a little leery. We got there and the place was empty and besides the semi snotty host man at the door, I was extremely impressed with our dining experience. The bread and fresh basil olive oil was great. The bruschetta and calamari apps went down faster than Christmas decorations on January 10th. Everyone was satisfied with his or her entrees. Service was decent, but our waiter maybe could have gotten a bigger shirt because we were all staring at the outline to his nipple rings all night. He was friendly and helpful otherwise. They brought out a tiny little dessert, we sang happy birthday and then went back to my place to enjoy cake and ice cream, minus the $65 charge!
