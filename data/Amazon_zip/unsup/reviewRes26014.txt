So my boyfriend took me here on Monday to celebrate our anniversary. I had heard of Geja's but never had the chance to go. We get there a few minutes earlier than our 9pm reservation, and were told that we had to wait at the bar. There was a small table nearby so we sat there and got drinks, pineapple infused vodka for me, strawberry mojito for me. The restaurant is not as big as I'd imagined, and with the dark wood, dim lighting and flamenco guitar, (which that night happened to be live), makes it feel very intimate and romantic. After waiting about 20 minutes, the boyfriend and I were led to our table, and we opted to sit on the same side of the table so we could enjoy the view of the windows. We ordered the International, which was beef, chicken, shrimp and veggies, and it came with a cheese course, and a salad. The salad came out first, and it was simply greens tossed in a vinaigrette topped with cucumbers and some other veggies. Not memorable. However, the combination of swiss, guyere and another cheese in that first pot, combined with the different breads, fruits and veggies was great. We had a little trouble seeing what was there because of the darkness, but it almost didn't even matter because it was just yummy. After nibbling on that, the time came for the main course, and we happily dug in. With the flamenco guitar playing right across from us, I was afraid it would be too loud to hear or make declarations of the sentimental kind, but it wasn't. Boyfriend got full off the main course, so I ate a nice portion of the chocolate course myself...which is fine with me as I love sweets. Him, not so much. I love the idea of fondue, and I loved the experience of Geja's. It's more like eating in the middle of romance...and boyfriend got major points for bringing me here. The blingy ring I got too...that was even more major.
