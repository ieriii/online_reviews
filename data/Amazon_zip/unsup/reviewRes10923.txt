If you ask me, Piece is an alright brewpub that could be a lot better with a little different game plan. The house brews are almost always really good, and in very interesting styles. The brewer has a lot of talent, and it shows. Unfortunately, they're usually out of several of their beers; in fact, I've been there at times where they only have two house brews available. Yes, they have guest taps, and yes, those taps are moderately well thought-out. Of course, though, guest taps at a brewpub are a cardinal sin, unless those taps come from another local brewpub. I would love to see them have more of their house brews on at all times and get rid of the beers I can get at most other bars. The food is above average. The pizzas are among the better thin crusts I've had in Chicago, though they're definitely among the highest-priced thin crusts I've seen. The chocolate pizza dessert is good enough to stand up to my immense hatred of Rachel Ray. Piece would probably be a 4-star pizza joint. But as a brewpub, it's only 3.
