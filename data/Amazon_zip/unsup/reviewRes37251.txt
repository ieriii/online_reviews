Fox and Obel is definitely Chicago's Dean & Deluca. That basically means you will find everything in this store marked up at a premium. The average revenue per square foot here easily quadruples that of more conventional supermarkets. That's okay because Fox and Obel has the best quality Prime Grade Beef in the city. The marbling is very good and the butchers cut the steaks nice and thick. The deli has a great selection of smoked salmon and imported hams. They had lobster tails and caviar for the big party. The produce section is very weak though. I came here to do some shopping for NYE. They had the same brand of risotto Spago Beverly Hills uses in its restaurant. I grabbed a box along with some Plugra, chicken stock, and grated Reggiano cheese. I grabbed some Hanger steak filets which are rarely found in stores. Overall, Fox and Obel does a good job of packing in as many high quality ingredients as possible in a relatively small space. I may not be able to shop here regularly at these prices, but I am sure glad that I know where I can find some great steaks for the summer time.
