I can see why this place is always busy, but the last time I was there, we got lucky! Waited about 2 minutes to get seats for six on a Thursdays night! I've been at grand lux in the past, but since then, every time I've attempted to go, the wait wasn't worth sticking around.  I think this place is great to bring a large group of friends! They are really friendly on splitting checks :) and the waitress we had was very helpful and so knowledgeable on specials. I really appreciate it when they're honest on how long bake goods take to cook. They ask you after you get your meal if you want desert, that way its ready once your done! I didn't get dessert that time, only because I was so stuffed with the enormous salad! I had the Polynesian salad. There was a lot going on in it - pineapples, wonton chips with peanuts, chicken breast slices, carrots, mango... tossed in a sweet and salty dressing. Too salty for my taste though :( The dressing with overwhelming. I also had a share of the Asian Nachos. I only ordered it out of curiosity, since I read such awesome things about it. It's definitely a huge amount. The sauce in the nachos was similar to the salad. It's pretty dark in there so I don't really recall what the topping was on the nachos, but it was ok. The rice in the center on the plate was kind of odd though. It was on the soggy side and just felt random to me. It's an interesting twist on the two cuisines, but not for me. A 3.5 star for grand lux. Fun and chill place to dine with friends. Extensive menu and decent prices for the amount of food. Go on a "cold" weekday if you don't want to wait in line, otherwise, be patient :)
