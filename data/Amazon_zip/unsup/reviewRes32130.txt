ok finally I went here for dinner and it's so much better than lunch. Very trendy and chic atmosphere. Food was delicious. The dinner menu was so much better definitely does the restaurant justice. Something i recommend to start out with is the stuffed avocado, the brussel sprout salad, and the braised short ribs and for dessert try the taro and coconut bread pudding and if you want a sugar attack go for the tempura ice cream (too sweet for me). the only complaint I have is that the communal table with the stools are extremely uncomfortable. My back and butt was hurting was hurting.
