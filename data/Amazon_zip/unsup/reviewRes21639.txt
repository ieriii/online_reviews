Visited this for lunch on Satuday and yes, the line was long but who cares. The hostess offered drinks while we waited the 45 minutes. The guacamole is the absolute best (order a side of guac for your guest). The sandwhiches are amazing! We tried the Pepito:(not spicy) Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos and the Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. Don't leave without trying the churro with a shot of chocolate!!!
