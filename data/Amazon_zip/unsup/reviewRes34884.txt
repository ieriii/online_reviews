Sushi X is a great addition to this burgeoning neighborhood. The service and cuisine are impeccable. The maki rolls are unique and oh so yummy...I recommend the "Godzilla" and "Crab Rangoon" rolls. But be sure to bring your appetite the sushi portions are huge and you will definitely leave the restaurant satisfied. Be sure to try their other interesting menu items; the Asian Pot Roast w/ Wasabi mashed potatoes is great (hmmm, I'm just getting hungry just thinking about it). If you are thirsty and crave some alcoholic beverages, bring your own. Sushi X is a BYOB establishment.  The decor of Sushi X is very minimalist and funky, with anime cartoons being projected off the rear wall. The one criticism I have is that Sushi X is teeny tiny, so be prepared to wait for a table on the weekends. But if you live in the area, give Sushi X a call; they also offer carry-out and delivery to their customers. Be sure to stop into Sushi X.  Maybe, I'll see you there...
