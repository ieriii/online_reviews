Not too shabby. My family and I checked out Wildfire two weekends ago and well some of us enjoyed our meals, some of us didn't, but we ALL loved the dessert (check out the pic)! For starters, we ordered the Crab Crusted Stuffed Shrimp - nice flavor, and a decent start to the meal. For dinner, I had the Horseradish Crusted Fillet Mignon. I enjoyed my meat for the week ;-) It was wrapped in bacon and the horseradish gave the fillet a tiny kick. One sister ordered the Blue Cheese Crusted Fillet - pretty good as well. My other sister and mommsie ordered their specials - some special cut fillet mignon w/ mushrooms and mahi mahi. Both were not too pleased with their meals. Now for dessert - all I have to say is Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie w/ Vanilla Ice Cream and hot fudge! Damn that was good. This dessert makes up for 2 of the 4 stars ;-)
