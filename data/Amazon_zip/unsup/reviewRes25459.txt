Based on the number of reviews, I don't need to say much. Awesome (albeit expensive) tapas!! Portion size is generous for tapas, so even though it's pricey you leave feeling you got your money's worth. Favorites: bacon wrapped dates (of course), arroz a la cazuela (could have licked the bowl!), costillas de ternera (beef shortrib flatbread with horseradish, parmesan & bacon...truly amazing and I would go back for this one dish alone!). Great place to grab drinks too...awesome sangria and great setting in the unique Blackstone Hotel.
