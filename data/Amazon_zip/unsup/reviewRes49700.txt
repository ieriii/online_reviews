Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Needless to say shame on me! I visited this place once about 7 months ago and got sick from the food. I thought maybe it was just a bug. I revisited the restaurant last night and got deathly sick again! I will never go here again. Also, the food was good the first time not so good last night. It lacked any real flavor. The prices are high but you do get a lot of food but no one needs that much food. Save yourself a trip to the bathroom and do not visit this place.
