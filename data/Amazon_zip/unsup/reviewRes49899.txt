Hmmmm, meat. The Picada Columbiana is a great combination plate of steak, chicken, pork and sausage along with lots of sides. It feeds 2 with plenty of leftovers. I loved the cornbread- consistency is more like chilled polenta. Sangria was good but not very strong. It took a little while for our waiter to first approach us but the service was good after that. I'm definitely going to go back and bring my own wine.
