I arranged a stay for my two best friends for their 10 year wedding anniversary. The price was more than reasonable given the location and the quality of the hotel. The staff made it really easy to arrange the room and were very friendly when I called to confirm. Best of all, my friends LOVED it. The decor was cheerful and yet tranquil at the same time. They had a great time. I can't thank the Indigo's staff enough for the warm and welcoming atmosphere that they provide.
