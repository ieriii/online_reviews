i love grand lux! i became a fan of this place when i lived in las vegas for a few months...however, in vegas, grand lux is 24 hrs. talk about convenient. very nice location. i'm a little appalled at the wait time for a table on the weekend but i guess thats expected. the wait at 10pm on a saturday was still 30-40 minutes. service was good. they function like a well oiled machine. the second you sit down, you got servers coming at you from every direction with water and bread. same thing happens when your food comes out. a little pricier than cheesecake factory...but worth it because the menu is much more extensive. i also love that they have fresh from the oven desserts that you have to order in advance so they can make it in time. i didn't order any this time but the chocolate chip cookies are to die for! can't wait to come back! =)
