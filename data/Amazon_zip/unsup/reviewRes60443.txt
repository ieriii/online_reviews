I would love to give a higher rating to Anteprima but there has been a consistency issue. First time we went there it was a 4 boarding on 5 rating, we looked forward to coming back. The 2nd time was a 3 star on the food, atmosphere always a 4-5 experience, very cozy and lively. The reason 3 star on food was too much salt, a little dry on the rabbit dish I had, just not nailing the dishes. I also based my ratings with price in mind. If you going to charge $15-20 or more for an entree, you have to deliver a plate that meets the value. Unfortunately they come up short. The food is good here, one of the better Italian resturants in the city, but not consistently top. We want back a third time hoping for a great meal, and still got good to OK food. Service and atmosphere is very good, but can be hit or miss on the meal. For best Italian I have had so far in the city it has to be A Tavola over in Wicker Park/East Village on Chicago Ave. It is more expensive, but always delivers.
