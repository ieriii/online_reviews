I don't get the hype. I came to The Publican on an impromptu double date with my favorite foodie couple. I'd heard the rave reviews, so I was excited for dinner. Everything here is meant to be shared, tapas-style. We ordered a little bit of everything, including the ham sampler, sweetbreads, steak tartare, pork belly, lobster, frites with a fried egg, and beets. Some stuff was great (steak tartare, pork belly, lobster) and others were just OK (sweetbreads). The best part of the meal was dessert, so I highly recommend that you leave room for it. We ordered one of each dessert and polished everything off. A meal here will cost you big time, so be warned that while this place may look and feel like your casual neighborhood bar, it's priced for foodies. The service was great, and I loved the aesthetics (there are baskets under your chair for your purse!), but I just didn't buy into the hype. The food was good, and I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not sure I'll come back.
