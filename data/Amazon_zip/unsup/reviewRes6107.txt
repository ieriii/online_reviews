Well worth the wait! We were expecting a wait on a Saturday night with a larger group of 5 - didn't quite expect to hear 2-2.5 hours - but I live near Longman and Eagle, so we weren't scared away. The wine bar across the street was perfect for some pre-dinner drinks and we were seated within 1.5 hours or so. My friend and I were first time visitors (from Chicago), with some out of town guests. We studied the menu intently over drinks, went in with a firm game plan to share and sample many dishes. We had one vegetarian (eats fish), so we skewed towards veg/fish, but supplemented with a few meat dishes. We had a nice tray of meats and cheeses, great presentation and nice flavors all around. Also tried antipasti and salads (white anchovies with celery, truffle egg toast, and two orders of the roasted corn salad). Only complaint via this round - almost impossible to split the egg toast 5 ways, but we all managed to snag a bite! Split a few orders of paste: Cacio e Pepe (yum!), two orders Riccio di Mare e Granchio (a table fave), and a special that had smoked salmon - we put the last plate on hold and were happy to sample that special. We also ordered the beautiful Pollo 'Sole Mio' - quite a lovely presentation and all the meat eaters were digging into this platter, even the romaine side salad was a star - just a perfect plate of food. Finally, as a dessert, we had to order the Ricotta + honey comb Vasi - my friend was NOT leaving without trying this dish. We were fairly stuffed, but what a treat. We all had a few bites to round out the great meal and sent our friend home with a little serving of the ricotta which she promptly used the next morning. Can't wait to return and sample more items, including brunch.
