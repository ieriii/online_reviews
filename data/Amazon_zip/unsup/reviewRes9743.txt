My wife and I went here over the weekend and the food was absolutely fabulous. The menu options were initially unclear - however the waitress cleared up our confusion very quickly. Basically - you're kind of forced to order the $60 prix fixe option which includes a appetizer, palate cleanser, entree, mini-appertizer, then a dessert. The scallop appetizer was perfectly cooked and the flavors just melted in your mouth. i ordered the beef short ribs with truffle dumplings. OMG - the dumplings were heavenly, a perfect symphony of flavors with the short rib. I ordered the butternet beignets, the beignets had a hint of curry, which I personally didn't really like, but overall the composition of the flavors were outstanding. Upon request, Sara Nguyen and Dale Levitski stopped by and chatted. It was very fun to meet them in person and they have very friendly personable personalites. Would definitely recommend going back. This place is up there with my other favorite spot, Takashi.
