I had such a nice time. I wanted to take my wife somewhere special for our anniversary but also someplace different. We have been to the Trotters and all the other upscale establishments and this was such a nice experience. I notified the restaurant staff in advance that it was our anniversary and it was so nice, all of the staff congratulated us whenever we interacted. I enjoyed the romantic, low light atmosphere and I really liked all of the food. I can't say enough, they completed our special evening.
