Nothing special really. It's a very nice atmosphere, but everything is very overpriced. Also, the portions are about 4x too big, and if you're a vegetarian or even vegan, there about two dishes outside of salad (and even most salads include meat here) that you'll be able to eat. Also, DO NOT order cocktails here, they'll be sloppily made and will cost about as much as your dinner. UPDATE: AN EMPLOYEE HERE STOLE MY BLADE RUNNER UMBRELLA!!! And no one would fess up! You see, some friends and I were the last group in Lux to leave that night, I had walked there with the most amazing umbrella in the world. It actually lit up at the handle! And blue light at that! I knew I had left it in the booth right next to where I was sitting so I called FIRST THING IN THE MORNING out of my intense love for my umbrella. I told them the exact booth we were in and they denied finding any umbrella. Thinking they just didn't check good enough, I sent a secret agent to harass some poor people sitting there later that day to look for my lost umbrella, but alas, it was not there. THIEVES! I WANT MY BLADE RUNNER UMBRELLA BACK! ....I should mention that I also came back every day for a week asking after my umbrella and they finally gave me someone else's, which didn't exactly help me gain any faith about their standard umbrella policies.
