ok, I feel as if my recent posts are all pretty harsh and i preface this by saying, I am not a hard customer to please- but the past couple places i've been excited to go have bombed. this is no exception- I went to wishbone for brunch with two other friends (and fellow yelpers) to hang out after a long work day/night yesterday. I was thirsty, hungry and psyched to not be at work.  We were seated and our waiter didn't appear for at least 7-10 minutes- During this time I was very thirsty (i may have gotten a drink after work!)- When we did finally order our beverages, it took a while to get our water, and forever to get our cocktails (horribly bland bloody marys and an ehhh mimosa) and our coffee. A diet coke was forgotten on the first try- we finally ordered, I was so excited... food took a while and then arrived missing parts, and with some wrong parts- and then was just not very good at all. my crab (which many have raved about) was mediocre, but I was hungry so i ate it- my friend ordered the bean cakes, which were gross looking, dry and not good So, i could go on and on, but i am getting lazy and annoyed with having to yelp at it. All in all, my water was always empty... the staff was slow, and inattentive, the drinks were not that good, the food was not that good, and my tummy hurt a lot for the rest of the day. I would not ever go back-
