I've gone there twice. The first time I would have reviewed it at a 5. The second time a 1. The empanadas were wonderful, but the chicken ones really lacked chicken. The other 2 are one of the best in the city. The food both times was really good, although the second time our waitress kept messing up our order. The second time we came in was during lunch. I've done a lot of restaurant mystery shopping, so I'm used to looking at the clock and seeing how long everything takes. First of all we tried calling to see what time they opened for lunch. No one ever answered the phone. One time they answered but immediately hung up. We called the other restaurant for the phone number of the owner. We called him and he confirmed that the restaurant was open for business. When we got there, we stood at the hostess stand for 9 minutes before anyone even looked at us to acknowledge we were there. Had we not had a Groupon, we would have left for sure. We walked in the door at 12:30, sat down at 12:39 (only because we finally asked if we should seat ourselves) and then weren't approached to order until 12:51. That's completely ridiculous. We ordered 6 empanadas and didn't want chicken since they aren't that good. They still gave us one chicken, but we just ate it and didn't say anything. They were short staffed, but they should have at least said something to us. There were only 8 tables seated. Anyway, the food is really good, service pretty much stinks. Both times we dined there we had to wait awhile for someone to acknowledge us. That's supposed to be your first impression of the restaurant. Not good. I honestly don't know if I will go back again. They need to hire someone to do mystery shopping so that the owner really knows whats going on in there. Other than the chicken empanada, the food really is good. It's not cheap but it's not expensive. It's a good mid priced restaurant.
