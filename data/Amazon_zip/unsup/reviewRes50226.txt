We were there for brunch Saturday. We really enjoyed ourselves and the food is very good. The drinks were all good as well. The staff was so helpful that when one of us asked for a drink that wasn't on their drink menu they served it anyway. We all shared the beignets, awendaw, pate, and plantains and corn bread. All very good. I had pork and gravy on biscuits with greens. Pretty good except for the greens, which turned out to be mostly stringy, which is the only reason my rating is not a 5. The others at the table had the pancakes, eggs benedict, and the walleye. Everything tasted great and the portions are generous. We also had desert. The ice creams were unusual and good, the chocolate torte was outstanding, and the sour cherries were very good. All in all, we really liked the place and would go there again.
