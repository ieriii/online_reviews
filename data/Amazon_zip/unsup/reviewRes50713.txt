I went here a few months ago and I'm STILL thinking about my meal here. Everything was sooo delicious, from the hibiscus tea to the fried green tomatoes. New Orleans' Tourism board should give these guys a commission... boy and I picked a place for our weeklong summer break and New Orleans was my pick thanks to a reading of A Confederacy of Dunces and my memories of Big Jones. THAT is how good that one dinner was. More pluses... it's a really sweet date spot, a unique idea (the only other Southern place I know is heaven on seven, which is way too expensive for what you get), and the service is top notch.
