Service was acceptable for a high end place, though to be honest I find it awkward when people try to push in my chair or replace my napkin anyway.The decor is nice, especially the entrance. When you step into Alinea, the hallway shrinks towards the far end producing a very Alice in Wonderland type effect. Appropriate considering the highly creative dishes that are served.If you really love food, have the money to spend, and want something adventurous, I highly recommend Alinea. Otherwise, don't go. Many of the dishes are definitely hit or miss, and it's not fun to spend a chunk of change on twenty small courses, only a third of which you like. That said, I had a good time. I had the touring menu. Although I don't think this always happens, Chef Achatz came out to my table and painted the table with an edible dessert. Very cool.
