Solid, cheap food. Go here on a cold rainy day. It will heal you. :) Get the Pho--it's their specialty. Just picture a big bowl of soup with bean sprouts, and rice noodles, and whatever meat/fish you choose, accompanied by many different fresh herbs that you can add to your liking. very fresh tasting and you're not bloated afterwards. PLUS, super cheap.
