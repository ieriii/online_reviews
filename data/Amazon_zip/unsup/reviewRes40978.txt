Let me preface this comment with a couple of facts, i love to eat, i have hit up taco joints from north to south, even one in San Antonio texas that was supposedly the best of the US, it was horrible!!!!, and I am a beaner.  So let me say that the meat here is what makes the difference, Flavor!!!.  I cannot vouch for anything else, try the steak tacos.  On a side note though, la pasadita's franchising if you will is a little bizarre, 3 on 1 block!!!  Note to owner, at least you should have opened one around the corner.
