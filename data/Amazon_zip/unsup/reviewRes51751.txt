My roommate and I went for lunch. We waited 10 minutes for chips and then another 10 more minutes for water. After 20 minutes or so from the time the water was brought, the waitress finally brought our food out. They were busy, but not THAT busy. I ordered a Chimichanga and the last time I checked Chimichangas were more than a deep-fried burrito packed with 2 pounds of meat. What's the point in going to a sit-down restaurant and paying for the service if the service is terrible? I might go back and try something else, but I'll get it to go because their service sucked.
