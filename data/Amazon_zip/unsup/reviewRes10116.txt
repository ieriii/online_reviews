Took my lady here for her birthday. Nice dinner. Great patio. Reservations are recommended (I think the hostess even asked me "are you sure?" when I told her we didn't have a rez, even though plenty of tables were open). Service was below-par, but food and atmosphere were great. Nice white tablecoth atmosphere and fresh and flavorful Italian food (not to mention al-denta pasta gives them a fighting chance for 4 stars).
