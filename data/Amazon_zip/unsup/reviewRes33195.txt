yep, I've giving Yolk 5 stars. It's just really that good. The service is friendly and efficient, the menu is HUGE so anyone can find something they'll like, the portion are very generous and they brew a spectacular cup of coffee. Whether I'm"m in the mood for something sweet or savory; if I'm feeling like a sinner or a saint (in terms of calories that is) I can always find something to satisfy! I love their Belgian waffle topped with yogurt, granola and fresh fruit. That is such a good pick me up type of meal. They also have a TON of omelet options (all of which you can get with egg whites) that are quite tasty. I've tried their crepes and their pancakes (don't judge, I live a block away!!) and I've loved everything. My husband isn't really a breakfast person and has ordered off of the lunch menu and always is happy with his choice. The other thing I really like about this place is that I've brought everyone from my 8 year old niece to my grandfather and everyone has really enjoyed it. I like that it's a welcoming enough place for anyone to enjoy. Oh, and my sister and parents did catering from Yolk for a "morning after my wedding brunch party," and everyone raved about the food. The catering was on time and reasonably priced.
