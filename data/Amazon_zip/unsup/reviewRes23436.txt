The food here is actually pretty decent and as closest to true sechuan food in Chicago that I've found. Unfortunately it's impossible to enjoy the food when the waiters suck, the tables are cramped, and owner Tony can't control his crew. The waiters are doing a whole lot of wasted busy work while people wait a hour for their food. It doesn't make a difference if you tip $100 or $20 or $0, same bad service. I will never forget one night when the restaurant was busy. Tony was pacing all over the restaurant and looked visibly scared. I had waited for an hour and there were empty tables but no one was cleaning them. He wouldn't look anyone in the eye and talk, even as I tried to get his attention. He then proceeded to wipe clean spoons from a rack. Wtf was that. The reviews from ABC, CBS etc etc are a joke in Chinatown. Every restaurant has a smug picture of a reporter endorsing it. It's too bad I got to hate on the restaurant because I love the food, but service is just that bad. Save your sanity and order take-out.
