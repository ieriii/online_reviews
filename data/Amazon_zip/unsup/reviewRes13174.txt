Well, this location has definitely taken things up a notch. We come here once or twice per month. However, this last visit was different. There were 5 hostesses at the stand. When we approached, ALL of them were smiling. I defy you to find that at almost ANY restaurant, ANYWHERE. We were seated immediately; and, we had not even sat down when I server walked over. This server was new; however, the man had true fine dining skills, from the service to the attentiveness to the pleasantries to the damage control - it turns out that this location no longer makes the peppercorn sauce. The server's name is Javier. We told two managers that the service we received was the best ever; and, as much as we like the place, the other servers could learn from Javier. It would appear that the place is kicking things up a notch, as ALL of the servers returned a social smile. Staff politely moved out of the way if you were walking toward them; and, again, smiles were abundant. While we always enjoy our meal, I know we will be going back to make certain that our particularly good experience was no fluke.
