I like Lao Sze Chuan, don't get me wrong. There have been a couple good meals had here. I just don't get though why this place seems to be so much more popular than partner resaurant Lao Beijing. I realize that I need to stick to the staples of this restaurant- like the Ma Po Tofu, and the lamb in cumin.  Still- I like one of the lamb dishes at Lao Beijing better.
