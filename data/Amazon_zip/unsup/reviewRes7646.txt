this was my first time there. i had to call everybody in my cell phone to tell them what a great place this was. the meat was seasoned to perfection. it was cooked to perfection. the servers were awesome!!. i never had to wait for anything not even a clean plate when one of my plates were too full to hold any more meat. i could not eat fast enough. my stomach is too small. i was wondering why i never heard of this place . whatever fogo de chao is doing please keep doing it. you are a magnificient place to eat, very resonable prices, the atmosphere was pleasant, the service is magnificent.!!!!! the dishes were clean , the utensils did not have water spots!! the owner/greeter was personally magnificient, friendly and funny. thank you for a wonderful time and i did not mind paying for it!!! also , i did not want to leave out the person who opened our car door at the curb when we got dropped off. you know what it takes to provide class and service.
