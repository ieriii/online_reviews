I honestly do not understand why so many people rave about this place. There is SOOO much better pizza in Chicago. This is probably at the bottom of my lists as far as deep dish goes. I give it two stars because there are many locations, and was able to get it quickly when I lived in Logan Square (where your choices are very limited). Every time I order deep dish from here, it either comes out overcooked or being scarce on the sauce. The only thing I will ever get here is the thin crust as that is not too bad.
