Went here very last minute on Saturday night and left very impressed. Granted, it was a beautiful 73 degrees with a slight breeze and we were able to snag an outdoor table, so I could have been eating a wendy's jr. bacon cheeseburger and been impressed. That being said, made a reservation in the early evening for 8 PM. Got there a few minutes late and they told us it would be 10-15 minute wait for an outdoor seat, and it was no more than 10. The outdoor section is really nice with a line of tables right on the side street but very quiet and great ambiance. We decided to make our own little 3 course meal and started with a caprese salad which was very well constructed. On that note, I think I started saying 'well constructed' regarding food after watching a little too much Top Chef this past winter and it really makes me feel quite intellectual even though I generally have no clue what I am talking about. Anyway, next course was this light pasta dish with a lemon butter sauce absolutely stuffed with scallops. And I mean stuffed. We were splitting everything so I assumed we would get 2 each but there were 12-15 large scallops in here, perfectly cooked in an incredible sauce. This was a 5 star dish and was a huge portion. We ended with veal saltimbocca which was good, not great but also large portion and the veal itself was well cooked. We had a bottle of the house reisling which was decently priced and it really was a surprisingly nice meal. Were too stuffed for dessert but had a coffe and espresso which were nice. Overall, this place really surprised me and the pasta dish with scallops was one of the best dishes I have had in a long time.  Check this place out, make sure to sit outside, and order that dish, and you will not be dissapointed.
