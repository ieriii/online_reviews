My husband and I took my new mother-in-law to this place two days ago. I had heard good things about this place from a few people who said that it was a must-see, that it was high-class. Well, I was not impressed. The place was dirty. The first thing we noticed was the floor was sticky. When we were seated, we noticed that the spoon and at least two plates had dried up food on them. We told the waiter who nonchalantly apologized. I was humiliated. We wanted to take my mother-in-law to a nice, upscale place but instead we got nasty plates and utensils. I would never go back to this place and would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
