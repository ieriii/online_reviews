This place doesn't take reservations. Expect a wait about an hour on a Tuesday evening. They do have a cocktail waitress outside taking drink orders while you wait. Unfortunately, it took 30 mins for the waitress to bring me a beer menu. Ended up getting my beer delivered to the table. We were so hunger that we ordered everything that looks good. -roasted beets with goat cheese and pistachio: this is a delicious dish where the components complement each other very well. -roasted bone marrow: too greasy and not enough other elements to balance the dish. -fried pigs ear: this dish needed a sauce on the pigs ear. All the flavor was on the veggies. -uni scramble egg: I would stick to raw uni over cooked. I felt like the egg was overpowering the the great flavor of uni. -fried sweetbread: This was likely one of my favorites along with the beets. It came with a nice apricot jam/chutney. -Milk braised pork shoulder: the meat was tender but the sauce was very rich. I was also so full from the other dishes. There's definitely more thing on the menu I would try.
