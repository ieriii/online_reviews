You know when you get ready to go out and you catch your reflection in the mirror and say "damn, i'm hot tonight"? Don't waste that night on any place other than Victor Hotel. It's perfect. Its big and small. Its bright and intimate. It's sexy and industrial. I've no idea how they did it. But they made opposites fuse and the amalgamation is hot. (not to mention the crowd)
