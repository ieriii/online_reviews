The details are well-documented, but to recap: insanely long way, and they won't take reservations for a party of less than ten. Insanely loud, although when we went, some club called the Black Hawks was engaging in some sort of televised sporting activity involving sticks and roller blades, which seemed to spur additional noise. But the pizza is amazing and the on-site brewed beer is pretty damn good too. Pizzas we tried: - The white pizza with fresh tomatoes and basil. HIGHLY recommended. Having recently been to Pepe's in New Haven, I thought Piece held its own. - The red pizza with pepperoni and mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes? I know, right? But damn if it doesn't all work somehow. My guess is that pepperoni inhabits a similar place on the food spectrum as bacon, which is great with potatoes so I think that's where the magic happens. I went in thinking "Wait a minute! You can't mix tomatoes and potatoes! Let's call the whole thing off!" (heh) But then I thought "Hey idiot, what about gnocchi? Idiot." I am always mentally calling myself an idiot. I don't know why I put up with the abuse. I should have left me a long time ago. I should call out that the service was fast and attentive. And very sympathetic and helpful regarding the long wait. I showed up an hour early to put in for a table, and I got an hour of amazing brew-pub beer and free wi-fi so I won't complain. My only caveat is that you may want to check the sporting events schedule before planning an outing.
