What's the big deal? Food was adequate. It would have to be a great deal better to be worth waiting an hour and then having the check slapped on your table as unsubtle encouragement to move on as soon as possible. Also, if you order the chocolate death tower french toast (or whatever it's called), be advised that you're essentially eating half a chocolate cake for breakfast. Is this acceptable?
