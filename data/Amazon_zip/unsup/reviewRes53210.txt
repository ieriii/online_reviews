I love this place! Located just block from my apartment, 90 mile doesn't disappoint! Service is friendly, food is tasty, BYOB makes it easy on the wallet, and the tostones are awesome! I love the garlic shrimp. Had a swordfish special the other day and that was good too. Love the indoor/outdoor patio also! Check it out!
