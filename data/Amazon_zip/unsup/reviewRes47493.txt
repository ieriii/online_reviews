I normally like this place for great food and the fact that they usually play concert videos. However, oftentimes when there is a sports game on, they don't play music. This bothers me because if I wanted sports I would go to a sports bar with every other" normal" person out there. For me, I like lockdown for the music and I wish they wouldn't turn it into a stupid sports bar for the jerk wearing the jersey. I'm a musician not a foozball player
