Oh, so delicious! I never have a problem getting in, but it's always busy... and did I mention the deliciousness?The pistachio crusted chicken is my favorite entree... add a mojito and I'd eat there daily if my liver and arteries would allow it.No one should ever need to convince you to eat here... you should just jump at the opportunity. It's right near the Irving Park Brown Line stop... so once that opens up again, make Cafe 28 your first destination.
