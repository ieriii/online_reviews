It's a given that the outdoor space here is hands-down fantastic! However, I need to base my reviews on the food. I had the Carciofini salad as an appetizer (baby artichokes with arugla and shaved parmesan) to start. The ingredients were fresh, but it tasted like the artichokes were steeped in balsamic vinegar, which overpowered the delicate flavors of the ingredients. For the main, I had the Farro di Stracci pasta. I thought the Farro pasta would be a nice change from the standard semolina, but the pasta was almost gummy and under-seasoned. I don't even think the pasta water had been salted. Service was a touch scarce and the hostess was able to squeeze in a large party finto the garden without reservations. All in all a good place and I would go back, especially for the outdoor dining. However, the food was a touch disappointing. I'll definitely give it another shot, though.
