Just returned from Costa Rica, addicted to the food - and NUEVO LEON broke my addiction:) WOW. Basically, you pay for your beverages, & get a humungous, delicious ENTREE FOR FREE! They even made me something NOT on the menu when I mentioned a dish I love. Gets my vote for the BEST MEXICAN FOOD in Chicago. Can't wait to try everything ON the menu! (And though my husband thought it was 'risky' parking his 'baby' there, hey, there WAS parking - totally SAFE, too).
