Here are a couple things I experienced during my first visit at IRAZU...... 1. The waiter, which seemed bored and uninspired, took about 30 minutes to ask us about drinks and appetizers. 2. Food took over an hour and a half to get to our table. We finished an entire bottle of wine. I had to run over to the wine shop across the street for another bottle. 3. While waiting forever for our food, I glanced into the kitchen and saw the wait staff eating dessert and cracking jokes..........in my head im like WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE? 4. Food was cold and mediocre. My fucking Siamese cat can cook up better steak and veggies. 5. Towards the end of our meal one of the food runners was screaming that the shake machine was about to get shut down for the night. He obnoxiously approached every table accosting people into buying a shake. I dont know what scam their trying to pull here. Why the fuck would you turn off your shake machine at a certain time? Overall, IRAZU is just a shitty low quality low service joint that every byob turd runs to because they dont know better costa rican food. Dont settle for the minimum people.
