How have I not reviewed this!? It's my neighborhood Cuban spot. BYOB. In the winter it was awesome to come to the back patio and sit either on high chairs or normal tables. It's a nice atmosphere, low key, can be romantic, huge painting on the back patio wall, old typewriters where you can leave a message. They're all about customer interaction--the wall by their restrooms is tagged by all sorts of customers leaving appreciative notes. Now that the summer is here, I drive by this place everyday from work, and the huge sunny patio in the front is open again and it's usually nicely filled with couples, singles, or groups. I like the Ropa Vieja at this place, and the steak and chicken as well. They give you very good portions, the prices are great, everything works. When you first walk in here, the smells attack you, and if you drive by, it's luring. Have never had an issue with service either. BTW I heard you can take RUM since it's BYOB and they'll do the mojitos for you at no charge. AWESOME!
