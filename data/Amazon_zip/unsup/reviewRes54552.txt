I guess the rents must be high, because Sultan Market is also charging a lot for food! I didn't eat, I just took a couple bites off my friends lamb kebab. The lamb was juicy and perfectly seasoned. There were plently of vegetables and rice and a whole grilled tomato served with his kebab. He also got naan and lots of different yogurts and sauces to try with it. I only ordered hot tea, which turned out to be just a lipton tea bag, my friend got iced tea..both were $1.99 and no refills. So it cost almost $20 for 1 person to eat...too much.
