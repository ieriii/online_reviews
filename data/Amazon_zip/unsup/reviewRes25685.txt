I will be honest- I ate at The Melting Pot in San Diego a week before coming here and I couldn't help but to compare the two. Geja's is probably THE most romantic restaurant I've been to. Atmosphere alone is worth going. I'm giving this place 4 stars because atmosphere and service were 5 stars, but food (for a fondue place) was probably a 3. Solid restaurant, but compared to the Melting Pot there was just no selection. Only one type of cheese (that was kinda weird...), one plain salad, only one type of chocolate (whaa???! no choices of dark chocolate or regular milk chocolate or to add peanut butter dark chocoate??). Though pricey, i do think the value is well worth the cost- I mean, c'mon, you get 4 courses of fun! The food was very good as were the dipping sauces, but I didn't like that Geja's uses all oils for dipping whereas Melting Pot feels lighter and easier on the stomach the next morning by using broth-like liquids to cook the food in. If you're going for the classic experience and to impress a girl, you can't go wrong. If you want a little bit more selection of cheeses, salads and desserts, do Melting Pot.
