Pequod's is our favorite local deep dish pizza, no doubt. Their crust is amazing as they somehow incorporate crispy onions into it. We also love the Pequod's salad. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I take all of my visitors to Pequods as opposed to the more touristy Gino's or Giordano's.
