Yum, yum, yummmmmm!! I originally had reservations at Frontera but a friend told me to skip Frontera and go to Xoco instead. So glad I listened to him. The line was at the door so we waited around 30 minutes before we ordered and maybe another 10 for a table. They don't let you order until a table is free. My girlfriends and I are three little piggies so we ordered: - chipotle chicken torta: so good! the bread was nice and crispy, and torta overall was really tasty. the sauce on the side goes really well with it and adds an extra kick of flavor. - ahogado torta: this was my second favorite of the three tortas we ordered. i loved the concept of the torta in a broth because it softens the bread and the pork was a little dry so it added some extra moisture. something very comforting about this dish, it's probably the tomato broth. - pepito torta: this was pretty good too! the short rib was tender and full of flavor. - pork belly vermicelli: this was definitely not what i was expecting. it says vermicelli noodles but it was soba noodles. the broth was a little bland but the pork belly was good. i probably wouldn't order this again. - guacamole and two salsas: all really good. Overall, my gfs and I really enjoyed this place and wanted to come back during our short visit there. Luckily, there's one in the airport so we got to have our fix one last time before leaving the windy city.
