Went here on tuesday and probably the reason another yelper's table was not ready. Food was amazing as always. The current menu is the best so far. Desserts were perfect! Cherry covered chocolate and bloody mary were amazing. I am going to be very sad the day I do not get the quail egg ravioli. So far that day has not come. The first time I went to schwa was in 2008, Left a message (one message) and received a call back. Its not a complex system. Did the same thing this time and got a reservation for 6pm on a tuesday night. This was my second choice but you need to be flexible. Anytime I go back to visit chicago Schwa is on the top of my list of places I need to go.
