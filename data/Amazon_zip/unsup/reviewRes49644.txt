How does one describe this experience? Its like having very great sex with someone that annoys the shit out of you. Listen, there is no question that their food is good. Its hearty colombian fare with large portions and great flavor. The Entrana is low cost flank steak that they craft in something that tastes like a $45 filet. The empanadas are to die for and it's BYOB. The service is probably the worst I've ever seen in Chicago. We had to go up to the hostess four different times to make sure they wrote our name down on the list. Finally she did and we got seated an hour later. Once seated, we didn't see a server for 45 minutes. It's BYOB, so of course we are drinking and enjoying ourselves, but we had to go find someone to take our order.  Again, once we did get our food it was hot and tasty, but were angry when were eating it. May as well try it out, but at 5pm on a Monday.
