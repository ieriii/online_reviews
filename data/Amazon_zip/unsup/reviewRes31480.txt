I am in love with this place! I had the baked chilaquiles (made by Nana herself, no less) - unbelievably flavorful. A perfect combination of texture, sweet, spice...the list goes on. Even the eggs were farm fresh. You can tell by the beautiful color of the yolks. It is clear that they did not skimp on a damn thing. Metropolis coffee to wake the palate first, of course. The space is gorgeous inside and out. Hand carved wood, white trim, brass (or copper - i always get them confused) lights hang low and inviting over the front bar. Some places have a lot of heart, and this is clearly one of them. The owners were all over the restaurant, talking with people that they had known their whole lives. Apparently they grew up upstairs the restaurant. I am excited to see such a bright light in a neighborhood that truly needed what they are offering. Heck yeah. Well done fellahs.
