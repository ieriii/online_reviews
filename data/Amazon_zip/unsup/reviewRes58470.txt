I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in Chicago here. First and most importantly if you are going to eat here, request a table in the back room. If you get stuck at one of the restaurant tables by the bar, you will not be able to have a single conversation all night. So after being stuck at one of these loud tables, one of our party was also spilled on (because they tables are really jammed in there with little room for waiters to move). When we complained to the manager a group of 4 men and two women (one who does not drink), were offered pink champagne as the apologetic response. Needless to say only 1/6 would actually drink the pink champagne. The food by no means made up for the atmosphere or service, it was nothing special.
