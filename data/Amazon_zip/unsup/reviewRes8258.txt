Meat heaven. Wow. Delicious. Wonderful. Green circle. Go. I've been to Fogo more at least twice, maybe more evenings. Who knows. There is this...carnivore coma that takes over when you've eaten more than two pounds of perfectly cooked animal flesh that changes the chemical makeup of your brain. For the better. The first time I came to Fogo was with a group of about a dozen people & we spent most of the money we had. The next time was for a birthday. What a night. But as much fun as I was having it didn't match these big burly dudes that came in like it was WWF Raw! lifting their arms yelling "Whoo!" like they just defeated Hulk Hogan or The Rock. The food at this Brazilian steakhouse is delight. The service is top notch. I especially loved the anything bacon-wrapped. Using a green "go" /red "stop" circled drink coaster system to drink over specially trained South American cowboy waiters to slice off choice pieces of meat. Yeah. This is meat heaven.
