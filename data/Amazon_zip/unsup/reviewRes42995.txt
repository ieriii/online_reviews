It's a shame they have good pizza because I can never ever order from here again. I cannot tolerate interacting with A-holes of this caliber. In fact, the thought of talking to their phone guy again makes me want to punch a hold through something. He was too busy cutting me off every chance he could to get my order right. And as I was trying to explain the confusing buzzer situation at our building he abruptly cut me off and said "if our driver can't deliver your pizza because he can't find your unit it's not our fault." The guy was too busy using his tone of voice to let me know just how much he hated his job to actually do his job. Being treated like I'm somehow inconveniencing him by calling to spend $40 on pizza really isn't worth the taste. We'll just have to order from one of the thousand other pizza places in the neighborhood. Art of Pizza, we will not miss you.
