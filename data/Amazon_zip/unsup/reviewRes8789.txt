I took my parents there a few months ago. They are big time foodies and they loved it. The pizza is as close as you can get to Napoli. Spaca meaning poor in Italian will have you feeling poor after you leave, yes it is pretty pricey but worth it. Mozzarella di Bufala is not cheap along with real Prosiutto di Parma. The oven they use is from Italy which is great. The best thing however was we waited in line for about 20 min to get a table then the owner kept bringing out samples of pizza cheese and wine to the people waiting which was awesome. Our server was great although she had to look at the specials board to remember what was on special ( forgivable). the other great thing was the Bresaola with ruccola and parmigiano
