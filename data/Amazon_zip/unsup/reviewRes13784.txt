One word: Tostones. If you don't know what they are then you won't even know when they are done right. Had daily special: Bistec with Tostones and a salad. The salad was blah but as expected. The steak was really good, the cut of meat was bad but however they cooked it made it better. Wish I would have had it in a sandwich instead of covered in grilled onions but now I know better.... Wanted an order of Tostones to go....yes, they are that good.
