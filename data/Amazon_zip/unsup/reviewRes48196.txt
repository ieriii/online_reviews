The restaurant has a great interior. We walked in for an early Saturday night dinner without a reservation and ate at the bar - very pleasant service and experience.The main compliment is the awesome, extensive drink menu. Sampled variety of Belgian beers and also enjoyed a Lambic mixed with cider. Really liked the Maison des Futailles, "Sortilege" (canadian whiskey with maple syrup). Minor complaint that they were out of a few drinks listed on their menu that we asked for. Loved the oysters - I preferred West Coast and my husband preferred East Coast. The other dishes we tried were also good: ham, mussels, suckling pig, waffle dessert. Would return again.
