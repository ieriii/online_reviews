Visited Chicago for the very first time in my life on December 02 -04, 2011. You could not go wrong with this hotel. Hyatt Regency Chicago is very close to everything like the shopping on Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, the river, Marilyn Monroe statue, and so much more. It's all a walking distance. There are pictures that I uploaded for reference of what the inside looks like. It's spacious and the customer service provided was spectacular from the beginning to the end. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Chicago. The rate I had was $150/day which is not bad at all. It's beautiful inside and out and kept traffic moving so everyone can arrive and leave faster. Great service!
