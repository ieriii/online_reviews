I don't think the wait here is that bad and I love that there is so much seating. The staff is so efficient. There is a huge variety on the menu and everything I've had I've liked. Really good breakfast potatoes and the orange bread french toast is ridiculous. This place puts in me in a food comain the best way. And it's across the street from Grant Park so you can just nap in the grass after you binge.
