I've been to all of the Brazilian steakhouses in downtown Chicago and this is how I feel Texas de Brazil compares. Fogo de Chao has better meat and service. Brazzaz has a better salad bar, hot dishes, mashed potatoes, and bread. Texas de Brazil has the best fried plaintains and miscellaneous buffet items (soups and sushi). I wouldn't say its a huge waste of money, but I won't be back for a while if not ever. Ambiance/Service- 4 stars Food- 3 stars Value- 2 stars
