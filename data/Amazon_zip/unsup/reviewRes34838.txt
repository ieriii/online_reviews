been going for a few years to both locales. really great place for quick good food, large variety of fixins at salad bar. nice space nice location. most items are moderately priced but its easy for all that yummy food to add up to 13 bucks a person. specially after all the regional snacks, desserts and beverages, but the tap water is cool and free! some clown left to visit a J.A. steakhouse b/c no chicken soup on weekends, just lentil. just so you know...different strokes for all folks
