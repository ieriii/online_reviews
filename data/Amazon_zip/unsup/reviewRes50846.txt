I took my wife here a few weeks ago (sorry for the delayed review!) and we had the a really great time. Which kind of makes it hard to be a good reviewer, but I'll do my best to dissect everything: 1. Menu - the menu item all looked really good but the specials were really too amazing to pass up. All had really decent price points 2. the food - how in the world can you pass up anything that has deep fried mash potatoes. WHOA! Those were awesome. err... what I got to eat of them - my wife kept stealing them. Next time, I'm going to order a side of them for her, so I get to savor my own :-) 3. The service - our waiter was really really good. Professional - Polite but personable, made excellent recommendations, and was fast and efficient. - it's clear to the eye that this place is well managed in all aspects. Loved this place and I look forward to coming back!
