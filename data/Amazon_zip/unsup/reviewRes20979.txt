Yes, FINALLY. I get to see what all the fuss is about. We didn't waste (many hours) waiting for table. Pick up and off to our favorite bar - thank-you-very-much. Everything was DELICIOUS - particularly the chorizo with pickled veggies (terrific). The Cuban is also great as is the Pibil. Hot (Aztec) chocolate makes you wonder why you ever wasted your time with creme brulee or flourless chocolate...  Bayless is a the man. Now if we can just resurrect that cookware line :)
