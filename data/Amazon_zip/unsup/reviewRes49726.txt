I had the steak and maduros at the Taste two years in a row so the last time I was in the neighborhood I decided to give the restaurant a try. I ordered the empanda appetizer and the steak entree with maduros. I also wanted rice and beans but if I remember correctly, I had to order those seperately. This was a disappointment to me because the entree was already quite pricey. When the food came, the portions were large so this did offset some of the sticker shock in my mind, but I was still hung up on having to pay extra for the rice and beans. The food was delicious and the ambiance is dark and romantic in a rustic South American sort of way. I would definitely return but next time ready to spend $40 on my meal (without drinks). Summary: The food is great but I think there are other Colombian places in this city with good food for half the price, albeit with less time and money spent on ambiance.
