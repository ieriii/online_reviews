I love me some Coast. I've been here twice and both were great experiences. The second time was with a party of 6. We ordered a variety of appetizers, sushi & desert. Coast did an amazing job bringing the food out seperately. As soon as we were done with one plate another would come out a minute later. It let the table really enjoy each different appetizer & roll. The food is amazing, but the fact that Coast is BYOB really seals the deal. I will be back again soon!
