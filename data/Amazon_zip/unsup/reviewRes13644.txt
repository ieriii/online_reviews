I make it out to revolution at least once a month. I take the blue line, which is rapidly becoming the brew line with all the breweries popping up. Finally the upstairs is open, so the long waits for a taste of the nectar of the goods is not an issue. Formally, on Friday or Saturday night the wait was often over an hour. So now that the upstairs is open, with tons of seating that is a non issue. The staff is awesome, and the beer is always good. I would recommend getting something dark on draft, which is what Revolution in my opinion does best. If you want something a little more sophisticated for your palate, hop on the blue line and go to Haymarket Brewery. The brew master there is always hanging out, singing and mingling with the guests. I have been to Revolution plenty of times, and have never had the brew master come out and say hello. Anyways, the beer is good, the food is good and the service is consistently good.
