Finally made it to The Purple Pig last night and I definitely enjoyed myself. Firstly, I was happy to discover that although this place is downtown and has delicious food it is not hoity toity which I appreciate! It had a bustling but down to earth vibe. Secondly, we went on a Monday night and had to wait about 45 minutes. I cannot image what a wait would look like on Friday or Saturday. They do serve drinks to people while they are waiting which is nice. Finally, the food, was good, better than good. Especially the jowl. Oh man! it was gooooood. The cheese was delicious. The pork gravy was okay - nothing I haven't had something similar to other places. The pate was different and good. The dessert (we had the chocolate lemon thing) was fine but nothing I would need to have again.  Overall, I would say go here prepared to wait, drink and then eat some goodness (in that order). Side note: This is definitely more in the $50/person (especially with drinks) price range rather than $20.
