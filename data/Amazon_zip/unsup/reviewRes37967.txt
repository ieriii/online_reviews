Beware - its CROWDED on a weekday evening! I've been wanting to check this place out for quite sometime now and yesterday I finally had the will power to hop into 22 and get here for a date night with my husband. Since he was a little late (as usual) I got to explore the area. Such cute stores, bars and restaurants int he neighborhood that I already have plans of going to a couple of restaurants nearby. Finally when we went inside the bar area was packed and the bartender was kind enough to inform us that we need to go deeper inside, find a waitress, give our names and wait for a table. 40 minute wait time on a weekday... but I was not complaining as I was determined to try at least a couple of beers from their extensive list. The patio is so cool that you almost feel like you're there to attend an awesome house party. Looking at the young crowd, for a minute I thought someone's gonna start playing beer pong. Anyways, we decided to stick to the Belgian ales. The Dekoninck, Tripel Karmeleit were amazing but the Kwak (the beer served in a round-bottomed glass... like the ones in a Chemistry lab!) was a little too strong and earthy for my taste but my husband enjoyed it. When we were seated, even though it was loud I kinda felt the vibe to be very romantic or may be I just have the world's best husband ever :) The limited veggie options are great. We knew exactly what we wanted. The Summer veggie tart was delicious. The grilled abalone mushroom was complex as it was tasty only when you ate all the elements of the plate in one bite. The best part of our dinner, the CB&J... All the rave reviews about this sandwich is justified. However, I have to say that the Mac & Cheese, though delectable is not the best I've tasted.
