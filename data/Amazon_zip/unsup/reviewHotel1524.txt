4.5 I was pretty concerned about my stay after reading unfavorable reviews, but our stay was surprisingly very pleasant! We took advantage of the Groupon offer ($110 a night for a standard 2-queen bed room). The service was fast AND friendly. The location was amazing. The room was HUGEE (for comparison, it was about the same size or even slightly bigger than our 1 bedroom suite at the Intercontinental Chicago). The furnishing was relatively nice too, MUCH better than I anticipated (no ugly yellow checker-board pattern to my delight!) The only minus that prevents this from getting a 5 star is the horribly worn out bathroom. Our room was pleasant, but our bathroom was not. It's extremely old and worn out. Pro: VERY spacious room. You would not find a room this big ANYWHERE in Chicago for this price point. Con: Furnishing may not be up-to-par with other boutique hotels, but I personally think that the very spacious room easily makes up for that. It really comes down to decor VS. space. You could either choose another boutique hotel with amazing decor but small space or Hotel 71 with lots of space and a nice, but not amazing, decor.
