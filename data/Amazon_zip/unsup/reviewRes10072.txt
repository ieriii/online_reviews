A fun atmosphere, but not the best for a big group. We went here for my husband's birthday dinner with a small group of friends. In total, there were 7 of us. We tried calling for reservations - no dice. You need at least 10 people for a weekend reservation (it was a Saturday night), and apparently, the reservations book up months in advance. So, my husband and I got there about 5:45, hoping to secure a table by 6:30. When we got there, we were told the wait would be an hour. It was so crowded inside that there was nowhere to stand. We waited outside. After about half an hour, we were told our table was ready. Well, not everyone was there yet. They usually won't seat a party unless everyone is there, but we sat down with only 4 members of our group there. We were seated in the back, by the speakers, and by the huge, open, pizza oven. Needless to say, it was hot and oh so noisy. We were also next to the bar, so we had random people using a part of our table to set down drinks. At one point, a couple even asked if one of the chairs at our table was taken. Really? We're sitting down to eat. You want to join our party? The pizza came out pretty quickly for how busy it was. Our waiter was super nice, and the beer was very good. With the atmosphere the way it was, we didn't linger too long. It's OK if you know what to expect - long wait, big crowds, very noisy. Be warned.
