One of the best meals I've eaten in Chicago. We had: Foie Gras with Hot chocolate: One of the richest dishes we've eaten and a perfect combination of flavors. We had to take breathers in between bites! Marrow Bones: Awesome. So good I was scraping the bones long after we'd gotten all the marrow. =P Wild Boar Sloppy Joe: Great flavor, just the right hint of spicy. Venison steak: Cooked perfectly and delicious. Bittersweet "Manjari" Chocolate Tart, Bourbon Tapioca, Malt Cream: One of my favorite desserts. So rich though, that we had to take more than half home to finish later! The Kentucky Colonel I had to drink was also mixed very well. The only downside to this place is that it seems like it's always busy. We got there at 5:30 on a Sunday and were the last people to get seated right away. Too bad they don't take reservations! There's a parking lot right across the street, so don't fret about the lack of street parking in the area.
