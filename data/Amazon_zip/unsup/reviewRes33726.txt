The food is excellent here and the service is too! The best testimonial for this place is the line that is always formed that always flows over to outside. But don't let the wait scare you, it moves pretty quick...and it's definitely worth the wait! - The skillets are awesome (steak especially) - The crepes are also frickin great!
