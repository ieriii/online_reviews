I really liked the Publican. I always get nervous when places are super hyped up but the joint did not disappoint. I had anxiety with the beer list, I'm more of a wine person, but the server helped me pick a few different ones to try that I ended up really enjoying. I know this place is known for their pork, and I enjoyed the pork, I even tried pork rinds for the first time! However, the dover sole was PERFECT! Do not miss that. Our server was really knowledgeable although I thought he tried to up-sell us on a few things (with all the food we ordered, we should have ordered the 1/2 chicken and he told us we needed the whole). A+ for the atmosphere. I felt much cooler than I am hanging out there.
