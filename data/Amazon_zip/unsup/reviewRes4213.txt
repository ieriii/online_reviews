Just a crazy good experience. I had been to Alinea a couple weeks before. Comparing them is apples to oranges but I had more fun at Schwa. While I feel a bit sad and lonely that we did not get the quail egg ravioli that everyone raves about, the scallop noodles with pork belly that Michael was "messing around with" could have been the best thing I have tasted at either restaurant. Wow. Already plotting a strategy to return.
