I went to piece with my husband and a friend on Superbowl Sunday. We didn't go to celebrate or to watch the game. We wanted pizza and I work just a few blocks from this place.  We got two of the biggest pizzas and some PBR. Points for serving PBR, by the way, and more points for keeping it cheap. My pizza, at which they scoffed until they tried it, was barbecue sauce with mashed potatoes, roasted red peppers, and red onions.  It was delicious. They went a little heavy on the cheese for my tastes, but that seems to be a common thing in Chicago. Maybe midwesterners like cheese more than southerners. I don't know. The guys ordered white sauce with clams, bacon, and artichoke hearts. Their pizza was good, but mine was voted to be better. The food was pretty reasonably priced-- we spent about $50 for three beers and two ginormous pizzas. The table next to us kept commenting about how we ordered too much. We only had about six slices left when we stopped eating. Each of us could've eaten more, but we all had the same complaint: The roofs of our mouths were raw. It wasn't only because we were so hungry upon arrival that we burned them with the lava-hot cheese. The crust tore up our mouths. That's my major complaint about this joint. Service was great-- our girl gave us some suggestions and wasn't at all overbearing. She refilled our drinks when necessary, took our orders in a timely manner, and left us alone when we didn't need anything. I'm not sure whether we'll make a special trip to go back to Piece, but if we're craving some mashed potato pizza and we're in the area, we know where to go.
