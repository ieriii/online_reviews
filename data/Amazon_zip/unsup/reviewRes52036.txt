After posting a blurb about Giordano's on Facebook, I was immediately challenged to also eat at Geno's East before giving my deep dish pizza heart away. So after a Chicago Architectural Boat Cruise, the wife and I went to See what all the fuss was about. We liked the vibe of the place better. We liked the service a lot better. We loved the beer selection. We just didn't like the pizza better which counts the most. And the biggest difference was the freshness if the ingredients. My wife's spinach was still frozen in places and looked of the Green Giant variety. Very disappointing given the rest of our experience. Two stars for the pizza, completely due the lack of freshness (I liked the rest of the pie). 5 stars for everything else. 3 stars total.
