We must've had 8 courses of food and they were all good. It's a good thing this place serves tapa portions so that I could enjoy the different courses. My favorite for the night was the Milk Braised Pork Shoulders. Thank you fellow Yelpers! We had one delicious portion and then the kitchen though we didn't get our order so they brought another portion. The waiter realized the mistake after we told the runner but he still insisted that we keep it and just didn't charge us. What service! My husband said he enjoyed everything but LOVED the espresso soft serve ice cream with a shot of espresso. It apparantly hit the spot and brought him out of his food coma.  The only two things that I was disappointed about was how tight the place was, especially the individual tables, and the fact that they ran out of of an appetizer that I wanted to try. I guess we'll just have to visit again.
