I got a gift certificate for Anteprima for my birthday. It took me forever to use it despite the fact that the restaurant is walking distance from my house. When I looked at their menu online, I had to look up a number of ingredients because I had no idea what the foods were--and I write menus for a living. The food just sounded intimidating. Once I finally got around to going over there, I kicked myself for waiting so long. Delicious! Delicious, I tell you! Risotto, to die for... super creamy and perfectly seasoned. I had a shrimp dish as well and loved the flavor, but hated the fact that the shells and little legs were still on them... very difficult to eat in polite company. All the desserts we shared at the table were quite good too...not always the case at many restaurants. I will return!
