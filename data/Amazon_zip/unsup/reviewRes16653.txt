Lamely, my friends and I went here without first knowing that you're supposed to get a name on the list by stopping by before you intend on going during those Friday/Saturday primo hours--especially if you have a larger group (parties of 2 seem to get in fairly easily as there seems always to be a couple open seats at the bar). There isn't really a line outside not b/c you'll automatically be granted entry, but because they'll take your name + number and call you when there is space available. We gave them our info and waited by the phone with bated breath. They called. It was worth it. Highly recommended: Dark & Stormy (ginger!), El Diablo (ginger + spice!), Golden Age (subtle and delicious), Iron Cross (perfumy loveliness), Hotel Nacional (beachy), Southside (classic gin drink), Amaretto Fizz (dessert) The drinks are phenomenal. They take an artesian approach, concocting their own grenadine and whatnot. Our ex-bartending friend agrees that the drinks are deeeeelicious. Ahh, LOVE! milk and honey of nyc fame comes to chicago. Clever. Sit by the bar if you've got just a few of you. Make friends with the bartenders. Watch them at their finest hour. Feel cheated for having paid more than $10 for sh*tty cocktails everywhere else.
