Amazing food and service! I took my mom and she loved it. I think I like this location better than the Lakeview location. The Lakeview one has a slightly unwashed-hipster feel to it (or maybe it's my general disgust with urinals; that smell just follows you out the door). I had the crunchy chicken and it was positively amazing. I could, quite frankly, eat their sweet potato fries all night. My lack of one star is the price to food amount ratio. The prices are a bit high and the portions are a bit small. But man, you can taste the freshness.
