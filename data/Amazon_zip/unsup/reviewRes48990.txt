I have enjoyed three meals at The Publican this year and they were all outstanding. Great service with knowledgeable wait staff that's ready with beer recommendations. My favorite is the sweatbreads, nicely sauteed with a crispy carmelized skin. I also enjoyed the pork belly, nicely flavored with plenty of fat. Excellent bread, and make sure to indulge in the Chef's Choice of oysters. Cool atmosphere, much like a Public house. The booths are interesting, kind of like a mini pig pen. Neat concept.
