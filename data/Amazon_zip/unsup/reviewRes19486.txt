Wow is the food great here. We sat at the bar and service was a little slow, despite the bar not being crowded (we were there around 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon), so if that was a tad more to my expectations I would have given it a 5 star rating.  We split the cheese fondue with wilted spinach. It's a perfect balance of cheesiness and saltiness, with the crusty bread with a nice brush of olive oil. Yum. I could have stopped the meal here and been totally satisfied. My friend had the pickle & olive assortment, which is uncomplicated but delicious. I had the steak sandwich, and it was HUGE. I had to eat it with a fork & knife because the cheese dripping off the side would make it impossible to pick up and eat delicately. Not that I'm delicate. But still. It was cooked to my preference and tasted super good. The fries were so-so, nothing special. The husband and I split a side order of the roasted potatoes with blue cheese, and they were to die for. We practically fought for the last bite. His beef brisket was very good, with greens and slices of apple as a counterpoint to the heaviness of the beef. The bar menu is extensive, with a good mix of local, domestic, and foreign brews, as well as some decent wines. We stuck with beer and were satisfied. I thought the prices were a little high (notably the potato side dishes), but not overly inflated. For what we ate and drank it was definitely fair. I thought the ladies room was cute, and the sinks are really cool (I've been watching a lot of HGTV lately). A nice touch was the scented soaps and lotions they provide. I just didn't like having to go downstairs for the bathroom after 3 beers, but they do provide an elevator for those of us who aren't particularly graceful. I will definitely be back!
