As far as deep dish pizza goes, Giordano's is absolute tops. The flavors are outstanding, with a great crust and sauce that compliments the flavor well. Portions are perfect, with not too much sauce or too much cheese, its nice when you're not being smacked over the head by an overdose of a particular flavor. The service at Giordano's is significantly better than the other big pizza chains. Even when its really busy, as it always is, it seems like we're well attended to and treated very well. The biggest problem with Giordano's is that there is always a wait of at least an hour or more, unless you get there for lunch right when they open. They won't take reservations, so you have to wait around all night for it, so its not something I frequent. But if you want the best deep dish pizza around, Giordano's is the place to go, if you can stand the wait.
