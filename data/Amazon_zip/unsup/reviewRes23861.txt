Authentic food, great wines and atmosphere, free parking. I have been here twice, once with a large group and once with my fiancee, and have enjoyed the experience both times. Super friendly staff from the moment you walk in the door, to the wait stuff, and all the way to the valet guys who bring your car promptly almost to the door. I am keeping one star, because the last time we asked for the fresh, whole fish we were told they were out of it - a must have, especially for an ethnic place such as the Greek Islands, hint hint!!!!
