Trying to impress your date? Try again. Trying to have a delicious, budget-friendly meal in a fun part of LP? DONE. Try the Penne Puttanesca and Bruschetta. Both great. I also like the Pollo Farfalle without the chicken and the Mac and Cheese (to die for!!!). Literally, if you eat it too much it will clog your arteries and you will die. But a few times in the winter ain't too bad. If you're planning to drive, godspeed. The parking sitch is terrible but two legs and a bus will get you there right on time.
