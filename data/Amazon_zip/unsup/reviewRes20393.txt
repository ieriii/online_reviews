very well-prepared sushi and sashimi with a beautiful crowd. coast is a great date place. they have a good selection of sushi. but be careful. you can easily spend over 100 bux per person if you walk in there starved. you can save some coin if you bring a favorite bottle of wine. i like their super white tuna and volcano roll. they also prepare a pretty fresh uni as well.
