Despite the weird name (because the food isn't french per se and the grammar is just plain incorrect if it is french word) the food is outstanding. There is no point in talking about what we ate - only that we ate it and enjoyed every last morsel and drop. We went on a no menu Sunday and chose the 4 course meal. As the name suggests, on Sunday you don't get to choose what you'll eat - the chef decides for you. It was lots of fun to wonder what would be next and enjoy every bite. Our waiter was very nice and attentive with pouring the wine we'd brought. Simply put, you must go here. The food is wonderful and the experience is a blast.
