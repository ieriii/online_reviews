I thought the atmosphere and setting were wonderful. But when it came to the food, it left a lot to be desired. We started off with the artichoke dip for an appetizer. There was very little there and what was there was burnt. Next I had a corned beef sandwich and barely ate half of it because it was so dry (even with mustard). My friend had ordered a shepherd's pie. She was left unsatisfied as well. Overall, I might be back for a few drinks in a cool environment but I definitely won't be back for the food.
