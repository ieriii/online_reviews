Great BBQ in Chicago! I went for a work event, and we started with the shrimp & grits and hush puppies, they were both delicious. Then I had the sliced kobe brisket which was amazing... the cornbread is delicious too! My friend got the half smoked chicken and I tasted some, it was delicious as well. We got the Mac & Cheese on the side, and it was incredible - could have had that as a meal! We were too full for dessert. They did a great job, though I wish they had draft beers. Also, our server mumbled and it was hard to understand what he was saying, though he was really helpful and gave good advice. Great, great BBQ north of the Mason Dixon line.
