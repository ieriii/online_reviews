The owner is terribly rude, and getting a table with more than 2 people is basically impossible. The cashier literally screamed at me when I tried to order before I was seated. She refused to take my order, put down her pen, and walked away. (The other cashier, a very nice guy, did take our order).I called the next day to talk to the manager about the rude cashier, and it turned out that the cashier was the manager/owner. I am FLOORED that the owner of a business would behave that way. Besides being wildly unprofessional, it was just unnecessary.  The way the restaurant is set up is kind of confusing--you have to wait for the hostess to seat you, but then go stand in line at the counter for your food, which is brought to you by a waiter. I can't imagine this is the first time that someone's made that mistake. So I talked with the manager/owner/cashier, Carol, for a while on the phone the next day. One of the crazier conversations of my life. To cut to the conclusion--there was no apology to be had. Definitely will not be going back.
