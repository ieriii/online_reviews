Again, 300+ reviews with an average of 4.5 stars? You likely don't need to read my review to be convinced to try this place. Service is spectacular with just the right amount of doting on customers. The meat cuts are flavored well and delicious. The salad bar is exceptional with plenty of chartucerie, cheeses, salads, which are phenomenally fresh.  My only issue (being the frugal person I am) is that the dinner is very high priced. ($50 bucks a person or so?) If you can swing it, go for lunch... it's half the price, and you get the same quality of food and service. Otherwise, Fogo de Chao in Chicago has set the benchmark to judge all other Brazilian Buffet Steakhouses against. Other chuscarria's need to come experience how it is done here before attempting to set up shop. They'll be hard pressed to meet the similar expectations. Even when you're stuffed at the end of your meal, do your best to order up a papaya cream dessert... not only does it taste great, it's good for digestion. I'm not a fan of the splash of alcohol (raspberry I believe) they put on the top, so you can decide for yourself if you want it sans raspberry. Verdict: Delicious, and well worth your money... and I've had out of this world food and service all five times I've gone.
