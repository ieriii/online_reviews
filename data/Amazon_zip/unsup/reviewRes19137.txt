We stopped by the Gage a few months ago and enjoyed a round of drinks, so we decided to return and try it for dinner with a group of friends. But we won't be back. With so many other great dining options downtown, it's hard to recommend the Gage. I can't get past the schizophrenic mish-mash of sports bar, tourist magnet, fine dining prices, children yelling behind us, Irish pub wannabe. If you do go, make sure you request the server with the British accent and wild hair. He seems to be the only one who enjoys his job. And don't order the "Chop Chop" salad because it's a head of romain lettuce cut four times and sprinkled with a couple of tomatoes, teeny diced pepper and one sliver of cucumber.
