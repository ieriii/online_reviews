Still a great place to go. Although I sat in the dining room this time and I have to say while the food was pretty great, the spacing was a little cramped and the service was a little intense. I'm a slow eater. Always have been, always will be. So it gets frustrating when not one, not two, but three separate waiters come by asking if they can remove my plate. Finally the 5th time they asked I was so upset I had to say "FINE JUST TAKE IT!" even though i wasn't done. I wish restaurants would care more about creating an atmosphere as opposed to just rushing people through a meal. I wanted to sit, enjoy the decor, enjoy the company, enjoy the conversation and enjoy (slowly) the food I ordered. So that kind of put a damper on the meal for me. Other than that, though, I love this place and would definitely come back again.
