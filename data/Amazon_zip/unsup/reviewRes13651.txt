Yummy burgers!!!  The burgers were very big and tasty. Plenty of seating...  I like Kuma's burgers, but it's not a place you want to stay and have a few cocktails at. Here you are able to relax order your food and stay for a few drinks. The burgers are delicious.  You don't have to worry about bumping into chairs, tables or people when you walk to the bathroom.  Definitely will be back.
