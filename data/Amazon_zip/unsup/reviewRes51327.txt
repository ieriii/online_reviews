Nothing earth shattering here, just some good standard Mexican options (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.) that are generously portioned for your hard earned dollar. If you're not in a tortilla-filled-with-meat sort of mood, the filete al mojo de ajo is a tasty alternative. They pack enough garlic in there to keep vampires away for days.
