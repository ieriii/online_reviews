Got here right at noon knowing the line was going to be crazy...luckily the wait was only about 15 minutes which I think is really good. We were bracing optimistically for a 40 in wait. It's cold (mid 50s), overcast and windy....the perfect day for soup. My guy and I both had caldos. He had the chicken pozole and I had the pork belly fideo. Let me preference that my guy has grown up with Mexican food so he had some high standards eating at XOCO his first time and these soups exceeded them. He loved his chicken pozole and my fideo. I already knew I was going to love my dish when it arrived at the table....red broth, skinny noodles with chopped zucchini, onions and avocado topped off with CRISPY pork belly. It was smokey, savory, sweet and creamy with the avocado....just delicious. As other yelpers mentioned you have to get a hot chocolate and churros. But which hot chocolate? So many to choose from! This time I tried the Mexico City which is thick (but not as thick as the hot chocolate in Barcelona) and creamy. The Aztec is the sweet and spicy version of hot chocolate. You probably won't be disappointed with any of the options. BTW - when we left at 1 PM the line was out the door and lining around the windows (yikes)!
