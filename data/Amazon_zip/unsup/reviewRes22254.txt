It's been a few years since I've had the opp to go to Greek Town - let alone Greek Islands restaurant. My decision was between Diana's, Roditi's and GI's - all places I've been and had fun times. I took into consideration the advice of a Yelper friend and landed on Greek Island. We had a fairly large crew and everyone had a blast. Three orders of Saganaki kicked off the evening and was as expected; delish. I highly recommend creating your own entrees and choosing from the "combo" options - great way to mix it up. There really wasn't anything anyone ordered that I would deem questionable so good coverage on their extensive menu, And as others have noted, free valet parking in this busy neighborhoold
