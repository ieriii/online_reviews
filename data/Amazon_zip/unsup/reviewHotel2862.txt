This hotel is situated in a great area of Chicago, right next to the river. It is in prime location because you can walk to Michigan Ave for shopping or any restaurant that you want to. The layout of the hotel and cleanliness is great as well. The rooms of this hotel are small, even if you get a queen-bed room. The main reason I was unhappy with this hotel was because of the staff. From the door-man outside to the reception desk inside, they are not kind or professional. They all seem like they hate their jobs and are being forced to work there. My friend left my shoes that I needed for the evening at the front desk with my name and room number. When I sent my wife to ask them for the shoes, the man working there was very rude and didn't even listen to what she was asking for. He said there was nothing there. When I went later and spoke with another person, my shoes were there the whole time. Later, when I asked the front desk for a cab, they told me I would have to call-in for a cab or wait for one outside. I decided to walk outside and find a cab myself. When I finally flagged one down and asked it to pull into the hotel driveway, the bell-man (door-man) was so rude to me and treated me (31 yr old male) like a 10 year old child telling me that it was his job and I should have told him. Then why did the staff inside tell me I would have to get one myself if there was a bell-man outside for that job? After treating me like a child, he went on to embarrass me in front of my friends stating that he should get me a uniform so I could work there with him since I'm more pro-active than he is. WTH?! Does anyone treat guests that way? If this is how you want to be treated by staff at a renowned hotel chain, then this is the place for you. No professionalism, no courtesy, no spacious rooms. Would you take a chance with that kind of money?
