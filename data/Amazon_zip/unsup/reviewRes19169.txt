The setup is odd -- have to wait in line to order but can't order until you're assigned a table number; 'runners' as opposed to 'servers' (no one to ask about the missing part of my order); and prices that are at odds with the casual environment. We got 2 beers, chips and guac (the chips tasted like Fritos), two tortas, and three churros. $50. Mexican street food, eh? The only reason I would go back is for the chocolate. It was amazing.
