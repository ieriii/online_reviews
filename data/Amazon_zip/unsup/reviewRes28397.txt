this place is outstanding!!! I was a long-time devotee, forgot about it and have recently returned. if you haven't yet, you gotta go!! prices are more than reasonable, selection is all authentic Mexican culture and food (and enough for veggie's to choose from, too) and even the wait time is reasonable if you're there at the peak of busy. A must-do in Chicago!
