5 Stars for amazingly inventive cocktails and sleek ambiance 0 Stars for horribly rude service. We lucked out and were seated immediately, however, we seemed to be seated at a table that was crammed in where it didn't fit. The chairs were so awkwardly positioned that my friend kept trying to adjust them so we could talk (shouldn't be difficult at a two person table). However, every time he would adjust his chair even a 1/4 inch a waitress would rudely come over and tell him he had to move it back. Finally we asked for a new table after explaining how uncomfortable we were. The waitress acted as if we has personally offended here and reluctantly gave us a different table. Did someone leave their customer service skills at home that day? I have no problem spending lots money on hand crafted cocktails and leaving generous tips but rudeness is not welcome. So props to the bartenders for creating amazing drinks but I don't think I'll be back due to the lack of service.
