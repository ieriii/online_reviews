My favorite breakfast place in the city! And yes... we've tried them all!! They have a large menu and huge portions. Food is always consistently delicious. (Personally recommend their sweet crepes!) Wish they had seating in the enormous waiting area... or even more tables so less people would have to stand and wait! It's always packed during the prime breakfast hours, but most places are anyway. They also need sugar dispensers instead of the packaged sugar, as we always have to ask for more. Excellent food, excellent service! I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good hearty breakfast.
