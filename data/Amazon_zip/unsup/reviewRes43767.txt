Although the food is ok...i always leave this place pissed off. I dont know if its the screaming kids, or the rude staff, or the long lines or the crowded rushed atmosphere. I cant pinpoint it, and i dont want to . i have been here many times thinking that i was too harsh, and i can say one thing. It is consistent. Consistenly BAD.
