I took my out-of-towner friend here after reading the many positive reviews on yelp. Pros: We shared a yummy and highly alcoholic (though $30!!!) pitcher of margaritas, followed by a taco (me) and enchilada (her) dinner. Both were delicious. Even on a Friday night, we were seated promptly. The staff was friendly and checked-in with us frequently during the dinner. The chips with salsa, margaritas, and dinners came out quickly. Cons: Street parking on Halsted was a bit harder than I'd like, but, hey, it WAS a Friday night after all. Food was a bit boring. Restaurant is small and people kept walking past our table to go through a closet-sized door marked "Patio."
