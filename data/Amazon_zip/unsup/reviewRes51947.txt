Love, love, love! I so wish we had one closer to home. The app sampler was good and was a definite must since the pizza takes so long to bake. But good things come to those who wait. The golden buttery crust, the delicious amount of cheese, and super tasty pepperoni. Next time I must figure out a way to smuggle some home.
