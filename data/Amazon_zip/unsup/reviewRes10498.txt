Chicago may be known for its deep dish chains, but Piece is so much better. This is and has always been my favorite pizza place in Chicago.  Their incredible pies are thin and have to be eaten either with a fork or two hands. The bigger pie you get, the better the deal since additional toppings cost the same, no matter how large or small your pie. Leftovers taste great too. Don't forget Piece is also a brewpub, so make sure to sample their award winning beers. I always go for their light, crisp Golden Arm. A pitcher is just enough to share with another and leave quite drunk. The salads and spinach artichoke dip are well worth getting and sharing as well.  The atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious with the communal seating in the center of the restaurant. The wait can be huge on weekend evenings, so best to avoid with a group unless you have 10 or more people (in which case you can make a reservation). I think this is the perfect place for a 3p weekend meal.
