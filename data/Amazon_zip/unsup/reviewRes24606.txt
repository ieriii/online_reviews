Another delayed review, but I do remember the first time I've eaten at this place.... I went with a few friends during one of our 3-hour gaps between classes. We went around the noon and the place was slightly busy for lunch. It took 45 minutes for our server to take our order, but quick to give us our lunch. We were worried about being late to our 3pm class (which was by S. Michigan & Roosevelt Rd.) because our server had taken on a couple of more tables and we really wanted desserts and enjoy it there. So to speed up the process, we ordered desserts and asked him to bring out our check at the same time. We broke down our bill accordingly while we waited for our order to be brought out. Then gave him our money to ring up when he arrived with our desserts. I would've given this place 2 1/2 stars, but the desserts were so deliciously filling that it more than made up for the poor service. I will update this review when I get a chance to go back.
