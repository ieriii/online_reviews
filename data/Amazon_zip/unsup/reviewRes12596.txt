Muy caliente!! I have been to the restaurant in the burbs for some Thanksgiving fun for a few years in a row, but never been to the one on Ohio. Mmmmmm-Mm! I am not much of a beef eater (I know, why a Brazilian restaurant?!?), but can live on the "light" dinner. That meant I was able to eat all the soup, cheeses, vegetables, fresh fish, variety of salads, and even a few hot items I wanted. Come on...fresh mozzarella, sushi, tuna, salmon with ground mustard sauce, asparagus, lobster bisque, quinoa salad, orzo salad...yummy food galore! The wine is no slouch either with decent prices. We decided to finish off with a banana foster pie...to die for and well worth the extra calories!! The waiter was extremely attentive and made great recommendations for both my second glass of vino and the heavenly dessert. Did I mention the entertainment? I like to call them "bottle nymphs". There is a gal show is in a harness and jumps, twirls, walks on the walls, while moving bottles of wine. I was under some sort of trance!  Worth swinging by and enjoying a entertaining and tasty night out!
