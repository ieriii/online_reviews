There are a bunch of other reviews that will get super technical, but I'll just share what I remember sitting here a month after my meal at Alinea. 1)Our ressie was at 530, we walked out about 8 so give yourself time. This seems bizarre, but even with 22 courses, you don't walk out overly stuffed. It's feeling satiated but not uncomfortably so. 2) The hot potato,cold potato truffle course was SO FREAKING AMAZING. The Frozen Yuzu was also amazing. Thanks Grant, for ruining my life. If only I could get Yuzu italian Ice on demand. 3) I get it; it's stuffy. But if you aren't, the staff will chill out and give some personality back! They are still beyond professional, but they're human! I know there were like 10 people waiting on us, but they were pretty funny and laughed with us when we didn't know how to eat some of the things we were served. All in all, definitely the best meal of my life (based on food alone. Mama's Fishhouse in Hawaii will forever hold the title because it's Maui).
