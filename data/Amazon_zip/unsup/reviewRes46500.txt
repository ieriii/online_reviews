RJ Grunt's has been a favorite of our family for years. Not only is the food great but the service is too. Dorrie is our favorite server but all of them are efficient and personable. We've been coming here for over 15 years since before our kids were born and Dorrie has literally watched our kids grow up. Even though we moved to the south side and don't make it here as often as we used to, we still manage to get here several times a year. My most recent experience with Grunt's is what prompted my review. Our family came here the weekend before Valentine's Day. My husband forgot his wallet at home and my credit card was declined (turns out there were fraudulent charges made and I had to get a new card). I felt terrible because we weren't able to pay the bill but the entire staff was so nice. They kept telling us not to worry about it. Fast forward to today - I received my new credit card and came in to settle up on the bill. Once again everyone was so nice and professional. I've always loved this place and love it even more now. Thank you RJ Grunt's!! PS - this place does get very crowded weekends and evenings so be prepared to wait for a table. And check out the "temperature soup" - a cup of their daily soups is only the price of the outside temperature (with purchase of entree). Soup for 99 cents or 32 cents or less cannot be beat.
