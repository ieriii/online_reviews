Five stars for the service and value aspect. It's not a "five star hotel." It's not the Ritz. But as a choice for out-of-towners for a downtown wedding - this seems like a good choice. At least it is for me - we secured a rate with them for next year for a wedding that is almost half the cost of the other rates of local Michigan Ave hotels. Consider the hotel is a little outdated - currently a renovation (soft remodel) is planned for December thru March of next year. They'll be updating the rugs, rooms, walls, floors, lobby, etc. The rooms are currently clean, efficient, perfectly placed on Michigan Ave - and the hotel has a shuttle that will take you up and down Michigan Ave throughout the day. They also have a pool with a lifeguard which is in an atrium. It's not the Ritz, but if you don't need your shoes shined - it works.
