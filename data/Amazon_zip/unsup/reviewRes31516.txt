One star for the food, One star for Peter, One star for the waiter with the whale on his arm and One star because I eat here once a week. My new love is the Vegan Chicken Ranch Sandwich, minus the guacamole because guacamole on bread is gross! I also love every raw cheesecake they have at the Diner. I seriously eat here enough that they know me by now, at least the boys waiters do, the girl waiters are a little "too cool" to be nice to me, but I don't mind. I don't go here to make friends, I go to the Diner to eat their foods. Keep it up because you're keeping me happy.
