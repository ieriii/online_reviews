This restaurant, currently being renovated, is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, if not my favorite. Several friends and I went there for one last amazing meal before they closed their doors on June 26th, and the hostess told us that they were going to gut the decor (which was extremely modern, if you did not get that from the name), expand the seating, and also extend the hours until 2 a.m. for their reopening. Although there will definitely be changes, I am positive the quality of their food (they use as much organic ingredients as possible) and the drinks (extremely creative) will be just as good. My favorites from the old menu included a goat cheesecake, mushroom risotto, and the truffle-infused corn. Can't wait for the reopening.
