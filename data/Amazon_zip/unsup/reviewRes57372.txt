All I have to say is that I don't even eat seafood let alone sushi and this restaurant changed my mind. Their sushi is amazing and the atmosphere is great as well. The only downside is if you don't have reservations on the weekend it can get really busy. You may even have to get on the waiting list for a glass just to drink the beverages that you brought along with you.
