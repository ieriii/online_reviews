I went here a couple years ago and ordered veggie dishes. I remember it being good so I went back last night with my bf. We ordered the vegetable moussaka, garides shrimp and a village salad to share. The veggie dish was very tasty. The salad was ok, but I've had better elsewhere. The bread they served should have been served to fish in a pond! It was so dry and hard. The garides shrimp dish was GROSS! We LOVE this dish at a greektown in Florida. However, Greek Islands version of it tasted like some nasty cafeteria food. It was in a sweet tomato sauce which tasted to me like Chef boyardee. I really should have sent it back, but the bf liked it enough to eat a few bites. Once thing I noticed was that while waiting to use the restroom I was saw the chef standing still. He was watching a moving food belt as the plates of food circled by...probably stuff he cooked hours ago. I think the food is way over priced for the cafeteria style quality. I doubt I will back to this one ANY time soon!
