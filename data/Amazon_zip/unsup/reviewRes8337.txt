My company had its annual dinner here several months back, and I have to say it was absurdly good as all-around tasty meatfests go. The various meats were spiced effectively and never dry, and while some are in rotation less frequently than others, the point is to enjoy at your own pace, so take your time, and sample the entire spread. The wine list was comprehensive, the salad bar both essential as a palate-cleanser and supremely well-stocked. The service is attentive, as the gimmick with the tokens effectively demands of them. I'd go back, but certainly it's not something you can fit easily within a normal diet without making allowances for the absolutely fabulous amount of protein you'll have ingested.
