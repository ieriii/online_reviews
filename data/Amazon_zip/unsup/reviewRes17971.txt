Ok, From most of the reviews the People get this place. It's not your corner Dive bar. Don't order a rum & coke or a bud light ok ?! Don't go in trying to hook up. This is a real cocktail lounge. People who want to have well made cocktails come here. Foodies, people with pallets. I know, I know, maybe this isn't the place to come twice a week & have people yell "Norm !!" when you walk in. Your not going to watch "The Game" here. What you SHOULD do is 1) Come in with an open mind, willing to try something you've never had before 2) Sit at the bar if it's an option. 3) Trust your bartender, tell him what you like, IE, a rum drink, not to sweet, or a gin drink that's smooth. Let them do what they do. Do not come here and expect it to be like other Chicago bars. Don't come here "Instead of" somewhere else. Come because you want the best made, well balanced cocktail you can get, and judge it on that. You wont be disappointed
