242nd review. Here's my 2 cents. I was lucky enough to get to experience Alinea this week. This is a culinary experience. It is not for the faint of heart. Did the 12-course (ended up being about 14 courses)+ wine pairings. I was worried it would be too much alcohol, but it was perfect. (It's actually about 8 pairings). The smaller tasting is plenty of food. I was stuffed, especially with all the bread they bring you - maybe 4 pieces? I was turning the guy away. Enough starch! I want more room for the actual courses. The service is impeccable - light-hearted but informative. Couple next to us was tanked... makes me wonder why you would do that before experiencing such a fabulous meal? Oh well, made for good entertainment.
