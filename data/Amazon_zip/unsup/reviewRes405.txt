Alinea is definitely not your run of the mill restaurant. This is about as foodie as it gets (or as foodie as I've gotten) and diners should be aware that when you come to Alinea, you're coming for a complete gastronomical experience that caters to all your senses rather than just for a typical meal. I believe reservations for Alinea need to be made some time in advance but I managed to find an opening a week before my trip to Chicago last September. The restaurant itself is fairly inconspicuous. Even as you enter the building into an empty hallway, there is no clear signage directing you to the entrance of the restaurant. Instead a sleek sliding door opens up almost as if you're in some underground secret lair. Needless to say, it was pretty darn cool. We came for the tasting menu which was comprised of 13 different courses. Each and every one of the courses was a unique tasting experience. You could tell that the chef took time in thinking about how each flavor would complement one another, and also how each dish should be presented. Dish after dish presented food that actually made you think about what you were tasting, smelling, and feeling. I won't go through each and every course but I do remember the wagyu beef as a standout (as it always is).  The service here was prompt and professional albeit not at all overly friendly. I wouldn't go as far to say that it was a stuffy atmosphere but they definitely could have had a bit of a sense of humor. The dining experience is indeed an exceptional experience but it would have been nicer had it been perhaps not so serious. Overall, I would definitely recommend Alinea to anyone who is open to trying a new food experience and isn't too concerned about the minor damage to his/her wallet as the price per person starts as $150 for the tasting menu. It will definitely be an experience you won't forget.
