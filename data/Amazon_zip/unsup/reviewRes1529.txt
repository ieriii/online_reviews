After watching Anthony Bourdain rave about Hot Doug's, I booke a flight and flew to Chicago to see what all the hype was about....It was good, but not great. I gave it a fair chance though. I tried 5 different hot dogs & the duck fat fries: The Chicago Style Hot Dog The Keira Knightly - fire dog Paul Kelly - bratwurst soaked in beer The Dave Kingman - chicken sausage sante fe style The Elvis - polish sausage The BEST was by far the Paul Kelly & Keira Knightly....full of flavor! The others just tasted like boring Oscar Meyer weiners you could buy at your local grocery store. The duck fat fries were delicious though. Then again anything fried in fat & has the ability to clog your arteries is always happy on the taste buds. The line is super long ( I waited 45min), but it should be expected. Overall it was good, but not great.
