Yes, the vegetarian chuck pea burger is as awesome as everyone says it is. I absolutely adored it. My boyfriend, a regular meat eater also enjoyed his burger (I can't remember which it was). It was noisy, but that is to be expected at a burger bar on a Friday night, i'd say. My only legitimate complaint is that our waiter was so slow to come with our orders, and we waited at least 25 minutes just to get our beers, and even longer to receive the check we asked for. Hopefully you wont be stuck with that guy. I also feel bad for those complaining about the fries. I ordered the garlic fries and they were perfectly crispy. Other than that the slow waiter the food is excellent!
