Anyone else come here for the MUNUC conference back in high school? Good times. I have to admit that The Palmer House is my default for staycations back home, just for the nostalgia and the sheer beauty of the place. Last Christmas, my friends and I let ourselves get upsold to the Executive Floor for a weekend and it was just what we needed. I gorged myself on the breakfast, snacks, and nighttime hors'doeurves right down the hallway from our extra-large suite. Excellent. Also, bathrooms are much nicer on the Executive Floor, with dual showerheads and ambient lighting. The age of the hotel is really starting to show though, and they haven't gotten around to updating all the rooms, so it's a total crapshoot as to whether or not you get a good one. And after having stayed in both styles of rooms, the older one definitely feels...well, old, almost grandmotherly. Internet is also ridiculously expensive when free WiFi is becoming the standard. If you want a historic, gorgeous hotel, and really don't mind getting nickled and dimed here and there, this is the place for you. There really are more comfortable and higher quality hotels out there for the price, though.
