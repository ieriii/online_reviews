The wait varies, but it has gotten a lot better than the summer. The hostess is generally efficient at seating people asap.  It's a pretty casual place but the quality in the food is there. Try the Ahodaga for an amazing spicy pork sandwich. The menu is really unique, but not too diverse - vegetarians have very limited options here. It's worth trying the coffee and/or hot chocolate as they make their own...
