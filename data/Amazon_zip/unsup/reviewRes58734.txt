My husband and I ate at Graham Elliot's last evening for the first time. Decor is great, and love the idea that the menu is printed on one side of old record album covers. Speaking about the menu...if you are very hungry and going there for dinner(we were famished after shopping and walking around the city all day), this is NOT the place to dine. First off, the cocktails are small. There is no bread/crackers of any kind offered - just flavored POPCORN (a trendy idea, yes, but c'mon!) I was dying for some good bread - flat bread, anything...The menu is pretty trendy - and limited. The portions --appetizers and entrees -are small. My chicken breast entree was excellent, but way to small of a serving. Needless to say, the four of us were still hungry after our meal, and couldn't wait to go eat somewhere else. Quite unimpressed, to say the least.
