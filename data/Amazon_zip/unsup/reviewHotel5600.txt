This place is fabulous and the reason why is because you'll be poor after your stay. You know the old attage about saving a penny every day? You probably need to save like $5 a day to afford this place. Yes, very posh very nice but the location is not everything because you can walk about 4 blocks and get to the Marriott. The hotel is a little off its rocker when it thinks you WANT to get your eyes ripped out of your head just to stay there, but it's probably one of those places that the boss gets to stay at with the family while we toil in the mines. At least this place didn't stick me with ridiculous charges. I earned those badboys.
