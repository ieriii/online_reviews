What a disappointment. While the service was great, the food was very average - most dishes weren't warm enough and lacked seasoning. Their mashed potatoes and pickled onions were my favorite things though the burger was very good - says a lot for a bbq place. The meats were pretty flavorless (the burger being the exception), the cornbread boring (e.g. compared to Bandera's incredibly delicious cornbread). Pretty decor and a nice place, just wouldn't go back for the food.
