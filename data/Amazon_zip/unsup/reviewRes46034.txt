I know it is supposed to be a tourist trap, but I love Grand Lux Cafe. It gives you this ability to choose, even at 11 in the morning between a yummy omelet thing or pizza or even meatloaf. I love this, because while 90% of the time on a Sunday morning I am in the mood for their Chiliquiles, there is that 10% of the time that I want some potato egg rolls and grilled cheese. I like that I can choose either of those at any point in the day. I have never eaten anything I did not like here. Service is always really good. The wait is never too long, though I don't love the waiting area- it makes me slightly claustrophobic. All in all, one of my favorite places for a quick bite on a weekend day.
