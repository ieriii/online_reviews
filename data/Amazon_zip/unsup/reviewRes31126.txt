So, I recently returned to Nana twice since September. Wow and wow. Amazing! They were good in September, but now they are great! The food has improved tenfold! The vegan breakfast burrito is no longer bland! It looks like they've added nutritional yeast and the soyrizo (yum!).  The potatoes are amazing. The fresh squeezed orange juice (made with blood oranges) was the best orange juice ever, seriously. Totally worth the money (if only they had free refills).  Also, I usually don't give restaurants that lack vegan desserts five stars, I'll give it to Nana anyway because the food is awesome and they do have vegan desserts every so often (so I hear).  They need to open for dinner...right now...because now I'm craving it. Knocks other brunch restaurants right out the ballpark! ;-) PS-You might have to wait to be seated now (20 or so minutes). It's worth the wait.
