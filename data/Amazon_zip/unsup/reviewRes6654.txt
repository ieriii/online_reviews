This place is a little fancier than you'd expect for a bbq joint, but thanks to Yelp we were prepared for this. We had gone to Giordanos for lunch that day so we weren't very hungry when it came time for our dinner reservation. I don't suggest doing both places on the same day but we were only in town for a few days and had a long list of places to try. With that being said, we still wanted to try as much as we could here. - Complimentary bbq chips and pickles: if you put chips in front of me I'm going to eat them.. it's that simple. I don't like pickles but my boyfriend finished the entire bowl so they must've been good. - Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies: I was excited seeing these on the menu because I've really liked the ones I've had elsewhere.. these were good but I think I liked the chipotle mayo dipping sauce more than the actual hush puppies. Probably wouldn't order again. - q2: we went with the pulled pork and St. Louis half slab.. thank you to our waitress for explaining the difference between baby back and St. Louis ribs.. naturally we went with the one with more meat. The q2 came with a huge piece of cornbread and 4 bbq sauces (original, spicy, vinegar, and south Carolina mustard). My favorites were the spicy for the ribs and vinegar for the pulled pork, while my boyfriend liked the mustard the best. The ribs were tender and delicious. The pulled pork was also really good. However, I prefer ribs and he prefers pulled pork so splitting the q2 worked out perfectly. - braised greens - I was a fan but could've done with the pieces of pork in it and the separate sauce had little flavor. I used the vinegar from the q2 instead.. much better. It was just the right amount of food for the two us - we went home full and happy.
