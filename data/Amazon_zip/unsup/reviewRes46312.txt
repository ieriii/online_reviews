I've been to the Grand Lux Cafe twice and both times were great experiences. Most recently, I had celebrated my birthday there. Since they don't take reservations after 5:30pm, I had to just give my name and wait for a table of 10 to 15 to free up. The hostess wasn't even surprised by the number of people and said the wait was about 45 minutes. It didn't even take 45 minutes and we were all situated at the table. Our server was quick to take drink orders and bread baskets with butter were on the table before I could have even noticed. The accommodation were impeccable for the rest of the night from our server. I had ordered the Duck Pot Stickers as an appetizer and the Rib Eye Steak served Medium with a side of mash potatoes for dinner. The pot stickers were perfectly seasoned and the dipping sauce complemented it well. The Hoisin really opened up your taste buds. The Rib Eye had that grilled crust I always look for in a good steak. At the end f the meal, they brought out a free birthday desert with a candle for me. All in all, it was a good time.
