We went on a busy Friday afternoon and missed the dinner rush. They were busy, but we got right in, so there was no long wait at all. The atmosphere was fun, but a little loud. I loved the energy of the place. We ordered the milk braised shoulder, the pig ears, the jowl and the roasted marrow. The shoulder was the star of the show! Absolutely incredible. I've had ears before and they've been chewy and sort of unsatisfying, but these were perfect. The texture was sort of like fried onion strings - crispy, light, delicious, and they served it with an egg on top, so the yolk gave it a fantastic richness. Jowl - how can you go wrong? It was basically a take on the BLT, with jowl replacing the bacon, heirloom tomatoes, frisee and an egg on top. Really, really good. The marrow itself was good, but I wish they hadn't oiled the bread so much. Adding that to the fats in the marrow made it a little too greasy. We had a few cocktails - the price was typical of the area (overpriced) but the quality was good. Excellent atmosphere! Excellent food! Excellent service! I highly recommend this place.
