If you are a avid beer connoisseur (beer snob), you should love this place.  Large selection of specialty and international beers, each with the appropriate serving glass. Beer prices are on the high side, but that is mostly because of the beer selection itself. As a far a "specialty" beer bar goes, this is a five star place. Food is decent as well. I tend to rate bars on their overall vibe and how it fits into may personal standards (cheap, comfortable, empty). Hopleaf does not really fare too well in that respect. Its very crowded and its hard to find a seat even on off nights. The crowd is typical andersonville plus the hardcore beer snob types (perfectly nice people, but there are a lot of em). There is no easy parking in the neighborhood, so this place works better as a neighborhood hangout than a destination, unfortunately, it is seen more as of a destination. It is not cheap, but the beer can be argued as worth it, especially if thats what you specifically came here for.  Nice place, crowded, but not really a type of bar I would want to spend too much time in (unless I got there early and got a table).
