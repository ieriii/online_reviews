Went for dinner recently and was impressed. We had a 9 pm reservation and were seated promptly. Very comfortable, casual atmosphere. As others have mentioned, it's very loud in here, almost annoyingly so. But the food makes up for it. We started with the chef's selection of oysters. Incredibly fresh and delicious, I could have done another round. Then came the charcuterie plate which was quite enjoyable. We also had the spicy pork rinds which I ordered because of all the raves on here. They were so addicting! Just the right amount of spice and crunch. We finished with the mussels which were served in a very tasty broth. At this point, I was pretty full and wasn't planning on ordering dessert until the waitress handed us the menu and I saw this toasted rosemary cake with Valrhona chocolate gelato. Yes, please! And oh my gosh, was it amazing. Like one-of-the-best-desserts-I've-ever-had amazing. Who would have thought it? Not me. It was one of their specials as it's not on the permanent menu but it should be. Wow. They also have a fantastic beer selection.
