Okay, this place is seriously amazing. Hot chicken wings: FINALLY! I'm a fan of spicy, and these are exactly what I mean when I say spicy.(You do need to specify that you want them spicy, though. You can also order mild, or not spicy at all). The only thing that was iffy about this place was the fact that I did order take-out so it probably would have been better if I would have sat in, but that place is too tiny! There is not enough room for a lot of people to sit in which is a bummer. The fries are what I ordered with my wings, and they're okay (just plain ol' fries, kinda soggy), but the nice thing about em' is that they're HUGE. Like, 3 people could share them and be satisfied. It's BYOB. Friendly staff. Cool drinks (that are non-alcoholic). You'd be lame not to go here.
