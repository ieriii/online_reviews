We had to entertain some out-of-town guests who were craving some deep dish pizza. I'm not exactly sure why we didn't go to Lou's but I wasn't the decision maker. This was my first time to this location and it is touristy and large. They warn you that deep dish takes an hour and we thought they might be overshooting the time, but it really did take an hour. Borderline starvation probably makes people think this pizza is better than it really is. Alcohol helps pass the time. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and had a real personality. Gino's pizza has A LOT of crust. When I looked at everyone's plate at the end of the meal, there were piles and piles of crust. The perfect deep dish pizza in my opinion is a hybrid of Lou's and Gulliver's.
