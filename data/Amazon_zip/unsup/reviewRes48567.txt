Great atmosphere.... if you don't like and/or want noisy... don't go here. However, the noise level did not prevent me from hearing what my dinner guest had to say. I will be honest we ordered so many things from the menu including desserts that I can't remember them individually. However, everything was fantastic as was the beer and wine selections.
