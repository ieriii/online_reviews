I think I have had more take out from this place than eating in. Partly because I grew up on the Taramasalata that my Dad used to bring home along with the gyros. I remember as a kid, we came here several times and my best memory has got to be the flaming cheese. If you have pyro maniac kids, this is a great place to take them. They really do make a big production of it. The cheese, is amazing! There is nothing more I can really add to the great reviews that this place has. All I know is that I'm pretty sure that the Greek islands had a hand in starting my love affair with food.
