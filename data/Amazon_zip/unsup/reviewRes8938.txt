I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet. Pretty much one of my favorite spots in Chicago. We've been going here for about 5 years now - and always making it my birthday dinner destination. We've brought family, friends, visitors from out of town. Persian food is one of my favorite cuisines, and I love everything about Noon O Kabab. Nice casual, elegant atmosphere, prompt and friendly service, and great food. I consider myself to be a baba ghannouj snob, and theirs is definitely top notch. The saffron rice, the pita and feta, the Persian tea with the cute little sugar cubes....it's heaven! (Great place to bring vegetarian friends too).
