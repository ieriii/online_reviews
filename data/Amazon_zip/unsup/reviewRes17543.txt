Love the concept. Love the fact that they always change the mural decor of the door you always miss when you try to find the place. Great place to have an after work cocktail or two...I say that because the lines are ridiculous on the weekends. Place is pretty quiet, so it's easy to have a conversation instead of having to scream in the ear of your companion. Speak easy + Alice in Wonderland feel, and the drinks are an experience. I'll just stick to one or two, because the wallet wouldn't allow for more than that. Definitely a place to come if you're not worried about how much you're spending and if you want a more intimate place to go. Due to the set up and their capacity rules, you don't really have to worry too much about that random guy who'll come up to you and ask, "How you doing?"
