Fondue... Tastes great, fun to cook, and expensive! There are a couple highlights that I want to accentuate. 1) Quality of food  This place has great quality meats and veggies. I've tried all of their proteins in Prince Geja's combination ($49.95) and was pleasantly surprised (chicken, steak, lobster, shrimp, scallops). Dipping sauces for the protein are excellent. Horseradish is my favorite! Great with steak and potatoes. They also have butter, dill, BBQ, teriyaki and a few others.  I also like the variety of food you get. I'm sure you already know but it comes with a Gruyere cheese fondue appetizer and a chocolate desert fondue. 2) Atmosphere I usually don't care about atmosphere. If the food is good, I have and will continue to go to "hole in the wall" restaurants. There's just something about this place that I like in terms of atmosphere. It's a good romantic date place. You go down the stairs to enter the restaurant. It's dark, cozy, and comfortable. Only thing I would complain about is that it can get a little hot when you're cooking but I figure that's the nature of fondue since the oil pot is on the table. Definitely one of my favorites in the Chicagoland area and one of two restaurants that I will be giving 5 stars to in the plethora of reviews I plan on writing in the next few weeks. Go there and enjoy great quality food and the romantic atmosphere with your date!
