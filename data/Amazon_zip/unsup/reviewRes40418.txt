Went here a second time after not being so impressed the first time. I had ordered the Bouillabaisse which was eh. Dessert of molten cake overdone. Chicken solid. The second time, I ordered the scallops. Perfect. and the duck, which was the best duck I've ever had. A mix of both the duck breast, cooked perfectly, and the duck leg confit, it was a great healthy portion, and deliciously seasoned. Such a contrast from my first experience, gets an extra star from me this time around.
