Longman & Eagle just might be my favorite new restaurant in the city. The neighborhood restaurant and bar serves up unique, flavorful American dishes concentrated on local ingredients. Two small plates -- seared scallops and foie gras -- were a wonderful start to the meal. Served over a bed of braised oxtail and soft gnocchi, the two large Maine scallops were seared to perfection. The foie gras was laid upon ginger bread with an espresso-sized cup of thick hot chocolate on the side. Much to our delight, a chef brought out a sampling of shrimp in celery root sauce to our table to try from the kitchen. The menu also appeals to the sans meat crowd with several vegetarian appetizers and entrees available. The butternut squash risotto was full of flavor and textures with tender diced squash, creamy rice, and dried herb leaves. As far as decor, the ever-popular exposed brick is combined with dark wood tabletops and seats and mirrored cabinets to create an upscale but warm and welcoming space. We arrived at 5:30 pm on a Friday to avoid the crush of weekend diners. By 6:30 pm the waiting area was packed with people spilling over from the bar that parallels the front dining room. Longman & Eagle is top-notch dining in a neighborhood setting on a reasonable budget. It's no wonder the gastropub was named "Best New Restaurant" by the Chicago Reader.
