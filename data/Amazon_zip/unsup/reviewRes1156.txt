There are many days when I curse the fact that I have to work second shift. Thanks to Hot Doug's I have a new found appreciation for it, since I could mosey over for a lunch time dog during the weekday instead of battling the tourist filled lines on the weekends. I went around 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon and the line was quick, with lots of seats still available (parking too!) I convinced my lunch companion to go out on a limb and try their Jack Daniel's pork sausage with bacon mayo and cheese stuffed hot peppers instead of her go-to Chicago dog, which she was quite happy with. I figured I should take my own advice and try their duck sausage with foie gras. Foie gras was everything Anthony Bourdain promised it would be, downright amazing! The combination of hot, crispy duck sausage with fluffy foie gras...truffle aioli! FLEUR DE SEL?! I am now a foie gras fanatic, I want to put it on or in everything. It's become my newest obsession. (In other news, I'd love if someone made a savory foie gras toaster pastry. Yum) Lunch companion and I shared an order of fries and didn't even finish, since they were bland compared to our collection of encased meats. I'm willing to give the duck fat fries a chance, but I've heard there isn't much a difference. I think I'd rather just buy another experimental sausage to fill my tummy.
