Tonight I ordered pick up and decided to expand my Sultan's experience by ordering the Tilapia dinner. I am so glad that I did!!  The woman on the phone said our order would be ready in 15 minutes, and, as promised, it was ready within 15 minutes. The fish is perfect and pairs well with the lentil rice. It had a little kick to it because there's a jalepeno included (sliced into halves) and I bit into one half of it, because i was starving and thought it was a bell pepper. So if you get this, remember that you should cut the pepper up. I will definitely order this from Sultan's again when I feel like venturing away from the falafel and zatter sandwiches. Which are also delicious. So yes, I have added another favorite to Sultan's market and will come back to devour more tilapia at a later date
