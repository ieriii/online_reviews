Dare I say Meli is the best breakfast spot in Chicago? Do you like eggs? If you do, then congratulations, you've found a restaurant that has about a billion different egg options on their menu! Their pancakes/waffles/french toast are amazing as well....so beautifully presented! Even the coffee is outstanding. Since this place is heaven in a restaurant, it gets busy pretty early. I arrived around 8:45am on a Sunday and we had around a 5 minute wait. By the time we left at 10:00am, there was an hour wait. I'm a big fan of Orange, Yolk, and West-Egg Cafe, yet Meli is simply in a league of it's own! It's a fantastic restaurant....great service, delicious food, and it's affordable!
