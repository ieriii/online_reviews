This is the place to go in Chinatown if you want authentic Schezuan food. DISCLAIMER: Do not take someone here on the first date, unless you know for a fact that the other person thinks sweating is a turn-on. I spent half the meal with my tongue hanging half out of my mouth like a fucking dog in summer. The restaurant serves a free spicy cabbage appetizer that will already be too spicy for roughly 95% of the white people who mistakenly find themselves in here. The issue is not how hot each dish is individually. What's really emotionally taxing is the fact that the spice builds on itself, until your ears are bright red, you're using your napkin to dab the pool of sweat at the small of your back, and you're talking like you've got a speech impediment because your mouth is contradictorily both numb and all-feeling at the same time. We split a dry chili chicken and a spicy crispy eggplant. I would recommend both, but the dry chili chicken is something you will both love and fear for months to come. Don't be a pussy and try this place out.
