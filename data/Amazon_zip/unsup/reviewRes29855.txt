I really like this thai place. I have friends who live in the area who are also thai freaks and they introduced me to it. I have had their Kuay Tiew Kee Mao (Spicy noodles) and its pretty good, but its their curry that really shines here. I have had the green curry - Gaeng Keow Waan- and it is AMAZING. Best curry I have had in the city, hands down. My friend normally gets the Panang and that is also exceptional. If you like thai curry you have to try this place. I have only ever gotten delievery, so I can't comment on the actual restaurant.
