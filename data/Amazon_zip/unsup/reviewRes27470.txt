It was very nice food, but it was just not spectacular. I guess I was hoping for spectacular. I started with the Kung Pao sweetbreads. They were nice. For my main course I had the skatewing with raisins. It was very nice. For dessert the mexican chocolate cake... it was a bit boring... your basic chocolate lava cake. The cucumber drink was really tasty (I tried it after I was less than thrilled with my "escape from alcatraz"... too bitter). Overall, I found the food did not live up to the menu descriptions or my expectations. The food was good, definitely, but I didn't get much wow factor.  Tab was about $200 per couple, including tax and tip.
