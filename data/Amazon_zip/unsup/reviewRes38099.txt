So I went to the Hopleaf for the first time a few days ago and i will defiantly be back. First of all the restaurant is in the back behind the bar. This meaning kids are not allowed, a nice touch. I didn't even go for the food but was overwhelmed by the quality of the dishes there, the fried sweetbreads were fantastic as well as the skate. Food aside the real draw of this place is the beer selection. I went with a standard Left Hand Sawtooth first that has never let me down. after a that the atmosphere made me become a bit more adventurous and I tried the pumkin ale, it was like drinking fall. and anyplace that serves the Frank Zappa tribute beer "kill ugly radio" deserves five stars in my book. Go for the beer, stay for the food, then keep staying for the beer.
