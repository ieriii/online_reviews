it takes a certain kind of person to have the patience to put up with the waiting process at violet hour. i'm still not sure how best to get in. we waited for a bit until a couple of people in line behind us walked in and said they put their name/number on a list. of course, when we tried to do the same we were placed behind them on the list, which was incredibly frustrating. we left and grabbed a drink at blue line until we got a call, but i get the impression that if we would have just stayed we would have gotten in earlier. again, not really sure how it works and given the fact that there is a list of rules, it definitely seems like this information should be included to avoid people getting really pissed off. with that being said, the wait was worth it in my opinion. my cocktail was divine and i absolutely love the simple, elegant (and of course, violet) decor in this bar.
