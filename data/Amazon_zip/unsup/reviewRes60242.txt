My favorite place for pizza, and now my favorite place for chicken too.Normally I get a 2 slice deal and a drink for like $6 something plus tax, and now I am hooked on the chicken too...Think I have been there 4 times in the last 10 days!!!!  Got the 1/4 chicken with rice and bean, pita, and a pop for less than $6.I like to eat out, can't cook with crap, so I need good places with good prices.  The Bar-B-Q pizza is my favorite, and normally grab the Italian Sausage slice if they have it out..They are always mixing up the slice options. I call ahead on the chicken when I am in the Loop, and they have it ready when I get off the Diversey stop to dinner..Folks at counter are great here too..Like old fashion, nice people..the pizza guys know me by name too..Tops in Lincoln Park by far..Ps..There empanada..called a Coxinha is awesome too(like $2.25)    Chicken and Mash in a cone shaped ball!!!!
