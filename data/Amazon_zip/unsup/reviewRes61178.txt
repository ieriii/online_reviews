Although in a prime location...this is NOT the Gino's you want to eat at. When you walk in the door employees yell at you to sit and tell you where to sit while you wait for a table. I along w/other customer could not believe the treatment. The service was horrible. While I was eating my salad, the waiter came by and asked if I was finished but didn't wait till I answered and instead just took my plate...This was by far the worst pizza experience ever. I will eat at Ginos again, but never this location. The one star is for yummy pizza.
