Mashed Potato Bacon Pizza changed my life. Quite possibly the best New York Style pizza in Chicago. Love the live band kareoke they have on Saturday nights. The only reason this isn't a 5 star rating is because of the crowds. On a recent visit to Chicago (I lived there for 6 years and just recently moved) I tried to get a table for Kareoke at around 11pm. The wait, I was told, was over 3 hours. The place was packed so tight I couldn't imagine staying for 10 minutes - much less 3 hours.
