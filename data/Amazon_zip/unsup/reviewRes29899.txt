THE BAD:The service is slow and generally lousy. Usually too busy and loud for what should be a low-key cafe. Atrocious crowd control during weekend brunch. THE GOOD:They do have the best steamed oatmeal and applewood bacon (but you have to tell them to burn it to get it crisp.) Interesting and sometimes great art rotates on the walls. They let you carry-out.  Overall, not my fave.
