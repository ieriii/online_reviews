Start with the fried yucca, it can't be just me that loves the fried starch drenched in garlic. As the waiter confirmed don't even mess with the boiled, coward.  Bistec tico is good stuff, and you have to like the Casado with a fried egg. The taco tico was a very pleasant surprise too. I think mayo is good on everything, Irazu confirmed that for me. BYOB and take home an oatmeal shake to make the experience last.
