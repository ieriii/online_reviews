I'm just a rookie at this Yelp Review business, but I can tell you this. Anteprima was awesome. I picked it based on the Yelp reviews (although the service comments and noise concerned me) and its proximity to The Steep theatre. I had my wife, mom, mom-in-law (and her husband) and sister-in-law meeting for dinner for birthdays. Mom said: Best ravioli she's ever had. Yummy bread sticks. Great veal. Great service--thanks Chris (who got us out of there when we were running out of time). A little loud once the full crowd is there, but we had the cozy big table in the back corner--perfect for us. The vegan amongst us was also able to order what she wanted. All and all, a great experience where everyone enjoyed the food, wine, and service.  By the way, great specials that night added to the surprise of an extended selection of great choices. Six thumbs up!
