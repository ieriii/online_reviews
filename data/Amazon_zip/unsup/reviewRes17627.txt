If you don't go for the Buffet, then it's not worth going to. It's the best in the city! Fresh food that hasn't been sitting there for house like other buffets. For appx. $15 you get a wide selection of Indian dishes including vegetarian options like dahl, samosas, fish masala and tikka, etc. The flavor is truly authentic. With the buffet, you also get the tandoori chicken brought to your table on a sizzling grill plate and basket full of naan. Dessert options always include at least 3 dishes. Try the mango ice cream which is creamy delicious. It cannot be beat. Careful with parking however. Valet is $12 during lunch and though there are meters, they're hard to get during business hours.
