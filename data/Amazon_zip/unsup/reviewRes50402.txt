I could not have had a better brunch experience here. Literally everything we ordered was blow-you-away awesome. From the warm flaky cheddar biscuits with house made butter to the spicy bloody mary with pickled okra as a garnish, they killed it on everything. I had a crawfish omelet, with andouille sausage and cream cheese. This was fantastically done, and I anticipate a massive overhaul of the omelet status quo in this city to follow in its wake. Meanwhile, the choice of cheese grits on the side must not be overlooked. You will find yourself scraping every last grit off your plate with the edge of your fork. That is a promise. The Migas which is basically a southwestern scramble is also a perfect pile of breakfast deliciousness, even if it is a bit too much food for one person to finish. Fortunately I was the hungry beneficiary of my fiancee making that mistake. I absolutely cannot wait to come back for another brunch here. And they take reservations!
