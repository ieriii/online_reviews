I went there for an AT&T event, and the appetizers alone was good. The Chicken wrapped wit bacon is very good. The atmosphere is very unique by its colors and decor alone. But the waiters are trained to keep the meat and chicken going. There is really no parking around that area but the valet is on 11.75 but there is also a garage nearby for only 8 bucks after 8pm. Good Hospitality and Good Service!
