I grow up in Bridgeport and I'm so proud to see a place like Nana's in my neighborhood. The service was great and food was delicious! The atmosphere was refreshing and energetic. It's a great place to go for brunch. I live in Seattle now, and it's so great to find organic restaurants like this in Chicago.
