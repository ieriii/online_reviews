Used our Groupon and tried this place for the first time. Have to say, was very disappointed. Listened to the advice below and only ordered the fondue and chocolate. The bread was not fresh (or tasty), veggies were raw (we added these to dip) and the apples were poor. Very disappointed they don't opt for higher quality dipping items, considering the importance of these items to the meal. At least serve some hot, fresh bread! The chocolate was good, especially with a roasted marshmallow, just sort of got sick of it after a few dips. Again, it would be nice if they provided better quality fruit, say some raspberries, to complement the poor looking strawberries. Also, the maraschino cherries were a bit ridiculous, why not real cherries instead of drink garnishes from the bar? As noted below, you definitely smell like grease when you leave, but not the end of the world. Overall, considering the options in the area, I would never go back.
