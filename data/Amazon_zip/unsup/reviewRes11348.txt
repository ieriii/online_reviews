Beer? Awesome. Fun? Yes. Pizza? Ooookay. I think my review is partially colored by the high expectations I had going in. It's good pizza, but I agree with some others that it isn't anything to write home about. The crust is tasty, but not as crispy as I personally like it when it comes to thin crust. The sauce is nothing special. The sausage had good flavor but was a little greasy. Also had a goat cheese and bacon and tomato pizze (a combination I've had before and LOVED) but the bacon was all uncooked and yukky, which ruined it . Otherwise, that one would have probably been pretty good. The best was the veggie pizza that I tried (peppers, tomatoes, olives, mushrooms). Veggies fresh and flavorful and cooked but not soggy. It was very tasty.  On a plus side, the pizzas are HUGE and not really that expensive.
