Definately make this place your one and only stop if you go on the weekend. Went on a Friday, was told it would be about an hour, but it turned out to be almost 4! Snagged a seat the bar luckily, until a waiter said our table was ready but then took it back. He bought us a beer, but we lost our seats. The kitchen was so tiny (must be the reason for the slow turn around on the tables). When we finally got seated we were starving and ready to order in about 3 minutes. Service was fast and the food was amazing! Super tasty, but worth the 4 hour wait? Not so sure. We were happy to go, but probably won't be back
