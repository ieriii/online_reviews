Saturday brunch - strawberry pancakes and real, fresh watermelon juice infused vodka drinks. I couldn't be happier. We sat at the bar to get some distance from the families and mass amounts of children. The bartender was super friendly and since it was our first visit, pointed out her favorites and gave drink recommendations. She talked us into getting a side of bacon because of the awesome way they make it and it was delicious - very crispy but not burnt. I loved the pancakes that had the strawberries cooked into them and were perfectly paired with my watermelon vodka drinks. I love this place for brunch - I will definitely be back.
