Holy food coma! This place is like a version of a Foga De Chao, I think they have a little more variety then your typical Brazillian Steakhouse though. Think duck, venison, ahi tuna all in addition to your beef and chicken. My date found all of the meat to be fantastic with the exception of the pork belly (but hey I don't think one out of 15 or so is bad). I can only comment on the chicken and harvest table, both of which I found super yum! The decor is totally zen like and the service was impeccable and so, so friendly! I told her to choose a Chardonnay that she thought was oaky and she came back with 3 wines for me to choose from! She had a great dessert recommendation ( TRY THE CHOCOLATE PUDDING MOUSSE CAKE THING..... JUST DO IT!!) and to my surprise when she brought the bill I was only charged the 25.00 for the harvest table as I am only a chicken eater. So not necessary, but very thoughtful. All and all we will be back....even if it's just to stop in for some killer cake. It's a meal in itself! :)
