I tried to like this place, really I have, given the rave reviews in Time Out, the Reader, etc. but I can't even after two visits. The drinks are excellent, the bar well stocked and the beer selection definitely justifies the "pub" label. It's the "gastro" part that fails miserably. The appetizers and small plates are grotesquely overpriced and range from ok to just awful. Two quarter sized scallops on a bed of succotash with no sea urchin or lobster to be found on the plate for $13? The grilled sardines were badly prepared, hideously presented, and nowhere in my dining experience have I ever found fish scales to be tasty or appropriate. And I love "fishy" fish - smelts, mackerel and such but this preparation was so salty, and bitter that I required another drink to get the taste out of my mouth. The tete du cochon was one of the few highlights, a pork cheek sweet bbq preparation with a fried duck's egg on top. Avoid the buffalo frogs legs, Goodyear reject bits in hot sauce made my jaw ache trying to chew them. So 1 out of 6 in the small plates department is hardly enough to justify the rave reviews this place gets. The entrees fared a little better but each dish is we had was somehow flawed conceptually rather than executed badly. The beer battered soft shell crabs were delicious with the smoked tomato fondue, but the bitterness of the alfalfa sprout decoration diminished the plate overall. The Dietzler beef and gnocchi entree had no unifying element since the sauce was invisible, a smattering of high quality ingredients standing by themselves failed to impress. Don't go there on a hot day or evening, because the kitchen heat overwhelms the A/C and roasts the dining area even in the back. With all the other wonderful restaurants to choose from in Logan Square, this place is not worthy of waiting an hour or more for a table and suffering the idiocy of the hostess-maitre' de at the door.
