Although the place does get high reviews I can only give it 3 stars... I was alittle disappointed on the food dont get me wrong it was tasty but my food was cold. I do like the fact that it is ready fast but fast isnt always good. I did give it 3 stars because the second time I went my food was hot and like i said there food is really tasty. I like the sitting area outside its pet friendly so my dog loves it and you really cant beat there prices. Would I go again... yes.
