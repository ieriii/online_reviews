I've been here at least half a dozen times. It used to be one of our favorite restaurants because it wore its eccentricity and playfulness on its sleeve. However, the last time I was here - post Michelin star - it seemed to have lost what was great about it. Now the staff wears uniforms and rigidly sets the platings down in sync. Each course from the tasting menu was overwhelmed by being asymmetrically plated on a round, white 12" plate and also just looked contrived. The outdoor seating is gone as well, and it just didn't seem as fun. Yes, the food is still good, and I know that if you want casual you can go to Grahamwich. However, if the food components to a dish include cheezits, rootbeer or pop rocks, you've got to maintain an atmosphere that complements that food.
