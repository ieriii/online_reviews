As a closet vegetarian, I'm so not a pork rinds kind of girl but lord! after watching the reactions of my colleagues to the puffed and powdered hot crisps peeking out of their papered cone, I had to just try one. Amazing. Like eating spicy, salty air... extremely high-calorie, spicy, salty air. After being closed into our booth, we were fed and watered often. Two bottles of pinot and tastes of everything: a flaky, buttery dover sole; a tender roasted chicken that must have come from an enormous bird; and a plate of pickles so more-ish I could've dined on those and a beer alone. The commitment to local farmers is also a big plus in my book. Even though the hipper than thou will roll their eyes and tell you that's so over, it's actually so important and really exciting, as a diner, to see the specific farm mentioned one each menu item, just like a wine would be attributed on its list.
