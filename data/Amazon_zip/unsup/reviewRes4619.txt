Adored this place. I was in town for a conference and went with a coworker. I love the concept of this place - wine, swine and cheese. We got the cheese plate. I tried to google the cheeses and pick on my own but in the end the waiter helped guide us and the combo of choices was great. I had the beets with goat cheese and pistachios. Yum! And we wanted one pork dish so we tried a super soft melt in your mouth shoulder with whipped potatoes. Seriously some of the best cooked pork. And save room for the dessert! The nutella panini is so good! The wait staff was great! Well informed, helpful and funny. Great lively atmosphere if a tad loud and quite crowded!
