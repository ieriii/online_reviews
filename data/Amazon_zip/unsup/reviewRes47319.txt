We just got back from eight days in London and wanted something we take for granted in Chicago but is sorely lacking there: Great burgers and great beer. I ordered the Arson burger and the always reliable Two Hearted Ale. They were delicious. We sat at the bar and the service was great. The bartender gave me a tip that I'll pass along to you: If you get the arson burger, cut up and spread around the Scotch Bonnet pepper. I'm so very serious about this. If you don't, well, let me put it this way: The pain you'll suffer won't be limited to your time at the bar. You're welcome. Last night we witnessed about 1/2 of an AC/DC show, including waaay-too-long guitar solos, followed by an Iron Maiden show filmed when men covered head-to-toe in spandex sporting permed hair with awesome bangs somehow posed a threat to our youth (see: Tipper Gore). Music changes daily and is posted on their website; you may want to check what's on before heading over or you might find yourself "enjoying" hours of nu-metal with your burger and beer.
