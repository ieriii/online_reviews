Tried this place for the first time last week with long-time, a.k.a. "old," college friends. Right off the bat, I liked the fact that we found easy street parking. Glenn's is small and cozy. We had to wait for our friends to be seated, and there was no room to stand around, but when they got there, our table was ready and waiting for us. In addition, while we waited, the host offered a drink menu and took orders. Our server was friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and patient. I am pretty easy to please when it comes to ordering food, but one of my friends needed almost everything explained and our server was more than up to the task. He made solid recommendations from beers to appetizers to types of fish and everything was spot on. He recommended this shrimp appetizer (unfortunately I can't remember the name at the moment) but it comprised of melted cheese, butter and shrimp. Need I say more? It was delicious! Also, I loved the Texas-sized toast that seemed to be served with everything. Good call Glenn's chefs... good call! All 3 of my Bloody Mary's were meals in-and-of-themselves and very tasty. My lobster fettuccini was plentiful and quite good. We had kind of a loud crowd, but the food was good, the atmosphere was cool and we all left happy and promising to return. All-in-all, I highly recommend Glenn's Diner for dinner!
