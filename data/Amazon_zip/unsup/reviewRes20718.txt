Came here last Thursday for a business lunch. I had been here before for a drink after work and was thoroughly impressed. Let me first review my first occasion at The Gage. A group of us stopped in here after work for a few birthday drinks. The manager was walking around to the tables and seeing how everyone was doing. When he approached our table he asked what brought us in that day and we mentioned a birthday. No sooner could we sneeze and the manager brought out 2 appetizers and 5 glasses of champagne. We were confused at first but he told us that he was thankful we made The Gage our choice that day and that this was on the house. This was the greatest show of hospitality I have ever received. We ended up still only staying for a few drinks but made certain to compensate the establishment well for their hospitality. My second occasion at The Gage was last Thursday as I already stated. Came in for a lunch and I was blown away AGAIN!! My coworker and I sat down an immediately offered bread and water. A couple minutes later our waiter came by and explained the specials of the day and let us think about our choices. I had no choice to make, the soup special of red pepper & butternut squash was right up my alley as was the sandwich special of the day...a slow cooked pork shoulder topped with tomato, onion and coleslaw on a Cuban roll. My coworker ordered the same and both of us were licking our hands and plates at the end. The sandwich was so tasty, tender and juicy, I wanted more!! The sandwich was accompanied by french fried and a half of a pickle. This sandwich BY FAR is the best pork sandwich I have ever had. The staff was extremely friendly and the interior made me feel like I was at some high-powered luncheon. My two experiences here definitely warrant my 5-star rating.
