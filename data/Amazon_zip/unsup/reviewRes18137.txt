Ti amo Caro Mio. (English Translation: I love Caro Mio) Caro Mio actually means my beloved, or my darling or dear in Italian. Just a little interpretation for you little yelpies... (plus your date might be quite impressed with your knowledge of the Italian language!) Hands down the best Italian food experience I've had in Chicago! I'm being for real here. First off, BYOB, (these restaurants are becoming my favorite), and no corkage fee. I am a huge fan for the no charging a dude to open my wine for me because their business doesn't offer alcohol. Thank you for that. My boyfriend took me here on one of our first dates. He couldn't have picked a better place. We were one of the 2 tables in there, but we did venture in close to the time the restaurant closed. I imagine a time closer to dinner time, the place would be packed. I loved the decor, the ambiance and the romantic feeling I had the moment I walked in. Bonus Points for the boyfriend. I knew exactly what I had a taste for and Caro Mio served me exactly what I wanted. I ordered the linguini frutta di mare (seafood with linguini in a spicy, red sauce) and it was unbelievable. My boyfriend ordered the veal parmesan. Fantastic. Nothing was over-priced and it was very reasonable. Our waiter was awesome. Wasn't there every two seconds to check on every bite. Was there just enough to not be over-bearing. Thumbs up! I loved this place and am hoping my boyfriend decides to take me back there soon! hint, hint! :)
