Wow, I never knew I could like hot dawgs with such a passion until I went to this place. My friends and family and I saw it on "Check Please!" on PBS, that great Chicago restaurant review television show. We swung by the neighborhood (if swinging by means going 30 mins out of our way) on our way up north, and are we glad that we did. I'm also glad I didn't drive, otherwise my poor suburban heart might have had a heart attack. However, once you've parked your car in your little ordering spot, the rest of the world simply disappears as you order your meal through the intercom. The novelty of this place is simply amazing. Two giant hot dogs on top of a building? Dressed liked Tarzan and Pollyanna? Waiters who bring your food to your car and attach it to the window using hi-tech plastic trays? A hot dawg (superdawg) that lays in this retro-red box smothering a bunch of french fries? It's worth it just to see the hot dogs with the blinking red eyes on top of the building, but even if that's not really your thing, the hot dawgs are the best I've ever had, and I don't usually consider myself a fan of hot dogs. I also caved in and had a small shake (delicious) and enjoyed the tasty fries. I would love to try something other than a hot dawg (superdawg, excuse me), at one time, but I just don't think I can bring myself to branch out. I would not enjoy the full Superdawg experience (car, waiter, et all) by myself, only with a group to share the fun with. However I would probably be content walking to the take out window and ordering something to go. There is a Superdawg in Midway Airport that I find myself able to visit more often than the one up North, however the service there is not nearly as much fun, the food tends to be greasier than the main location, and there is no hot dog dressed up like Tarzan on the roof of Midway.
