I can't believe I haven't reviewed one of my favorite brunch stops! Wishbone is pretty awesome. Don't get me wrong I love ethnic food, but I also get the urge to go back to my southern roots from time to time. (Yes. Florida is still technically the south, even if I don't have the accent).    Don't get me wrong this isn't a hillbilly joint by any stretch. The atmosphere is kind of artsy. Think if a Chicken ran head first into the future, that's the decor at wishbone (if you go there that will actually make sense, I swear). Plus they have a lot of seating so you won't have to wait as long (if at all on the weekends). Moreover, the service is consistently good.    I consider myself to be somewhat of Shrimp and Grits connoisseur and Wishbone may have the best I've ever tasted. The Grits are sauteed in bacon and the shrimp is hearty and delicious.The make some pretty mean eggs too.   Overall, a delightful brunch experience!
