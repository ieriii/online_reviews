Not getting the hype over this place.....waited an hour, typical for Chicago Sunday brunch so no biggie. Waitress was sweet. I asked if the strada could be done without sausage since I am a vegetarian.......can't do it...ok fine....I get it...I ordered the market scramble...they're out of it..really.......what exactly are you out of but they could do the market omelette......Then my SIL wanted a side of mixed greens.......can't do it...have to order an entire salad........come on........put a few greens on a plate and charge 3 bucks....are you kidding me. My husband wanted some fresh onions for his burger....nope can't do it. They are definitely not about pleasing their customers...it's pretty much you get what you get and how we want you to get it........no exceptions! NOT GOING BACK EVER! Only cool thing about this place was we saw Danny Devito and Rhea Perlman there. My bro and SIL got their pic taken with Danny...cool stuff...
