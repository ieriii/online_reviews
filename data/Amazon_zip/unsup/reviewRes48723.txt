The food was great. We ordered the morcialla, Blood Sausage; Steak tartar; Oysters and Sweetbreads. The selection of beer was outstanding, and paired with all of the food in a great way. We were very happy with the selections and pleasantly surprised with the great ambiance that was presented at the 10pm reservation. This is a great gem in the city.
