One of the sad facts of my life is that I don't like Thai. My husband, on the other hand, loves it. So, what do we do? We eat at (or carry out from) Indie Cafe! And I absolutely adore their sushi.We've never had a meal there we didn't like (and we've had many). We like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Both of us has a some favorite dishes. Mine are gyoza, asparagus tempura maki, spicy tuna maki, and spicy sake maki. A perfect meal. Sigh. He loves the miso soup and the edamame, and has a few Thai dishes that are standards for him.Everything is always fresh. We're going to miss it when we move (next week).Not enough for me to lower my rating, though my husband might - apparently the gentleman who takes the phone orders has problems with communication. It's not a language barrier, so I'm not sure what the problem is.
