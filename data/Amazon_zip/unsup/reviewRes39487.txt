Okay, so this was my 1st experience with Korean BBQ. Let me start out by saying the BBQ part was REALLY good. As for the rest, I'm not sure what to think. I understand that no one there speaks any English and cannot communicate the menu, and that's fine. However, I would really appreciate there was an explanation of BBQ on the menu. If that's too tacky or non traditional, some written material should be available on request, or at the very least, when a confused ignorant customer comes in like myself.  The woman that seated us had a very angry look in her eye that made me think I had just crashed a party. She took me to our table and our waitress. I asked the waitress what she recommended. Without hesitation, she fingered another waitress and all she could say was "rib" and "chicken" and "good." That sounded fine I thought.  They proceeded to throw 20 plates of food, the BBQ, BBQ setup, the appetizers, water, and drinks all at once and then left, never to return until they cleared the table.  I tried to ask the latino bus boy in Spanish what was going on, but he was just as clueless as I was. Maybe it was his 1st day.  I've had Korean cuisine but never the BBQ. I would have Korean BBQ again, but i did not think I had to research Korean BBQ before I went in. Silly me. If they want to mimic a Korean restaurant with foreign service, I'm fine, just know that I'm going to give a standard foreign tip which is far less than the domestic standard of 20%.
