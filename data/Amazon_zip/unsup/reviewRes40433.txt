Its 2am in the morning in Wicker Park.... Im a bit drunk and a lot hungry.  In the near distance I can see the blinking lights of Flash Taco. I start to make my move. Wait!!! I suddenly stop...a new thought enters my head (most likely prompted by my stomach, as it was bracing for bad mexican food intake).....LA PASADITA!!! Yes, its maybe a 15 minute walk down Milwaukee Ave, but thats a small price to pay for taco perfection. I stumble away from the line of waiting Flash Tacoites and head toward taco heaven....my stomach is happy. La Pasadita. My favorite taco stop in Chicago....hands down!! The steak tacos are out-of-this-world.  The meat is juicy, tasty, just plain awesome. Dont fancy up your tacos too much at this place....only a bit of onion and cilantro is needed to make the perfect taco. Grab a horchata and a steal one of those bottles of green hot sauce....and your perfect late night meal is all ready to go!!!  The tacos are equally as impressive while eaten sober during the day.....which is really the true test for a taco joint.
