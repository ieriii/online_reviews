I love this place and find myself randomly thinking about my next visit.  Let me start by saying the vegetable bisque soup is amazing. They bring it out before you get your crepe, it's so delicious and flavorful. I ordered the Greek crepe on my first visit and was blown away by the flavor and quality of ingredients. I had to order it again when I went back for the second time. My roommate and I have been impressed with this place and our love for it grows with each and every visit. I am happy to report that they pay attention to detail. The cucumber water is a nice touch and they continuously refill my glass. I drink a lot of water with my meals and they have never had a problem keeping up. The staff has been pretty consistant, fast and friendly on both of our visits. Overall this cafe is cute and quaint with amazing food.
