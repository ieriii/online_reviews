I CAN GET FAT HERE AGAIN After Yelping about an unsavory encounter at The Publican several months ago, I promptly received an unexpected yet welcome call from Kimberly, the GM, who sincerely apologized for the incident and offered to make things right. And make things right, she did. My friend and I were well taken care of and experienced all the things that makes this place so great: farm fresh food, incredible beers, and expert service. We were seated in one of the pens and paired with Justin, an excellent server who made some great beer recommendations, among them the Monk's Cafe Flemish Sour Ale. We stared with the charcuterie plate with a delightful assortment of cured meats, the star being the duck terrine. Next up was the suckling pig (good, but not eye-rollingly good) and the farm chicken which was just as wonderful as it was the first time I had it. Finally, we ended the meal on a soaring high note with the incredibly refreshing blueberry granita. Imagine cool indigo flakes of ice, rich cream, and fresh blueberries. It was the perfect recommendation (thanks Justin) for a balmy summer night. Thank you, Publican! All is forgiven.
