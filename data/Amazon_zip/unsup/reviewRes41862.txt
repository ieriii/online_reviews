Went here for Restaurant Week. This was my first time at the Chicago location and like the other locations I've been to, it doesn't disappoint. Maybe not quite a 4, but definitely not a 3. Now why go to a chain restaurant for restaurant week? Because they were able to accommodate the large group of guys I put together for steak night. Plus Ruth's Chris is also a great value for Restaurant Week. The ribeye alone on their menu is $39. And the portions for the appetizer and side are large. Despite it being a chain, it's still one of the best steak houses in Chicago. The preparation seems pretty simple - cook it super hot and add lots of butter - but the result is excellent.  The 3 courses I had were the seafood gumbo, 12 oz ribeye with mashed potatoes, and desert symphony (only choice for restaurant week). The gumbo was good, nothing special. The ribeye was excellent as always - as was the mashed potatoes. And the desert symphony was a pleasant surprise. The fresh berries and sweet cream was exactly that - very fresh and very sweet and very creamy. The chocolate mouse was good as well. The only down side is it looks like they packed in more tables for Restaurant week. Felt a bit cramped, but we were able to get my party of 7 in.
