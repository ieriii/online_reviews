Me and my daughter had the most amazing experience here. I brought her to celebrate her high school graduation. We didn't have reservations but that wasn't a problem. I don't know where to start. The decor was beautiful! There was a lady inside a transparent wall just spinning around. How awesome is that?! The food-Lawd! It was really good! My faves were the bacon wrapped chicken breast medallions, sweet fried bananas, chicken and arugula salad, potatoes au gratin, Brazilian sausage and the pork loin. The salad bar although not large does not disappoint. The desserts are just sinful to look at! I decided on the papaya cream(papaya mixed with vanilla ice cream I believe, with some liquor on top if you'd like, which I did) and my daughter had the coconut chess pie a la mode. They were both really effen good!!!! Actually I enjoyed all the food. I made sure I tried every damn thing! I was sooo full. The only things I didn't care for were the parmesan chicken and filet mignon and I honestly can't understand why they were not good but I wasn't feeling them. Our waiter was sooo sweet. It was just a really good experience. It's $50 for dinner. Alcoholic drinks start at around $7 and desserts start at around $9. If you decide to go, go hungry! Do not eat before you go! I'm glad that I went because a few of the reviews had me leaning towards not going. I guess you just have to judge for yourself. It was definitely worth it to me.
