We've finally found our pizza place here in Chicago! My husband and I have tried the various deep dish pies. Unfortunately, we weren't won over by this city wide attraction.  Piece is what pizza is supposed to be (or atleast for me). The pizzas are huge, very affordable and pack the flavor. Topping options are limitless and you choose from white, red or plain (but, the "plain" is far from plain ... it's truly delicious). Thin crisp crust offers toppings to the edge of every bite. And the perfect beverage to wash down all this yummy goodness ... well, have your pick. Piece offers a wide variety of beers, but I highly recommend the handcrafted brews. And if you find one you really love they sell growlers to go.
