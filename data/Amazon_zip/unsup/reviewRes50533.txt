LOVE IT!!!!! I came to visit family in Chicago for the holidays and found this place through Yelpers. Being from San Francisco, I have my nose a little out of joint and have pretty high standards for good food but Big Jones shut me up fast. The ambiance is simple and elegant like a spot that you would find in New Orleans. We had a bunch of their appetizers and there were all incredible. The crawfish fritters were especially good. When I asked out absolutely adorable waiter, Danny, what he recommended off of the menu he told me the burger. WHAT?? This is a cajun spot!! But that was the recommendation and I went for it. One thing that I loved it that you could choose a side item like friend okra (sooo goooood) and mac and cheese (OMG!!!). The burger came out perfect. Juicy with fontina cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms. It was a lot of food and I couldn't even think of finishing it. Everything else that came out to my friends was equally good. Grits and shrimp, pulled pork sandwich, pecan crusted catfish. All super good. Oh yeah. We had desert and that was even incredible. Go there If you have a hankering for cajun or just wanting good food. You will not regret it.
