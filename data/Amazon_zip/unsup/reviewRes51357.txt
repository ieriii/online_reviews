A newly acquired friend of mine and I ate here the other day and as usual it was great. I've been coming here for awhile now and never have a bad experience. I usually get the bistec a la mexicana, which is nice and spicy. Their salsa is awesome. A lot of times I just call in an order for rice, beans and an order of chips and salsa to go. Their burrito is gigantic and I'm also a big fan of their fajitas. Also their guacamole is made with the hand of Jesus or Satan. I'm really not sure which, but it is so damn good. I would have given them 5 stars, but their service is pretty crappy most of the time. They just don't seem to want to be at work. Maybe it's because they always seem to be so busy. I can overlook the service because their food is so good.
