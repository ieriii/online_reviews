I always feel so trendy at Artopolis. It's a gorgeous location with the most beautiful desserts, these little works of art that seem a shame to destroy with a fork or spoon. They taste as good, if not better than they look - it's really remarkable. I've never eaten a meal there, but it's a regular stop after dinner at a Greektown restaurant or occasionally just after a hard day at work. The staff is always exceedingly friendly. Definitely a favorite place.
