Just go. JUST GO! Options are plentiful, food is tasty and cheap, and service is quick (although don't ask too many questions as the servers are busy). I've been here too many times to count. I've had many of their dishes and they are all good. Try their DUCK SALAD with ginger sauce, it is awesome. It's a great hangover joint, or dinner place with family and friends. Not a great first date place as it can be loud, crowded and the atmosphere is a little lacking. If you're getting their bubble smoothies make sure they're using fresh fruit (sometimes they use powder and it's not so good).
