I had Friday night reservations for 3 at 9:00 pm which I made 2 weeks in advance - I heard this place was great and one of my friends visiting for the weekend said she wanted good Italian... We had to wait for 30 minutes in a cramped doorway. When we were seating, we had a table in the back corner closest to the curtain that hides the restrooms. The food was not anything great, but perhaps I ordered the wrong dish. I will try to come back once more beause I know it's highly recommended.
