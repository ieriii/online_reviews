I stopped by this place after my man saw the sign for specials. 2 slices of pizza for $6. You can't beat that! The staff seemed a little confused.. not sure if it was a langauge barrier :) We had a slice of the sausage and the margherita pizza. The sausage was a little spicy for my taste... but I did like the cheese and the crust. Will definitely go back when I am around the area. Fresh food. Huge selections!!!
