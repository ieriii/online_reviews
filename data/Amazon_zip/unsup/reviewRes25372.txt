Came here on a recent Sunday with some friends and family around 8:P.M. If you are looking too hard, you will probably miss it, since it looks like someone's house-literally. When you walk in, you do get this really warm, inviting feeling. The place is cozy, and on this particular night, there weren't too many people there to eat deep dish pizza. The family was smart enough to order ahead of time. This is something I would definitely recommend. Within 5 minutes from when we arrived the pizzas were ready. We were all vegetarian and the waitstaff was very understanding of that. Now I am not a big lover of deep dish pizza, and have not had it in years. The pizza was good, nothing I would write home about and go out of my way to visit all the time. There was too much sauce for my taste, the cheese was okay and the crust was overcooked. You need a steak knife to cut through this thing properly. I was literally stabbing and cutting. The service was really friendly. It's a great place to go to hang out, stay as long as you want, and be treated really well. It's definitely worth checking out if you are in the area.
