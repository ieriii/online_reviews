I had the Hombre Burger, and it was honestly one of the best burgers I've ever had. I also had some of the sausage pizza, which was also delicious. They've got an awesome beer selection, I tried a couple different ones that were all good in their own way. I'm sure I'll find myself here again in the near future.
