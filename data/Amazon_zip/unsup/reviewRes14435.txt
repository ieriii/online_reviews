The food is generally good here, if a little pricey for what it is - especially breakfast! I would not ever recommend the mussels - they basically come in a garlic butter soup with cheese grated on top. Maybe it's just me, but mussels+cheese=no. The wait staff has always been great and the space itself is pretty cool. Gets packed for the evenings though so make a reservation or be prepared to wait.
