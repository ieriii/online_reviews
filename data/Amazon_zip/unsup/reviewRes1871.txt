They make damn good dogs here. The chicago dog is crisp and the fixins are bright and appealing to they eye and the taste buds. The specialty dogs are very unique in taste and not like anything you would find anywhere else. Cheese fries are good too: it looks like nacho cheese sauce but it doesnt taste like nacho cheese. The line is long, but its worth the wait and when you get to ordering theres always a table that opens up for seating. Theres usually an ice cream truck too in the warmer months to spoil your apetite while youre waiting. The outside guard is a nice touch when Doug is on vacation.
