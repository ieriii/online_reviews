It's only NOT a five star rating, because it's not quite KC Barbecue quality which is the standard I put against all other BBQ restaurants after it. First, it was a busy Saturday night but I booked a reservation three days in advance and did not wait a single minute for our table. We were rushed upstairs to our seating next to the TV lounge area and had a great view overlooking the rest of the restaurant including an incredible glowing collage of the Virginia countryside where apparently the owner once lived. The entire room was incredibly well lit and the finishes throughout the restaurant and bar were clean and modern looking. Our server was attentive and very well-versed in the entire menu and immediately recommended two great starters for us - the mac n cheese and kobe beef baked beans! We paired them with our pulled pork and pulled chicken entrees and it was an incredible mix of meat, beans, and pasta! There were also four custom sauces to dip from and all were very tasty - even the tarty mustard-based sauce. The whole night was incredible and we had tons of leftovers to boot! Thank you fore everything.
