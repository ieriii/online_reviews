This place is definitely a meatlovers paradise! I usually go when i get the great deals via email with a couple of my guy friends or my boyfriend, all of whom are total carnivors. I love the salad bar and the huge selection they have. you cannot go wrong with a nice salad, some fresh sears tuna, and they even have a sushi bar that you can order certain maki rolls from. The lobster bisque is decent for an all you can eat type place, but are you really going for the soup? No, so skip it if you want and go right for the main course. They have all kinds of meats from Legs of lamb, steaks, chicken, pork and a special spicy spanish sausage. Pick and choose what you want, I recommend any of the beef dishes and anything they wrap in bacon. LOL Also if you get a chance to have some cocktails, they have a few drinks similar to the cuban Mojitos that you will just love!!! Make a reservation for two or a party of 20, enjoy and remember to pace yourself, there is lots to enjoy and they are in no rush to put you out!!!
