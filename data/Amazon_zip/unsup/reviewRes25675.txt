I was planning a day trip to Chicago and relied on Yelp for the best suggestions. With over 900 reviews and still at 4 stars, I assumed that this place was going to be superb. We walked in and there was a huge blast of heat, pretty nice coming from the 30ish degree weather outside. We were greeted rather quickly and sat instantly. Our waitress was really nice and attentive, I don't know her name but she is blonde if that helps. :P We had the lunch special, the personal deep dish pizzas, garlic bread and jalapeo poppers for our apps. I don't know if it's just me or maybe we came on an off day.. but I felt like I have had much better pizza. The jalapeo poppers and garlic bread were good, but the pizza. Maybe I just don't like Chicago pizza? Maybe because it was the lunch special? No idea but my boyfriend didn't really rave about it either.
