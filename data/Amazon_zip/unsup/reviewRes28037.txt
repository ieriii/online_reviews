Nuevo Leon is another one of those establishments that has been around since I was a chamaca. Unfortunately their quality has not improved over time. Good place to take the familia, but not the best Mexican food in town by far. Not even the best Mexican food in Pilsen. My mom makes better. It's way too greasy, the service isn't very good, and sometimes there is a funny smell in the front room by the kitchen. Since the redevelopment of Pilsen it's become the gringo-friendly establishment as it's not as intimidating as some of the other family restaurants on 18th (like the ostioneria across the street, which is actually pretty decent.) Probably kind of what it feels like for me trying to choose which Korean restaurant I'll venture into on 8th...
