I love that Irazu's delivery zone covers most of where I go in the city. Theoretically, I can have t brought to me in 4 different neighborhoods (ranging from the West Loop to the Loop to Lakeview and if I were over by Skylark, I could get them to bring me a torta and a salad. Actually, I just realized that I can have them bring me food to Gold Star, cause they allow outside food. Aw. some. Yes, I've ordered delivery from here on Grub Hub. It always takes about an hour if you order when you are on the far north side (read: Lakeview) but it is SO. WORTH IT. I mean, really. If I want a delicious salad with beets in it, and an oatmeal shake and some tacos or a torta or all of those, I am going to order this and have it brought to me if I don't feel like putting on shoes. And I don't mind waiting because the food is always ready to be eaten! Really, can you name another Latin restaurant that offers a plethora of options that will also deliver in such a large expanse of the city? If so, I shall add that to my list.  Last time I got delivery, I had an oatmeal-soursop shake (I wanted tamarind and oatmeal but tamarind is not yet an option on GrubHub), the shrimp salad and a taco tico. The taco tico probably is better ordered in the restaurant since it's a taquito with salsa on it which was pretty messy, but everything was super tasty! The salad was good and had plenty of shrimp and the right mix of dressing to go with everything. Seriously though, I think that I will order delivery from Irazu to Gold Star next time I'm there. Class that place up.
