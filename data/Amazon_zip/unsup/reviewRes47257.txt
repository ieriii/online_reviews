"Faggot" is not decor. About five minutes after we sat down, just after we'd ordered our burgers, my partner got really pissed off. The wall behind me was covered in graffiti -- ostensibly part of the prison theme -- including a sketch of a woman's head, a penis, and the word "faggot" in bright yellow paint. My partner was having the visceral reaction which is typical of almost anyone who's had that word flung in his face: fury. "It was drawn by a lesbian," we were informed. The sole justification provided. Putting aside that "faggot" is usually directed at men and not women, I'm pretty shocked that the manager thought that this was somehow a reasonable explanation. Lesbians, of course, are just as capable as straight people of making stupid decisions, whether artistic or, in this case, commercial. And last I checked my gay guide, there's no carte blanche within our community for using that slur (especially just to make money). The math of this is pretty simple. I don't give my business to people who scribble "faggot" on their walls. We got up and left.
