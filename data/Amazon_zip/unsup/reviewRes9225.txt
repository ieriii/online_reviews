Despite warnings to get home before the bulk of the blizzard hit - I decided to treat myself to a little (more like A LOT) of French-Vietnamese grub. A few things to note: This place is a 10 on the romantic scale (unfortunately I wasn't on a date) (sad). Great Mango Margaritas & Lychee Martinis 3 appetizers - CHAO TOM (Grilled shrimp wrapped around sugar cane, with angel-hair noodles, mint, cilantro, & lettuce, with peanut plum dipping sauce) OKAY - the other stuff just acts like a garnish and I mistakenly ate the sugarcane. GOI CUON (Soft salad rolls of shrimp, rice vermicelli, lettuce, bean sprouts, & aromatic herbs in rice paper, with peanut plum dipping sauce) AWESOME. TOM CUON RAM (Crisp beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken, & vegetables, Served with orange ginger dipping sauce) good TWO MAIN DISHES CA CHIEN SAIGON (Crisp, seared whole red snapper with a light, spicy-sour sauce) - tasty and they will fillet if for you so you don't have to dig through the bone. MI XAO DO BIEN (Stir-fried shrimp, scallops, calamari, & mixed vegetables over pan-fried egg noodles with a light garlic oyster sauce) Overall, it was good but I wish the sauce had a little more flavor. Recap, I'll"ll be back with a lover, in the summer, and I'll eat the red snapper. The red snapper was the only dish that gave me the flavor I was looking for. Everything else just needed to be turned up a notch Oh shoot, I almost forgot dessert. Fried Banana Wonton - Seriously, that shit is bananas. I'd go back for that alone.
