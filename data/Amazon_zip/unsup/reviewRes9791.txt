Sprout's brunch is unimaginable! My bf read the review in the Red Eye, so we decided to try it out this past Sunday. The menu is a combination of items that I would've never thought would go well together, but after trying the Skirt Steak & Eggs, Oatmeal, and Rhubarb Waffle we were more then pleasantly surprised! In addition to the mouth-watering brunch items, the decor and staff were the icing on the cake. Very attentive and friendly service! I also liked how Dale occasionally walked around his restaurant to check on things! Very enjoyable Sunday
