This place is basically a Cheesecake Factory with a nicer view and a slightly different menu. Portions and the menu are both equally large. Our waitress warned us about the generous portions at least 3x. That said, I do like the Cheesecake Factory, so I wasn't disappointed here either. Almost everything was decent, though nothing was spectacular. The three of us split the Sonoma salad, margherita pizza, and the chicken royale/short ribs combo. The chicken royale was the only thing that fell short of expectations as it lacked flavor and had an overly thick breading. We decided to bring about half the food home so we could get a slice of cheesecake for dessert. The cheesecake comes straight from the Cheesecake Factory, so it's standard, but I liked it! This place is very crowded and doesn't take reservations so go early!
