Best breakfast I've had in a long time. Cajun/Southern homestyle cookin'. We avoided this place for a while because the chef is a big asshole to delivery drivers. And I have one very close to my heart. But my delivery man swallowed his pride because of what all the Yelpers said.... We are both glad he did. We had the farmstead biscuits, made to order. The jelly is what really makes you swoon. Chicken and waffles, that morning. I sure do hope it stays. Its just ridiculously good. Dont question it, just get it. The Eggs New Orleans is also amazing. But if I could do it all over, I'd get 2 chicken and waffles. just go. Enjoy the biscuits.
