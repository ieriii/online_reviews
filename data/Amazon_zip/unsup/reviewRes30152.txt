Would love to give Frontera Grill "5 Stars," but alas I can't. It wouldn't be fair, because I only had dinner and dessert. However, my Blue Agava Margarita, the house specialty, and chocolate dipped bunelo covered with fresh peaches and blueberries and topped with tequila-lime creme fraiche was EXCELLENT!
