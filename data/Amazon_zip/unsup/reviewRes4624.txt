A wonderful reason to go to Chicago - Wine, swine and cheese at the Purple Pig. I LOVE good, amazing, fresh, unforgettable food.  I would expect to find this in a hole in the wall family owned place in Southern Italy, not on the Magnificent Mile.  i was in town for a conference and yelped/googled possible restaurants for a small dinner with co-workers. This place lives up to the hype. 8 of us went for a long lunch. I was worried about waiting in line, since they do not take reservations, but we walked right in. We put ourselves in the hands of an amazing wait staff and enjoyed the best meal. The atmosphere is inviting and open, each small plate (we had 12 of them) was more delicious that the next. We ordered two of the fried deviled eggs (yes, that's what I said), and the pork neck with ricotta, which is the cook's family recipe. We are an eclectic bunch of 8 and every palate was delighted. Oh and don't forget to try an interesting wine. I had a Spanish red recommended by the wait staff. I can't wait to come back.
