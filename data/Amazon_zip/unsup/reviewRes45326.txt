After many years of wanting to go to wilde--- I finally did! it was for a friend's birthday. Um, first, the host had the coolest accent in the world. I guess it was irish, but it wasn't your typical irish that you hear in movies or that leprechauns have. It was like dodgy irish, well, what I'd imagine the people who live way out in the country have. When he seated us, I didn't understand a word he said. It was AWESOME. He was like "billy on the slots yadda right there." Or something. I made that up, but he might as well have said that. Did you understand that? Yeah, didn't think so. The interior of the restaurant was also fun... but a little too dark for my taste. Yes, I know it's a bar of sorts, but I hate it when 1. you can't see the person you're talking to and 2. you can't hear the person your'e talking to. Clearly, I just gave it away, I am not cool. So anyway, I ordered a shepard's pie, which was good, but nothing special. My friend got the mac and cheese which was super delicious! Despite her saying she didn't want chicken in her mac and cheese, they put it in. It was ok but I'd stick to no chicken. Anyway overall, a fun experience, nothing amazing, but I liked it.
