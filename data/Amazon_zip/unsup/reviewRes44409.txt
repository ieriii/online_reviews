I've been Wakamono twice. The service is friendly and the small store front restaurant is beautiful. I really want to like this place. The first time I went I was disappointed in the food, but my partner thought it was a good value. I gave it a second try last week--treating my 16 year old niece to her first sushi experience. The vegetable tempura was limp; the chef's maki roll selection was mushy and the sushi did not taste particularly fresh. Not a great impression to leave with a first timer to sushi. Maybe they will improve, but I doubt that I will be back very soon--there are too many good sushi restaurants in Chicago to bother with this one.
