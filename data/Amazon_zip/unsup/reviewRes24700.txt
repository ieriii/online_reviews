I would have to say that this place serves the best casual Latin food in Chicago...hands down! I had the pepino sandwhich this afternoon and it was awesome. The guac wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be, given the amazing fried yucca and garlic oil, but it was still worthy of dipping. Also, I had a passion fruit smoothy that made me want to scream, it was so good. It sounds like a pretty simple thing to make, but you'd be surprised to find that so many Latin restaurants in Chicago don't serve anything like that. Our server, Chris, and the cashier guy were pretty cool too. It would be nice if they accepted credit cards, but it would seriously take a lot to make me not return...soon!
