I really love Carnivale. It is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and my boyfriend and I normally try to go once a month or on special occasions. Every time we go to Carnivale we are treated extra special and never leave unsatisfied for everything we've eaten there has been spectacular. I almost forgot the Ropa Vieja is a must have!
