Ok, I was a Chef for 16 years and THIS place made me miss cooking Classical French. My wife however is an extremely picky eater...I'll leave her at that. Reading the menu, it made me think of Le Francais or Park Hyatt LaTour from back in the 80's where I worked. I haven't seen Sweetbreads or truffles used in a menu in years. It seems that most people are losing the classic side and eating basic food. The service here was great, from the front door to the server. Everyone wants to make you happy here. My wife ordered the burger and was happy with that. I ordered the meatballs for an appetizer and then the house made pork sausage for dinner. The sausage is served on a roll but it's impossible to eat it that way. I would like to have tried some of the other entree options but I honestly had no idea what to expect, I only read about it in Esquire an hour earlier. Also, we had 2 tiny tastes of split pea soup and Monkfish, both were incredible. To be honest, what I had was OK but it wasn't what this place is emphasizing. This is Artisan French, not "PUB FOOD", as I assumed. I'm going to have to go again and break out my party palate. But please, be open minded when ordering. The food is creative, tasty and well executed.
