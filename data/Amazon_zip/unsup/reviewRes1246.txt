I can't believe I waited for an hour and a half at a hot dog place. And guess what? I'll do it again. Maybe if you're lucky, an ice cream truck will come along while you're waiting, too! Yes, bring cash (which reminds me, I need to send Dave a check) and check their hours and specials online before you come.
