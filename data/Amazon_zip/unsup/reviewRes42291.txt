As I sit here almost blinded because I'm so full, I have to tell you I am now a believer and will be attending the Church of the art of pizza more often. We ordered a 14-inch pan and a two-liter for delivery it was 23 dollars and that is not too shabby. The pizza had a lot of cheese, but the sauce was lacking a bit. I just wish they would put more on the pizza. The sauce was very tasty and the cheese was great. They put some serious seasoning on that bad boy as well. The crust is good, but a little too doughy at the end for my tastes. I think if you asked for it well done it would be better. The toppings were plentiful one side had mushrooms and the other side jalapenos. I can't speak for the mushrooms, but the Jalapenos were awesome. My ass will not be thanking me in morning. My mouth is on fire at the moment, but that's always a good decision. If you aren't sweating you aren't eating is what I always say. (I have no idea what the hell I just said) Delivery is where this place loses a star. An hour and 47 minutes huh? Another five minutes and I would have started eating my fingers and toes. I know it's pan and I know it was Friday, but I could have made my own pan pizza, had sex with myself...twice, and knitted a sweater in half the time. I'm surprised people weren't murdered while I was waiting. In conclusion this place will get my money again. I wish I could take Peqoud's caramelized crust, Lou's Sausage, and Art's cheese to create the Perfect Pan Pizza! We can call it the Art of Louqoud's pizza and we shall rule the WORLD!
