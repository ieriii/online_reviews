We used to go to Yolk all of the time and most of the time walked out with just a so so experience.  The one thing I noticed on several occasions is that the waitstaff is pretty unattentive. For some reason my brother who lives out of town loves to eat here, probably because he lives in Houston, TX with no better options except iHop and Waffle House...lol...j/k  The last time he went there he said the waitstaff was absolutely awful, they were ending up having to walk up the bar and asking for refills and other things. Unacceptable.... I hate waiting for an hour to eat on the weekend and end up having mediocre food. I usually get the BLT, just ok, nothing to write home about. As well, I've tried some of their breakfast items and they are mediocre as well.  I think the reason why they're packed on the weekend is that there's not a lot of great brunch places in the South Loop. For us, we decided to just skip the brunch and stay home and make our own or head over to Hashbrowns over by UIC.
