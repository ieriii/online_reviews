My husband and I went here because I had purchased a Groupon. Being that this place is a bit on the pricey side, the Groupon was a major help. First, the place is very easy to get to via public transportation. We walked from the Belmont Blue stop. We noticed several buses nearby. The place is really nice and cozy inside and was clean and well-kept. Our server's name was Daniel, and he was excellent. He explained the menu items and was just very friendly and polite. The dishes we had were excellent. I had the vegetarian goulash. One of the main reasons I wanted to try this place as I'm planning a trip to Romania in a couple of years so I thought why not try the cuisine and get a feel for it. The portion size was very large. We also got the flaming cheese appetizer which was delicious.
