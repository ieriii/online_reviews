Expensive, but delicious. We started with the toro (and don't yell at me, but I'd never had it before and discovered I don't like it), and the experienced sushi eater at our table said it was very good. We basically, after that, stuck to basic rolls, and they were as good as anything else we've had. I'd go back, but it will require a bigger outlay of cash than I can normally afford, so...we'll see. I did enjoy sitting out at their small sidewalk cafe section. That was nice. I find myself with very little else to say about it.
