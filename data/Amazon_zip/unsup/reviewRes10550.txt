I've been to Piccolo Sogno twice in the past two months. The patio is one of the prettiest in the city. Feels like you are somewhere else...Italy perhaps.  During my first visit, the food was outstanding. The food was just good during my second visit. Service was excellent on both occasions...very attentive. Contacted the private party coordinator about a future private party. She contacted me and then when I responded with a question, I did not receive a reply.
