A group of 6 of us booked this hotel directly by phone line for the Chicago marathon 2008. We encountered several problems for the first time ever this past year at Embassy Suites. 1. They charged all 3 rooms for all of the nights immediately rather than when we checked in at the desk when we arrived.  2. When we arrived we checked in and went up to our rooms only to find one room occupied by former occupants. The occupants feigned checkout and one stayed behind and let the other back in. Security had to escort them out of the room. Housekeeping didn't come to clean that room until after 5:30 that evening, only after asked to come up more than 4 times. 3. We overheard conversation from another hotel guest exclaiming that they got a "great deal" on priceline of $180 a night whereas we were paying well over $400 a night.  4. There were no apologies made regarding the renegade guest or compensation for the late housekeeping staff.  We will not be returning to this particular embassy suites as the other embassy suites closer to Navy Pier is more than $100 cheaper a night, with better service and no such problems to this date.
