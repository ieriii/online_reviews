I've been here twice in the past month and LOOOVE Rick Bayless. It's always hard to get a table here so come early or be prepared to wait! In true Bayless style the food is uniquely inspired and packed with flavor. Service has always been great, too. Appetizers - Oysters always good. Server reco'd the Sopas last time and they were really uniqe. Some of the ceviches depend on taste so if there are certain flavors you don't like make sure to read all the ingredients first. Entrees - Their Weds special is pork in a banana leaf is really flavorful. Last time I got the vegetarian tamale that was SO good. Amazing sauce and the actual tamale was the best tamale I've ever had. Had a bite of the Carne Asada from others at the table and it was one of the most flavorful steaks I've ever had! It is on the pricier end, but I'm convinced this is because we think Mexican is supposed to be cheap and Bayless has just taken it to the next level.
