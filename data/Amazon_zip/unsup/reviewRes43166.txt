Milk & Honey is one of those cute little places for women who lunch, yuppies who brunch, and families just looking for a good heaping of food. It even has the cutesy-friendly moniker to boot. It's a smallish, crowded joint. Service is counter, and the menu is posted on the big board behind the cash register. The Yelp "Review Highlights" is a sufficient palette highlighting the best of Milk & Honey. The fiance and I went with 2 of the 3: the famous granola and the top-rated huevos rancheros. I did long for a bite of the orange brioche french toast, but went savory over sweet. Next time. The huevos rancheros were dynamite, served casserole style in a medium-sized ramekin. It's available on weekends only, with a healthy scoop of eggs, black beans, tortilla strips, and cheese. It's accompanied by a sauce that tastes more like a New Orleans-style remoulade rather than traditional salsa. It's also delicious and filling. The granola was likewise very good. It came in a large bowl, sitting on a bed of yogurt and accompanied with some fresh fruit. The granola bites were spectacular and quite flavorful. I can see why they've started selling it retail. However, the dried fruit was a little too tough to chew and a bit overwhelming, with the fresh fruit already in the bowl. A dining compatriot picked the turkey reuben, which looked tasty as well and satisfied his hunger pangs. Prices are solid, in the $6-$9 range. Gazing at the drink menu can set you back some. There's fresh-squeezed OJ or grapefruit juice that'll run you $3, as well as Intelligentsia coffee product. Since ordering is counter, you can save some money without the obligatory full-service tip.
