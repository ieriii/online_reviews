Don't know how much I can add here. Ate after a concert Friday night around 12:30 AM; posted closing time is now 3AM, not 5. They open back up at 10 A.M. No parking issue at the late night time. Had Kalbi for two with 24 side dishes plus soup. Flavorful, well porportioned meat, came out quicker than most. Small complaint - midget sized rice which arrived first. Service is fairly peremptory, but they did fill our tea and water. Good value. I love late night Korean food.
