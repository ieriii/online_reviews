Our first meal at our first-ever trip to Chicago, XOCO really sets the bar for the rest of the trip. We avoided the peak times and arrived slightly after 3pm. Great, it's not crazy. But it was a bit disorienting for a first-timer. I knew we needed to wait for a table, but we weren't exactly sure where to wait. I imagine if we went at peak hours it wouldn't be confusing, it would be clear--just follow the long line!!! There was none to follow, only until the host popped-up later. It would've been nice if they have a little sign here to give directions: get in line, wait for table number, then order. Guacamole and salsa were a bit on the salty side, but had a unique flavor, must've been the roasted poblano. It's always a no-brainer for me if either pozole or cubana is on the menu, but when they are both there, I'll be in trouble. Chicken pozole was the chosen one. It (green pozole) was hearty and comfort-foody, its broth was definitely intense and complex (roasted poblano again). Chicken was tender, though interestingly, they were cubes not shredded. It'd be nice if the usual lettuce/radishes/cilantro/dried oregano accompaniments are DIY instead of in the bowl already. No tortilla chips was a bit disappointing. But because the entire bowl made me so happy, I didn't really care. Oh, and the coffee... (Americano), wow.
