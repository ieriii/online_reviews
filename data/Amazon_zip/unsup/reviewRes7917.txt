I know this restaurant has been reviewed a tone of times but I figured I might as well review it. I've been here a few times and to be honest every time I go I end up sick. I just went and I made sure not to eat more than 3 small pieces of meat and something in the seasoning or tenderizer really bothers me. I would say this is a great experience and I'm glad I tried it once but I wont' go back again. The salad bar is great for anyone who is not a meat eater.
