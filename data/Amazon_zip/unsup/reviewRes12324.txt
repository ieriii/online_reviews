There are 99 reviews of this place already, do I really have to yelp about this and be the 100th? Yes. I cannot love their honey jalapeno pork chop more. I try hard to get something new each time I go, but I fail miserably. My boyfriend gets the Cuban Roast Pork always too. We are kind of lame in this regard. The portions are huge here. You get two big thick pork chop piled on top of a heap of mashed sweet potatoes. Plan to save half of it for leftovers. But we do try to branch out with the apps. We have had their soups, coconut shrimp, quesadilla, ceviche, you name it. All are creative and delicious. Try a side of plantains or fried yuca too! We love this restaurant for date night. It's romantic, yet bustling, colorfully decorated. Service is always attentive and efficient.
