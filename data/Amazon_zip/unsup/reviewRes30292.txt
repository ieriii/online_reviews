Sunda's Happy Hour makes all other happy hours seem... Well... Not so happy. Because $6-8 sushi rolls and $10 sake flights? That puts a huge grin on my face. We love their rock shrimp tempura (for all the Chinese food savants, it's a modern take on walnut shrimp). Another HH appetizer that's impressive is the Toast and Jam - an arrangement of mini-toasts and tuna sashimi spread - absolutely delightful.
