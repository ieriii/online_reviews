This Brazilian steakhouse; my friends, is where you should drink, be merry, and allow yourself to be a gluttonous fool..for after the dinner, you will be dizzy with food coma delight! Perfect atmosphere, ambiance, and service where the waitress goes into depth about how this type of restaurant works. Red card up: No meats for now; Green card up: Bring the meat on! My favorite was the garlic beef, Fillet Mignon, and lamb cuts. The salad bar balances the meal out perfectly as well: cheeses, bread, dips, mixed greens, veggies, etc. And if that doesn't sound like it's enough to fill you up for a season long shooting of Survivor, the waiter brings you a side of fried plantains, mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and an additional side of fried potatoes. Dessert? Forget about it! Thank you Chicago for having the finest Brazilian BBQ any girl could ask for!
