Went to Bad Apple last night for a friend's birthday. They have a very extensive beer list, but I don't like beer. I'm sure if I did I would be impressed. :) They do have a few options for cider, though, which I always love to see. I enjoyed the food. We started off with the fried cheese curds; they were delicious! I got the Elvis' Last Supper burger which is topped with homemade peanut butter & bacon. It was really good. However, I think it was slightly overcooked. I like my burgers medium well, but this was definitely well done. If I go back I will order my burger at medium. It was too dry so I couldn't completely enjoy it.
