I wanted to give a good review for this place. Unfortunately, we didn't have the greatest experience. First off, not worth the 1.5 hr wait we had when we got there near opening time on a Sunday. We actually had 1:30pm reservations, but we were hoping more for brunch, so we got there by 10:15a. The hostess escorted us to the waiting standing "bar" area, and we ordered some juice and coffee. As more and more people showed up (a lot of people also had reservations), the ones who didn't have reservations were hanging out with us. At some point, we noticed everyone who arrived after us, somehow got seated first. WTH? They seemed very stingy with their seating, and what I also noticed was that they weren't very efficient in cleaning up and clearing tables out after people left. Onto the food. After we complained twice about waiting so long, we finally got seated, and they offered us complimentary a maple syrup pecan pastry (delicious!) and an apple cake (ok). I have to say, their coffee was really delicious as well, very smooth. But for our main course, I went with the pork belly bibimbap, one of my friends went with the waffle. Waffle was just okay according to my friend, and for me, the kimchi was just waaaay too overpowering in the bibimbap. We also ordered the maple glazed bacon which came out a few minutes after our main courses. It was good. When we wanted to pay our bill, it took a while for our waiter to come back to us. Had to flag him down a few times. Perhaps my experience would have been a lot better had we gotten our desired reservations, but I'd save my time and go somewhere else.
