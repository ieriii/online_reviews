It is a very controversial topic but I believe Giordano's has the best deep dish. They have an awesome crust and the best tomato sauce. I actually crave the deep dish often. The only down side is that, the rest of the things on the menu isn't very delicious or anything. Nothing spectacular but definitely try the pizza!
