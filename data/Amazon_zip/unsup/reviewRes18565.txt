It's been a dreary and chilly Saturday here in Chicago so there's nothing else better to cure that (and the hangover....) than grabbing a veggieburger. I heard good things about The Bad Apple for a few weeks now and decided to walk over for dinner. First, the atmosphere is outstanding. Obviously it's very red, but the painted walls with trees and aesthetically pleasing apple paintings tied the cafe together very well. I decided to order a beer, which never happens, and went for a Dark Horse Raspberry Ale. Let's just say that beer is beer to me and I opted out and got a Long Island instead. Which was awesome. It was time to order and I decided on the Strange Famous. Inside this homemade veggieburger was corn, chickpeas, seitan, mushroom, and spinach on top. I decided to skip on the onions and goat cheese (ick!). I was starving so I jumped out of my seat every time I saw our server come around the corner with food. Finally the burger arrived and it was fantastic! I have to say one of the best veggieburgers in town. Most veggie burgers consist of rice and beans (which obviously is NOT a bad thing), but the combination of chickpeas, seitan, and spinach gave a new twist on the classic veggieburger. I was very impressed. It came along with some fresh cut fries which supported the dish very well. Overall, I loved The Bad Apple! I will be returning for sure as I would like to try the other burgers with the veggie patty substitute. Friendly service and well priced. Check it out!
