I've been going to Simply It for over two years and it keeps getting better! I love the fresh ingredients. The recent cooking class was great. I know quite a lot about cooking and was surprised to learn some new techniques, sources of ingredients and cultural background about the cuisine. The owner Tuan is very friendly and almost always there.
