A born and bred Chicagoan that prefers thin crust. I know it sounds insane but somewhere in my 20+ years in Chicago I lost my appetite for deep dish. I can eat it once in a blue moon, but I really do prefer a thinner crust. That said I like Piece. Pizzas are big and slightly more on the expensive side (charges per topping). Do not ever go here really hungry because you will be waiting. If not for a table for your pizza. At least that means they are making it to order. If you are waiting though I recommend trying the goat cheese as an appetizer and one of their many award-winning beers. I have had all the different types of pizza but like the traditional "red".  My only issue (the reason I can't rate it higher) is that I have at times gotten really salty pizzas. I mean I am a salt fiend but it was once almost inedible. I have remedied this problem by skipping on any meat toppings and it has been much better. Overall, I know I will be back especially now that they have a new separate To-Go area next door.
