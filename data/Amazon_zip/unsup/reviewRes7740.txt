Filet Mignon OK, not great. skimpy on asparagus (vegetables) even though menu described it as "mixed vegetables". Had a glass of Sharecropper Cab that was almost the price of a full bottle online (i.e., a bit overpriced). The waiter wasn't up to snuff - looked and acted like someone who should be shlepping behind the bar in a college beer joint. My dinner date also wasn't thrilled with her food.
