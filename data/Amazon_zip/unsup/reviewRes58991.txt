Beef lollipops tasted a bit gamey, not steak qualityThe noodles for the pancit was all wrong; should really use the rice noodles; it was like eating at china chef!Loompya- isn't this incorrect spelling? shouldn't it be lumpia.bad service-soup came out after our meal, and definitely after we asked for our bill. We actually asked the same waiter for to go boxes, which he brought, and then brought us the soups (really). and then they said they would take them off the bill which they were not, and corrected later-The bus boy spilled soy sauce on my brothers camera.-The sushi chefs were not wearing gloves prepping the food, nor were they washing their hands after touching nonfood items. We were seated within a minute or our arrival, only thing going for this place, but we did have reservations. Interesting decor and a hip place but overall, overpriced for the quality of food
