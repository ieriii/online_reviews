I'm not a huge fan of traditional Greek food, but this place is fantastic. It has lighter fare, truly cafe style, but some heartier dishes as well. I love their Greek lemon chicken soup, it's great ans served with the tastiest basket of fresh bakery breads. The salads, sandwiches and the flaky artopia are my favorites. Now, I can't talk about favorites without mentioning the bakery section filled with cakes, cookies and small individual desserts that are top notch!!! save room!!! I don't drink coffee, but there is an extensive coffee menu and the creations look beautiful. There are drinks& wine also, and i have enjoyed some of the recommended Greek wines!! Great atmosphere and little shop as well as take out! Go now....they're open late!!
