I'm a patient person, and so are the two people I went with. On a Saturday night, at 9.30pm, we waited for 1.5 hours to get inside. Once inside, we got seats at the bar and was greeted by the friendly and informational bartender. Water glasses filled immediately, which never seemed empty the entire night. We all ordered our drinks, which were phenomenal. Top shelf liquor all around at this place, for a price I thought suited the high quality cocktails. Well worth the wait. Great service, delicious drinks.
