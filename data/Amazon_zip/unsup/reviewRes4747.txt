This place was packet! We went mid-afternoon, knowing we were going to have a late dinner and couldn't believe how busy they were. Worth the wait! The food was great, so many different tastes! And amazing beer and wine selection! We throughly enjoyed everything we had: Salt-Roasted Beets with whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, and of course the Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs - they give you fresh herbs and crostini to spread it on.. so good!
