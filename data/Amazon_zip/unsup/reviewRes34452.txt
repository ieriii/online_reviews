I'd give them a better rating as my neighborhood falafel purveyor, but the lamb shawarma is just tough, gristly and flavorless, the chicken shawarma is generally dry from overcooking on the vertical spit. Go vegan here for the falafel sandwiches medium spicy (great jerusalem salad and fluffy humus) and the yellow lentil soup for a wonderfully healthy $6 lunch. The salads by the pound offer a tasty amalgam of ingredients, but the greasy hot buffet items have never looked appealing to me. CASH only.
