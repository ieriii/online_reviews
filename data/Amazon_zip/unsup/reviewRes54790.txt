I was really looking forward to having dinner at the Hopleaf since I have heard great things about their food but left feeling disappointed. For openers, we arrived before 6:00 and the dining room in the back had maybe 3 people in it. Knowing this, the hostess wanted to seat us behind a wall and facing a stairway and an emergency exit. Since the place empty I told the hostess to give us a better table. Duh?  For an appetizer we started out sharing their signature Mussels Belgian style and they were excellent. For my entree I ordered Montreal brisket and it was extremely dried out and should not have been served in my opinion. Perhaps more disappointing was the Stliton cheese mac which not only didn't taste of Stilton, it didn't taste of anything because it was so under seasoned. My dining partner had the Steak Frites which was a success in terms of the steak but a failure in terms of the frites which were soggy and so over salted they hurt your lips. This coupled with a robot waiter made the experience a downer. Sorry, but I won't be back for the food.
