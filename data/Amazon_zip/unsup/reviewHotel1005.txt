Check-in is a bit weird (one small desk with one or two dudes behind it), but other than that this was a pretty nice place. Supposedly they offer some high end concierge services but I didn't take advantage. Continental breakfast is meh, but at least it's on every floor.  The main downside of this place is that the damn Harry Caray bar thing is right across the street. I happened to have the room that looked directly at it. Freaked me out. I might try the W next time, I dunno.
