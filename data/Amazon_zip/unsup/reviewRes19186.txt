I went to this place after being completely snubbed of service at the Wild Goose. We left there out of frustration, and wandered in. I had been to "Feed the Beast", which was in the same building not more than a year ago, so I thought I'd give it a chance. That being said, I'm very glad I didn't stay at the Goose! Our goal in eating there was mainly to watch the epic Olympic Hockey game yesterday. What surprised me first was the monster beer list. Really good beers at affordable prices. We also got right in, right in front of the TV. There were only 2 TVs in the bar area, but I think the place is mainly for drinks and food. Our server was very attentive despite being a little busy, and us having a large group. She was completely honest with us about being busy, too, but her service never slacked. She made good beer recommendations, and once she figured out our tastes, she made further, more advanced recommendations. On to the food: I'm pretty sure the place is all about burgers, and it shows. There were a lot of choices, I think the reviewer that called it "Kuma's Light" sums it up. I got the Big Texan: pork, bbq sauce, onion rings, etc. It was phenomenal. I'd put it right on par with Kuma's, at a lot cheaper price, and with practically zero wait time! My friends all got various burgers from the menu, and we all really liked each others' as well. The Sir Loin burger was amazing. Couple that with really good fries, and we have ourselves a winner.  To sum up: It's a great location, good decor (if you care about that stuff), great burgers, and a fantastic beer list. I'm going back as soon as I can! Cheers!
