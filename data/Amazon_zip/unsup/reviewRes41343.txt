Warning: Vegans may find this review disturbing.  I like a dead animal on my plate for most every meal.  A little bacon for breakfast, a burger or chicken topped salad for lunch, and a big 'ole hunk of meat with potatoes for dinner.  I like fish too but not as much as I do the 4-legged edibles. :) My friend's at Ruth Chris do a really good job with the red meats and as a bonus they add a layer of butter to the steaks before serving.  Happiness!   The selection of side dishes is decent, but all are served ala cart. Considering what they charge for the entrees, they should throw in at least one side dish with the order unless they consider the layer of butter added to the steaks as your free side dish. I have been to Ruth's Chris several times and have not had a bad cut of meat yet.
