This place provides a unique spin on korean food which was really cool to see and taste. The Seoul Sassy chicken is excellent. It was fresh, very crispy, and the flavor was awesome. The same goes for the Crisp chicken which has a spicy/sweet flavor. Having gone with a group of friends, we also tried Bad Boy Buddha, which is basically a Bi-Bim-Bap, which was pretty tasty as well, and came in a decent sized portion. Lastly , I tried the Seoul Sensation burrito. The bul-go-gi had an authentic and good tasting marinade and made my stomach happy. All in all, a neat place, with a good variety of food. The setting is very informal and the owner was very nice. I'd like to go back and taste some other dishes. for now its cash only, but worth it!!!
