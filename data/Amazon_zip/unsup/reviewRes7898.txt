Went there yesterday for first time. This may be best Neapolitan pizza in Chicago. The crust was very thin and had a few burnt bubbles on the edges. The combination of sauce and cheese was fantastic. The sausage had great flavor and was pretty light. Also had the grilled zucchini and eggplant, which although served cold was still good. If you like Neapolitan style pizza, u must try this place.
