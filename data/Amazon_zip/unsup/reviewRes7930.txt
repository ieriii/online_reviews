BEST PIZZA EVER! I am not a big fan of pizza majorly because I don't like cheese. However, this place totally blew my mind. The pizza was thin crust with tons of fresh goodies on it. Super yummy that I don't even care the restaurant was noisy and crowded. The seafood appetizer I ordered was also very fresh and tasty.
