OK, I don't know what all the naysayers are complaining about! We had great, unobtrusive service with Doc (that's how he introduced himself...perhaps he's the Doctor of Tapas), the food was great (albeit some items were a tad salty) and we had a great time. The Arroz a la Cazuela was fine...a little salty though. Bacon wrapped figs were fabulous, esp the salad at the bottom. Nice pairing. The mushroom rice was awesome... The mushroom and potatoes were amazing... The shrimp in garlic was perfect... The flatbreads were pretty good... My one complaint is that they could have brought the food items out in a better sequence. We had a vegetarian at our table and they brought out all of the meat items first. They could have grouped everything with at least one veggie dish coming out along with the meat tapas. But, other than that, it was great! You do need a reservation though...my sister in law tried to drop in on three occasions and it was full each time. And, tapas generally aren't cheap so expect to spend about $10-15 on regular tapas and more on the meats.
