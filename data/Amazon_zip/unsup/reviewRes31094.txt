Omg, this is my absolute new favorite gourmet sushi place. If I have a taste for raw goodness, and a few (well ok, more than a few) extra bucks in my pocket - Sunda here I come! Granted I went on industry night with a friend in the industry, and thus my first experience involved everything being half off, but I've seen the prices and I'm willing to go back. It was just SO good. Appetizer highlight - crispy Brussels sprouts salad. WOW. We also had the crab cake crusted tuna, which was actually my least favorite, since it had some steep competition. My friend had the stuffed avocado which I didn't try, but would absolutely order next time. For roles I split the Tale of Two Tuna's and the Number Nine with a friend. Both fabulous. Seriously, I have never had fresher, creamier tuna than in that first role. And the number nine is an unagi roll with great flavor. Sunda, I will be back - probably soon!
