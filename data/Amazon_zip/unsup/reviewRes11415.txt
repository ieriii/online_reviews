I love the Bongo Room (the food!) I hate the Bongo Room (the wait, the rush, and some of the people). So, I guess I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is really great, I love the seasonal specials and the hash browns and the breakfast burrito and the coffee and all that stuff. Waiting for an hour or more on the sidewalk with a herd of North-Face clad, blonde-highlighted, huge-sunglasses-wearing ladies (HUNGRY ladies!) to get my breakfast, only to be stared down by those same (GETTING HUNGRIER) women while I eat really puts a damper on the overall experience here. The Bongo Room might be great for a weekday brunch, but for weekends I'm kinda over it. I'd rather go up the street to Rodan.
