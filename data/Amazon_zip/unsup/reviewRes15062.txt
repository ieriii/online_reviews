This is a great place for beer brewed on site. Chicago doesn't have many, so it will probably be busy. It's worth the wait. Have a beer or two and your table will be ready before you'll need to P.  The food is good, but not the reason for going. The atmosphere is loud, but....IT'S A BAR....so, y'know...Have another beer.
