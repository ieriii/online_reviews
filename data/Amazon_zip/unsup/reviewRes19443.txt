Dislikes first, since it's what comes to my mind- Seating- like a fast food restaurant. It was just uncomfortable, no where to put my purse. (They should put hooks under the table!) And I hate being forced to stare at a wall. Prices- WAS not worth it. I could of gone to Pilsen with what I spent and had two meals, even three at the Maxwell St. Market. My Torta- Could NOT have been more disappointed. Unsalted pork. It said SUCKLING PIG on menu. Total lie. It was a dry actually. It needed like avocado, cheese, mayo something fatty since the pork was eh. And smeared with beans, couldn't even tell. But the price was already at $12 for sandwich, which included no sides. The side sauce- just gross, unedible hotness. Like it had heat, but no flavor. What I kinda liked- Churro-it was good. But.....I had better. Sorry Rick Bayless! Hot Chocolate- Yes it's fresh from the bean. But the best I've had? Sorry, no. I give it 3 stars. Chips and guac- Chips are 4 stars, guac was only 3. But that's personal, I always like guac with more onion/ garlic. Their has little of either. Overall, I don't think I'll be back. If money wasn't an issue, maybe. But Pilsen could swallow them whole.
