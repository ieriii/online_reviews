Usually, Asian Fusion sucks. Sunda does NOT suck. Sunda is amazing and you should try it. ++Crispy Brussel Sprout Salad - this was the best thing on the menu. It has the most amazing set of flavors I've ever had. You MUST try this. ++Lobster and Waygu Roll - this was my 2nd favorite, it tastes so good! ++Steamed Soup Dumplings - these were very good, the best I've had stateside + Rock Shrimp Tempora - very sweet, but a very good dish + Hand Cut Spicy Tuna and Jalapeno - this was delicious, and went quickly + Duck Hash was good, but I was expecting better (I was completely stuffed when I tried it though) - Spicy "Tail of Two Tunas" - this was the worst item on the menu, had almost no taste - Drinks were around $10 (I guess this should be expected) - Food CERTAINLY isn't cheap + Atmosphere was classy, good looking crowd, place was PACKED on a Monday + Had an AWESOME waitress, she made fantastic suggestions
