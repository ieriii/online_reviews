First of all, I am so sorry. I don't mean to be a negative norman all the time, but, I was quite underwhelmed here. The food is too expensive and bland. We started with the scallops, which were accidentally? served raw, which included 4 scallops with a microscopic bit of acorn squash-which had no discernable flavor. I told our waiter that they were raw, and he kindly took them back to the kitchen. In the meantime, we were served a cauliflower gratin-which had no gratin. It was instead, a sweetish creme sauce and again a very small ramekin (all of the dishes are supposed to be for sharing.) Next, a chicken dish was served, on the bone and with some strange consistencies. The chicken was served with below average fries and bland summer type sausage. Eventually, the waiter returned with the scallops-15 minutes? later, at which point, he felt the need to tell us that that was the way the chef was serving them-raw throughout most of the scallop. The bill for these miniscule portions and 3 beers was around $100.00. yikes!
