After realizing that an hour wait at Meli just wasn't going to cut it, Martha and I sauntered across the street and right into our seats at Artopolis. I'd been here before for coffee and snacks but never for a full meal. The atmosphere is relaxed and we didn't have to sit on top of any of the other patrons. Yes! We both chose the tequila chicken sandwich which was huge and full of grilled chicken, avocado, and fresh tomatoes. Feel free to add some cheese. I know I did. I was also amazed by the pasta salad. A portion bigger than a thimble? What? I've never heard of such a thing. Amazing. And quite tasty too. We also pigged it up a little and added the frites which were crispy and served in a boingy little cone. The only complaint is that our service was a little erratic and it took an eternity to get a cup of coffee. I'll definitely come back and check out some of their other lunch options. Plus if you're into Ouzo, I noticed quite the array for sale. Intriguing.
