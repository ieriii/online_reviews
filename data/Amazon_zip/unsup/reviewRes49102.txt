The service was lacking, rude at times, the food was just OK. We liked the beer options but were disappointed that most of the menu seemed to be unavailable the night we were there. The dishes we did have were fine but nothing special. We did have one vegetarian dining with us and were surprised by the snotty response from our waiter when she requested a salad without meat. He informed her that "the chef WILL NOT make the salad with out pigs ears". Really? Thanks for making the night awkward for our guest.
