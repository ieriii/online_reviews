a quick stop off the train on my way home for dinner, and a tasty cheap $5 dinner at that ($3.50 falafel sandwich, drink, tax). the lentils & rice I get sometimes is quite yummy as well. careful of the occasional long lines - they seem intimidating, but actually move pretty quickly. I only wish they had more seating on those busy days.
