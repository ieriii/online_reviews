This is the place to bring a date.Great service, unbelievable food. It is very high quality. We didn't wait for anything as the wait staff was always there anticipating our needs.I don't recommend that you get one of the whole crab dishes. It looks like a big spider on your plate and is not that easy to take apart and eat. The entrees with stuffed crab are the best.There are places to walk around afterwards that are nearby, which again makes it great for a date.Highly recommend!
