So much good food here! The butternut squash arancini balls and the quail with pomegranates and salsify would be my favorites here, but also fantastic are the burrata (with mushrooms and balsamic vinegar), the crispy kale with pig's ear, the bone marrow (the coarse salt is a great addition), and the milk-braised pork shoulder. I would recommend getting the charcuterie and cheese platter over the Pig Platter (only meat). The latter was just a little too...piggy...for me.
