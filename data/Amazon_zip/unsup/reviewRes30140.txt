Actually closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I will come back again to see if I am sincerely able to update it to 4 stars. My 'house omelette' was fine. With the plethora of great omelette places downtown, this omelette was as Yelp calls "A-OK". O'Brien potatoes (w/green peppers and onion a nice departure from the typical slab-o-sliced potatoes. Wife had '4 star' pancakes, laced with blueberry. She's a bit of a pancake snob and really liked these. Dane, the server, was one of those nice guys who adds to the friendly ambiance. Service 5 stars!
