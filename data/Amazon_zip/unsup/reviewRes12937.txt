I went to Texas de Brazil for their extended restaurant week, which included their entire meat buffet + salad bar + dessert. The atmosphere was pretty nice, especially the aerial wine show. I enjoyed their salad bar, which was quite diverse, but I had to save room for the meat, which was the main course. Meat! And on to the meat... which was very delicious, if slightly salty due to their cooking methods. There were so many different kinds of meats! Some of them were much more worth the stomach space and others weren't. I wasn't a big fan of the sausage, but I did like the lamb and the ribeye. Don't forget to turn your placard over or the meat will just keep coming... The desserts were pretty interesting too, but I barely had any room for them after all the meat. In summary, good meat!
