This place is solid, though I don't understand the lunch time line that winds around the block in the middle of winter. I mean, it's good, but not freeze my toes off good. It's pretty pricey, considering they only offer sandwiches and soup. I got a limonade (really tasty - like a margarita without the booze) a sandwich and an order of guac for $23. You're paying for the opportunity to eat something that Rick Bayless thought up, which isn't bad, but it's not outstanding either.
