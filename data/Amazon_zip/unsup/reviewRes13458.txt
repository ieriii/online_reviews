I recently made a list of all the places I've been meaning to review on Yelp. I've since lost that list. I suppose I could log into my banking stuff to see where I've been, but it's Sunday and I'm afraid to come to terms with how much I've actually spent this weekend. Anyway. Today I ended up at Revolution for brunch, for probably the 4th time. I know it was on the list, but it didn't need to be. This place never disappoints. I've only ever ordered off of the brunch menu, but from going with groups of friends, I think I've at least tried everything they've got on it. My personal favorite is the Egg in a Hole. That cheddar ale "soup" (sauce) is really ... ugh, I could bathe in it, it's so good. No I couldn't, but you know. I have never had anything I straight up didn't like -- although the biscuits and gravy are not for me. But that's because I don't know what's good for me. They are, apparently, the best biscuits and gravy you can find this far north. I just don't like pepper, which is something I need to deal with for the rest of my life. The gravy is very peppery, which is how it should be. Again, I don't know what's good for me. Anyway. The coffee also, I know it's just coffee, but I wish I lived closer just so I could have more, more often. It is delicious. I've never had an issue with service, everything else is just good. So good. I cannot say enough good things about this place, but I will say that I currently live in Lakeview, which is not far from this place by any means, but it's not like there aren't 1,200 places for brunch around here -- ones that I could walk to, even -- but I'll keep going back to Revolution until I find a good reason not to. I don't see it happening.
