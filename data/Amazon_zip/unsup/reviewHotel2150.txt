God help me if my Irish Catholic mother ever reads this review because of what it implies, but here goes.... I used to have 2 roommates and a boyfriend. So when Valentine's day rolled around, I decided that a better way to spend it was to NOT stay home on the couch watching tv with my boyfriend AND 2 roommates.... So I booked us a room here for a romantic Valentine's mini-getaway!! Service at the hotel was very courteous and prompt, from check-in to check-out. From reading the other reviews, I'm guessing that the hotel has different rooms in different sections. Well our room was gorgeous, a high floor, no street noise and a kickass view of Michigan Ave. The bathroom was large with marble countertops and shower/bath, but most importantly it was clean! The Intercontinental is located right a decent section of Michigan Ave with lots of good restaurant options in the near proximity. As a result of that, we definitely did not eat at the hotel or order room service. We tried to have a nice romantic walk down Michigan at night, but February in Chicago = COLD!!!! So we went back to the hotel and went swimming. The pool area was really nice and WARM. I'm willing to bet that they have one of the nicest hotel pools anywhere in Chicago. Note to parents: it doesn't seem kid-friendly, the minimum depth at the pool was like 7 feet. All in all, we had a wonderful, relaxing and romantic time staying here, and I got a beautiful diamond necklace from the boyfriend as a gift. So what can I say?? That's worth at least 4 stars in my book! Oh yeah, and Mom??? If you're reading this... our room had 2 king-sized beds. ;)
