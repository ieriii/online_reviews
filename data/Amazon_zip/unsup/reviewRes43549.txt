This place is designed to serve food quickly and move people through the doors which is nice when other hot spots like the Bongo Room have a crawling wait. The breakfast menu leans a bit much toward vegetarian for my personal liking but everything is delicious. Thankfully they have real bacon and not the turkey or tempeh crap.
