My boyfriend and I booked our dinner and dance reservation here for our 3rd Year anniversary this winter.  Carnivale DELIVERED! It was all we hoped for and more. We began the night with a basic latin dance lesson for an hour that included Mojitos... (YUMMY) and Guac/Chips.  Afterwards... we had dinner in the main dining room. The decor and lighting was to die for!! The food... Stupendous!  The live music and lounge/bar area is where we ended the night... with some live salsa music and dancing... we went home happy campers :) We will definitely be back!
