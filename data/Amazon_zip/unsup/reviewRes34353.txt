YUM! As soon as my grandmother and I walked up we saw the masses waiting outside for a table. Brunch is some form of God to people here in Chicago and I'm just learning that the longer i live here. I swear you never see lines like you see outside of a brunch place. Anyhow we put our name in and decided to brave the wait. It wasn't bad, maybe 20-30 minutes. We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful weather. (I spent half the time staring at this guy I swore was kanye west...hope he didn't notice haha). Anyhow got inside to see it was pretty close seating with your neighbors which I'm starting to adapt to. I use to completely hate it, I have total space issues. We got the menus which are HUGE, if you can't find something here you like then you have something against brunch!! Anyhow it took me a good 5 minutes to decide between the French Toasts and an Omelet. Finally I went with the French Toast and it was absolutely delicious. My grandmother got this crepe thing which was awesome and she really enjoyed it. Her plate was just overflowing with the crepe and fruit. The food was great and we walked out very stuffed and happy.
