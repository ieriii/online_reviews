Yay for Crisp! I've had korean fried chickens all over, and this place is pretty darn good. Tried the seoul sassy wings and half-chicken, as well as the buddha bowl with bulgogi, all of which were well balanced - sweet, salty, and some spice. Was curious about the rest of the menu, which included korean burritos, sandwiches, and misc. fried sides (i.e. frieds, onion rings, mushrooms (?)). Hooray for korean cuisine's surge in popularity - i hope they open one closer to downtown.
