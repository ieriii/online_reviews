I had really high hopes for this place given that Broadway/Argyle and its surroundings are absolutely packed with Vietnamese restaurants and, compared to Tank, they're all pretty much empty. After something of a wait (we could have been seated a bit earlier if our party of three didn't mind sharing a six seater table with another party of three) we got a table and started working our way through the menu. The menu itself is like a book, there are well over 200 items to choose from. I ended up with a pho after seeing all of the reviews on here. Firstly, the bowl was *huge*, probably two pints of soup in total. However, I have to admit that I didn't think it was anything special. Somewhat bland and a little bit tough. Oh well. My friends had a fried rice dish and some beef thing respectively, and like the pho they were nice enough but not amazing. The thing that really threw me, though, was the toilets. The only cubicle in the men's room contained about two dozen rolls of toilet paper just scattered around, two or three stepladders, and the toilet seat itself had a big smear of shit on it (although I guess it could have been brown paint or something, I didn't taste it).
