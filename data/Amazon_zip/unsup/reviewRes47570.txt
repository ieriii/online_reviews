Half priced bottles of wine? Yes please! Or as my dining partner called it, buy one get one free. Our server was top notch, super fun and super attentive. He even went back to the kitchen to get us his favorite salad (Tuna & Shrimp Poke) which wasn't on the harvest table any longer. It was super good. Atmosphere was great! We were here for restaurant week, so we had limited selections for meat, but after all of the fun stuff on the charcuterie table and the salads on the harvest tables, the sirloin and chicken were just enough for me.
