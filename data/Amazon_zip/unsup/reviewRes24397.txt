When you look at this place, all you see is a dive. I was not at all impressed when I walked inside and had to walk through part of the kitchen to get to a tiny sitting area. However......the food makes up for all the atmosphere lacks! It is so yummy and plentiful! I highly suggest getting the vegetarian special (no matter what it is that particular day).
