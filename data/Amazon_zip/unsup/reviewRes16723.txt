I really wanted to hate this place. I mean, REALLY. I am cheap, laid back, and hate the idea of a cocktail club.  I LOVE this place. I went for one drink and stayed for three. And every drink I had was worth the price too. The place is super comfortable, not loud, and not crowded in the slightest (everyone must be seated). And I didn't feel under-dressed in my vintage ELO tee-shirt sitting next to the dude in a Hugo Boss suit.  I cannot wait to go back. I cannot wait to bring other non-believers.
