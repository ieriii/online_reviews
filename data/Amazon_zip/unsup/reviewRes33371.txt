My husband and I have been here several times over the past few years, for Valentine's Day dinner and most recently our one year wedding anniversary. We can always count on a good meal here, and the atmosphere is always great. The bread is always delicious--ask for fresh shaved Parmesan to dip it in along with the table olive oil, it's so good! We each had a salad to start and my husband ordered the half chicken and roasted potatoes (his go-to dish) and I ordered the mussels. They were delicious and the tomato sauce is so good, with a little kick to it, that you can sop your bread in it. I literally ate it with a spoon! The prices are what you'd expect for a nice Italian restaurant but if you don't order alcohol it's a lot less. We've never had enough room to order dessert but they have a pretty good selection. Not sure if you can request it but I highly recommend the top level if you're going for a date--it's a lot more quiet and romantic, and the tables aren't as jammed together.
