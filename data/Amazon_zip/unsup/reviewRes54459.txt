We had an awful experience at Chicago Diner. Not only was the food heavy and medicore, we all got stomach problems afterwards!! I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an off-day or what, but it was not worth the stomach problems. Even if we didn't get sick, we also did not enjoy the food - this place is all hype!
