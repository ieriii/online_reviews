I have come out of Yelp hibernation after my nice dinner at Grand Lux Cafe last night.  Grand Lux Cafe is one of the many restaurants I have walked by a million times but have never gone in. This changed last night when my girlfriend and I stopped in there after work. I went with the BBQ pork sandwich. The BBQ and fries were good, but what was really great was the peanut coleslaw. I am a coleslaw snob and one of my biggest culinary pet peeves is mayonnaise. Fortunately this was an oil based coleslaw and the honey roasted peanuts added some great flavor! We had outstanding service and the Beignets (French Doughnuts) with THREE sauces for dessert was a great end to the meal.  Overall, Grand Lux Cafe is a great escape from the hustle and flow of Michigan Avenue and is a must for anyone who enjoys large portions and a variety of menu choices.
