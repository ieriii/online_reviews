It had been years since my last visit to Bin 36, and I don't remember the food being anything out of the ordinary on that visit. This visit...the food was anything BUT ordinary! Everything we ordered was simply amazing.  We started with a snack while we perused the menu...the Basket of Gougeres...described as Parmesan Cheese Puffs with Truffle Honey. I don't even like honey, but this honey was the perfect complement to the cheese puffs, making it a spicy/tangy mlange of flavors in my mouth! (FYI...in this case...that's a good thing.)  For our meals, we split two entrees between us. The Strozzapreti Pasta (roasted winter vegetables, sage-hazlenut pesto, shaved parmesan cheese), and the Sauted Amish Chicken Breast (Tuscan kale and Gruyere cheese bread pudding, braised chicken and mushroom "gravy"). Both were wonderful, although I actually preferred the Amish Chicken Breast...surprising since I usually do not care for chicken.  Worth a special mention is the Flemish beer I had...Duchesse de Bourgogne. I described it to someone as tasting like a glass of red wine, with Newcastle Brown Ale poured in it. (Sounds horrible, I know, but somehow it works!) If you like a darker beer, try this one. If you keep in mind that it's going to have an unusual and fruity taste, I think you'll like it.  Finally, kudos to our server Chris...he's not a waiter, but he ended up waiting on us for our whole meal because we loved him so. If you are lucky enough to have him at your table, listen to his recommendations! He knows his stuff. All in all, I know I will definitely be back to Bin 36!! (And I'm hoping this wasn't a fluke occurrence.)
