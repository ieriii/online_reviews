I've been to this place twice. The beer list is superb and the food is wonderful. They have excellent homemade veggie burgers (for the veggies out there) and the ketchup is made in-house as well!  It does seem to get really packed though; on one of my visits, a large party seated nearby was pretty loud, so it might not always be the right spot if you're looking for quality conversation. Other than that--good service, nice ambiance, laid-back crowd. I'd recommend.
