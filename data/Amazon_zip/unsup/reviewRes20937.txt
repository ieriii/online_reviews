Coast reminds me of one of those really pretty girls from highschool....Everyone thinks she is pretty and she knows it and in the end her ego just ruins her appearance. Coast has great sushi and a really nice atmosphere, plus the BYOB is awsome. BUT...the staff are horrible. They act as if they are gods gift to sushi and because of that the restaurant has been ruined for me. You will find me at Butterfly instead.
