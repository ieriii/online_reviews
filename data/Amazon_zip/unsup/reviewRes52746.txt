My boyfriend has been talking about this place for months now and we finally decided to try it. We booked a reservation on OpenTable for 8pm on a Saturday night. We don't live nearby and decided to drive- there was tons of parking available on Armitage. We arrived at the restaurant a little early and they sat us immediately which was nice. Unfortunately my boyfriend did not do his homework and see that the restaurant is BYOB so we showed up without any libations.  We started with the empanadas- they had an extensive menu of them and we decided on the shrimp and chorizo with goat cheese. We ordered two of the latter and unfortunately our order was reversed. The empanadas were cold and hard when they arrived to our table. They also weren't very full. For our entrees I ordered the Media Noche sandwich and my boyfriend got the Cuban. I felt like I could have made a better sandwich at home. It was basically a glorified panini- nothing special. We opted to skip dessert, after such a sub par meal all I wanted to do was leave. As for service they were spot on. The waitress was very nice, our water glasses were never empty and you could really tell the staff worked well together. I am not sure we would return- if we did I know we would order something other than a sandwich.
