#1 gripe, as with most Indian restaurants, is inferior beer list. Good beer is a great accompaniment to Indian food. Mediocre beer need not be shipped overseas (I'm looking at you, Heinekin and all known Indian beers). Come on.. get some local beers, preferably not from Goose Island but even that would suffice. And don't get an IPA just because "India" is in the name. The wine list is no better -- many (most?) wines utterly inappropriate to the cuisine.  The beer really gets me. It alone separates my experience at IH as good rather than great. Almost every dish we had was excellent. We ordered mostly vegetarian items, and some members of our party (regrettably) ordered a few meat items, including a rather unappealing pile of mixed meats. The menu is pretty huge and labrinthine. Spend some time with it, and order what sounds good. They have a few chaat 'street food' dishes, plenty of curries. I liked everything that I thought I would like, and in general found it to be the best Chi-Indian outside of the vegetarian district on Devon, and possibly Chicago Curry House, but I go there for Nepali. Lunch buffet is solid, if costly. I owuld obviously prefer it to have a few more veggie items, a few less meat items. Basically this restaurant is very good except the beer which is reprehensible.
