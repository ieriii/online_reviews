The only problem with this place is the wait. So go early! Good food. The salads are totally under-rated and the stilton mac and cheese is the real deal. Also they do a nice job preparing mussels in classic Belgian style. Great beer selection. There are some beers here you can only get on tap at a couple places in the whole country. This is a destination restaurant, go and enjoy some great beer.
