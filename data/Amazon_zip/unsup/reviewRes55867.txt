This is a great place. I eat here about once a month, either for lunch or dinner. I've never had a bad meal and never had to wait (although I have eaten lunch at the bar because there were no tables available).The lunch buffet is a notch above other Indian lunch buffets I've tried. They have plenty of choices, fresh from the kitchen, and the serving area is clean. On popular days, you'll wait your turn to go through line.My dinners have been delicious with large portions and great service. Last couple of times I had the vegetarian thali and it's too much to eat in one sitting.
