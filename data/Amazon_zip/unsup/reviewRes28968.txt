When I moved out of Lincoln Park, I almost cried over not being so close to the Pasta Bowl. A year later, I am definitely missing this place, especially on Sunday nights. I used to be able to see the Pasta Bowl from the window in my apartment; now they don't even deliver to my place.  The menu is small, but everything is so good! The daily specials always sounded so tasty, but I could never part with my usual order (cappellini pomodoro). The portions are generous, especially if you get take-out, so there are always leftovers. And you are probably only spending $6 or $7.  The restaurant itself is small so it's hard to get a table here, especially with a larger group.
