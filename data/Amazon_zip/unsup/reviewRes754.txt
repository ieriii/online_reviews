First of all, just make peace with the fact that you're going to be standing in line for a spell. A small price to pay for what waits inside. In my many years patronizing this establishment, Doug has never failed to welcome each customer at the register with warmth and humor. This is a man who clearly loves what he does! I couldn't begin to pick a favorite menu item. If I've ever not enjoyed something, it's because I took a leap and tried something outside of my comfort zone, NEVER because of the way the food is prepared. Hot Doug's is A+ in that area as well, every single time. Easily a top 5 eatery of Chicago and one I love treating out-of-town family members and friends to.
