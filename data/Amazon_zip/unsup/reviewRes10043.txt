what a treat!  Came here for restaurant week 2012 and what a pleasure! We've been here once before, 2 summers ago and sat in the beautiful patio which is truly breathtaking, the best patio dining experience in chicago for sure! But because we were outdoors last time, I never noticed what a great space it is inside! We sat right next to the kitchen which gives you this sense of being in a rustic italian kitchen. The decor is upscale but the food is home cooking, a great combination. Started with a great glass of Santa Margarita Prosecco Rose, yum. For a $22 lunch, this meal was SUCH A VALUE! and I felt Piccolo Sogno did it right - making offerings that remind me to not forget it for the rest of the year! Loved: - Braised oxtail: love love oxtails and these were done so rustically. braised so they're falling off the bone, combined with soft and flavorful root vegetables (carrots + bok choy and celery), atop a subtle mound of polenta - DELICIOUS! - lasagna: such a classic dish, but such a rich, flavorful version! fresh homemade sheets of green pasta with bolognese sauce :) happiness - the foccacia! this came in their bread basket, along with table side balsamic and olive oil - i ate way too many pieces, but it really was that good.  - mushroom carpaccio: i expected thinly sliced pieces of mushroom but it was more like a mushroom salad with celery and mixed greens. a great simple salad. definitely coming back. would be a wonderful place to bring out of town guests!!
