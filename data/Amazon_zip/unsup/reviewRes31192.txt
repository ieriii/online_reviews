This is one of those places where I just wont get sick of the food. Ever. I love coming to The Chicago Diner, so much so that I've actually purchased their cookbook and I've bought slices of cake at local Whole Foods (I just love them that much). The menu is always changing, which is good. But old favorites still stick around. I had some form of rosemary lemonade last time I went there and it was GREAT. I try something new every time I go just to keep up with all the variety they offer. The place is pretty cute, parking can be a bitch but whatever. I've parked further for less, so its no biggie. Besides, this is the city...what did you really expect? lol.
