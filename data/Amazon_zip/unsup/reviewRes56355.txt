Wow! This restaurant compelled me to write my first Yelp review. This has to have been the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. When we arrived, there was a wait and I wasn't sure where the host or line was, but the owner got us water while we waited and I bought a kiwi-strawberry smoothie from the juice bar. We agreed that we'd take the bus to Simply It for the smoothie alone. We were seated after about 10/15 minutes (on a Saturday night without reservations). We agreed upon the shrimp papaya salad, chicken avocado appetizer, Bamboo Duck, and Grilled Salmon Noodles. The shrimp papaya salad was refreshing with a bit of a spicy kick. The chicken--how did they make that chicken so perfectly crispy? The mango salsa was a nice compliment to the avocado stuffed chicken. While we were eating, the wait staff kept the water full without asking. The waitress informed us that they were out of duck, so we ordered the green beans instead. They were very apologetic and the owner came by with ice tea and lemonade for all. The green beans and salmon dishes were delicious. After dinner, we were served fresh fruit and then the owner brought us a free plate of fruit and tasty fried bananas! To top it all off, on the way out, the owner insisted that we leave with a few slices of cake from a giant birthday cake. Now that's what I call service! I can't wait to go back to work my way though their menu!
