wowwwwwww.... i have nothing bad to say about this place. 1. AMAZING chef named MIke :) 2. Staff is amazing 3. BEST SUSHI i've ever had in my life 4. decor and ambiance is awesome 5. price is decent 6. there is no #6 except EAT HERE or you will regret it. came here twice during our trip, and every single item we had was to die for. let's see if i can even remember everything we had. 1. lemongrass beef lollipops... i ate 3 out of the 5 =X 2. Ahi Sashimi 3. duck....what....pork? 4. crunchy pig, hidden lobster (this is a must) 5. great white!!! (melts in your mouth) 6. lobster and wagyu roll (mouth watering) 7. sunda's yellowtail jalapeo so many other rolls that i don't remember! =( doesn't matter because everything was amazing... i definitely miss this restaurant and wish i can just pick it up and take it home with me
