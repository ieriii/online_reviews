Chef's Tasting Menu. Need I say more? Honestly, this was my first experience with a tasting menu and it was amazing. I am somewhat of a control freak and the thought of having someone else bring dishes to me on their whim could have put me into panic attack mode... but fortunately, I had already had about 2 glasses of the amazing Summer Sangria, so I went with it. The experience was literally something I will remember for the rest of my life... so fun, so unexpected, so delicious and so worth the price. I recommend the tasting menu at Mercat a la Planxa, hands down. So many surprises along the way, I won't go into detail... just do it! It will change your life.
