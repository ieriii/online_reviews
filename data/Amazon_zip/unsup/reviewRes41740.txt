This was my first time going to a Vietnamese restaurant so I was excited try some different things. I got the pork spring rolls which were delicious, especially the dipping sauce, the pork had an oddly grainy texture but over all they were very good. I also got the lemongrass pork vermicelli noodles that were outstanding (especially with a good squirt of Sirracha) Next time I might try 777 but, I'd definitely go back to Tank Noodle
