This is the kind of place where you envy the guy who gets to bless the customers by carrying out the plates of ridiculous food.  The cooks should really get the joy of doing that here.  EVERYTHING is delicious! You cannot go wrong. It's just scary because you want it all. Hopefully you get lucky and your friends order something different so that you can explore the menu. The zucchini and pumpkin pancakes (or ANY pancakes from what I can see) are RIDICULOUS. They are covered with some mix of cream/frosting and caramel but not in a disgusting or overly sugary way. We literally were just sitting there oogling the stack of three thick cakes and taking turns having bites.  They can really make any of the eggs however you like and the hash browns are not those fake little pre-cut squares. They are real potatoes that have just been prepared. AND they told us the wait would be 25-30 min but it was less than 10!! ha! I WILL BE BACK!
