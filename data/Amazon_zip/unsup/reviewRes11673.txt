my fave local pizza place becuse: 1. mashed potato and bacon pizza. delish. try it. you'll thank me later. 2. chocolate pizza. 3. their own brewery. me likey the "golden arm" 4. karaoke on thurdays and live band karaoke on saturdays. i will belt out some "i wanna be sedated" from time to time... depending how drunk i get. 5. mashed potato and bacon pizz... errr... wait. i said this already. oh well. worth another mention i guess. p.s. the wait to get a table will be long on fri and sat nights... unless you know the owner (i do). so plan ahead. p.p.s. Piece also delivers pizza now.
