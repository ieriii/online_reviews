i went here with my good friend from san francisco (a fellow food lover), and we really enjoyed it. a highlight was the casserole-style huevos rancheros. what a great idea. i think i had the pancakes with some sort of fruit, but i can't remember now so it must not have made too much of an impression. i do remember liking it though. i'm bummed i didn't try the granola now that i read all of the reviews, but there's always next time. must eat: huevos rancheros
