I was pleasantly surprised by this place. We came across it via the a la card thing we bought at ribfest this year, and were not really expecting great things. Summerberry Lemonade: Wouldn't order again, ended up being mostly just an incredible sour mess, and this is coming from someone who loves sour drinks and food. Eggplant parmesan dip: Great, it was well spiced and really savory. The portion is not huge, but it is fairly rich so that worked out in the end. Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf: I actually loved it. The meatloaf had good texture and didnt suffer from the usual too-salty problem of most restaurant meatloaf. The mashed potatoes had a good flavor, and the cheese they added to the top was well spiced and smokey. Macaronia and Cheese: Girlfriend got this, but in eating the leftovers I was a fan. She wasn't super sold on it, and ultimately I'm not a big fan of Swiss, but I found myself really liking the flavor. I would go back again, and I hope to relatively soon.
