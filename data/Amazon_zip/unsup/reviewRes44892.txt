I recently went on a trip to Chicago with my wife and son to visit her family. When we came back, people asked me where I went for my vacation, I said Giordano's. I will never have a problem visiting my wife's family in Chicago as long as there is Giordano's. My wife wants to order the thin crust and I say fine, go ahead, get whatever you want, I'll have the Stuffed Pizza. You can choke on all that cheese and it wouldn't really be that bad of a way to go. Next time, I 'm bringing one home on the plane, so help me god!
