You do not have to eat sushi to enjoy dining at Sunda. But this is a great place for beginners or experienced sushi lovers. Plenty of other great options are on the menu though.  This place is swanky by night and is more casual by day. When in doubt err on the side of business casual at the least. Or at least dust off your nice jeans and leave the Converse at home. You won't be the oddball in either a dress or pants here. What you should try: Devil's Basket: wok tossed crispy soft shell crabs (2), dried chilis, shallots, scallions, toasted garlic - Amazing. The crabs pick up the hint of heat from the chilis. If you don't like spice you'll probably be fine. This is a good spice, not a "fire in the hole!" sort. Oxtail Pot Stickers: braised oxtail, caramelized onion jus, "white" wasabi cream - extremely tender, just wonderful. Dim Sum style. Any of the Truffled Tataki Sashimi; the Summer of Sunda Roll, or the Lobster and Wagyu Roll. Or the Firecracker Roll. Delicious martinis; good wine list. Go there with friends, a date, family, coworkers - you'll do well no matter whom you eat with.
