Just made it to The Publican for the first time last night and had a great time. There were four of us and we had drinks and snacks in the bar as we arrived early and were waiting for our table reservation. The beer selection is top notch, but definitely expect to pay premium prices for their premium selections. I do have some issue with a $7 beer that seems at or less than 12oz, but you just have to deal with that and be prepared for a hefty price tag for everything at The Publican. We had a 1/2 dozen oysters (chef's choice), which were fresh and delicious, along with the charcuterie plate, which was a great way to get our feet wet with the pork-filled feast we were about to dive into for our seated dinner. After we were seated, we shared three meat dishes, two seafood dishes and a veggie dish. We started off with the beets and burratta, which was possibly my favorite dish from the night. It was a generous portion and easily sharable with a light sweetness that I could have easily had a another two plates of. The sardines (yes you can eat the bones and should for the extra flavor) and mussels came next. Definitely ask for extra bread to sop up the broth from the mussels. For meats, we had the sweetbreads, pork belly and pasta/rabbit/chorizo dish. All were delicious and very sharable. Altogether, we spent about $100/person with tax and tip that night. Definitely pricey and not a place that I would go every week, but a fun and delicious dinner if you're willing to drop some cash.
