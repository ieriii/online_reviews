Finally was able to make it out to this establishment and I was not disappointed! Seoul Sassy Wings, lived up to its name..sassy, flavorful and needed no extra dipping sauce (unless you're like my boyfriend and likes everything spicy so Sriracha it was). The big Buddha bowl (aka Bibimbop) was good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. 10 Seoul Sassy Wings and a Big Buddha Bowl were more than enough for 2 people and we definitely had some leftover to take home.
