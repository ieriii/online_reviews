I love Wishbone's. It's one of my new favorite breakfast spots. I had a great omelete- it was the Wishbone's omelete with potatoes and toast. They had very good coffee and my cup was never empty. Our waitress was very friendly and always around if we needed anything. I want to try the cornbread as I've heard its amazing. We didn't have to wait at all for a table on a busy Saturday morning. I'll definitely be going back.
