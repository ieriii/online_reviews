a solid 3.5 stars in my search for the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, it led me to Pequod's. sorry to say, but it did not live up to my expectations. don't get me wrong, i enjoyed my pepperoni/mushroom pan pizza, but it didn't really blow me away. the burnt cheese on the sides is unique and adds a texture contrast to the doughyness of the pie. maybe i'm just a thin pizza kind of guy.
