We went there for restaurant week (just yesterday) . Well, first of all I love that the valet parking costed only $5. Felt like "winning" in this one. Second, everything ran pretty smoothly. From reservations, to getting in there, even to waiting past our reservation was ok, we were hanging out at the bar, where the "amigo bartender" made me a delicious raspberry mojito! Drinks are quite expensive thou. It was a very pleasant night. The waitress was very nice and helpful. I looked at the menu to see if they had some Brazilian dishes, but as much as the waitress wanted to convince me I know that 'Jambalaya whatever dish' is NOT from Brazil. So yeah, Brazilian options won't pass the famous Caipirinha or Caipiroska ( when vodka is used instead of cachaca). Jeremy and I followed the set menu for restaurant week. He picked the bean soup (which was delicious) and i picked the argula salad (delicious as well). For entrees we had the sea food stew, and the pork and cabbage with rice. Very Cuban this last one, heavy dish, and it took me a while to finish. Still, everything was delicious. For desert, I had the pecan cake and hubby opted for cinnamon flan. We agreed that the cake was way better than the flan. The result was that everyone wanted my cake. - I think this sounds a little dirty. Fun night with friends, i LOVE the restaurants colors and vibe, and the way tables are set up. Thumbs up! :)
