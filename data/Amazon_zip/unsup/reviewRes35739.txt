I really wanted to like this place, but didn't. :(  I've lived around the corner for the past couple of years and was always scared to try it because it looks like a total dump. However, after reading rave reviews from my fellow Yelpers, a friend and I decided to give it a shot. I had the roasted duck and chicken with rice, which was cold. The duck had a lot of bones, etc. in it but the chicken was juicy. It all pretty much tasted the same. My friend had the soy bean chicken, which was no different than my plain roasted chicken. We split the Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, which was average. Sadly to say, I won't be back and it's not going to become my new neighborhood take-out place as I had hoped.
