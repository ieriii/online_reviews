This place has been around for many years and has just gotten better and better. The rib eye steak is beefy flavor and great texture. The cream spinach and wild mushroom risottos are my favorite sides. The servers, Sam, Chris, Rafael, Jose, and Michael and staff, Ahmad, have been great. The food I highly recommend and I try to go for lunch there once a week. I also like being able to have FRESH fish every day, cooked to perfection. Keep up the good work!!
