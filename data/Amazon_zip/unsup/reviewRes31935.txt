chicago diner, i love you? yesterday an adventure of adventures was taken, and boy was i lucky we stubbled upon you. both me and my friend could not stop raving about the food all night. we must have came at an odd time, because the place was oddly empty but as i was enjoying my meal (radical rueben) the place filled up. mmmmm so coming here asap. as a vegan i approve. as a person who loves food, i approve. also would like to marry whoever made my sandwich and ask them to make me delicious vegan things on a daily basis. see you soon ; )
