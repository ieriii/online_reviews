If you love meat, especially different types of meat, then you'll be in hog heaven. Get it? Hog heaven? Ha.. ha.... ha.. .. .. . I like meat too, but I prefer a little bit more balance. Still, the food was pretty good and I had nothing to complain about. The decor is interesting. I felt like I was in a barn with stalls. A swanky barn, mind you. And the bathrooms didn't have mirrors. Come on, with all that meat, I need to check my teeth to make sure my date wasn't staring at a random pepper flake as we do our requisite small talk. Give a girl some help here. Our server was helpful and polite. They got our plates out of the way and refilling water without being intrusive. I had a good experience here.
