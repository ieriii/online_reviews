I stayed here for four nights this fall for work. Hands down the best thing about my room were its size and the fact I could see the sun rising over Lake Michigan between the buildings every morning. The location was convenient, the king sized bed comfy, and all the finishes ultra plush. The bathroom featured a shower stall AND a tub. And the toilet was in its own closet. The TV was huge. one strange thing - i could hear EVERY time my neighbor showered or flushed the toilet. Very weird. And annoying. The lobby is ginourmous, with a small bar in the center with a nice selection of wines. I did like the revolving door that activated when you approached it. So yeah, the hotel is nice. But over the weekend, when I was footing the bill, I moved across the river to the Courtyard Marriott on E Hubbard street. The location was equally convenient, though we did have to walk 2 more blocks to Millenium Park. The rooms were smaller, the finishes less nice, but the service was superior. Everyone was so nice! The security guard got me ice when he was passing me in the hall and noticed the ice maker wasn't working for me. And they had a pool/jaccuzzi complimentary to guests, AND I didn't have to pay $14.95 for internet. BTW, the $14.95 for internet is for a 24 hour period that starts at midnight and goes until the next midnight. If you, for example, went out to a work dinner as soon as you got in and then wanted to check your email when you got back to the room at 11 PM, you'd pay $14.95 for the one hour until midnight, and then have to pay for it again at midnight. Apparently the internet is complimentary for gold club special people, which I was not one of. Either way, it was spotty, which is annoying especially if you're paying for it. Next time I visit Chicago, I'll probably stay elsewhere. Unless you're a rich person who doesn't mind being nickel and dimed, or you're here for work on a conference, I'd recommend you do the same.
