My partner and I had a great meal here to celebrate my birthday. I had the Alaskan halibut which is cooked in parchment paper and then served with an amazing sauce. It was probably the best halibut I have ever eaten. My partner had a delicious asparagus and ricotta ravioli. It needed a bit of pepper, but otherwise was quite tasty as well. We had excellent service -- attentive, friendly, but not intrusive -- and she appreciated our slightly warped sense of humor. All in all, a fabulous meal in a very lovely room. For those who like outdoor dining, there is a nice space in their back yard that is nice change of pace from the tables in front of restaurants where the bus fumes "enhance" the meal.
