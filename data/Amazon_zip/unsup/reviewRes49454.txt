I was not impressed. we actually came here by accident since another restaurant was not available. The main thing for me was the service. The service was very slow. The waiter maybe came over once or twice. The food was eh, ok. I should not have ordered Skirt steak, since I am not much of a steak eater anyway.  The ambience was very loud, especially one guy at a group table talking from the top of his lungs. That was very obnoxious. I also don't remember hearing any music either. I would say, I would not come here again.
