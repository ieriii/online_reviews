Be prepared to eat a LOT. For instance, I ordered the Chicken Sabatino (chicken stuffed with wild rice, mushrooms, and olives with a similar sauce of mushrooms/olives/potatoes over it). The dish is $16.00 + tax, and this is what you get: When you first sit down, you get a loaf of white bread (olive oil and parmesan cheese are already on the table), pizza bread (delish!), salad, a cup of soup... and then your entree! Because I used to live in the area, I would often time introduce people to it... and they are hooked! The food tastes authentic, and the atmosphere is great too. I highly suggest reservations, and while you wait, have a drink in the separate bar or around the piano.
