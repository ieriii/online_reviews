When you hit Bourdain's top 10 places to eat before you die, your doing something right. Hot Doug gives me a culinary erection! I apologize for the disturbing relation, but its true. Long wait, but all god things come to those that do wait. Canfield's 50/50 soda, need I say more? Genius combinations to make up his menu, you truly cant go wrong. Do yourself a favor, dont doubt and get your ass into Hot Doug's.
