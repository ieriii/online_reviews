My girlfriend wanted to eat duck so I figured I'd go to Sun Wah to carry out. I didn't know what kind of duck they had so i figured i'd give them a call. The lady who picked up the phone at Sun Wah had an accent and obviously was having some trouble describing the various ducks they offered so I decided to do her a favor and speak Chinese. I speak rather well but can't write it so as she spoke in Chinese I began writing as fast as I could in English. It's rather difficult translating Chinese spoken words into English words. Anyway, I asked her to repeat herself and she got rather abrupt telling me that she had told me X number of times what they offered and then hung up on me! I called back and this time a man answered. I asked him the same question and as he started to answer, he began to laugh and then he hung up on me as well! Believe that? I guess they don't care to offer good customer service now that business is good. Keep up the good work Sun Wah!!! I decided to call Hon Kee, right down the street on Argyle. The man was SO patient and even explained how the ducks were cooked. Needless to say, forget Sun Wah.
