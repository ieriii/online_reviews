I think the place is going down. I have been going here for years but I stopped because of sanitary reasons and they always mess up take out orders. I never get what I order for take outs. The cooks put in whatever they want regardless what is says on the order ticket. I don't know how they passed the health inspection back in February with bugs around maybe they know people . I still see them taking out the trash/garbage through the front door which is a health code no no.
