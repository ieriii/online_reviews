Where to begin??!! The first mistake was going there on a Saturday night at 9:30. The second mistake was waiting in line in that wooden shack out front for 40 minutes. After several tables of 4 were seated before us (it was just me and my girlfriend) I complained and was asked to leave. My mistake for going on a Saturday. Violet Hour's mistake for running such an unorganized line and for being so rude.
