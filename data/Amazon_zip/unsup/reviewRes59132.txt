great value -- ridiculous amount of food, could easily share with someone else.i got the zamboni crepes and it came with 2 crepes, a generous portion of potoates, and 2 pancakes! everything was delicious.we had about an hour wait so we walked through grant park, hilton chicago, and the public library (harold washington).
