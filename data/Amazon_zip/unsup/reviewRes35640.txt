You can get one or any combination of: 1. char siu, 2. roast pork w/ crispy skin 3. soy chicken 4. roast duck Comes w/ rice, side of chinese broccoli, and half a salted egg.  All for under $5! Keep in mind, choices 1-4 are not the best I've had. Esp the roast duck. The skin is not that crispy, duck is a bit anorexic, and just missing that quality I can't really describe. I've just had much better duck such as in N. VA. And I'm still looking for one in Chicago. Regardless, you get a nice balanced meal for under $5 and in under 5 minutes. I would take this place over McD's any day of the week!
