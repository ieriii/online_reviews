located across the street from the pasta bowl, the bf and i decided we needed to sit and rest over some coffee before we trekked around some more. this inside is very cozy and intimate and the server/cashier guy was super friendly. although we were already stuffed with pasta, we still ordered a strawberry/nutella crepe with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. the dish came out dressed in whip cream and a little umbrella! oh, and our ice water had cucumbers in it too. i love this place and i say that we need more independent coffee shops and less starbucks!
