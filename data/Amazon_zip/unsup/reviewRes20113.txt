Listen.....if you want to be waited on and pampered, go to Topolabampo or Frontera next door. If you want awesome no frills Mexican food in a casual environment...step right up. XOCO rocks. Yes I had to wait in line for 25 minutes before being seated, but who cares? The food was well worth the wait. Had the poblano, chicken and potato soup, chips and salsa and the Ahogada sandwich. All amazing. Then finished with the churros and homemade vanilla soft serve, which was beyond description. Simple and delicious. Side note: How funny is Sandra G's review below? "I wondered if the owner even knew what Xoco meant..." It's Rick Bayless Sandy....umm...I'm guessing he knows...just a hunch. Too funny. Bottom line: walk, don't run to Xoco for amazing mexican food.
