This...man...knows...food.... Any sandwich is devine, the soups are equally delicious, and the churros are off the chain good. Compliment your lunch by trying one of his chocolate beverages. They're full of deep harmonious flavor. I also recently went for breakfast, again Rick's food does not dissapoint. I think he could take taco bell's menu, change nothing, and "I would walk 500 miles *sing the tuen damn you" and give T-bell 5 stars. Call me a fanboy, but I love this place. Serve your own water, thank you, I will. I drink like Don Rickles insults, which is a lot. Nice to have a place give you a change of pace. Not to mention it probably helps the servers out a little. Just go here already. It's good for you. In one way or another.
