My husband and I decided to try this place on a whim and walked in for breakfast on a Saturday. The food is creative and delicious, with reasonable portions! They have a mix of savory and sweet items. Their egg-based dishes come with a great mix of avocado, chorizo etc.Not a very extensive menu, but enough to for everyone to find something. It is not a very large space and tends to be popular.
