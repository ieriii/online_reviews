This hotel was recommended. I spoke to the manager and was told I would have a lake view room, which did not happen. I prepaid for room and discovered if I had waited, I could have gotten room for a lot less. The promised free in room Internet was going to be charged. When I asked to speak with the manager who assured me over the phone that my requests would be satisfied, I was told she was not available the five nights we stayed.
