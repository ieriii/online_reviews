What can I say.....humm let me think....THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! It was a total surprise to me that the food was sooo tasty. My friend took to Mercat for my birthday. It is a place that I passed everyday on my way to class, but never thought to stop and eat. She told me that the food there was good, but I didn't't know that it would be THAT good. The dishes that we ordered consisted of : Costillas De Terner, which is a beef shortribs with horseradish parmesan and Bacon. All of those yummy topping were served on a warm flatbread. The shortribs were tender, the parmesan was gooey, the horseradish gave the dish a kick without being over powering and the bacon...well who doesn't like bacon. Gambas Al Ajillo, which is garlic shrimp. They serve the shrimp sizzling in butter. If is the freshest shrimp I ever tasted. It was so good that I didn't mind if my breath smelled like garlic. Datiles Con Almendras, Bacon-wrapped Dates stuffed almonds. Now this was a dish that I was very skeptical about but my friend told me I would love it and I was pleasantly surprised with this dish. I not a big fan of dates, but when mixed with the almonds, bacon and spinach it was amazing! I couldn't put my fork down. Sangrias are crisp and refreshing. We had the one served with cranberries. Last but not least was the dessert. I don't remember that name of it and it is not on the current menu, but it was a olive oil cake with almond ice cream. I was the perfect portion and the cake was served warm. They also put this crunchy wafer on top of the ice cream. I would never think that olive oil cake would taste as good as it did. They perfected that dish. If you want good food go here!
