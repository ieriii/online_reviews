xoco was SO SO good! Line was a little long, but it was well worth it. Chips and guac had so much flavor and portion size was good. i had the ahogada, so delicious. It had pork, black beans, and salsa! The sandwich was huge. My date had the pozole with gunthrop chicken. Excelent as well, another giant portion. I like that Bayless supports the local farms. Something that seems so easy, but not enough restaurants participate in! I can't wait to come back as the staff was so friendly and outgoing and the food was superb!
