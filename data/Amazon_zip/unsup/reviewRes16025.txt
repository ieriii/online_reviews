A really special place. Everyone was very polite, but not sickeningly so, the drinks were perfectly concocted, and watching the bartender create them was a treat in itself. Beautifully decorated, a gorgeous dusty blue all over with unexpected white molding, and fun high backed chairs that my friend compared to Alice in Wonderland. The giant velvet drapery helps to muffle sound, so it's quiet and extra cozy. My friend and business partner was a regular at Milk & Honey, and she couldn't help but notice the many similarities (apparently the chief mixologist at Violet Hour worked there) - the drink ingredients, the arm bands - except a true speakeasy where you have to be a member and buzzed in with a video monitor at the door probably wouldn't fly in a no-nonsense city like Chicago, so they left that part out! Oh well . . . By the end of the night, we were finally able to come up with a name for our fledgling business, so apparently it gets your inspirado flowing - I plan on being a regular and going bankrupt here (um, it's pretty pricey)!!
