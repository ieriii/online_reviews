The little cafe in the corner of this Market serves up some of the best lunch meals you can find. Highly underrated Delicious sandwiches, panini, soups, salads, and house made fries. It is very good. Every summer when I return to Chicago, I have to come here and get a bite to eat. It is fresh yet savory and very filling. Anything you order will be bomb. The line is usually extended into the market, deservingly so. But they are quick and keep people moving. They also have some of the best desserts. Who said dessert is for after a meal? Shoot, hun, I snagged about 4 or 5 and checked out and ate them throughout the day. mhm. Delicious. The not so quiet setting of this cafe is delightful. It's in a market so you get the hustle and bustle of city life, which I happen to love. Great place to eat with friends and enjoy a great mid-afternoon lunch. Refresh rejuvenate here! Hot Eats.
