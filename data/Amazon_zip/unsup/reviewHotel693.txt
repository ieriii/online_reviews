I walked in off the street and I am only a silver member with Marriott They hooked my son and I up with a room ASAP, i was really impressed, it was so last minute and everything in town was booked up. They could have charged anything they wanted and they gave me a great rate. I have been at the Marriott on the mile and it was not as nice as this place was. Such a good call. I love how close it was to everything. Will be staying there again. The parking was great and desk service was the best. PLUS room service rocked!!!!
