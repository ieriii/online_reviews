We didn't sit down for a meal here, but just ordered some pastries to-go: specifically the almond and walnut baklava (can't have too much baklava) as well as some cookies (can't remember the name but they had raspberry filling, one end was dipped in chocolate then in sprinkles). Everything was delicious and the baklava was sweeter than any I'd had before. The cookies were great, especially dipped in tea. This cafe is so cute, I'm definitely planning on making another visit. Hopefully over my lunch break since it's pretty close to work!
