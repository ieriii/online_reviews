There is a wait - but not bad. Their sandwiches were great - yeah. The hot sauce could kill a man - loves it. But the most important thing I took away with me after eating here was that this place has the most delicious guacamole I've ever tasted. I could literally come here, order a heaping bowl of their guacamole, and eat it straight it's that good. And, seeing as I am from California, and therefore an undisputed resident expert in avacado dishes, I suggest you take my advice and try it, even if you just get chips and guac. (Although why would you do that... get some other stuff too.)
