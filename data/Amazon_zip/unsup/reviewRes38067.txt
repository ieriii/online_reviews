My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while visiting Chicago. I'm not usually a fan of deep dish pizza, but this was something of it's own. We had the deep dish spinach with mozzarella & parmesan cheese....so yummy! They do not skimp on the ingredients, especially the cheese! We ordered the small and still had enough to feed 1-2 more people. The pizza takes a while to prepare, so I suggest looking at the menu while you wait to be seated and ordering at the counter so it's ready by the time you sit down. Bonus fun was watching the guys in the back toss around the pizza dough and pile on the toppings.
