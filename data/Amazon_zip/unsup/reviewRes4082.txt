Schwa Although, not every dish works, you are still glad they tried. This is the double diamond for a foodie night out. This place is the counter culture of "cuisine on the edge". This is not a place to take anyone who is afraid of food. It's not a place you want to take your mother to dinner. This is a place for foodies to enjoy someone who colors outside of the line. The ambience is little and so is the space. Rockin' music expletive ridden, only goes to highlight the cross directional attitude of the food. I went by myself because I knew if I took my partner, he would be in his own food hell here. I did the 9 course which became 11 with additions from the kitchen. What worked for me was the: The greeting, first names. I felt special before I sat down. Clarified Bloody - Amuse that was just that amusing and delicious. Octopus Poke - a real taste of Hawaii with taro and pineapple chips are more. It was as pretty as delicious. Elote - a take on local street food with popcorn. A total hit out of the park! And I am a corn snob, from Maryland land of silver queen.    Halibut - amazing. Biscuits and Gravy - fantastic! Dessert. - incredible. Who would have thunk. Beyond description, lets just say never would have thought celery could work in dessert. Almost worked Taglaitelle - It was great but soo many ingredients, a few of them tripped over each other. Less would be more here. S'more - perhaps the most creative with "campfire" won't spoil the surprise, but it would have been better without the savory mole and just done as dessert Fell Short Cheese - great idea courgette, but over salted. Hendricks sorbet - great but rose flavor completely covered the juniper. Maybe that was the idea. free addition. Roe - This one totally missed me. The rapid-fire verbal description of each dish. With all that thought and preparation, seems a shame to run through what's on the plate in 10 seconds or less.
