I'd been to Anteprima a couple years ago on a Friday evening for a group dinner and wasn't very satisfied with the experience. I felt like it was very loud and the meals were overpriced. I'm writing this review because I had a different experience a few weeks ago.I went with just one other person a few weeks ago and we had a great experience. The restaurant seemed much quieter and felt more intimate. The food was excellent and the prices weren't outrageous. This may all have been the difference between initially going on a Friday evening to recently going on a Sunday evening. This time, I also shared all appetizers, main courses, and wine with the other person. That may have also helped in making the prices feel more reasonable.Overall, I feel this is a nice place to go to if you're looking to have a more intimate experience and able to share with whoever you're going to have dinner with. I'd go back for that type of occassion, but not for a group meal.
