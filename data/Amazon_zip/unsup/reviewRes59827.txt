I was hungry, in a hurry and just wanted something to eat. Anything would of done. I saw this little pizza shop in a very little shopping mall (strip). It only contained 3 stores. I entered and in a matter of 2 minutes or less (at lunch hour no less) I had a slice of pizza. Not expecting much I returned to my car for a quick bite. Three minutes later I went back for another. It was soooo sooooooo gooood. I couldn't believe it. I would give it 5 stars for the speed and service of the staff, and 4 stars for the pizza.
