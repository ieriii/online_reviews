In our journey to find the best sushi in Chicago, Coast was stop number two for my friend and I. And, thank goodness it was such an early restaurant in our quest, because we learned a very valuable lesson in sushi: Listen. To. Your. Server. To preface, we got a table right away, which was great. The restaurant is pretty large, very conducive to pairs or slightly larger groups. It had a trendy vibe without being obnoxious, and all the staff came off as very friendly. After we were seated, our server came over and suggested his favorite rolls on the menu, and also took the time to point out some specials that were written on a chalk board behind the counter (which we never would have noticed otherwise). Per his suggestions, we ordered the White Dragon (everyone's favorite and for a darn good reason), the Volcano, the Popper (from the secret chalk menu) and the Ebi Tempura. Oh, and some wasabi oysters to start. Phenomenal. The oysters were such a tease, we each had one and wanted more. But it definitely set the tone for what we were about to experience. The White Dragon is to die for, the combination of sauces and goodness within was perfect. The Volcano was presented in, well, as a volcano. Which was cool, and it was just spicy enough so that it lived up to its name without making you lunge for your water. The Ebi tempura was fabulous, however disappointing that it only came with 4 pieces. I would have gladly had more. And, last but not least, the Popper. Oh. My. God. We had to order a second roll because we were so thunderstruck with its awesomeness. It's a sushi chef's take on a jalepeno popper, thats the best way to describe it. Jalepeno and cilantro blended perfectly with fish. I think it's just a special roll that makes it's appearance whenever Coast sees fit, but it should become a regular. It's to die for. All in all, I was very pleased with my Coast experience. I'll definitely be back once I'm done questing around the city for my "perfect sushi" project.
