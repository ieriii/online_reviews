Went during restaurant week to try their fixed 3 course meal. The wine list is like reading a book. Seafood gumbo - tasted great. Although I wish it was a bit heartier. Ribeye - a bit fatty and salty. Otherwise, it was amazing. I had it medium rare and I felt like I should have gotten a rare. I think I'll try the filet next time. The 3 sides were nothing spectacular. (spinach, potatoes, mushrooms). Dessert Symphony - loved it and I'm not even a dessert type of guy.
