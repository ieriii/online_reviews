Outstanding Hotel! Our first contact with Chicago and its people was the Avenue Hotel. My girlfriends and I met in Chicago for a weekend getaway and everyone was so kind, helpful, and pleasant from the moment you entered the door. They definitely gave one the feeling you were their main concern. We were all so hungry when we arrived and didn't really know what direction to walk. We asked the first person we saw which happened to be the Bellman, what he suggested. Without hesitation he got us a map and highlighted a few places and sent us on our way. We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel is beautiful. Great location for walking if you don't mind the frigid air, but it was a nice change. Shopping, museums, restaurants, they were all so close we didn't' even need to rent a car. However at one point the Taxi Cab did feel warm and inviting. The rooms were very nice and comfortable with a hip, contemporary feel and awesome beds. I don't remember the last time I slept that good in a hotel. There was a lot going on at night and the Sky Lounge at the top of the hotel was a perfect way to end our evenings, what a view! It was a happy place. We would love to return for another Girls Weekend in Chicago. Thank you Avenue Hotel!
