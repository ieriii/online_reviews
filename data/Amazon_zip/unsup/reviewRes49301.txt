Our team had an event in their private upstairs section that oversees the restaurant. We had a great wine selection along with other drinks. It took them a long time before they brought out the appetizers and we wished they brought out more at a time. But they were really good, the little hamburgers were a hit! They have a store in the front of the restaurant that sells all sorts of wine stuff. I hear their cheese fondue and wine samplers are really good. Definitely have to come back and try it out!
