What a great experience - the food was great and it was kinda neat to cook your own. Just a tip - if you go with 10 people, order meat for 7 or so. That's what we did (went with someone in the know), and am so grateful we did. The atmosphere wasn't the best and I went home smelling like smoked meat... maybe that would be a plus for some people, though...
