Glad to have finally tried this place I've hear so much about. They do a good job being creative with some of their dishes and portions are pretty large. But overall, I wasn't so impressed (can you screw up eggs?). It was a good breakfast place for sure but I won't be dying for a return. AND I think I may prefer Yolk just because of their Strawberry Orange Juice!
