I had multiple foodgasms last night when I ate at Sultan's Market. I love the chicken shwarma dinner. It is so much food, it feeds me twice. Everything I've eaten here is delicious, especially the hummus. They are cash only and byob. They must read the reviews because the chicken was really spicy last night. Vegans/vegetarians, I've found chicken in both my hummus and baba ganoush, which for me is just a treat. I only wish the pitas were warm. You will not regret eatting here.
