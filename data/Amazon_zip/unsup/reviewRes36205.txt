Wonderful! I had an amazing lamb curry special once. Delievery and dining in has never disappointed.  My only complaints are that it does get crowded on the weekend, so stop by on a Monday night if you prefer a more intimate dining experience. Also, don't come in close to closing time- the servers WILL rush you out by dropping your check mid-entree. This is something that would normally really set me off, but I happen to love the place enough to ignore the one-time occurence. I'd give them five stars, aside from these two complaints!
