I like to dance a dance of many meats. Succulent sausages, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, filet mignon, pork, ribs, chick, lamb chops, lamb leg and more! I feel like its the Night Before Christmas, but with meat instead of sugar plums. The meal starts off with a visit to the salad bar, which is a pretty impressive treat. It has all sorts of things not found on your usual iceberg lettuce and crouton salad bars. Its all really a distraction from the main event and an invitation to fill up on something other than meat. Even as good as it is, it falls short of Texas De Brazil here. When you return to your table you'll find fried plantains, fried polenta, mashed potatoes and some wonderful, hot, cheesy tasting rolls. I think the rolls are amazing. I would go here for the rolls alone. Once you're settled in the real show starts, the parade of meats. Gauchos roam the room with sizzling skewers of meat fresh from the grill. They'll come to your table and ask you how you like it cooked, and then slice you off an appropriate piece. The meat is well seasoned, it every bite is nice and hot. Unfortunately you really get what you ask for plus or minus a temperature. The ribs I had here were also way way overdone. If you're looking for something specific, be sure to ask. The staff will make sure it gets to your table right away. Service is pretty amazing considering you don't really have someone specific assigned to your table. There always seems to be someone at your side asking if you need a refill, or would like another drink.
