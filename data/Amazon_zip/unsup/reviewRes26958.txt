I don't get their pizzas. I was so excited to read "caramelized crust" and believed it to involve turning starch or doing some science magic turning chemicals into sugar for a sweet taste. WRONG. By caramelized they really mean burnt. The edges are burnt and the crust is.. well, it's just bread. I don't think they use yeast.. more like baking soda or baking powder as a riser, and so it tastes more like very thick breadsticks than what you'd expect as pizza dough that Italian chefs spin in the air. Not enough cheese. Sauce was good, though, although slightly on the saltier side if I could say. I would never rate this as one of Chicago's bestest pizzas as others have put it. I've tried better.
