This is the second time I have been to Gilt Bar, and it was not nearly as good as the first time. I shared the mashed potatoes and french fries for an appetizer and had the gnocchi with squash for my meal. The food all tasted good, but not great. I was excited for the gnocchi, as I had it the last time I went here (granted that was over a year ago), but it didn't really have much flavor. Overall, I was a bit disappointed, as I had high expectations since I loved it so much last time.
