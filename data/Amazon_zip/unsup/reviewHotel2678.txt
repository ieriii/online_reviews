Hip. That about sums up The James. Where else could you go and find someone on an elevator pick up on your 'This Is Spinal Tap' reference when someone requests the eleventh floor? My six nights here were very pleasant. There were only a few nitpicky details that kept me from awarding the fifth star. The bed was very comfy and The James knows that three pillows are not too many. Oddly, though, I found the sheets to be rough and actually caused sores on my elbows. Bathroom was spotless everyday. But the toilet lid would not stay up. This can make for some awkward experiences. The James supplies Kiehl's bath products. I kept taking them and they kept replenishing. Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and lotion. I'm going to give them as Christmas gifts I have so many of them. Nice touches include original art in the room and fun books to peruse. Bathrobes and slippers included. Free internet in the lobby if you're not traveling with your laptop.  The location is great. Two blocks from the Mile and about four blocks from the red line. Plenty of good eats in the 'hood, too. The staff was great, always friendly. I would definitely stay here again.
