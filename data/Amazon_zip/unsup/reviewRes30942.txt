The peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie dough vegan milkshake really was pretty amazing! We enjoyed the sweet potato quesadilla, the bean chili, and the cornbread quite a bit too. Highly recommend for vegetarians and non-vegetarians a like. The don't take reservations though, and the wait can be long, so I docked them a point for that.
