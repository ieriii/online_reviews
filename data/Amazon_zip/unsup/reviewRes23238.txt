My prior impression of Lao Sichuan had been "good food, but horrible service." That was why I had not returned to the restaurant for over a year. My most recent visit, however, was a refreshing experience.  I went with a friend from China who was in need of some authentic Sichuan cuisine. The food was good as usual - slightly watered down, but still authentic-tasting Sichuan dishes. More importantly, the service has markedly improved. Our waitress was brisk but efficient and friendly. All wishes were granted without attitude.  I still wouldn't use "good" to describe the service. But service is much better than before, and is definitely above the Chinatown-average. So if you have been deterred from going back because of its service, I'd say give it another shot. You might just be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
