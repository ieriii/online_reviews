How did I skip writing this the moment we got home from eating at Bonsoiree!! What a fabulous dinner & service. Each course was just that much better than the one preceding it and that's hard since EVERYTHING was made to perfection. Chef Luke came our table to serve one dish (not to the others though) - how awesome is that? Chef Shin wasn't there but made sure we had "extras" Since this was our 2nd anniversary dinner, the ambiance made it all that much better. Going back? You bet!!
