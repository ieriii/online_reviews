I always have a great time at this place, and I am in love with their arrabiata sauce. In. Love. I've tried to reproduce it at home and just can't. Warm, cheery atmosphere. Friendly, attentive service. BYOB. Always food left over to take home. It's loud and a little cramped inside, but in happy, cozy way. Feels like a boisterous family party.  Also be aware: there can be a long wait on the weekends. However, when I went there last weekend, they took my phone number so that they could call when a table was available. We went to the pub down the street and 30 min later, ring ring, your table is ready! Awesome. I would give Caro Mio 5 stars, the the prices have gone WAY UP in the last year or so. My beloved pasta arrabiata has gone from about $15 to $20. Overpriced for a tomato sauce despite its perfection. Thank god the place is BYOB.
