From there we grabbed a bus back into the loop near the miracle mile with the intent to get some grub.....after a few menu views...we decided to go ahead with Texas de Brazil. A Brazilian steakhouse. Where they bring all you can eat cuts of meat to your table on skewers and cut off servings from there. They also have a salad bar...all the high end stuff you would see a salad bar have....and none of the cheap stuff to fill you up. Really tasty, even had a small selection of heated stuff just in case you don't do the meats. We decided on a bottle of house wine and a couple of desserts as well. This meal was EXPENSIVE but was really worth it. The Brazilian Papaya Cream had a float of Creme de Casis on it. And the Chocolate Mousse cake was rich....so rich we took it home. Our server...was great, Nina made us feel so welcome and special. This was intended to to be our "big night" of the trip and she surely made it our big night. Her service was what you would expect at a top of the line establishment. I would highly recommend Texas de Brazil based on Nina alone.
