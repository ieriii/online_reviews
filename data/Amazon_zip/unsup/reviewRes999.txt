Since there's thousands of reviews for Hot Doug's, I'll try to keep my review as concise, interesting, and relevant as possible!  I lived in Chicago for the past 3 years and just moved this past summer. I had to get my booty to Hot Doug's. Let's just say, I had high expectations...and they were somewhat met.  Pros - Duck fat fries - these are as good as everyone says - Mr. Doug himself takes the order - I like me some old fashion Chicago dog. Them other dogs too fancy. People love them though, so try them if you are up to it! Cons - With all the anticipation of waiting in line and then the stress of ordering fast because of the long line, there's too many menu options! - The day we went the hood was broken and they gave us choice: (1) Wait more and take your chances (2) Wait more tomorrow - I was upset because I took a $30 taxi just to be sure I was there super early Conclusion It's like Pink Hot Dog in LA, if you are in the area, you just have to go and try it. It's like a rite of passage into the city. Same thing for Hot Doug's - if your in Chicago, take your e-reader and camelback, and make your way over to Hot Doug's!
