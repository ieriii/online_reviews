Vegetarians beware! Oh beautiful meat! Be prepared to sweat this one out for a couple of days, but trust me when I say it's entirely worth it. Unlike the 'other' Brazilian steak houses in Chicago, Texas de Brazil adds a lot of elegance to the borderline 'meat buffet'. I recommend trying a bit of everything on each skewer that comes around to your table so I HIGHLY recommend NOT eating any of their sides or salad bar. You're paying a high cost for the meat, not lettuce, so fill up on what they specialize in. If you do bring a vegetarian and they aren't gagging at the meat flying around them, don't worry! Although I don't recommend filling up on the large salad bar if you plan on indulging in their meat selection, the salad bar is well known for it's delicious options. I realize buffets are sometimes gross, but their salad bar is unlike any other buffet I've ever seen - fresh, clean, and tons of options from regular salads to grilled vegetables to cheese platters and so much more. They have it all! The restaurant itself is a wonderful place for a date or bringing a client. The lighting is dim so it could be either romantic or intimate enough to talk business and make a solid impression. The 2 story wine cellar with the trapeze girl fetching the bottles is a fantastic conversation piece. The servers and bussers are always incredibly kind and efficient and certainly live up to a high end dining experience.
