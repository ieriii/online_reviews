As has been mentioned, and as you may have noticed, they are BYOB. Great selling point. All they had to do to impress me was be halfway decent, food-wise. As it turns out, they were fullway decent. Went on Mother's Day with my whole nuclear family, 6 in total. All of us enjoyed the heck out of our food. I recommend getting the specials that aren't on the menu. The waiter gave us the rundown, and the females in the family made him repeat the list of special specials (so special, they aren't on the menu!) to hear his Italian accent again. Anyways, I had a chicken breast in porcini mushroom sauce with housemade portobello mushroom ravioli. Delicate, tender pasta, perfectly cooked chicken, and super flavorful sauce. The only criticism was it was a bit salty, but I like salt. For someone more sensitive to it, could be overwhelming. Everyone had one of the "special specials," except my sister, who had a normal special, the salmon picatta. She, and all of my family, raved about their food. $24-ish per entree. Not cheap, but worth it, in my opinion. BYOB makes it all the more affordable. Oh, and we had the bruschetta, and calamari appetizers. Nice bruschetta, very fresh tasting. Calamari was exactly as it should be. If you order calamari and it comes out rubbery, immediately flip over the table in fury and storm out, even if you already ordered your entrees, because a poor calamari portends poor entrees. Anywho, our calamari was tender and delicious, so, luckily, we didn't have to do that. To be fair, I went there a couple years ago for Valentine's Day with the wife as well, but never got around to rating it. Had the lasagna that day. I remember it being nicely browned around the edges so the cheese hardens up into a sexy, chewy crust. I like that. Its what I'd call a neighborhood gem. Parking is easy to find, and service is decent. Oh, did I mention you should bring some vino? Every restaurant should be BYOB...
