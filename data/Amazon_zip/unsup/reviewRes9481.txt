Dining at Sprouts was one of my two highlights when I was in Chicago for new years with my boyfriend. As a Top Chef fan I just had to visit Sprout as Dale is one of my favorite contestant on the show. The food was very good but it did however had its missteps, I order the foie gras appetizer; the Torchon was very smooth but the cannoli shell was a bit too stiff and hard to eat with knife and fork. My boyfriend had the scallop app and it was delicious with all its accompaniment. Finally after our first course they brought us the bread with a butter bean spread (yum!) The first intermezzo was a cauliflower soup, while it was ok, I felt it could of been a lot more. For my entree I order the pork and my boyfriends order the braise short rib, my entree was probably the best dish we had all night, the dish came with these tiny meatball that was out of this world. While my boyfriends dish wasn't very impressive at all and the reduction was a bit too salty for my taste. Our second intermezzo threw me for a loop, I thought we were having some local artisanal cheese, while we did, he served up in a grill cheese sandwich form with house made mustard (yum!), apple and a Ipa chaser. Half of what he served would of been more than enough. Finally for our dessert I had the grape and apple for my boyfriend. My dessert consist of 3 filled donut hole and a grape sorbet chaser and the apple dessert was apple and bacon filled crepe with root beer dust and toffee brittle. While the dessert was good but I was waaaaay too full to really appreciate it. Over all the meal was delicious and very reasonably priced $65 for a 5 course meal and since we checked in with foursquared we were given a glass of complimentary champagne. All of the staff was extremely nice and friendly and cute to boot. When I come back to Chicago I'll def make a reservation here again.
