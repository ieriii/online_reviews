Good place to grab a bite to eat when with a group of people who all want different types of food. Although nothing on the regular dinner menu is spectacular, all the entrees are very solid and give generous proportions. However, the best part of the meal comes after the main meal: dessert. Whether you order the molten chocolate cake, beignets, strawberry shortcake or red velvet cake, you can't go wrong. Along with the good food comes great service, as well as a nice overall ambiance. Personal Recommendation: Chicken Pot Pie or Jambalaya; Strawberry Shortcake or Beignets
