Good, authentic Vietnamese food in Chicago. I toured Vietnam in '05, and when I returned I was disappointed with the Americanized food at the places I visited. Not so at Tank. This place is the real deal. I went with a party of 8. Most of us ordered pho, a sandwich and salad. But one friend ordered Tom Kho Tau, a shrimp dish. To his surprise although fully cooked, the heads and legs were still intact. Not too convenient to wolf down quickly, but very very like the experience I had in Vietnam. So too with the chicken, which is neither white nor dark meat, but whole chicken cut in vertical portions from top to bottom. Sounds odd, but still tastes like chicken! The service here is solid and as others have said, amusingly you are waited on by more than one person. I'd go back any time I crave some good pho, or banh mi doi. The food is inexpensive, tasty and authentic.
