I came here this past Sunday to meet a client and his wife for their weekly poetry slam. I was excited. On several occasions my client told me about the fun they had going on this weekly Sunday event. This place does seep charm, history, seduction, that smokey jazz joint you envision... with out the smoke. Since I came here during the poetry slam, I can't say anything about the jazz or how the crowd is for that. The slam was pretty tip top, you have to give it up for the effort and courage that these people have for doing this, because honestly if you don't bring it, the crowd will let you hear it. I got to be a judge... I even got razzed at a little. It is more in fun, but you get to hear all sorts of short stories, poems, one guy even played the piano. Apparently they have a band after wards, but not this night. But if you do go for slam night, look out for Ginalli... (I probably misspelled his name), ummm just really an entertaining poet and a crowd favorite as well as Nicky Poo.... yes, apparently that is his real name.... I will say our first waitress was not too friendly, she apparently did not want to be there at all, forgetting an ordered drink and a water in two separate occasions. Our second waitress was good though... so I am going to say the service is hit or miss... but a fun time... well its probably going to be spot on.
