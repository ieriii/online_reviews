I had been craving Indian Food after not having it for a couple months and a visit from a friend spurred my visit to India House.! The food was extremely tasty and the menu a little overwhelming. It felt odd having to order my food by number because the menu was so large. We ordered two dishes and there is still plenty left in my fridge for dinner tonight, and lunch tomorrow. I can definitely recommend the wheat Nan bread! If you reserve a table, the ones by the window seem the nicest. On a side note, the woman yelling at her husband two tables over was pretty amusing!
