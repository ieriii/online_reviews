As much as it pains me to say this, Crisp's wings FADE Harold's! I met up with a few Yelpers at An P's Get Yo Wing On event and I must say, I had my doubts. I mean, all this hype about how good these wings are, there's no WAY they can be better than Harold's. As I stood in line confused about what to order, Matthew S.'s smiling face appeared and schooled me on what and how to order. He recommended I get the wings doused in Seoul Sassy sauce since I'm such a sassy Soul Sista. And boy I'm glad I did! First let me say that I have NEVA EVA EVA in my life had chicken fried to this crispy level of perfection. And that sauce---hmmmph, you betta run and tell dat...homeboy! I ordered a side of kimchee which was super spicy and very tasty, but really, all I needed were the wings. My ONLY complaint is that Crisp is a bit expensive. You can get a half chicken at Harold's with bread and fries for less than $10. I paid almost $15 for five jumbo wings and the kimchee. Nevertheless, I'm in love.
