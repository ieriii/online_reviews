The Violet Hour is hands down my favorite cocktail bar I have ever been to. As far as price goes I, unlike others, think that it is an excellent deal. You are getting a drink made with freshly squeezed juices, hand carved ice, homemade bitters, generous pours, and the assurance that if you don't like it they will gladly make you a different beverage. To me, that is worth the 3 or 4 dollar premium over a appletini any day. I have gone roughly 10 times and the service has always been excellent and the wait staff nearly always know when I need another drink. Personally, this isn't the type of place I would want to come to when it is packed just because I enjoy taking it easy and enjoying a long conversation. So if you are like me, don't go on a Friday or Saturday night. Couple words of advice. This is a place to talk amongst friends, not get wasted and party. Go with a group of friends and order different things so you can try a bunch. For me it is experiment for the first round and indulge in the second :). I have been disappointed with the famous Juliet and Romeo the last few times I have had it. A couple years ago it was from heaven, now I think it is average. If you are a beer lover they do have Miller High Life but you will probably get a funny look or two. Cheers.
