Overall: Fantastic place specializing in pig-derived portions.  Friendly waitstaff, good selection of food and drinks, and very reasonably priced (considering it's on Michigan Ave)! The Purple Pig. You've heard all about this place. Reviewers rave. All your friends talk about it. Is it really that good? The answer is yes. Unless you can't eat pork products. In which case, I feel sorry for you, and we'll meet at Avec. Everything on the menu is great. Highlights include their pate and the to-die-for, let-me-lick-the-plate-clean, braised pork shoulder. Even the bread is good. The overall meal will run you less than $30 per person including wine, which is a ridiculous bargain for where you are and what you get.  Don't blame me if you get fat though. Not the place for the health-conscious.
