Drinks - 4.5 stars Food - 3 stars Drinks - Tonight was a cocktail kinda night...I had the In Your Dreamsicle, Kitchen KoolAid and Summatime Lemonade. They were all phenomenal, and I was buzzing at the bottom of the first! The In Your Dreamsicle tastes just like an orange cream soda... a must try. Kitchen KoolAid has sweet and sour mix in it, very sour taste but to my liking. Summatime Lemonade had big juicy strawberries floating around in it that were like dessert at the bottom of the drink. Yum. Food - The burgers were nothing special. I had the Red Dragon and my boyfriend had the Big Texan. My patty was cooked to order, but the overly salty brisket hash threw off the taste of the entire burger. I ordered truffle fries, but all I could taste was the salt. I was literally dusting the salt off of my fries. On the flip side, the onion rings on the Red Dragon were amazing and not at all salty and you could taste the freshness of the oil used to deep fry the batch. Yum. The creole fries were delicious too. I'm conflicted, maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, very possible. Also, the house ketchup was great, I could actually tell it originated from a tomato. Service - Our waiter wasn't memorable, not very helpful when we asked for suggestions, and overall just didn't talk much. Maybe if he spoke up and told me to avoid the brisket hash, I would've had a better experience! =p I'd recommend this place if you're in the area but wouldn't take the trip to the city just to try the burgers. The drinks on the other hand were awesome. Next time, I can't wait to try their extensive beer selection!
