Cool menu for sure!! Everything we tasted was good. And al very unique. Great for the Chi-town Foodies.  It is super tiny...which was a shock. So get there early if you want to get a table. We sat at the bar, which was good. It was a full restaurant and it was a Tues at 6 PM. The bar surrounds the also very tiny kitchen. For all this tasty unique food it is amazing that they can cook it in this very small open kitchen....and all electric...no gas stoves (interesting). Pick a wine from their large selection, share some small plates of food, and talk to your neighbors. Enjoy! P.S. The wait staff could use a little more training on when to notice empty glasses...we wanted to continue to order drinks and food, but they were really slow!
