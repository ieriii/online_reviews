How can ANYONE like this place? It's SO pretentious there, and their food isn't even good! Not to mention it's also very dark. Maybe they turned down the lights so no one could see how much of a terrible job the chef was doing! I couldn't believe how overpriced everything was, considering how the sushi tasted bad and how our waitress treated us like we were the plague. Ugh. I have a bad taste in my mouth just thinking of them.
