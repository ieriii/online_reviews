Pretentious, shitty service and a high maintenance and lazy wait staff eradicate an otherwise creative and tasty menu. Our waitress screwed up our order by not entering half of it into the system. We waited 50 minutes for the food because when she re-entered the order she placed it at the bottom of the queue instead of at the top. To make matters worse she didn't apologize and instead was irritated at us for being irritated. Ridiculous.
