This is a great place to come for a happy hour on Friday after work, say, 3ish! I had remarked to my friend, "There shouldn't be much of a crowd at 3 on Friday", but I was wrong! This place was bustling, with the outdoor patio open (it was chilly, but they have multiple outdoor heaters). We sat outside and had drinks and shared some small plates. My favorite thing, hands down, was the spring peas with red onions and feta. Also very tasty, and meaty, was the pork neck bone with ricotta. Don't be turned off by the whole pork neck bone thing....it is sorta served in this croque with fresh sliced bread to spread. If you are into olives, order the fried ones here. Reminiscent of fried pickles, the fatty/rich/bitter taste is delicious. We also tried the milk braised pork shoulder. It was good, not my favorite, but was very tender and served with mashed potatoes. The only thing I didn't like here was the hostess. When we came into the restaurant to be seated, she acted like it was quite a chore to help us.  There are a lot of things on the menu, I will be back to try some other items.
