Like so many places, it's gone downhill after a mangement/ownership change. Used to be 5-star all the way. Really the best. Perfect pad thai. Last I was there, after the change, the portions were smaller (although still reasonable down from cartoonishly large) and the quality just wasn't up to par. Still good, but just knowing what it used to be makes it a little more disappointing. I guess I'd head back and give it another shot. Maybe it was just a fluke, but from all the other recent reviews, it doesn't sound like it.
