A communist-themed yuppie restaurant in Logan Square. Give the people what they want! Giant fists! Went on a Friday night, long, long wait & they don't take reservations. Super crowded. It seemed more of a traveling crowd, not as much of a Logan Square hangout. But maybe Logan Square's population is really changing? Anyhow, people were parking outside though I had walked. Great in-house beer selection! Tried the Bottom Up Wit- nice. The Gomorrah stout is REALLY good. Coup d'Etat arriving in a tulip is also a treat. Their beers will get you drunk, but taste so good you want more, more, more! I did get the feeling our waiter was trying to rush us out though we wanted to linger & hang out, drinking their good beers and all. However, he kindly did not charge us for a meal that we sent back. So service is alright, though not exceptional. I would HIGHLY recommend their Sweet Potato Cakes for an appetizer. SO SO SO GOOD & YUMMY! Yes, I had to put that in all caps. I could eat those, all day. I also recommend their pizzas! had the mushroom, with the truffle oil & goat cheese..... deliciously amazing! The margarita was also very tasty, smothered in a thick tomato sauce. Did *not* enjoy the special, Arctic Char w/summer ratatouille. The veggies were not bad, but honestly I can make myself better. (I'm very good at cooking vegetables in a healthy manner.) The fish though? Not tasty!! :( Extremely fishy w/little to no seasoning or actual FLAVOR. I like fishy fish when paired with FLAVORS. This lacked the goodness, sad to say. sent it back for fish & chips which were decent, good, nothing tooo special but their fries are great. Dessert of chocolate bread pudding was a treat! :) The main reason tog o here is that: it is reasonably priced (actually quite lower than you'd expect), it serves delicious pizza, it has a fantastic assortment of unique brews, and it is communist themed. Also, it's fun to go out at night to a place nearby that's hoppin', y'know what I'm sayin'?
