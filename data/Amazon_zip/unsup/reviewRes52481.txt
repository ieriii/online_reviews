In typical Brazillian Steakhouse fashion, they give you a chip. Orange side = "BRING MEAT!", Black side = "I'M BUSY EATING". Then there's the salad bar area which happens to have one of the best mushroom risoto's in town. This restaraunt loses one star for thinking I'm a sucker. Our waiter brought my date and I shots of Liquor 43. It retails for about $20 a bottle but the shots we had were $8 a piece.
