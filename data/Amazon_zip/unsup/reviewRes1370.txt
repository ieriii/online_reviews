A totally awesome and unique purveyor of sausage. The complete name of this place is Hot Doug's Sausage and Encased Meat Emporium. The reputation of this place preceded itself even before a visit by Anthony Bourdain, but now, after that, the place is even more popular. If that's possible. We visited on a blisteringly sunny and cold March saturday, about 12.30pm. We waited in line, with everyone else, until about 2.15. Very few people left, and those that came understood that to experience the greatness, the wait was part of the experience. Now sure, everything tastes better when you have to wait for it. But honestly, this place would taste awesome without the wait. Doug's is truly a shrine to the encasement of meat. The three of us ordered about 10 sausages with several types of meat: beef, chicken, bison, lamb, and pork by my count. We also had the duck fat french fries. So that's 6 types of animal product in one meal. I dare you to find that in a meal anywhere else. Seriously, it's something that may not be accomplished again in my life.. All of the sausages, particularly the more exotic types, were excellent. I had a rib-eye steak sausage with horshradish that really did blow me away. The duck fat french fries, not so much. For all it's greatness though, Doug's can't get 5 stars from me. The reason is simple. Amidst all the extravagance, I got the basic hot italian sausage to try something "classic". In Chicago, you expect this to be top-notch, and it simply disappointed. The hot italian was not all that hot, the consistency inside was too fine, it lacked fennel seed (which is a debated ingredient, but I personally think it's necessary). Also, the mustards on-hand weren't particularly noticeable. Ultimately, this place is a trip. It's really, really, really, great. Do order the craziest encased meat you can find. It's sooo worth it. But if you're the Ultimate Encased Meat Emporium, you better have the most top-notch hot italian sausage I've ever eaten.
