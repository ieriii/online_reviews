Came here for a late lunch with the BF and little sis and the place was pretty empty on a Sunday afternoon (the bar on the other side was packed with people watching a cubs game and a sox game). However, this meant that our entrees came out really quick! We ordered the lunch special which was a pasta (chicken farfelle with plum tomatoes, peas with marinara sauce) plus either their soup of the day (spinach artichoke) or salad. We had the soup and it was pretty good but we used it more like a dip with the bread we got with the soup and our pasta entrees. The lunch special pasta was ok - actually there was nothing special about it. We also ordered the angel hair pasta with clams, which I thought was pretty good. The flavor was very light which I was craving for today but typically I like things with a stronger flavor so I might not like it the next time i come. We also tried the mac and cheese which was also pretty good - it came with broccoli mixed in and toasted bread crumbs on top. Overall I think the pasta is pretty good here but nothing too special. The portions are good and the prices are reasonable. They also have salads and sandwiches here so don't think its just pasta. The menu isn't too extensive though and I wish there was a create your own pasta option.... I'll be going back to pasta bowl randomly since theres not too many decently priced pasta places around the city but its not a place I would have a mad craving for.
