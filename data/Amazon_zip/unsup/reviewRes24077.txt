My fianc and I usually sit at the bar and eat. We have always enjoyed the kind and attentive staff working behind the bar, Pete in particular. Food and ambience are all very enjoyable. Best Greek town resturant. Also this place is open every day of the year till 12am. And plenty of room. I ve been here many time and every time I see a new room. Go and have fun in Greek town. And take advantage of the free parking love it!
