We had a nice dinner here a few weeks ago. We went on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too busy, and were able to sit right away. There were a lot of selections on the menu but my favorite was the cornbread, quite delicious!  I didn't get to see the whole space but the front area was fine. the only issue we had is that they did bring courses out really quickly so we felt rushed and didn't have room on our table, but the waitrss apologized and she was really attentive and friendly.
