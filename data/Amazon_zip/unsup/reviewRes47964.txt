I was extremely excited to step into the modern, sinful space know as Zed451 last Friday night for a birthday dinner for my friend, but I was overly disappointed. I give Zed451 1 star because they have one of the best salad/cheese bars I have ever experienced. I would not recommend this restaurant for big groups. We had a group of 16 and received the last cuts of meat from the grill. We sat for 2 hours and the chefs would come to our table with only half a slap of meat and petition they had to go back to the grill to obtain more and never returned. We waited for wine once we first arrived for over 20 minutes. Finally, my friends and I stopped the waitress, once most of the table was done eating and asked what cuts were served tonight and once she read the list we figured out we missed 6 different types! Since most of our table was done eating for the night they missed out. I scarfed everything done for my love of meat but found many of the cuts to be coated in salt and cold once they arrived at my table. I am sure this is a great place I just wouldn't recommend it for big groups.
