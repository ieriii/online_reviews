Pizza and beer what more could you want. I would go here for either the pizza or the beer alone but the combo is amazing. They have mashed potatoes as a pizza topping which is bold and right on.  The reason I'm only giving it 4 stars is that they only fill their own growlers. I lugged in two growlers to get some beer to go and was denied because they weren't from Piece. How annoying. They also don't keep their beer lists current, including their own brews. I always seem to be denied on my first choice but what I do end up with is always good.
