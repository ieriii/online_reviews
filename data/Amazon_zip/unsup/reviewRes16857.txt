Definitely worthy of 5 stars. Went on a Friday night ~9:30 pm. There was a line but it moved relatively quickly. We were seated in about 30 minutes. Service was terrific. The gentleman in the front seating people and keeping things organized was extremely polite. Once inside, the service was just as great. Atmosphere is romantic though there were both couples and groups of friends there. Drink menu is unique. We just got drinks and while it did seem to be taking quite long to get our order, when it came out the waitress told us she had removed them from our bill due to the long wait. Service you don't see much these days! I will definitely be back.
