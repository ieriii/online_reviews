I discovered Art of Pizza about a year ago and I think it might be my favorite pizza place... ever. And that says a lot because I was born and raised in Chicago so I've been eating Chicago pizza for 25 years. I try to get something different everytime I go, but I'd have to say their deep dish might be my favorite. D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
