Excellent location: Convenient to Miracle Mile, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, Garrett's Popcorn, shopping, and the train. I mean, most everything is literally right around the corner. Gorgeous lobby - the layout of the hotel amenities were a little disheveled though. Also, in addition to no free wifi in the rooms, apparently there is a also fee required to use the business center as well - the rude employee at the door made us very aware of that. All of the other employees were amazing... except that chick. Nice rooms and ridiculously comfy beds - so much so that I overslept for an outing with a friend of mine, geesh! I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.
