I finally ate dinner at Big Jones after seeing them on 190 North. I've been meaning to eat here a long time. It was a late birthday dinner with two of my friends. We had the southern table dinner, which was supposed to be three courses for 25 dollars but it was more like four courses with cornbread and other interesting things to eat. I had the scallops, and my friends both had pasta, and everything was great, and a really good bargain.Next we're going to try their brunch. If it's as good as their dinner, it will be a welcome find.
