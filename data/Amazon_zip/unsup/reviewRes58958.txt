It is not often we make the journey to Chicago from NW Indiana. But we did tonight to wrap up some errands in Chi-Town. We found SUNDA on the way back from another famous restaurant (with a 3 - 4 hour wait) and decided to try it. It delivered big time. Creative and delicious sushi rolls, salads and some interesting fusion dishes gave us reason to plan a repeat visit. The quality and freshness coupled with reasonably pricing and expert service makes me think the 65 min drive is well worth it.We did try lots and were pleasantly surprised. Bring ear-plugs - it was on the LOUD SIDE.
