This is my favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago. I love the way the crust on the edges is burnt and crispy. The crust really is great. The ingredients are put on in hearty portions, and the sausage is awesome. It also has a really great environment, with hockey games on all the time. They also have a good beer selection, a key ingredient of a solid deep dish pizza place. Do check it out!
