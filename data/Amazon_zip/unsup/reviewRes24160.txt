My husband first took me to Greek Island when we were dating and we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary...we've been regulars for a very long time. The food is consistently good, service is attentive, and it's kid-friendly but can also be appropriate for business dinners or date nights. If you are in a hurry, your waiter can get you in and out in lightning speed, but if you want to linger, let the waiter know and you can take your sweet time. Favorite dishes include saganaki, fried zucchini, taramosolata, Chicken Kampama, Lamb Rosa Marina, snapper, sea bass, and gyros. Wash it all down with some Greek wine and you will be happy. You will never leave hungry and prices - and parking - are a value.
