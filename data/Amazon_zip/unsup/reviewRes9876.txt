Went there for my first time eating dinner and absoletly loved it! I went on a blind date and let my date pick the appitizers which is a big deal since I'm a picky eater. Anyway, he picked some shrimp rolls and they were excellent. (first time having shrimp) I ordered some filet w/rice dish with vegatables and it was very good. We also finished a great bottle of Pinot Grigio which was recommended by the waitress.  We ate outside upstairs, which is a bit small, but it was romantic w/the candles on the table...After dinner we went and sat by the upstairs bar and had a drink. Some drunk guy sitting at the bar touched me inappropriately and the bartenders saw it and comped our drinks because they felt so bad. The management even apologized and escorted the guy out. It really wasn't a big deal, but they were the nicest people ever! I would definately recommend it and I'd go back again! Great date place!!
