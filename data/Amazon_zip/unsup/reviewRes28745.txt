I'm from Oregon, where we travel around on covered wagons carrying provisions (like the old Oregon Trail game you played on your Apple II), where it rains 363 and 2/3 days of the year, and where "Mexican food" equals $5 wet burritos, taco stands, fish bowl margaritas, and other mostly fairly inexpensive fare. Not Frontera Grill. This place is good, serving up rich, complex moles, fresh ceviches and fire roasted meats. If you come to Chicago and have to eat at one restaurant, this would be it. Granted, the wait for a table is stupid ridiculous. Our party of 4 waited 2+ hrs for a table. On a Tuesday night. Tuesday night! Don't you people have better things to do on a Tuesday then to wait in line for fantastic Mexican food? Shouldn't you be at home watching Grey's Anatomy? Thankfully, an Irish pub was nearby. Must try - all of the ceviches are great. Get the trio sampler so you can try them all. The camarones en aguachile are really fresh king prawns served sashimi style with a lime juice and fennel sauce drizzled on top. Also, any menu item that includes "mole" in the description is probably a must try. And no, you don't need to take the handful of pints I had into consideration. More sober individuals in our group thought the food was delicious also. And the best part? Rick Bayless was there, having a cocktail and a bite to eat, hanging out, checking in on the patrons. Who does that? This guy was on Top Chef Masters dusting Michael Chiarello and Hubert Keller on national TV. Do you ever see Wolfgang Puck hanging out at the Wolfgang Puck Express in Terminal 3 outside Gate B gnoshing on his salads and handing out individual sized pizzas? Hell no.
