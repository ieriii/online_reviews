I completely forgot about this place until we were driving down Pulaski the other day on the way out of town for the holidays. I used to order from this place at least 3 times a week when I lived in the neighborhood. I'll admit, I've never had their pizza, but their pastas are delicious. I always got the cheese ravioli with marinara sauce. Quick delivery, extremely reasonable prices, good sized portions, and tasty as hell. Who could ask for more? I ate in once, the service was excellent. Friendly atmosphere, regulars sitting at the bar willing to have a conversation with you, the waitress acted like she'd known us for years. You get a salad with almost everything you order basically for free, which to me is a serious bonus. Everything I've ordered has been fantastic. I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to have it again soon! I've missed you La Villa!
