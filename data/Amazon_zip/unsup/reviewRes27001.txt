I dream about the chicken tortilla soup and the mole from Frontera Grill. This place was worth the money and the trip to Chicago. Bayless puts together a terrific menu and I wish I could have tried it all. The soup- that was so rich, flavorful, bold, filling. I have never had a better soup. The mole was a little spicy, but with a side of sour cream, it was just fine. The mole was so full and flavorful- I've never had it better. We also had ceviche, which was okay, but not my favorite thing. I can't wait to go back and try even more.
