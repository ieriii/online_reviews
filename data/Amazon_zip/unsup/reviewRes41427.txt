I've been to Tank a lot. Every now and then I figure I should try a different Vietnamese restaurant, but immediately afterward I wish I had gone to Tank. It's not because Tank does every dish better than everyone else. It's because when I go to another Vietnamese restaurant, they're always missing some dish that I want to order, and Tank's menu has everything imaginable. Their spring rolls are always fresh and their pho is one of the best examples in town. If you're feeling brave order the pho with raw beef and cook the beef in the soup, I love eating it this way since the meat comes out particularly tender. Perhaps my favorite dish at Tank is the Banh Xeo which is a coconut crepe stuffed with sprouts and shrimp. Truly, though, where Tank sticks out most is the incredible variety of dishes available. The menu reads like a dictionary of Vietnamese dishes (including bull's penis, haven't tried it yet, but I will).
