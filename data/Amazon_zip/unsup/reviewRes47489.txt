Started going here a little over a year ago, a month or two after they opened. Can't get enough. The burgers here have all been delicious and perfectly cooked. Mac & Cheese is awesome!! A quality beer list. Service would be the only thing I can make a comment on. When first coming here, it could be spotty, but as of late, it's been on point. Perhaps cuz I'm a regular here and they know my face?? Either way, the staff have been great to me, and I have no complaints. PJ, who I believe is a part owner, is an awesome guy, loves greeting people and asking for feedback. Sol is another great guy who I see time to time. Favorite 3 burgers (because I can't decide just one) Warden Burger (stuffed with Merkt's Cheddar, topped with shallots, garlic & leeks), Electric Chair (Buffalo sauce, melted bleu cheese, Jalapeno relish) and Fat Elvis (Peanut Butter, Bacon, and Bananas). Drink & food specials everday of the week. Late hours. Plenty of Metal/Rock music. Games are on the tv. I love this place.
