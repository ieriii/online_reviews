I've only been to Big Jones for brunch, but if brunch is any indication of how good the other food is, then expect my review to remain at five stars.  I pretty regularly go here for Sunday brunches with friends (though I have to go more often now that I think about it), and I've never been disappointed. The ambiance is nice, the food is amazing, and the waiters are very nice. Also, I've had many late mornings where our group had to change the reservation multiple times, and we've never had any problem doing so - a very big plus for a busy Sunday morning destination. If you've never tried the Eggs New Orleans before, I suggest you treat yourself. I never thought crab cake and eggs would go together, but I was very wrong. Now I find myself craving this every time I even consider going out for brunch.  A few small gripes: 1) the beignets are a great touch, and a good start to brunch, but why bring out three when there are four people at the table?; 2) I've been there many times when waiters brought out our food and then more or less forgot about us, and we ended up with empty coffee cups for much of the meal. I understand this is no coffeehouse, but it would be nice to have something to wash things down with. Unfortunately those two small issues can do a lot to hurt a good time - try getting excited for the beignets when one of your friends can't have one - which is why I left the review at four stars. A few small improvements, and Big Jones would be a certain five-star.
