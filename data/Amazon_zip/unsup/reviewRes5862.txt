Ok, so yes, I get it they are corporate. Wildfire gets 4 stars because they do what they do and well. We order carry out from here often as it is kiddie corner from where we live. The salads are big and yummy (a small is more than enough for two), the chicken sausage pizza is great and on Monday's their fried chicken special is one of the man of the house favorites( I can vouch for him it's good, I've tried it, my thighs just don't appreciate it as much as my mouth). BUT what sets them apart from other chain restaurant or any other restaurant for that matter And earns them 4 stars, is their customer service. We have NEVER had a wrong pick up order and that is saying something. We order a lot of carry out/delivery and 9 times out of 10 something is wrong or missing. Wildfire marks everything in the bag and will go through the items right there with you before you leave. Prevention is key, good job guys. You know what you are getting with these guys good food (not amazing, but good) and AMAZING customer service.
