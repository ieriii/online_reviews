Our friends who just moved to Ravenswood led us to this restaurant and we really enjoyed it! First - the burrata appetizer was DELICIOUS and shockingly huge (that amount of burrata at Whole Foods costs $10+ - I know this for a fact because I look at it longingly every time I am there and splurge every so often). Really high quality, nicely presented and perfect for a table of four to share as an appetizer. The pizzas were good too - since they are smaller, everyone can order their own which is a nice treat (get exactly the toppings you want). The chocolate gelato we had for dessert had tiny bits of chocolate in it - really yummy. This isn't high-end cuisine so I can't give it 5 stars, but it's much better than your standard Italian place around the corner -- really terrific food, reasonable price, nice space (the tables are crowded together, they have outdoor seating) and easy street parking. I want to return!
