Our group came away with mixed reviews about the place, however those that didn't like the place as much are thin crust fans. I personally loved the pizza. I had it on Saturday and I kept thinking about sunday night and even today monday. We ordered a Large Pan Pizza with Sausage, Canadian Bacon and Tomatoes. The ingredients where top notch. Everyone agreed on that. The crust is thick, however the bread isn't very dense. I thought it was great, other thought it was too much bread... but they are thin crust fans. Most enjoyed the burnt crust and cheese.
