Dropped in Fox & Obel really quick to grab a simple bottle of H2O... & I stepped into a wonderland of specialty items galore! I found a small, single bottle of Perrier in a cooler & was beyond pleased. So nice to find something so "convenient" as Fox & Obel, but with far better offerings than the drugstore across the street. Fox & Obel, you know how to make things quick, tasty & classy!
