When you think of Diner, one thinks middle of the road... The name fools one. There are cereal boxes on the shelves and a funk to the decor to fit with diner but the food is 5 star.. I love seafood and they specialize it it. Between certain hrs they have a seafood dinner for around 12 dollars, cannot beat that..Have been there twice, plan on going whenever I can.Debra
