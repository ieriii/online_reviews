In these economic times, a place like this is a godsend. My wife and I dined here recently and ate like Romans for not a lot of money at all. In fact we ordered too much not knowing how big the portions were and had leftovers for a few days. The lamb schwarma is awesome, but even if you 're a vegetarian there is much to choose from like falafel, a very tasty hummus and a $2 spinach pie that ain't bad! I was not a huge fan of baklava until I tried theirs. Screw Mcdonalds, this is the real value meal for under $5 and it's healthy!
