Midway through my meal I leaned over to my husband and whispered I think this is Buitoni. He countered by mentioning his gnocchi tasted processed. I make my own pasta - freeze it from time to time too. This is not handmade pasta.It's one thing to serve pasta that has been previously frozen. It's quite another thing to serve food service grade frozen pasta at a jacked up price of $20/serving. The complimentary bread was also low quality. But it is free so I'm willing to overlook. I won't overlook the main dish though. I also sort of question the cool-jazz soundtrack playing in the background. I suppose some people consider Kenny G romantic. I am not one of those people.The two stars is for the service - I have no complaints about the service.
