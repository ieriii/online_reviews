One of the better restaurants I've visited. Went with a group, so we were able to order the majority of the small plates they offer. Everything was cooked perfectly and was absolutely scrumptious. The veal sweatbread with jonah crab fondue was particularly delightful; the salty crispy sweatbread paired perfectly with the creamy sweetness of the crab. Drinks were equally as impressive. I highly recommend the Longman Manhatten.
