Simply breath-taking scenery, and the food was really great. I ordered the baby back ribs with a side of chicken, and that alone was way too much for me to finish. There's definitely enough and if you have room for dessert, the options are amazing. The martini samplers were exceptional, and would recommend to anyone with a party of friends. This restaurant and its service was great, and I'm definitely looking forward to going there again.
