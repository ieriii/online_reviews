Took my girlfriend here for dinner while we were in Chicago for her birthday. Portions are 'small' compared to other restaurants as it is tapas style, but each dish was simply orgasmic. Naturally, based on the name, the restaurant centers on swine, but their seafood dishes are equally high caliber. Perfectly seared salmon on a bed of blueberries, a flavorful squid ceviche-style, nothing disappointed. Service was great, with our very knowledgeable waitress who was able to give us several recommendations for my indecisive girlfriend =) While the place is no Montreal Au Pied de Cochon (drool), and the focus again, is on smaller tapas dishes, Purple Pig stands a worthy second on my list of swine eateries. Or swineries. :)
