Chicago Diner and I got off to a rough start. Mr. Man and I arrived on a crisp Friday night in February. We head in and give our name to the server/host who tells us there will be a short wait. No biggie. However, he then turns back around and asks, "Do you mind waiting in the vestibule?".  Do I mind? Yes, actually. It's freakin' freezing in there! Plus, one has to be on guard so as not to be nailed by either the door to the outside or the door to the restaurant itself as people enter and exit. Slowly, more people arrive and we all have to cram into this phonebooth-sized space. This involves a fair deal of awkward shuffling and much gnashing of teeth. Seriously, C.D., if I hadn't heard such great things about your food, I'd be off like a Prom dress. You aren't the only show in town on this stretch of Halsted! After a brief stint in this torturous dining antechamber, we are seated. Happily, it was all roses from that point on. The menu featured a lot of meat-in-quotes. You know, "chicken", etc. I don't eat "meat". Luckily, there is absolutely no need to as the food-without-punctuation is varied and tasty-sounding.  I went with the Sweet Potato Quesadillas and Mr. Man had some kind of enchilada (or fajita? Clearly I was more focused on my own meal). I as curious to see how Sweet Potatoes would work as quesadilla-filling, and they are deliciously divine: hot and smooth, but not too gooey. I ate every last bite. Both of our meals were surprisingly filling. I had my eye on a peanut butter shake before we even ordered our entrees, but when the time came, I had to pass (and I'm not usually one to pass on dessert, mind you). We washed our veggie-meals down with local micro-brews. Props for the beer-list, C.D.!
