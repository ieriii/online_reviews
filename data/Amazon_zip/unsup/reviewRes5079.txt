First time visit for a late lunch on NYE, surprisingly it was still busy so we sat at the bar...got lucky and sat right in front of the chefs cooking and expediting orders. Loved everything we ate, each dish was better than the last. One of the head chefs, Jaime, was nice enough to provide recommendations and walk us thru the dishes. Especially liked the pork shoulder, pigs ear, neck bone gravy, and fried Brussels sprouts. Loved the whole experience and will definitely be back.
