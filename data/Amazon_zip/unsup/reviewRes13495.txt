The beer and food were pretty good. We arrived before 6 on a Thursday night - most of the tables were empty and it was rather quiet. The hostess [rudely] told us that we could not be seated until our whole party was there nor would they put our name on the waitlist until the whole party was there. For a party of 4, that's pretty ridiculous. We also found out one of our group called ahead and they don't answer the phone and their voicemail is also quite rude ("we won't call you back"). By the time we were seated, the music was too loud to have a conversation. If it was close to me, I'd probably go back despite the attitude of some folks there (to be fair, the bar tender and our waitress were nice). Given it's pretty far from where I live, I doubt I'll ever go back.
