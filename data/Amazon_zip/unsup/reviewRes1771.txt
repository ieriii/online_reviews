The owner of Hot Doug's, Doug Sohn, has not let his success go to his head. He remains a kind and humble man. He is front and center in his business, always manning the cash register with a smile, ease and grace. His employees are super sweet too. The hot dogs, even the cheap ones, are delicious. I always get two Keira Knightley's for $2.50 a pop...mmmighty hot. Thanks Doug!
