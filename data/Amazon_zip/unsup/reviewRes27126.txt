Both the husband and I ate here years ago and agreed that at the time, the food and the overall experience were highly over-rated. But...we decided to give it a shot anyway on a trip back to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised! Maybe it was the extremely low expectations, but although the service was pretty slow (we had early reservations and the place was not full when we sat down), the food was memorable and absolutely delicious! We started off by sharing the guacamole with chips - simply done and so good! I had the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena - perfectly seasoned and they got my medium rare request exactly right. Husband had the Pescado a la Campechana (it was snapper that day), which was near the top of the list of the best fish dishes I've tasted. A bit of tragedy: since we were staying at a nearby hotel w/ full kitchen, I happily boxed up my left-overs with dreams of a nice snack the next day. Unfortunately, I forgot to put it in the refrigerator and ended up having to toss everything the next morning. I'm still trying to forgive myself. In any case, this place is definitely worth a visit.
