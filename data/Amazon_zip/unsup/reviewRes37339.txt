This is the best grocery store in the city. If i lived a block away I would go here all of the time. It has lots of gourmet items you really can't get anywhere else. They have a great cheese shop, and I love the little candy station. It is also a great place to get gourmet gift baskets....i got one for my dad an he loved it.  However, I really don't like eating at the cafe very much....it gets crowded and hectic on the weekends, and the service can be annoying. However, the food is good. I used to always get the oatmeal with bananas and and syrup for breakfast. Also, I love the truffle french fries and the lobster club.
