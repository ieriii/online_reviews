Is it possible for an inanimate object to be pretentious ? Because that is what the food is here. The staff are actually very nice and accomodating, and the bar list is fantastic. Any place that has an european cider is great to me. The food though, wow, its bad. Like really bad. Did it make me sick? No. Bad as in you're paying 18 dollars for a couple scallops piled on one piece of ravioli. As in the chicken is brought out in pot where it was cooked, soaking in its own juices, with no added spices at all. The chicken tastes like chicken. And the salad. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing to me, so I figured I get the cheapest thing, which was a 8 dollar organic salad. It was literally a plate of lettuce, which the tiniest pinch of vingarette. It was terrible. Why would you say its a salad if it only has lettuce? That just lettuce. Humor me with a onion or something, but nope just lettuce, and not even romaine, it was like garden fresh you get at Jewel. The dessert was disappointing. It wasn't bad, but the whole thing behind gastro pub is that they take simple everyday recipes and put a twist on it that in practice is suppose to be different and TASTY. Everything ono the menu required a double take, in this case I thought it was pecan pie I was ordering, but alas, it was pecan steamed cake with a yogurt topping served in a mason jar. Pecan STEAMED cake with a yogurt topping served in a mason jar. To be honest, it was funny. So if you want to laugh at food, but get a good drink while doing it, be my guest, I rather play less for the entertainment though.
