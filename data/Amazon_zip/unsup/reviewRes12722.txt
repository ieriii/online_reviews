Since moving away from Chicago this is one of the restaurants I miss most. I have yet to find a place in New York to satisfy the cravings I get for Cafe 28. Be sure to start with the Quesadillas, these aren't your average Quesadillas, they are like nothing you've ever had. And OMG, the Almond Crusted Halibut is one of the best fish dishes I've had in my life. I also really love the Pistachio Crusted Chicken.  Oh and I'm getting flashbacks of the butter as we speak... it's hard to describe... but this butter is like crack. I've thought about breaking in and stealing the recipe, it's THAT good!
