Short Review... I went for dinner. It's pretty overpriced for what you get. I didn't perceive value in the preparation. I wasn't wowed by any of the food; maybe I ordered "the wrong things." Long Review... I really enjoyed the cup of New England clam chowder which set expectations for the rest of the meal.  My entre was the cioppino. If you've had cioppino in California and liked it; that is not what you will get here. It was essentially a clear citrusy broth with chunks of fish and shrimp; not a seafood stew. The typical tomatoes, bivalves, and starch component were missing. I know everything is open to interpretation, but this didn't seem like it took much to put together. (I think it's hard to find authentic cioppino/bouillabaisse outside the regions they were created; I should have known better). My dining partner had the fried yellow perch served with a potato and asparagus. The fish were tiny and there were few of them (not too surprising). You can get an identical dish elsewhere; probably for less. We both had desert. Both were something you could easily do at home. The food was okay; it was just expensive for what it was. (The garlic bread served with the meal was obviously made from air/wonder bread). If I went back I would probably try a more straightforward fish dish, but to reiterate others, they were out of a lot of stuff. I probably won't be back though. It's just that I know other restaurants where I can spend $50 and feel like I got more value.
