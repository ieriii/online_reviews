A long time favorite of mine, Mia Francesca is my go-to restaurant for any occasion. Most recently, I needed a place to eat where I could carbo-load the night before my half-marathon. I typically don't eat much pasta, but when I do, I go for the best. Mia is consistently the best: service, food, and fun!
