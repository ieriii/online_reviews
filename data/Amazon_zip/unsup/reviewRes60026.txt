I had the most unbelievable dinner here Saturday Night. Crab cakes, amazing. Fried mashed potatoes, ethereal. It's a really good place to take a date, with modern southern decor but kind of a sexy feel to it. I usually expect southern food to be very heavy but this was perfect before a night out with my girl. It's definitely a different take on southern food, not very traditional but instead kind of a new american version. Spot on! Can't wait to try brunch!
