Deep dish was pretty good. I believe we had he Gino classic. It was pepperoni, mushroom and onions. We requested for no peppers. Loved the marinara sauce on the pizza. We went pretty late at night and realized they were about to close but they did not rush us which i loved. Also had the Tuscan salad, portion was huge but the salad was ok, ive had better, overall experience was enjoyable and would go back.
