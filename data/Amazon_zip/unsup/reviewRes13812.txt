Been here for lunch (reuben sandwich with potato pancakes) and for dinner (whitefish).  The food is fresh and delicious !  It was fun to see what the people around us ordered.  All of it looked wonderful. I recently walked there for dinner and they would not allow me to sit inside because I was by myself and the bar seats were full...when I asked if I could sit outside...they refused and said that it might rain.... starting to wonder if I should change my deoderant...
