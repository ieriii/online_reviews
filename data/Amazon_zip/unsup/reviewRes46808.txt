This is so sad. Uncommon Ground came highly recommended, and any place that puts this much work into sustainable, eco-friendly food and service should be commended. However, our food took more than 45 minutes (during a slow evening), came out cold, and was flavorless and tough. One party member got fish & chips; the breading on the fish was just the texture (but flavorless), the fish was cooked fine (but flavorless), the tartar sauce was all salt, and it was lukewarm at best. One party member got the $23 pork dish. Our server described the glaze as a mouthwatering reduction of maple syrup and a few other ingredients; the actual meal was tough, small, and almost entirely flavorless. My burger, other than being lukewarm, tasted great. I can imagine they had an off night, so I'm not ready to say "worst restaurant in Chicago." But, especially with the hype and the cost, this was extremely disappointing.
