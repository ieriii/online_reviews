There have been so many Saturday afternoons I've driven here, saw the line wrapping around the building, then audibled to the nearby BK since I was too hungry to wait. (I used to be able to hit nearby Kuma's Corner as a 2nd option but you can forget about that plan now) I've basically given up eating here on Saturdays. But if there's any reason during the week I decided not to go to work that day, Hot Doug's is always on my mind. Sometimes if I need to head to the burbs for work, I will plan my day SPECIFICALLY to hit Hot Doug's around lunch.  Is there still a line at 1:45 PM on a random Tuesday? Yes, but its manageable. Any place that has over an hour wait out the door on weekends and still makes me fight crowds in the middle of the day - AND STILL I am willing to fight them - gets 5 stars.  By the way, a few weeks ago I saw Doug walking around Terminal 3 in O'Hare and wanted to go up to him to let him know how much I love his sausage...but that would've been just plain creepy.
