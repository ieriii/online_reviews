Ok I know you're thinking really who cares it's just a hot dog place right? Well sorry you would be wrong. This place is seriously so much fun to go to and definatly more than your typical hot dog. I work at one of the businesses in the area and even though I only go in maybe every other week Doug still knows me by name and always ends up under charging me despite my protests. The food is awesome, seriously beyond compare to anything I have ever seen with sausages. The combinations he comes up with are as good as any that most 5 star chefs could make. The staff is really friendly and honestly if you go during the day on a weekday if you can the line isnt usually over 5-10 minutes long.
