Although this place is usually crawling with tourists, it is worth making a trip to Michigan Avenue (at least once anyways). The line usually looks worse than the wait actually is. The restaurant is huge and the line usually goes pretty quickly. Everything I've tried here is absolutely delicious. I've never had a bad experience. The waitstaff is helpful and very nice. I would recommend this place for lunch or dinner any day of the week!
