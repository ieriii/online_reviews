Great energy with great food. The pork belly is a must along with their charcuterie. We also had their chicken and whole roasted snapper. These were conceptually great but were slightly flawed. The chicken was unfortunately dry but had great flavor. The whole snapper was great except that it was butchered table side and ended up being blobs of flesh with bones enbedded throughout.
