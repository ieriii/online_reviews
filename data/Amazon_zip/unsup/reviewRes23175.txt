Opa! Nothing like starting off dinner with appetizers of cheese on fire.  Tasty and Salty live at this restaurant. Meet tasty. Meet salty. They live in each dish. Flaming Cheese - salty by itself, tasty on bread. (Make sure they give you a bread plate- messy crust!) Spinach and feta pie - tasty favorite!!!  Meatballs- salty and a ok, but nothing spectacular.  Mousaka - love me that eggplant - tasty, but rich!  Greek salad - meh - iceberg lettuce is no good, they should change it to romaine. Satly. Dressing was tasty. Water - keep it coming (and they did) to soak up the salt! Service was great and attentive: we had a party of 11 and they got everything right the first time and our glasses were always full :) Overall enjoyed it, but we had our sodium intake for the year! Long wait on a Saturday night. We actually parked at a metered spot a block away for $5 - which worked out better than the free valet because the line was HUGE to wait for your car when we left :)
