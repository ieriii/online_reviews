Warm and welcoming environment, tight space. Decent food with some clear hits and misses: the pumpkin and squash ravioli was great - burned sage butter sauce or something or another on it was fantastic. lobster ravioli - eh, pinkish, not very flavorful panna cotta - HOLD UP!! Damn! So good and creamy and chocolate - one of those way more fat than sugar desserts, just the way I like it. mushroom risotto - kinda odd - ridiculously huge portion, but I thought it was only mediocre with pieces of kind of crunchy/undercooked rice, even though my sister was loving it so that vote was split. the milk and honey ribs were extremely moist and tender Service was for the most part invisible in a good way, like non-obtrusive, but we did have to flag someone down to pay the bill in the end. And I like that they participate in a bartering program with other owners of small businesses/barters/etc. They graciously put our group of 9 in the separate little side room for our small party with no other people in it, which was a saving grace in an otherwise cramped space - especially since we were dining with a squirmy toddler. I would definitely recommend using that space for any small dinner parties/reservations, because it is off the main floor and is available for no extra charge. I especially liked that I received a note card in the mail a few weeks later from the chef/owner thanking me for coming in and included a coupon for a future visit. Probably more like 3.5 stars - not the best, but a pretty sure bet.
