I like the location and I love the atmosphere. The bar is great and they have a really good selection of beers. Street parking on a Sunday late afternoon was easy to come by and while it was busy, it was fun to wait for a table in the bar. I generally prefer thin crust pizza. I enjoyed the crust here a lot, but the tomato sauce just did not thrill me. It tasted like pure tomato paste. I would go back to try the white pizza with clams and I would definitely go in for a beer!
