Awesome food and great atmosphere!!! Happy to be a Purple Pig for the night. If you only try one thing: Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes One would think that The Purple Pig would be a tourist trap given it's location but it truly is a little piece of Europe tucked away down a high-profile alley right off Michigan Ave. The unpretentious vibe, down-to-earth staff, contemporary but yet warm environment was packed with hip, young and creative Chicagoans on a warm Wed night. Everything we ate was full of flavor and the small plates let us try a variety of dishes.  Round 1: To Whet The Appetite... - A Half Bottle of Wine: La Cartuja from the Priorat Region of Spain - Marinated Olives - 3 Cheese Plate: Manchego, Podda, Truffle Tremor - Salt-Roasted Beets w/ Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette Round 2: To Fill The Belly... - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes - Scallop Spiedini w/ Chickpea Aioli Round 3: To Indulge - Sfogliatelle Napoletane Bon Appetite my friends!
