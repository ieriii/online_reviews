The prices are really reasonable and the food is good! They have grape leaves, which I can't find any where else. They have awesome a delicious cucumber sauce that I love to sip while I eat their falafel. Stil....I would be willing to pay an extra buck for my food if they had a waitress. I did not like having to put my garbage in little holes..one for plastic, one for waste, one for paper. That's fine to separate them, but make the damn holes bigger! I also didn't like that they didn't accept credit cards so I had to pay 2 extra dollars to take money out. Seriously, what establishment doesn't accept credit cards now of days. I rather pay those 2 dollars for the WAITRESS. Finally, my rice was really cold. I like my rice to be nice and warm.
