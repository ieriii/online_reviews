The ambiance is kind of weird here. It's got that 1990s, lots of black and and brushed stainless, super dark and cheesy dance music playing thing. Although the service is always friendly and FAST, and the small space makes it seem cozy instead of stark, so I don't really mind it. It just makes me wonder if there are teams of musicians holed up in studios just pumping out these"oontz! oontz! oontz!" beats purely for uses in "hey we're EDGY!" restaurants and clothing stores? Like Muzak guys, only with, like, outdated nipple rings. At any rate, This is some of my favorite sushi in the city. Get the double decker roll--it's like four ENTIRE FISHES in one roll. Ours had hunks coming out as big as a baby's arms! The Lava roll is interesting because with the cooked fish and the melty cream cheese and spiciness, it tastes like a taco.
