Amazing! Not only were the ingredients top quality, the combinations were so creative tasty and whimsically named.  Very original takes on traditional dishes. The pea soup appetizer and the scallop appetizer were phenomenal. (my dining companion and I split all dishes). He ordered the lamb (unbelievably tasty and petfectly cooked. I had the poussin with ramps and gnocchi and mushrooms--very succulent bird with crusty skin and complex flavors. This was not your grandmother's chicken.  We finished with the apple galette and zucchini cake. Both were so originally prepared with unusual accompaniments . The service was excellent and enhanced by a friendly and knowledgeable waiter. This is a Top Chef competitor (Dale's) restaurant and it lives up to the hype. Be warned though, this place is pricey, but worth it.
