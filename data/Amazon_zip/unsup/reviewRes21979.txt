I'd love to never have to go here again, to pay their EXORBITANT prices for very mediocre food. However, my kids really like it, so we wind up going once or twice during the summer when their cousins are in town or after a day at nearby Whealan Pool. I never get out of this place for less than 20 or 30 bucks - sometimes more - and that's with having my kids run to the gas station next door for their drinks, instead of buying their overpriced items. Just recently, I spent about 45 bucks on 4 hot dogs, one cheesedog, and 2 supercheesies - had a couple more kids with me - and I nearly burst out laughing at the price. Other reviewers point out accurately that the kitsch factor is the only reason this place stays in business - they're right. Leave it for the tourists and suburbanites that don't know any better.
