This place is AMAZING! It's so hard to find real authentic Italian food, but Caro Mio really does an amazing job. I love their gnocci that is stuffed with riggota cheese, and a creamy vodka-like sauce, it's amazing. The restaurant is really small, so on busy nights sometimes there is a wait but it's always worth it. It's also BYOB which is fun, and they don't charge you to open bottles which is cool. Overall, this place is awesome, great food, good prices and just a cool atmosphere.
