I just booked my wedding here for the fall of this year in the Wolf Point Ballroom. HOLY COW, best kept secret in Chicago if you are a bride on a budget but still want an urban downtown wedding. Their per head prices are phenomenal and for the location, and all that is included, I am still in disbelief at the deal we got. Our wedding is on a Friday and we received an awesome discount on top of everything else being amazing at this place. check out their wedding packages on their website. The ballroom isn't your typical wedding hotel event space, which we TOTALLY did not want but this place is sweet! it has all glass windows surrounding 1/2 the room which face the west for a pretty sunset and the south looking at 333 wacker and the rest of the beautiful skyline....it's great, you get the benefits of having your reception at a hotel but don't have to have the "ballroom" vibe If you're wedding budget is around $20,000 just to cover your reception costs, check this place out for a 200 person wedding, because you can have an awesome downtown wedding for less than that which is really affordable!! I can't wait to write another review of how awesome this place is once the wedding actually happens.
