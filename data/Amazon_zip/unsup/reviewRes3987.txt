Eating a 9+ (they threw in extras) course meal + small intimate setting of fewer than 30 people + drinking BYOB + tunes from groups such as Pharcyde = Culinary AWESOMENESS! I would describe this place as Alinea's equally talented, but cool rebellious sibling. Same great quality of food with a very laid back atmosphere. If I could suggest any area of improvement it would be on the lighting...it was a wee bit dark for such great food presentations. I can probably thank my being able to score Friday night reservations after being put on a wait list a few days before due to Game 7 of the World Series and my indifference to baseball. Although, I have to say this was a home run for me!
