Who doesn't love a great BYOB Italian spot? If you are looking for one, Cara Mio is it! I went on a Saturday night and the place was hopping. Thankfully I was meeting a friend a little early so we didn't have a problem getting a table.  The food was delicious. You can always judge an Italian restaurant by how good the marinara sauce, since it tends to be the base of so many dishes. As an appetizer, I started with the polenta with marinara sauce and the flavors were wonderful. The marinara tasted like it was from fresh tomatoes. For my entree, I had the gnocci stuffed with asigo cheese and pesto. The portions were huge so I was very, very happy to have leftovers for the following night.  Also, kudos to Cara Mio for having so many homemade pastas on the menu! I'm a sucker for homemade pasta and can usually only find one or two dishes on a menu with homemade pasta.  The only bummer about this place is that they only accept reservations for parties of six or more. Otherwise, you can't go wrong here.
