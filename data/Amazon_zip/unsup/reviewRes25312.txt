Birthday celebration dinner at Geja's! And I wasn't disappointed. I was hoping it would be a five-star experience, and while we had a blast, it wasn't perfection. I'll start with the cons: 1. The best part of your meal will be the first course: the cheese fondue with bread and fruit. We could have eaten this stuff for the whole meal and been satisfied. 2. Cooking your entire entree in hot oil. I knew going into our Geja's experience that we would be doing a little cooking, but I think a lot of the food lacked flavor. I got the beef and shrimp, and it just didn't do anything for me. The shrimps were large and plump, but frying them up in oil just didn't do anything for 'em. Same goes for the beef. 3. Vegetarians are at a loss here. All the entree selections are meat-based, with the exception of one $30 veggie medley option. For $30, I wasn't impressed with the amount of veggies the hubs had to select from. Deep fried veggies just doesn't make for a nice dinner. 4. The chocolate fondue comes with a small amount of goodies. Of all the things they put on the plate, the strawberries, pound cake and apples were the best, and they were far and few between. It was rather skimpy for two people, I thought. Now, onto the pros: 1. The cheese fondue is amazing. Like, to die for. And the bread and fruit were a perfect compliment. 2. The service was awesome. Our water glasses were always filled, but we didn't feel overly-attended to. It was perfect. 3. The ambiance truly is romantic. I had doubts going into it ... I'm not much of a romantic myself. But the lighting and music definitely proved me wrong. 4. The chocolate fondue was so yummy! I just wish we had more stuff to dip into it with. Overall, loved the experience, and I would recommend it to anyone. I would just advice that you maybe even skip the entree, and just do an a la carte menu with cheese and chocolate fondues.
