Came her for restaurant week and I think the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is b/c I happen to go to Primehouse a few days before this. I have to say that I'm more of a fan of Primehouse. Sorry! So I started with the salad, which was great, and then moved on to the filet. Now I should have asked for no butter because I was not prepared for how it came out. Yes there's the sizzling plate (get to that in a moment) but the steak is swimming in an inch of butter! That's just too much for me. And I get the idea that serving the steak on a scorchingly hot plate is a good idea to keep it hot but the problem is that the temp of my steak was almost too hot and it kept cooking! The first bite was perfectly cooked but halfway through, I pretty much had a well done steak. I would have had to scarf that thing down in order to keep it a perfect medium/medium rare. The mashed potatoes that I ordered were fine and my friend ordered the mushrooms. I wasn't as impressed. As expected, they were just normal button mushrooms cooked in butter. Not much flavor there. But the dessert of chocolate mousse was great. It was the perfect size after a big meal. I should say that the service was amazing. They were attentive without being overbearing. My water glass was never empty and a new ice tea was brought out before I was finished with the first one. I had a great experience but will probably not think of Ruth's Chris as my go to steakhouse.
