It's okay. The beer's okay. The pizza's okay. It's a wait for a table usually. The pizza is definitely much better than a chain. It's New Haven, which isn't my favorite to begin with. It just seems like there are too many options; so any one pizza isn't spectacular or anything. If I could complain, in my opinion they have some issues with moisture control. There's a lot of activity in the place. I'd go back to hang out. I wouldn't consider it a destination spot for pizza though.
