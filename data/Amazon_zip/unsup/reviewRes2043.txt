I was here for my second time. Nothing new to report, only that on the day before Christmas I had a B-List celebrity sighting of Patton Oswalt there. He was even nice enough to take pictures with some people. The best part was where Ryan L. and I made Michael G. sit right next to him since he was the last to sit down.
