BIG YES I've been to Irazu 4 times, and it's a great down to earth joint. The casual, lively atmosphere (especially when the outdoor patio seatings are out) goes hand in hand with their dishes. They do have yummy vegetarian burritos, but it's really the dinner plates that have me coming back. Ah, love it. I also have cravings of the oatmeal shake sometimes, but I have only had it once :P The last time I dined there was a busy night and our server was taking a long while, but we put on a straight face and tried to play it cool. Knowing he was late, he broke the ice first and went out of his way to apologize and gave us an extra free order of Lava juice (lime & watermelon). Good service for catching on, despite the fact that we didn't complain. TIP: we mixed the lava juice & horchata 1:1 - REALLY GOOD.
