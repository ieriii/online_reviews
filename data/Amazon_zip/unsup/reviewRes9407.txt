Beautiful colonial decor and great, attentive service were definitely the highlights of this place. I started with the crab & asparagus soup, which came in a clear broth with aromatic herbs--very good, but also surprisingly filling with the larger-than-expected serving. I shared a chicken (#41) and shrimp dish (#27) with a friend--the chicken was spicy and had large chunks of portobello mushrooms; lots of flavor, but nothing terribly unique. The shrimp came in a very nice curry sauce, but I didn't care of the texture of the eggplant that was also prominent in the dish. Prices are definitely higher than anything I've ever paid for Vietnamese before, but more reasonable than a French fine-dining restaurant. It was a lovely experience overall, but based purely on the food, I don't think I'll be rushing back any time soon.
