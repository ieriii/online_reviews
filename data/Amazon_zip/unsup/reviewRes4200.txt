what to say about schwa... what i love about schwa is that its all about the food. the decor its very blah. the infusion of different tastes was great. and the way dishes were made were unique. i really enjoyed the experience. i would have liked a bit more explanation about dishes. i'm a foodie so i like to understand what dishes are made of and how they are prepared. i'm not sure if michael is the most personal individual in the world - i told him i wanted to try the 9 course since we only had time for the 3 course and i tried to get a reservation from him but he told me that they only take reservations over the phone and i let him know the mailbox is always full and he responded with "well i really hope you get the chance to try the 9 course menu' .... hmmm. next stop - alinea.
