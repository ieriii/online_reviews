Mmmm, Revolution. Whenever I go here, I get the Tempeh Reuben with a side salad (I'm a creature of habit). The reuben is always uber tasty and uber filling, and the salad is much nicer than your average side salad (which usually only consists of a few scraps of iceberg lettuce with 2 slices of tomato - bleck). Anywho, yes, if you go at prime dining hours, it might be a little crowded. I've never had much of a problem with this, and the most I've had to wait was maybe 20 minutes once. Also, the beer is tasty and they have a darned good tofu scramble on their brunch menu for hungover Saturday after-mornings.
