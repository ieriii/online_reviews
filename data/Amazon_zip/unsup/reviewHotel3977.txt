The service here? Pretty good. They were pretty helpful, and not considering weird rules for the convention we were at, I'd say they were very nice. The rooms were OK, nothing special, but at the price, they were not up to what I expected. The food was GROSSLY over-priced, even for hotel food. The breakfasts were especially expensive, even the buffett (though the Oatmeal Pancakes were awesome!) The best part was the view, which the worst was dealing with things like poor elevator performance (this can be a problem at large cons) and a layout that was at least a good deal more complicated than I expected. Still, cost and food knocks it down a good deal. And there were spiders outside the windows. Giant. Scary. Spiders...
