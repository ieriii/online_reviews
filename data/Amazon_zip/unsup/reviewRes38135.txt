I basically go here for the mussels, beer, and frites w/ aioli. Can never go wrong with them. Mussels are in an ale broth, and frites come with an amazing aioli. In the front is the bar, and in the back is the restaurant. It's always crowded no matter which day you go, so if you want a table, I suggest coming early or putting your name on the list and grab some drinks. They also serve food in the front bar area. You just have to grab your own table in the front. Great place of craft beers and I really like the chillax atmosphere here. A good place to just grab a brew and hang with your friends. On my last visit, we got the mussels, pork belly, duck confit salad, and mac and cheese. As usual, the mussels were impressive. Although they still came with that stale bread. Did not like the Pork Belly entree - the salsa that came with it was not good at all. Way too acidic. Pork Belly honestly just tasted like they just boiled it. i was excited for the Mac n'cheese after reading the reviews on it, but it's honestly just "meh." I can't even decide if I hate it or not. Tasted creamy and bland. My friend said that it tasted like vomit to her... We all loved the strawberry and duck confit salad.
