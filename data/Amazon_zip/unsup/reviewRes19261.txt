Great place to warm ourselves after a chilly walk around Millenium Park across the street(the Bean) and the Art Institute of Chicago.  My Bloody Mary hit the spot and made the perfect appetizer to our meal. Our "real" appetizer was a Scotch Egg which I've never tried before anywhere else but this was pretty dang yummy. The yolk was also perfectly cooked, not runny but not cooked all the way through...juuuuuust perfect. My friend's smoked salmon sandwich was a tad big salty. She thought it would be hot smoked salmon (cooked) but it turned out to be the cold smoked kind. Combined with the bacon, the sandwich was a little salt-heavy but still good. Their fries were bomb-diggity. I ordered the Duck Confit with grits which have been...awesome...if it had more salt to it. But I appreciated the spirit of the dish and enjoy every bite. I also got a side of their brie and bacon brussel sprouts which was quite possibly my favorite part of the meal. Just when I'd forgotten there was supposed to be brie in the dish, I hit upon a ooey gooey pocket of melted cheese and it just imparted the best quality to this unassuming side dish. Service was somewhat efficient. Our server seemed a little scared to come near my voiceless dining companion (my friend lost her voice due to a cold) but was otherwise quite pleasant. I would have liked more space, especially since we were all carrying around an extra 50 lbs of winter clothing but alas, what are we going to do about it, you know?
