I went here on a school field trip with Mr. Becker and it was great. the food was served in an appealing manner and tasted great. The workers explained the dishes that they served and its importance to the culture. I think that their Hummus was amazing and so were the Pitas and Falafels. The only thing i didn't like was one type of their kabab. Overall i would definantly recommend this to anyone who enjoys food that isn't typical with a westernized culture.
