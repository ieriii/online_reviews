When in doubt, come here. You won't be disappointed. I am telling you. I have probably been here 5 or 6 times, so more than most but certainly not a enough. Mercat is a tapas spot and though a bit pricey, they do a great job. I have ordered multiple options from their menu, experienced a grandiose chef's tasting menu and even engaged in morning beverages and brunch with their all you can drink special. Choose from "make your own bloody mary," delicious Sangria options or if you are feeling bubbly, their mimosas. Along with brunch comes a selection of tapas treats - and even some paella.  The only other complaint / potential issue I can think of would be the proximity to a hotel, which on a weekend for brunch, can leave you with a large group of loud tourists blabbing away. The food and drinks help you get over it! =)
