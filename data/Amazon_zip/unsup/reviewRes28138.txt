Just a warning if you book through open table: they will charge you $50/person if you dont cancel within 48 hours. That wasnt a problem for us, but the whole experience was underwhelming, especially the food. The obligatory popcorn was set on our table and it wasnt as good as the one at Lolla. I think it was because they used real parm on this one and the shaker parm at Lolla. We did the 5 course pre-fixe menu: 1. Deconstructed ceasar. This was actually a highlight for me. Very interesting twist on a regular salad and I felt like I was tasting something made on Top Chef. 2. Butternut Squash soup. Honestly, I make it better. It was overwhelmingly gingered...chunks were floating in it. Im a big ginger fan but this was too much! Blah 3. Scallops. They were alright. Pretty room temp if not cool. They had some type of topping with walnts and a bunch of other things. I didnt really like the walnut/scallop combo. 4.Wagyu Beef. Another highlight. It was cooked perfect and very tasty with little poatotes in the au jus. We wished we wouldve ordered this as an entree and skipped the tasting. 5. Smores. This was a cute take on a traditional smore. I liked it for the most part but not a huge marshmallow fan so I skipped those although I believe they are homemade if youre into that. For the exhorbitant prices I really dont think you get what you pay for. The atmosphere was nice and all, but the quality of food was not up to par. I guess go if you want to experience for yourself and say you went there, but make sure its on a pay day!
