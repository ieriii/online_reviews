Summary: Great food, kind of loud, average service. The wife and I walked in on a Friday night and got a table in the back room. It took a bit for someone to come around for drink orders, and by the time they did we order the main course at the same time. We got the house Margaritas (self proclaimed, "Best in the World"). While they might not have been best in world good, they certainly were good enough. We got the guacamole for an appetizer. Homemade and very good. For the main course I had the Vallerta Chimichanga. It was awesome.  The wife got the Mayan Enchiladas, and they were also very good. So overall 4 stars. I think a little faster service and better ambiance would maybe give it 5, but we were really pleased with our experience.
