A friend of mine and I went there for dinner and drinks last night. What a fantastic, ultra classy place! We had reservations, but still had to wait a half hour or so for our table. No big deal, we just went over to the bar and had a few martinis. The design and decor is very feng shui-ish and we really like it! I really like the fire element! When we got seated we had a nice relaxing time. Our server wasn't the best because he gave us another round of drinks and we didnt see him for about 45 minutes and had to eventually flag him down for a refill. The Chef's walking around with the different food choices were very kind, knew their stuff and even joked around with us. They were a lot of fun. The food was AHHH-MAZING!! The most tender, juiciest meats i've ever tasted. A completely delicious selection! Overall, it was almost a perfect experience, except the waiter service. I'm looking forward to going back!
