Was visiting a friend in Chicago and she insisted we had to go to Giordano's. I love deep dish so I was all for it. We called ahead and said we'd pick up because it's usually crazy busy. We arrived about 20 minutes later and the place was packed! People waiting in line, people at the bar, people waiting to be seated. This place must be great. It took about 15 extra minutes (only complaint) but we finally got our extra large, deep dish, cheese with green peppers pizza. It smelt and tasted absolutely decadent. Everything fit together perfectly and I'd go back there in a heart beat. If they don't serve this is Heaven, I'm not going.
