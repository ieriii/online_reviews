I used to live about a mile away down Western and now that I'm gone I wish I would have hit it up a few more times. For some reason the bartenders love my friend Josh and they shower him with booze and great service and one time I reaped the benefits of that. Fantastic burgers - really awesome concoctions. I credit this place for being the first time I ever tried banana, peanut butter and bacon (the Elvis) on a burger. Mad good. I also love metal so in my opinion they are doing everything right.
