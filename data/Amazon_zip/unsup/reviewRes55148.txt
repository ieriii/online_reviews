Took my Dad for Father's Day. We had a reservation and we still waited an extra half hour to sit because the kitchen was backed up. Once we got seated, the dining room was not even that full. The food was actually good and they gave you a lot of it. I had the brisket, ribs and chicken. Cole slaw and cornbread was good too! I would certainly order take out the next time I go to avoid the wait.
