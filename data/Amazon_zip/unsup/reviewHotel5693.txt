Dear Lord, Please don't get me started on how HORRIBLE my experience with this place went. Only reason for the one star is free internet and free water bottles to fill up otherewise I would say negative and never coming back here is my answer. First off the employees are rude. We had booked for non smoking but we got smoking in a tiny bedroom that reeked I seriously thought if I stayed there longer than the amount of days I did I would have gotten second hand cancer in no time. I went and asked for the staff to spray it down or do something he just waved me off without even asking for the room number I was staying in. I even went out and bought a can of air freshener after day 2 it ran out from my many attempts to "freshen" up the place. There was a DRIED UP BOOGER on one of our towels (gross!). not only that but there was stains all over the carpeting literally looked like someone had took a big dump on the carpeting all over the place. Trust me I will never come back even if its free and suggest people to stay away.
