I have chosen to change my initial rating. I actually feel bad for writing the original review after being contacted by the owner, Susan.  I think sometimes we forget that the businesses we are frequenting are owned by individuals rather than huge nameless corporations. I will definitely be going back for a second meal. Comments from the owner Susan are below: "Dear Rich, Thank you so much for taking the time to share your feedback on your experience here at Kinzie Chophouse. Its your comments, both positive and negative, that help us continue to grow and maintain who we are, and give us insight into what's actually happening with our customers. I can't tell you how valuable that is for me. I would truly like to hear more about your visit here. I'm so disappointed that you weren't treated to a far greater experience across the board-- in terms of the quality of food or service with those issues. Any details you can offer me would be so helpful: the day you were here, where you sat, how things were handled for you, and I can get to the bottom of it. I know you have a lot of wonderful choices here in Chicago, and would love to host you here again soon and be (and stay!) at the top of your list. I would love to have you back to see how Kinzie Chophouse SHOULD be for you, every single time."
