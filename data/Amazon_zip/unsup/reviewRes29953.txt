There are literally 4 Thai restaurants within a block of each other in Lincoln Square. I asked myself - how different can they be? Well, Opart is the best one in the area, possible best in town. Everything just tasted incredible. Chicago is such a big place that a restaurant needs something extra to stand out. It's hard to explain, but you know when a place has taken the time to make their food truly delicious, and Opart has done it. It's also the nicest looking and most busy of all the area Thai places. When I went in to pick up my take-out, there were like 6 bags on the counter ready to be picked up as well. This is the best and people know it. Highly recommended.
