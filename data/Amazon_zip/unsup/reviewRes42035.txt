I'm not the biggest fan of deep dish pizza because it's hard to find GOOD deep dish pizza. Many places just suck. This is not one of those places. I will preface my review with the caveat that I, at the recommendation of a good friend, ordered a slice of whatever had most recently come out of the oven. It WAS really really good, but I have a feeling that the quality drops as the pieces and pies sit awaiting purchase. I had a slice of spinach, mushroom, and onion deep dish that just tasted right. It very much reminded me of a lasagna that my mother makes not so much in the ingredients and individual textures but in how eatable it was. While I normally find most deep dish to some undesirable trait like bitterness or being overly sweet or saucy, here, the pizza was gentle, full of flavors, and easy to eat. None of the ingredients were too strong. It didn't feel like any one part of the pizza was fighting for dominance of my palate. I didn't suddenly get a mouth-full of spinach or mushroom. Nothing seemed to be masking some aspect of the piece. Although not overbearing, the individual flavors came out - particularly the onion. It had that great, full taste that only onion can give hitting the perfect spot between undercooked and caramelized. Not being loaded with the onions, it was a nice surprise whenever I arrived at one. I'm not a fan of slices of pizza too difficult to eat. You shouldn't have to struggle to enjoy a piece whether it's too oily or poorly cooked or so thick and heavy (in the case of deep dish) that you tire after just a few. This is where the pizza here shines. It's significant enough to have weight and heft. It'll fill you up, but it won't tire you out. For me, that's probably the most important part. It was just a pleasure to find a deep dish slice which didn't fall apart offering just enough resistance to remind me that I was eating something but also fluffy and light enough to make me want another just as soon as I finished.
