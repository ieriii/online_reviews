Did you really just give the "best restaurant in America" less than 5 stars on yelp??? Nahhh.. But really, it's hard to write a review on such an intimidating restaurant but actually it's not at all. Intimidating that is. I didn't know what the expect and was afraid to walk in and have everyone staring at me like I had a big "noob" sign on my face. But the service was awesome and the atmosphere was not pretentious at all even though neither of us (2) ordered the wine pairing. The food is also obviously amazing. Way beyond anything I've ever eaten and probably beyond my comprehension of how complex the food is. There are many many many reviews about the food and pictures and books even so I'll just impart a few nuggets of knowledge. - We didn't read too much about each individual dish which was nice because we like to be surprised. Especially the dessert at the end.. I won't ruin it. - Being the good foodies we were, we were taking a few notes and pictures along the way. Turns out they give you this awesome menu at the end which has names and a little chart of flavors. - Took us 3-4 weeks out to make reservations and we called a few times to get a better time. They have a wait list but it's just day of. - Plan on being there for at least 3.5 hours. We got there 6pm and left at 10pm and only had a table of 2.
