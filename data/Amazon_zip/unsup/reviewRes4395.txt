Well, I have been here twice and both have been after a show at the Riv so there is not much I can say about the Green Mill. It's dark with a big bar and some booths....the bartenders were nice (or just put up with the drunk crowd I was with). My friend spotted Johnny Depp here not too long ago.....so it must be cool! Kidding....kind of. Definitely an old-school Chicago jazz bar that should not be passed by!
