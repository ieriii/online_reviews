Hands down, the best (trendy) breakfast in town. Cool atmosphere, great dishes, good coffee, trendy bucktown art crowd, great staff. Every dish on the menu reads like a story book and tastes out-of-this-world. Fresh ingredients, adventurous combinations, and wonderful aromas. Get there early however, or you'll find yourself waiting outside in a long line, which in summer ain't too bad, but during the winters can suck!
