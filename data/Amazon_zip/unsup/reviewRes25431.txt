If you're expecting fine, upscale dining with pretentious and snooty ambiance, this is NOT the place for you. However, if you're looking for a cute, fun, and romantic time, this is definitely the right place. I've heard so many things about Geja's, and jumped all over the Groupon. The trick with Groupon is to wait until most of the hype has died down, then go. Seriously. There is an expiration date, it's ok to be closer to the expiration than the purchase date. As luck would have it, this worked even MORE In my favor, as if used during the week, the Groupon was worth $60 instead of $50. Sweet. Armed with a $60 Groupon, my boyfriend and I headed to Geja's for our anniversary. After reading reviews, I sorta knew what to expect. Request a booth, you'll kinda smell like cooking oil, it's a little dark in here, careful of the hot oil, TONS of food, kinda pricey. Yep, all these things are true. But, oh man... this stuff is GOOD. It's not healthy, but it's just fun, tasty, and romantic. We opted for the International, which is $50/person. It included cheese at the start, beef, shrimp, and chicken for the main, and chocolate at the end. Everything was cut nicely, the meat good quality, and the service timed perfectly. Also sprang for a bottle of wine. They came around with a card for our "special occasion", and a coupon for next time. Needless to say, both of us left stuffed, happy, a little tipsy, and VERY satisfied.
