I really love this place. $8.95 for a large crepe and cup of soup? Savory crepes? Awesome. Icosium seems to always either be packed or empty but they never shove you out, probably because they have prompt service and it shouldn't take you too long to eat a crepe anyway. It also seems appropriate for several occasions. If you go early to mid-morning there are a lot of people on their laptops drinking coffee. It's a casual lunch spot, and also a dinner date spot. Not pretentious or fancy but has enough intimacy and character to have a date. 4 stars because I only ever order the Greek crepe and every person I've brought here who has ordered something different has been "eh" about their food and wished they ordered the Greek crepe too.
