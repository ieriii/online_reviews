I really really want to rate this as zero or one stars just to bring down the average so people stop going there. I've only been twice, but I love this place. Sometimes the service can be a tad slow, but I'm forgiving of this as its not your typical bar scenario. The place is definitely a throw-back to the speak easies of the 30's and pulls it off quite well. From the outside, your average jerk wouldn't even know there was a bar there unless a line has formed, which makes it a little more conspicuous.  The absolute best aspect of the place is the drinks. They make their simple syrup, bitters and god only knows what else from SCRATCH! AMAZING! Hell, the latest menu even has a couple drinks with actual egg white in them, which is extremely impressive to me. All the cocktails are around $11 a piece, which marks them as pricey, but hey...well worth it in my opinion. If you're a conneseuir of fine cocktails, I highly suggest this spot.
