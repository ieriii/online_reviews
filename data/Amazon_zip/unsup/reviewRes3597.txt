Most.Amazing.Wings.Ever! We had the 5 piece wings (huge btw), with the seoul sassy sauce and they were juicy, crispy, and tasty! Which is all that you can ask a wing to be in my book. I ordered the seoul steak bowl which was very disappointing, in fact i ate very little of it, but my dining partner loved his version of bi bim bop. But the wings really stole the show tonight! Can't wait to try the other sauces! Yes they are byob, but they will give you little plastic water cups (just a warning) and they are no longer cash only! They took my card which means i can save that precious cash for another day! The other factor was the price, for 2 bowls, 2 waters, and 5 wings it totalled at over 30 dollars! Not exactly light on the wallet, but still i would definitely come back for the wings time and time again!
