I had been dying to go here for awhile after a friend raved about it. Boy was she right! My boyfriend and I went here last Saturday night with some of our friends before heading to another friends party so we were looking to have some cocktails and dinner. I had the moscow mule as my drink of choice which was light, refreshing and had just the right amount of alcohol. Everyone else had the table wine before switching to straight belividere on the rocks..4 dollars for a decent glass of wine!? can't beat that! For food, we ordered the steak tartare toast, the pecorino pasta, the truffle pasta, the hamachi, and a bunch of sides including the brussels sprouts, cauliflower and cornbread. My friend doesn't eat meat outside the house hence the large amount of sides for her. The cornbread was one of the top 10 best things I've ever eaten. It was crispy on the outside, warm on the inside and just perfect. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! My only complaint would be that the portions were on the smaller side but we all left pleasantly full but not overstuffed. I'll definitely be coming back here!
