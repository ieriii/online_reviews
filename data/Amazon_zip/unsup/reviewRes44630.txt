There are some outstanding Thai restaurants on Western/ Lincoln Square, How really can you pick? From first glance it may seem as if every thai restaurant is the same, had to check it out for my self. First on the list of Thai on Lincoln.... Opart Thai had some great reviews so I decided to try it! Whenever I go to Thai places I always end up getting Pad Thai. Tonight was different! What made it so different?, CURRY! *AMAZING CURRY!! Gaeng Panang w/ tofu * BYOB ( Superb)! *App Peanut Sauce Spring Rolls- So delicious! *Go for medium on all dishes, I love spicy but medium was spicy enough for me, whenever something is tooooo SPICY you can't really enjoy it if you can't taste it:)! * Yummy jasmin tea, my favorite part the small cups make you feel as if your at a cute tea party! WIll be back, though I think I will check out some more of Chicago Thai first!
