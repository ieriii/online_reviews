LOVE LOVE LOVE Sapori Trattoria. The food is amazing (the best Cappellacci di Zucca - or Pumpkin Ravioli) I have ever had....and I have tried quite a few versions. The staff is so friendly, I always receive coupons in the mail, and they have done personal menus for a friend's birthday that I planned and given my mom a rose on Mother's Day....all in all, I'd eat at Sapori at least once a week if I could!!
