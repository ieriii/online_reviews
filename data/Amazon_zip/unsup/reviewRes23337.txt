Having spent our honeymoon in Greece, my wife and I are always on the lookout for delicious Greek food back here in the States. Greek Islands does not disappoint.  I had the Keftedes (lamb and beef meatballs in tomato sauce). Outstanding! Service is excellent. The wait for 2 of us was only 10 minutes. And this was on a very busy Saturday night. We will defintiely return the next time we are in Chicago.
