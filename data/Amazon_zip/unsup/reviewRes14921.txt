Sabatino's is definitely old school and the crowd is a bit older... it seems like these people have been going there for years. I always feel out of place but I still love their food; I have eaten there 3 times already and will always continue to go back. They are very busy and it's hard to get a table on a weekend without reservations but you can always take a table at the bar if one becomes available. If you sit there, you can listen to live piano music and karaoke. If you're lucky, you will get a private booth which is very nice, romantic, and cozy!  Now, onto the food, they give you so much and I always leave this place overly stuffed. One time, I actually ate everything! Your entree will come with soup, salad, and pasta. Their bread is awesome; crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. They will also give you complimentary pizza bread but for appetizers, I love their bruschetta. I also enjoy their Stracciatella with Spinach soup, Chilean Sea Bass (usually a special), Shrimp Della Casa, and Chicken Toscana. Just writing about it, I already want to go back!
