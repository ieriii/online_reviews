Second time at Little B's new location, and it just gets better with each visit. The goulash is superb - super tender meat with tasty lil' dumplings and veggies with sauce that's zesty and delicious. The saganaki - fresh and melty - beats anything you'll get in Greektown. Add to this the delightful trad. jazz combo and the owner who makes you feel like you and your friends are the guests of honor and you have a truly exceptional night on the town!
