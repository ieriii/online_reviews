We drive by here on Saturdays and Sundays and make fun of everyone standing in line to get in. Sat morning we got up extra early for some unknown reason and decided that we'd go see what all the hype is about. The room doesn't open till 9. We got there at 8:30 thinking it's a b-fast place so why wouldn't it be open at 7 or 8? We decided driving somewhere else would take as long to wait - By 8:45 there was a single file line waiting to get into the place. I felt humiliated and like a total a$$ waiting to get into this place. Anyhow, I had the BLT benedict. It was good. I cleaned my plate. BF had the breakfast burrito - It was good. My 4 ounces of $3.75 tomato juice was disheartening. Honestly, I just can't figure out what all the hype is about. It's really NOT THAT FANTASTIC. Especially to wait for hours and hours. Honestly, save your money and your time and go to Cornerstone Cafe at Diversey, Western, and Elston - That place is Breakfast PRIMO.
