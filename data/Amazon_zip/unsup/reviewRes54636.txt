Seriously, one of the two best $10 lunches in town. The other is Hot Doug's. Spicy Falafel, Lamb Shawerma, Lentils and Rice, it makes me forget where I'm from and get all hot for Mediterranean food.Really, it should get four stars, for the horrible music and smelly hipsters crowding in, but the food is that good, and priced right.
