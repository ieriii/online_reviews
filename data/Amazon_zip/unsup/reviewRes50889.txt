Weird dinner here. Wanted to love it - did the Thanksgiving price fixe, showed up ready for hot Southern fun. Apps were awesome, then it went downhill...they forgot one of our courses, then the waiter all but disappeared. Didn't offer us coffee, never said thanks, and my coat was on the floor of the coat room. The waiter's reccomendations were also spot-off. Chose my entree by his suggestion, and it was like catering food. Wah.
