A few doors south of Nordstroms is a restaurant with such colorful and tasty choices that they take no reservations! I arrive at 11;30am when they opened,there was already a line. My BFF and I shared several plates. The whipped feta with cucumbers and roasted cornwith heirloom tomatoes and arugula pesto disappeared quickly. The charred cauliflower was my BFF's pick. I don't eat cauliflower but was intrigued by the different colors in the small bowl. It was delicious! Although we were sharing, my BFF did not share her Wagyu sirloin tips with a bone marrow vinaigrette! I must try that next time. The octupus was tender and so flavorful! I have a sweet tooth, so dessert is always a must. The bread pudding was the perfect end to a lunch that ended much too quickly. I will find any excuse to return. It is my new go to place on Michigan Avenue!
