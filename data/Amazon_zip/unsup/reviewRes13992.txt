i first fell in love with glenn's for their awesome breakfast/brunch menu. its pretty standard, but the quality is far above par. not to mention, almost each dish comes with an incredible potato pancake. (if yours doesn't - get one on the side - you won't be sorry). not sure what they put in those puppies, but they leave my mouth watering each time.  but breakfast is nothing, compared to their dinner menu. glenn is known for his seafood and he does not kid around. esp on monday nights when almost all seafood entrees are $13.99, which includes a massive piece of fish a veggie and some real tasty taters. also, if you get a salad - pleeeeease get it with ranch dressing. its probably the best ranch i've ever had and thats a bold, bold statement.  tuesday and wed nights they also have seafood specials. all you can eat crab legs one night and maybe shrimp the next? just give glenn a call. he's a nice guy. he'll let you know what's up.
