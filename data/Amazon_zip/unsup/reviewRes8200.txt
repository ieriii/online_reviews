After seeing this place in Chicago Magazine's Top 25 pizza places in Chicago, I had some high expectations of the kind of pie I would get here. Let's start with what I really liked: the outdoor seating is a plus, servers were nice, the caprese was fresh and simple, and they have a nice nutella focaccia dessert made with the pizza dough What was good but not great: I was disappointed that the toppings on the pizza didn't reach further out to the crust, so I left feeling like my pizza was mostly crust with a few delectable bites with toppings and cheese. The pizza also wasn't super flavorful (this could also be because so much of it was pizza dough). All in all, it was a nice spot that I would go to again if I were in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't make a special trip.
