On a chilly June night, double date, my friend insisted that we meet up for some Italian at Caro Mio. I love Italian food, but these days, I'm realizing that my jeans are a bit snug and I should, well, ya know, start watching what I eat. After a quick glance at the online menu, I decided, eff it, I'm going all out with carbs and the like. My date and I split the calamari fritto, which was good, but a smidge too big for my liking, and a touch chewy. I like 'em little and dainty. (That is NOT what she said.) But it was perfectly crispy and served with a lovely tangy marinara sauce. I had one of the specials for the evening: lobster ravioli in the marscapone cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes which was decadent and fabulous. (Not as good as La Gondola, but if you've had it there, you know what I'm saying.) I had half leftover for my lunch today...ya know, spread the fatty out. BYOB with no corkage (love that) and very friendly service, albeit a bit slow. Too full for dessert, I have no comments there. I know, I said I was gonna go out fatty style. Turns out I failed at that. Besides, there's always control top pantyhose for that extra tightening on those "days after" eating massive amounts of carbs and cream sauce. And to allow you to finish your leftovers the next day. I'm just sayin...
