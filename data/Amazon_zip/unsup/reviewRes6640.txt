Really great!! Went around 9 on a Monday night and didn't have to wait, but the place was still pretty full. The service was excellent!! One of the better service experiences I've had in the city - very friendly, efficient, knowledgeable, and not pushy. I loved the atmosphere there - very rustic yet chic, and relaxed enough that I felt fine in casual attire. However, the real star of the place is the food - a-mazing. Absolutely everything we had was exceptional! Someone had recommended the Pizza della Frattoria as a must there... I was a little wary about it, as its a bit extraneous for my usual tastes, however I ended up loving it! The egg is runny (including the white), but it really does make the dish. You can also get a big bang for your buck with the wine there, making the place even better!
