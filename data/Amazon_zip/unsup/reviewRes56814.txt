Spacca Napoli has become one of my girlfriend's and my favorite places. The pizzas come out lightning fast, but we slow the pace down by ordering a couple of appetizers and a bottle of wine. Service has always been fantastic, and we wrap up dinner with tiramisu and limoncello.I have always lived in the US, so my experiences with other cultures are what I've learned while vacationing. Having found the place in Naples, Italy where, it is said, pizza was invented, Spacca Napoli is a great place to reminisce about my girlfriend's and my travels. The margarita pizzas are nearly identical to what we ordered while in Italy.For pizza, its a pricey place for a quick dinner-for-two on the town, but as a date restaurant, its a winner! (As a heads-up: The pizzas are best to be enjoyed at Spacca Napoli; ordering take-out from there is a bad idea.)
