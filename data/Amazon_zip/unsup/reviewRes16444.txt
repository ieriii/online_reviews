Ditto on everything said about the lunch buffet: - $16/person + $3 for drinks = around $25 with tax and tip - Tasty with plenty of choices: a soup, vegetable samosas, desi style chicken, chickpea curry, potato/pea curry, spinach with corn, salad bar etc. - Tandoori chicken to every table - Hot, delicious naan - Dessert buffet with three options: deep fried milk ball in a saffron sauce (reminded me of bread pudding... very tasty), mango ice cream (tastes like frozen mango lassi), and rice pudding with cashews and raisins. Great spice levels and very flavorful food. High-quality.... and easily the best Indian buffet I have ever been to. I only wish the price was lowered a bit, then I could justify a 5.
