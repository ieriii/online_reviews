I love this place! The beer, liquor, and wine selections are great, but the best part is their unique and tasty mixed drink menu. They have beer cocktails that I can't get enough of...also, their liquor cocktails include infused flavors that are usually not available other places (e.g., habanero and horseradish vodkas). The food is great too! High quality and unique products. My favorite is the seasoning options for the fries that include truffle, chipotle, curry, garlic, to name a few.
