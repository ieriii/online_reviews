This is a great Brazilian steakhouse are if you're in the mood for that type of dining. I have yet to go to a churrascaria with serious mind blowing stand out food. I don't know it is even possible to turn out a masterpiece when you're cranking out that quantity of food. These places are kind of like a fondue place, all about the unique dining experience, the food it self gets you to Point B, but you probably wont taste anything crazy cool on your way there. The salad bar is amazing though, they really put out the works....but really how many people are going to a Brazilian steakhouse if they are going to past on the meat. They also hit you up with good little sides. Brazzaz has a cozy contemporary feel and I prefer it over those "other" Brazilian steak houses. As for the liqueur concoction they push at the end of your meal, touting it's ability to aid in digestion, be forewarned: it works.
