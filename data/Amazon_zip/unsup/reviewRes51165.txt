blah, blah, service, blah, blah.  the only thing that matters about an brunch is the eggs benedict. i'm that easy. but, apparently eggs benedicts are not that easy. whenever i sit for brunch at a place i've never been, i ponder. do i risk crushing disappointment? bad benedicts are oh so terribly bad... wishbone, however, can cook up a fine fine eggs benedict, if my first any only visit, is any indication. what's more, they have a number of benedicts if you, like me, tire of the ham, poached egg, hollandaise deal. i look forward to trying the crab-meat benedict on my next visit. oh, and their potatoes kick some tail too. and the orange juice is good.
