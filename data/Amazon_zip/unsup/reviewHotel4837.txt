The hotel itself was ok, but we used the event planning/catering service for a private event and the service we received was atrocious. The main event planners here are completely incompetent and totally dishonest. Not only did they make promises that were left unfulfilled, but they also blatantly lied and stated that they provided services that were not provided. The food was passable, but it was not served according to plan, the service workers were late, and the planners/managers were absent and unreachable when food and drinks were not provided in accordance with our contract..  I will never provide this company any more money after this botched event, and I advise that others not use any event services/catering services offered by these people.
