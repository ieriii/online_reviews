Being a major fan of Mr. Bayless, I was disappointed when I tried Xoco. The place: The ordering process is a little funky, you stand in line to order then someone tells you what table you are going to be sat at. For a small joint I understand it's hard to get everyone in, but I really dislike being told where to sit when the place isn't crowded and I get sat next to a busy staff door. The food: Now I love trying new things, but there are some ingredients I just don't like. So when I order a torta sans one ingredient (which I asked if they would even do, or if I should order something else) I expect it not to be on my torta at all. When it came out, the woman even confirmed- it was sans item. However, upon looking at my torta it appears that it had been pre-made and then the item had been scrapped off. Which isn't the same to me as not being on there, especially when said item was beans. So don't expect them to be fresh or made-to-order at all. That being said, the prices were also steep for what you get. The best part about it were the churros which I would come back and order- but that's about it. I'll take the hour+ wait at Frontera to get the good stuff any day.
