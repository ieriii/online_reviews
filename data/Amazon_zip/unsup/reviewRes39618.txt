There is almost always a wait to get seated when I have been there (usually after 11pm) The food is yummy. The meat is seasoned very well. The service is ok but what the hell, I'm cooking my own food. The price is right and you get a lot for your money. You WILL wreak of hardwood smoke after a meal hear so don't wear anything delicate or flammable. The venting is pretty good but it's not perfect. If you don't feel comfortable cooking your food, they will oblige by filling your grill. One order of BBQ is enough for two normal people. You get a lot of sides so don't go overboard on the appetizers. The parking lot is very small but there is plenty of street parking within half a block.
