I was in the area meeting friends for drinks at Monsignor Murphy's (don't ask) when another friend and I decided we wanted dinner. Enter Crisp. I have been wanting to eat here for ages, but I don't find myself in that area too often and the one time I did try to go, they were closed. Not this time.  My friend ordered the Crisp BBQ wings and I got the Seoul sassy chicken strips and we split an order of fries. At first I didn't think I was a fan of this place - the chicken strips were only so-so. I blame that more on the strips than on the sauce because I loved dipping my fries into the extra sauce in my to-go container. Then I ate one of my friend's (ginormous) wings. Holy yum. The Crisp BBQ sauce is the bomb. It was not reminiscent of a typical American BBQ sauce (which is why I avoided it in the first place). It was spicy without being too spicy and packed with a huge punch of flavor. The fries were fine, nothing special, though as mentioned, made a great vehicle for the Seoul sassy sauce. I would recommend the wings over the chicken strips by far, but both these sauces were delish.  I'm anxious to return and try one of the Korean bowls, but I don't know if I"ll be able to get past those wings. Now that's a problem I'd be happy to have.
