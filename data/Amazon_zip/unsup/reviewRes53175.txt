It was hard to say goodbye to Calvin's but I'm happy to have 90 Miles in it's place! The patio is usually full...the empanadas are tasty with a nice flaky dough. Goat cheese? Yes please. I've had the lechon and ropa vieja dinners. Both tasty although the steak could have been a little more seasoned. The staff there is friendly...rest assured i'll be back soon!
