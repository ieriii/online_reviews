Perfect lunch spot. Food is fresh and tasty; desserts are a feast for the eye as well as the palate. Chicken lemon rice soup and Mediterranean salad are my favorites. Potato salad is unique and memorable. The array of authentic Greek foods and gifts adds charm. Service is adequate, but not exceptional.
