If only the flights out of O'Hare were as smooth as the Chardonnay flight I had last month at Bin 36. I've been here about a half a dozen times (usually before dinner) and have yet to be disappointed in the food or the service. After a long day of meetings around town, it 's the perfect antidote for civilization (I think that was Club Med's tagline). Although the place was jam-packed and mildly noisy, my friend and I were too immersed in the tastes and aromas to be distracted. The waiter was also extremely helpful in suggesting the ideal cheese flight pairing to our Chardonnay (the slightly tangy Keen's cheddar was my favorite). Looking forward to my next non-stop flight into Bin 36.
