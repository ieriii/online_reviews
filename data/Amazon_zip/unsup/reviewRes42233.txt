When in Rome, right? I'd been in town all of about an hour when one of my favorite folks from Miami suggested that we try out some genuine Chicago deep dish. As fate (and a meandering cab ride) would have it and based on some yelpy Chicago love, we decided to hit The Art of Pizza. First of all, I love the idea of pizza as art (and more than that...inspiration), and given the slice -- if you can call it that, it was about the size of my first car -- there's no question that these guys were shooting for the moon. Says here that they hit the target: slices are arguably almost as deep as they are wide, slathered in various sauces and toppings, and soda choices ensure that you'll won't be parched even if you're full. I will say that the interior here is a little borderline sketchy, but in fairness, I don't think pristine was really what they were going for. Besides: sometimes when creating art, you have to tear down all around you to make something beautiful.
