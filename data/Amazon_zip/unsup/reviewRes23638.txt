I never really experienced Greek food until I moved to Chicago. I have to say that this is the first place I tried and though I've tried many of the other places in Greek town since, Greek Islands is my restaurant of choice. I always order the flaming cheese and it's always awesome. I usually order something different each time and I have yet to be even slightly disappointed. Great for a date or with a group of friends.
