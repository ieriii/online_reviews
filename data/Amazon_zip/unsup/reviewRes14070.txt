I've been told that there's been a whole lot of hype in the lead up to the opening of this place. And I think Revolution definitely silenced the nay-sayers with its top-notch drinks and fabulous food options. So yes, they do brew beer here and I have to say they taste pretty good. I'm no beer snob or connoisseur, but I can discern delicate and complex flavors and the people here do a decent job of that. Despite it's faux-proletariat-cum-class struggle theme, this place would make Lenin cry. Drinks and food are moderately priced so your tab can get pretty high if you don't watch it. From what I can tell, the food here is very good and very friendly to vegetarians. Last note, is it me or is the wait-staff here nice to look at or what?
