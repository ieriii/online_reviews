Why is this place getting good reviews? The sushi isn't anything to freak out over and the rest of the menu is fried food. I made french fries when I was 13, I don't get how people are charging patrons so much money for something that is so easy to make. The atmosphere is annoying. It's between middle aged Creed/Nickleback listening rich men that are akward and dress poorly or the women that are skanking it up to makeup for the lack of their father's attention. Wait is this a night club? Is that what I walked into? Cause if so then give it 5 stars. Sleezy atmosphere and all.
