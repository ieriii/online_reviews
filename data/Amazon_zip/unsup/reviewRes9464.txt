Chicago is close to heaven in the summer; of all the outdoor places to eat, Le Colonial is easily my favorite. Le Colonial has a fantastic atmosphere that's part Rush street and part vietnam. The interior is a respite from the bustle of Rush and the nearby restaurants and bars, and is completely calming.  The drinks are great - I last went for a family celebration, so we started with a bottle of champagne, then went to cocktails, and then a bottle of wine. The staff was cheerful and helpful, though not at all invasive. The lychee martini is one of my favorites, and the saketini is great for those who do not like sweet drinks. The food - fantastic. I love the shrimp spring rolls, and the scallop and noodle salad is large enough for a meal and fantastically seasoned. My brother got the Pho, and raved about it. For our main courses, we shared the clay pot tofu (very good), the shrimp and asparagus (also very good), and the lemongrass chicken (my favorite).  During the spring and summer, the second floor balcony is open - and we were fortunate enough to call at 6:15 and were given the last table at 7:15...wow, were we lucky. If you can sit outside, I'd highly recommend it. Great food, great ambiance...fantastic place.
