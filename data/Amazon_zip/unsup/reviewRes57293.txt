I'm a huge Sushi Lover, I've had Sushi In Seattle,New York,Las Vegas,California you name it I've tried it. I'm not saying this place is the best because I'm from chicago but Coast Sushi has never failed to Impress me. Every Time i go there it feels like my first time. The Sushi is soooo fresh and just melts in your mouthh aahhhh lol cant talk about it now. I always get the same rolls the White Dragon is by far my fav. The Spicy Scallop,Spicy Ebi and the Najma Jalapeno. It's also byob which is pretty cool. You Must try this place !!
