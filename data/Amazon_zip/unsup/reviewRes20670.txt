Order the ahodaga sandwich and you'll be thrilled with your experience, even with the wait. We had guac, two sandwiches, 2 hot chocolates, and 3 churros for about $50. One sandwich (the Pibil or cochinita--roast suckling pig) was surprisingly mediocre--but the habanero side sauce was really good and improved the mushy meat. Roast suckling pig is on our list of 'must-order' meats so that was a real bummer. It's also one of the more expensive sandwiches on the menu at $12. The other sandwich (Ahodaga: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions.) for $9 was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had--it's served in a bowl sitting in the chili sauce so you eat it more like a French Dip. It's spicy, but still complex. I would go back just for this sandwich. The people next to us had the pork belly soup with vermicelli and they seemed to find it orgasmic. The Barcelona hot chocolate is listed as thick on the menu, and that's an understatement. It was tasty, but a few sips are plenty. The second one on the menu has milk added and that one was perfect. The churros were good, with a sort of Belgian Waffle gooiness that's really good. Given the long wait(Sat night we 2 arrived around 6:30--the line was just at the door--and we got our food around 7:45) and the hit-or-miss food, I wouldn't push people to try it out. Still, it's a relatively cheap dinner and fun to say you've been there given Rich Bayless' cred right now.
