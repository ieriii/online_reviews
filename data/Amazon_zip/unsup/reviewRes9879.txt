Really good fresh Italian food, great atmosphere, and an amazing patio. Even though this place has been around for a while and is a little off the beaten path it is always tough to get a table here. Make a reservation at least a week if not 2 or 3 in advance, otherwise you are out of luck. I really love their antipasti here-- both the quality and the presentation. It's all laid out nicely in the dining room with whatever they're including that day and you can watch the server prepare your platter (right down to slicing the meats) in front of you.
