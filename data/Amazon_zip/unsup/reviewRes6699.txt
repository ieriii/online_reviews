Oh Chicago Q... I'm in love with you. This joint is top notch. The place is gorgeous and indicative of a fine dining restaurant. The service was stellar and the staff was very knowledgeable. It's great getting the butter pickles and kettle chips when you sit down...and their beer selection is quite good (I'd recommend the in-heat wheat) I had the pick 2 last time I dined which included pulled pork and a half slab of babyback ribs. Yum! So much I couldn't eat it all. You should also have the hush puppies... they're crazy good! It's a great place to dine if you're looking for BBQ in a upscale environment.
