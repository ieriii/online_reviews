La Pasadita is my go-to late nite taco place. Any of the three (or is it four?) locations on Ashland and Division will do. I especially like LP for their carne asada taco. Simply two corn tortillas, onion, cilantro and hot steak off the grill. Simply delicious. And cheap. Come on a Friday or Saturday nite after midnight when they are getting ready for the after-bar crowd. You won't find fresher carne asada anywhere else. The other stuff on the menu is just OK - no worse than you will find in the 1300 other taquerias in town, but not much better. Stick with the carne asada tacos and you will be in taco heaven. Beware of the burritos if you like stuff in them. LP burritos are HUGE, but they are just meat and tortilla - no beans, no lettuce, no cheese...
