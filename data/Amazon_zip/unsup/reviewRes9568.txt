This is a really fabulous place. I've been here a dozen or so times, most often upstairs, to have a coktail with friends and some appetizers. It's so mellow, I love all the tropical palm trees and lounge feel. The food is really fabulous, although in all honesty, I'm all about the cocktails. i can only have two, as I'm a lightweight. My favorite is the lemongrass. :) I don't get to this area often, but when I do, Le Colonial is always on my list to stop in.
