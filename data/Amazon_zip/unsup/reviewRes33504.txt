We have eaten here a couple of times, but won't be going back. The maitre d' was exceptionally rude and the food simply not enough to make up for being treated poorly. I would encourage the owners to think service-service-service. We saw him refuse to sit a much older couple when their party was incomplete. Ok, that's their policy, but when the husband asked for a chair for his wife, that was also refused. This was at 6:30 on a Wednesday, the place was easily half empty. He then sat our party next to the bus station--again, the place is empty. He very grudgingly and with much eye-rolling moved us, but the night was spoiled. Our waiter was fine, but there are too many other places of similar quality and price to go back here.
