Piece is the bee's knees. I'm thinking this is at the top of my list for thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Fresh and delicious, crisp and flavorful. I tried a few of their home brews and my favorite was the DysfunctionAle. In addition to having a great home brews they have a nice selection of guest brews.  It gets a little too crowded and the wait is always long. Once you are seated the food comes quickly.  If you like pizza and beer Piece is a must. If you don't, you mean nothing to me.
