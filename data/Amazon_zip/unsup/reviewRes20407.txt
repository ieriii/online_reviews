The secret to eating at Coast is not to. For real -- I always order carry out. Dining in, the service is incredibly slow and the crowd is so pretentious that it's a rather unpleasant experience. However if you carry out (you can even order online!), you are in and out in 2 minutes and you have decent and affordable sushi to snarf down in the comfort of you home while the hoards of trendsters are still queuing up for their table.
