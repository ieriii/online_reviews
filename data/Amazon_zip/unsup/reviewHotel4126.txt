I like this place. Great location, nice room, great bar. We stayed here during our first visit in Chicago a few years ago... The bar is impressive - you are warned on the large/group martini glasses ;-) I am keeping the fifth star, because of their water conservation efforts. I appreciate their efforts, but I had specifically asked that they change the sheets after two days of our stay there, which they didn't. I called again and asked for the housekeeping to come back and change the sheets when we got back from the sightseeing, and they did so promptly. I say, when someone pays $180 a night to stay here, they deserve to sleep on clean sheets. There are planty of ways to be nice to mother nature...
