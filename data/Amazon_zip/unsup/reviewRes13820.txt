Stumbled across this place on a rainy Sunday.  Was on my way to Irazu Costa Rican restaurant, but realized it was closed Sundays. Big BOO! Anyways, en route to Irazu 90 Miles Cuban Cafe caught my attention because of the amazingly arranged/large outdoor seating patio. As soon as I found out Irazu was closed I turned the car around and headed to "that Cuban place with the cute outdoor seating".  Overall: A-OK.  Food was delicious. Meal prices were a little too high for my liking...especially since the original plan was to head to the more affordable Irazu but the food was good enough to satisfy my taste for a Latin steak sandwich and rice and beans. An appetizer and a meal made me full --- and I had enough leftover from my meal to take home. Also tried a Guanabana Tropical shake that was milky and tasty bursts of fruits. The atmosphere was even better than the food! Loved how it was decorated inside and out -- which was my main attraction to it in the first place.  I felt like I was taking a mini-vacay away from Chicago to a more tropical locale. I'd come back here again when I'm looking to splurge more than my usual $10 for dinner on a Sunday night and with a bigger group than 2. Btw, it's BYOB -- if you want.
