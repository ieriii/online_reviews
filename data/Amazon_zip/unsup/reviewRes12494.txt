I'm trying to catch up on my restaurant reviews, I'm very behind. So yet again my review won't specifically mention what I ordered. I'll try to avoid reviews like this in the future but I wanted to quickly say that I thought the food was very good. We actually sat outside in the back which I thought was meh, I didn't like the train going by but hey my wife wanted to. The food was good, service was very good until at the end when our server who looked like Ben Harper disappeared for almost fifteen minutes. After a long ten minutes, I grabbed a bus boy and asked for "el checko" and it magically appeared. We had our 3 and 4.5 year old boys and I saw other kids there too, so don't feel weird about bringing yer kiddies.
