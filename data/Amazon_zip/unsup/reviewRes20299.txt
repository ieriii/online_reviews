I went their with my cousin and we had a good experience. Yeah the crowd seemed a bit pretentious, a couple chicks wearing ugg boots. But our waiter made up for that, excellent service. We got outta their spending about sixty beans, with a nice tip. And i was not stuffed but full. The place seems more expensive from ther street then it really is. I recommend it, especially if your looking to hook up with some yuppie soon to be breeder types... haha.
