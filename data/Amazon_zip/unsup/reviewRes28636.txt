Don't forget your gel inserts for your standing shoes here - you'll be waiting for awhile. in fact, you should probably eat something before you try and wait for a table... otherwise, the three rounds of margaritas you'll have before your name is called will probably send you under the table instead of in your seat. But hey, at least it makes the food taste that much better. 4 stars for the food ~ delicious, yes. 3 hour wait delicious? eh, sure. We knew what we were getting ourselves into trying to dine on a Friday night... so as long as you're good-spirited about the indifferent service and ridiculous crowds, then it can be a great time. My friend was smart and brought a New Yorker with him to keep him occupied while he waited for us - he put our name down at 6:30pm and we were seated by 9:30pm. Yes, I know... we are suckers, but we kept ourselves entertained at the bar.  Dining highlights :: the homemade tortillas + ceviche trio + ridiculously hot habanero salsa. That salsa is no joke... and this is coming from someone who smears sriracha on just about anything. Heck, I even eat sriracha alone sometimes just to wet my palette. But this habanero business is legit... too legit.  Minus one star for the lame service - no one gives rat's ass if you're coming back again or not. and why should they care, there will always be people walking through their door.  Remember, eat a snacky snack and do some calf stretches before - you'll be all set.
