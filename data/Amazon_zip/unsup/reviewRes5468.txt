I wanted to try this place because of the glowing reviews and recommendation from some of my Chicago foodie friends. I was apprehensive, though, due to it's Michigan Ave address and because of the hype.  We went early on a chilly May evening (arrived around 6:30pm) and expected to wait... to our surprise we were offered a table right away! Unfortunately, the table was outside, under the tent. We debated, but decided we were hungry enough to sit outside. I did get a seat by the large heater, which was great at first, but as we proceeded through our dinner, it felt as if my head and neck were melting! Hot! Exterior temperatures aside, our dining experience was fantastic! We had a very knowledgable and friendly server, outstanding food, and I would definitely go back! Just FYI...they recommend 2-3 small plates per person (it is tapas-style). My friend and I have very healthy appetites and struggled to finish the five plates that we ordered.
