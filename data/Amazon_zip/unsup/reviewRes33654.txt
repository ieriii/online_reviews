I came here with a couple of girlfriends on a Sunday morning. I figured we'd have to wait, but I wasn't expecting the hour they quoted me. Sadly, since I had already parked in a pay lot, we weren't about to go anywhere else. Luckily, it was a nice day so we sat outside and chatted.  The coffee was good, and they had different flavored creamers on the table. We each had an omelette with pancakes and fruit. My omelette was full of veggies, avocado, and jack cheese. The food was good, but it was nothing special that would justify the hour wait.  If you're in the area and looking for brunch, this is a good option. But it's not something I'd go out of my way for - parking is tough and there are other options that are just as good without the huge wait. You can get $5 validated parking in the garage next door - but it doesn't do you much good if you only get it within 90 minutes and have a 60 minute wait.
