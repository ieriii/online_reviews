This place is pretty legit. Been here for a sidewalk brunch. We were able to sit right away (it was about 1p so we may have missed the rush?). The cheese grits were yummy with some of their hot sauce but then again I'm no connossieur (first timer). The girlfriend I brunched with is from the south and loved them so maybe that has more weight. I had an omelette with seasoned shrimp that was pretty excellent. The home fries were so-so (I hold high home fry standards). The biscuit that came with it was delish but certainly not award winning. All in all, for the price/value, lack of stand-and-wait, friendly service, and creativity of menu I was please and think most will be.
