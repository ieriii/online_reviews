Hey, for me to write a review, the place has to either light me up as this place did or water me down as this one horrible sushi place did.  Opart has such quality food! That really means something to me. I also believe that they give great portions.  I recommend the Pad Thai Noodles, The fried rice, and the A=Mazing sweet and spicy soup. (Mild for me). My mouth became inspired. I have eaten there twice and they are very consistent. The first time I had Opart, it was the leftovers from my wife and the food tasted outstanding even while was cold....I was hooked, after I nuked the rest of the food, I became and enternal fan. I hope you all enjoy this masterpiece of Asian cuisine.  --brother bartell Can't wait to eat at the one closer to my house, it is on 19th and State.
