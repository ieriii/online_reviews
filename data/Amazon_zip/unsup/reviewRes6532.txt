Let me start by saying that you are doing yourself a disservice if you have not eaten here already. Everything that was served to us was both creative and delicious, but the shining star of this restaurant was the service. We walked in fuming after having made a reservation at One Six One to use our Groupon expiring the next day (they were closed for a 'private party' which consisted of no guests after looking through their plate glass windows). The host, Leon Smith noticed we were upset, and sent over a comp'd Roasted Cherry Tomato+burrata+basil pesto salad (they're most expensive salad), which was delightful. Other Food- Pizza della Terra- Excellent, large portion of portion of Truffley goodness covered in taleggio cheese. Ricotta+Honeycomb Vasi- This was excellent, I would recommend getting it towards the end of the meal as a dessert since it is a sweeter dish. Uovo in Raviolo 'San Domenico'- Creative, delicious, enough said. Our server Eric was very knowledgeable, we asked him about a few items and he knew in detail which farm each ingredient was from and exactly how the items were cooked. A+ The whole experience was great from start to finish, complete with a handshake and come back soon from the host Leon at the end. We could not have been more impressed with the restaurant's food and service. If you're thinking about opening a working restaurant concept, take notes from Davanti!
