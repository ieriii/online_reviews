Sheer perfection. Best meal I have ever had hands down. My friend and I described our experience as though we were Alice in Wonderland. What a show. Chef Michael is a genius and a card.  Can't believe I was lucky enough to get a reservation here.  If you go, you will never be the same.  The food, the atmosphere, almost drug-like. All I can say is go, you will never forget the food or the Chef.
