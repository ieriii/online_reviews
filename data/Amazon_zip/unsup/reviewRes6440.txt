I am a big fan of the Lettuce Entertain You restaurants.  They make it easy to make reservations with their Open Table online system. The food is delicious and great quality. The steaks are always cooked to perfection. My favorite is the three filets, you can pick different crusts to top them. They also offer great nightly specials. When they have surf and turf, it is a great deal for a large lobster tail and large filet. I am a big martini fan and Wildfire offers some delicious options, but I recommend the wine flights. They are also a great deal, they give you a relatively large amount in each glass for flight. Highly recommended!
