When it comes to Hot Doug's, I'm gonna be like the postman. Neither rain nor sleet nor freezing temps will deter me from my goal. And no matter the weather, it's worth the wait! We visited on a cold, windy February Saturday and even though we got in line 15 minutes after it opened, it was still an hour wait. And did I mention it was cold? But once we got inside the doors and the delicious odor hit our nose holes, all I can say is Wow. The encased meats (as they prefer to be called) range in price from about $3-4 for the "standard" fare to 8-10 for their weekly specials. And while the original Chicago Style dog (with everything of course) is top notch, the money is in the specials. As the name weekly specials implies, the specials change weekly. But no matter what is on the list, I'd suggest focusing on those. You'll have a little time to browse the menu once you wait in line inside the restaurant, but it's not a bad idea to prepare by checking out the menu online. Keep an eye out for the game of the week under the jackalope. While there, my group of friends sampled rattlesnake, yak, jalapeo duck, kangaroo, and their 40-sausage chili. The chili was rich and meaty with a great smoky taste. Highly recommended. Each special sausage has it's distinct characteristics and it's hard to go wrong with any of them. They were all good, but the favorite of all the types we got was the rattlesnake.  As an added bonus, on Fridays and Saturdays, they serve their famous Duck Fat fries. These were great tasting, but came out a bit limp and I would've preferred them a crispier. But still good enough to get them again. The order is big enough to share between a few people. Service-wise, Doug is great as well as the rest of the staff. They're welcoming, helpful, and all really seem to enjoy working there.
