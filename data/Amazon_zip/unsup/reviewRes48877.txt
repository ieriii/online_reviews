Sorry to say this place was just not for me. Tons of beer with very knowledgeable wait staff who are very willing to educate. The food was just not for my pallet I guess? Lots of pork dishes? And the long table communal seating? Felt like everyone was in on my conversation and I in on theirs. Just not my type place I guess??
