I was disappointed with Sultan's Market on my initial visit, after 2 additional visits I couldn't change my mind (I don't like to give bad reviews after one visit). The pita is cut and served cold, it should be warmed up (as is the case with most other middle eastern restaurants). The falafels are dry. I would much rather visit Dawali (2 Chicago locations), Pita Inn (skokie), or Pita House (Schaumburg). The food is cheap which is a good thing for the 99%-ers like me. The location makes it easy to get to, a block or so west of the Damen blue line stop. I know this place gets the hipster/ wicker park bump, but it really is sub-par as far as middle eastern food goes.
