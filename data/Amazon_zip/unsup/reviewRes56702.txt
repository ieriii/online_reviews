We went there for a special occasion dinner with my husband. We really liked the decor inside, very warm and cozy. The food was good, my husband dish was a special for the evening and better than mine. We had the tiramisu for dessert, we shared one and had still enough to share the next day. And I have to admit it is the best tiramisu I had so far.Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable concerning the wine list. Something worth to mention, when we asked him for recommendation, he actually suggested a cheaper wine than the one we were looking at! And I am glad we followed his advice as the wine was definitely great.We will definitely good again.
