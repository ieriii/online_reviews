Their specialty rolls are very tasty. The price isn't outrageous, but they don't publicize their corking fee for the BYOB very well. It's a little annoying that they do not take reservations, but the bar on the side has a cool enough environment, that it's not a dreadful experience. Staff is below average, but what I go there for is the sushi and the environment. Both are above average, so my local favorite sushi place gets 4 stars.
