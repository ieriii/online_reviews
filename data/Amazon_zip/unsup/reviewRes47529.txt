Thank You! From the bottom of my celiac, allergic to garlic, soy, peanut, dairy, strawberry and eggs heart... Seriously. I don't even look forward to eating out anymore. When my husband and I were spending our anniversary downtown, and it was time for dinner, I was planning on my usual meal... plain lettuce with lemon, or whole foods groceries in our hotel room. We came across Zed 451, stopped in to see the menu, and your hostess showed us your "Celiac Sprue Association Award" to which I admittedly scoffed... "Gluten Free" ?That usually involves some mystery soy based food substance, which is also totally off limits! Your hostess took us back into the main dining room - a salad bar Wonderland! AND you listed the ingredients! THANK YOU! I could actually eat more than one item! We stayed for dinner, and our server Brandy, and your staff were super knowledgable about the ingredients in the meat too. Furthermore, no one made me feel like a social pariah... In fact, when the chef found out I couldn't eat garlic he made me a special "safe" salmon. Wow. We Celiacs take that stuff to heart. Thank you Zed 451! You also have gluten free Vodka! The drinks were awesome.
