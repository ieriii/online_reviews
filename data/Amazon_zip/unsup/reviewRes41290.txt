So there are some perks to being a secretary and Adminstrative Professionals Day is one of them. That being said, I got to enjoy an all out food fest here for all my hard work this past year. This place sure is fancy and I loved it. The service was top notch from the moment we walked into the door until we left. Everyone was super polite and the service definitely fit the prices on the menu. The food was delish. We ordered the crabmeat stuffed mushrooms and mm mm mm.  Next up was the steak, I love me a good filet but cooked in butter.. what??  AMAZING. I was sopping up every last bit of the sizzling butter with my fillet. It was soo good.  We had mashed potatos and broccoli and while they were good, they were nothing out of the ordinary. Lastly, we still managed to order a dessert. I ordered the apple tart and it was HUGE. Enough to feed 4-6 people and it was very good. Perfect warm temperature with a gooey center and vanilla ice cream begining to melt on top.  All in all it was a great experience and I look forward to my next trip here. ** While I was on a business lunch I did not get to partake in any of the very yummy sounding beverages but I will in the future.
