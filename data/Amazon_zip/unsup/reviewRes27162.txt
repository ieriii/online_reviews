Lovely! I enjoyed my birthday dinner last night at Graham Elliott. The space has a modern yet cozy vibe. The food is fabulous and the wine list has lots of interesting choices. We started with the buffalo chicken. What a lovely take on a well known bar food staple. Great blend of spice and blue cheese. I had the scallops and my husband had the pork belly. Both were perfect!  The deconstructed Snickers bar is honestly the best dessert I've ever had (and I love dessert). It's a great mix of salty and sweet. I could eat one of those every day!  Perfect!
