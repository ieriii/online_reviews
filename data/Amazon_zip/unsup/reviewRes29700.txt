I had a terrible experience here, despite so many people telling me that it was great. As soon as we walked in, the place was near empty and the girl who greeted us seemed like it was a big hassle of us to even walk in the door. In fact, she just handed the menus to us, waved her hand and told us to sit wherever we'd like.  After this, our server appeared right away who was even more unfriendly than the first. This girl didn't greet us or say her name, just simply "Do you know what you want yet?" in a very flat tone. She was annoyed with us for asking for a few minutes. Luckily, the food came extremely fast, which was great and it was also very delicious. However, when the check came, the server literally threw it on the table and it slid into my friend's cup and made a loud thud. It awkwardly interupted our conversation and it was quite innappropriate. She didn't even say anything. No "Thanks", no "I'll take that when you're ready." She just slammed it down on the table when she was walking past.  Not sure where all the negative behavior was coming from. Needless to say, we ended up leaving a $1 tip and will definitely not be returning there anytime soon.
