How have I not written about this place yet? I went a few weeks ago and the experience was amazing. I still need to go back and try the noodles but boyfriend and I split three sandwiches... the CHURROS are AMAZING!!!! :] We had the Ahodaga [Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions.] the Pepito [Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos.] and the Pibil [wood-roasted suckling pig with achiote, black beans, pickled onion, habanero salsa] The shortribs were my personal favorite :] Yeah. Def get the churros :] They held on to our churros til we were done with our meal and they gave them to us warm :] LOVE RICK!!!!
