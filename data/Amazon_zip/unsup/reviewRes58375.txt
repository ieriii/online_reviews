Dont book this place for a group.We reserved a private room for 20 people.As part of the contract we had the restaurant include our meal as well as unlimited drinks from the bar for 3 hours. After an hour and a half the 20 of us had only been served a total of 43 drinks and were cut off for being disruptive and 'overserved'. The problem was we were then charged for not meeting our minium bar tab, the manger at the time felt the need to come in and and be agressive to us all for no reason. When we asked about this policy wer were asked to leave the restaurant. Food was ok, there was only 1 server for the 20 of us who also doubles as the bus boy. Although he worked very hard the service provided by the rest of the staff was as poor as I have received. In a city with so many other options, dont waste your time here as surely there are better places to get together. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE, TERRIBLE.
