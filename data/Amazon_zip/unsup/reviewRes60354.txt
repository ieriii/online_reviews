I'm going to have to agree with @Jeff on this one, I ordered 2 shakes and 2 slices of cheese & sausage pizzas. Well needless to say im really surprised about all the positive reviews, to begin the crust on the pizza was soo 'crackery' by that i mean pretty much it was alot like eating a thick saltine cracker it would break apart easily i think most-likely has to do with the dough they use to make it. Next the pizza itself had very little to almost no sauce and a mountain of cheese... I mean don't get me wrong i love cheese but this portion was enough to elevate ones cholesterol sky high, needless to say i really like there decor and all however i don't understand why they make there customers wait almost half an hour for some reheated pizza? As for the milkshake it was nothing special plus wayy too thick i could've had a better one from McDonalds or Wendy's... This place is really not worth the hype unless you like over paying for a slice of reheated pizza, can't speak for the rest of there menu items since i haven't tried it, however my first visit really didn't impress me.
