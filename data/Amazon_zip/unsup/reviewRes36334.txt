Indie Cafe had solid 4-star potential, but gets bumped for a few reasons. First and foremost, this restaurant is NO LONGER BYOB. They do have an alcohol menu and will charge $5 for corkage. That's not really a star-subtractor, just a note. They do lose a star for the hourlong wait for sushi. Both the waitress and manager apologized to us for the delay, which was good-- but neither offered something to tide us over until the sushi eventually came, as they should have. The fish was solid if unspectacular, suffering the oversauced fate of so much Chicago sushi. Best was the eponymous crocodile roll, with an excellently heated piece of fresh eel. Other offerings were good, but inessential. I also have to ding Indie for undercooked edamame. On the whole however, I think this restaurant deserves its solid reputation and large crowds on a Friday night. If I lived in the neighborhood I would certainly come back.
