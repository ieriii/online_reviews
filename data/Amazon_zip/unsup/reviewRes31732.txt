I've been a big fan of this place for brunch, great seasonal egg dishes and such, friendly service, good coffee. We went there the other day for their new dinner menu and had a great experience; my wife had a walleye special with succotash and I had crispy fried quail.  Both were exquisite, and my plate came out with not one quail but two perched on top of delectable biscuits and pickled vegetables. The food is unfailingly interesting, fresh, and flavorful.  They could definitely give Nightwood up the street a run for their money.
