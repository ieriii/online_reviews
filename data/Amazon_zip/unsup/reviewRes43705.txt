this will always have a 5 star rating in my heart because i took the love of my life here for our first date. i don't remember what i got for food, but i remember the date being like an interview, where i was approached with, "so....tell me about yourself." anyways - food was great and it's a cool atmosphere. it is an operational manager's dream, the way they have you order your food in line and then seat you as soon as you complete your order. short wait for food as well.
