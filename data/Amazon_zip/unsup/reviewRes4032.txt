If you are debating as to whether or not to come here, definitely (attempt to) make the reservation. I would return here in a heartbeat over a place like Alinea or even Bonsoiree (another world class BYOB). Not only because the food was better, truly, soulfully better; but also because of the friendly, laid back (yet consummate) service and potentially (probably) stoned out atmosphere.  When is the last time you've eaten innovative and flavorfully explosive gourmet food to the sounds of not only Redman, but also Helmet? If you want to tell people you've been to Alinea, go to Alinea. If you want to have a great time and possibly the best meal of your life, go to Schwa. Also, don't forget to bring a little something to drink for the kitchen. They are likely to return the favor during the course of the meal.
