If I could only eat at one place every time I visit Chicago, Sansoogapsan would be it. Why is this place worthy of five stars? 1) It is open ridiculously late (5am?) 2) It is down the street from a Korean karaoke place (!!!)....which means you can get wasted (or not) and sing karaoke all night long w/ your friends and then head over to SSGS for the obligatory post-performance, late-night gorging. There are lots of tables sized for a large group (you get to sit behind a screen, take off your shoes, and sit on the floor in some of them!) 3) SOO many little banchan dishes! 4) Never had a bad dish there...stone-pot bibimbop, bulgogi, kalbi, galbitang (beef rib soup), chapchae, all tasty and heart warming....but most of all... 5)They have the best seafood soondubu (SPICY tofu casserole, good seafood flavor base, not at all watery tasting) I have ever had in my life....maybe my view is skewed b/c this is where I had my soondubu-cherry popped. The first cut is the deepest....baby, I know. My friend tells me that SSGS has become more popular these days, so the service is a little more friendly to the non-Korean speakers than it used to be. Still helps to have someone in your party to participate in some Korean banter. EDIT: My mistake, the karaoke place is actually not next door....but it's down the street. Close enough for an all-out Korean Night.
