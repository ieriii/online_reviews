If you like Belgian beer you will like this place - not much dark craft beer though. All in all - awesome beer selection and good vibe. The fries are tasty if you are looking for a snack and the menu is not your typical "bar" food. Nice spot for dinner. Man it gets crowded though - I guess all the good spots do.
