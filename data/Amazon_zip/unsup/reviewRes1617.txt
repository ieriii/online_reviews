After hearing so many good things and seeing it on the Food Network, I figured it was time I try Hot Doug's. I guess 100 other people had that same thought that Saturday afternoon. We had to wait in line for 1 hour and 45 minutes for these friggin hot dogs! And just our luck it was about 18 degrees that day! We trekked our booties all the way to Avondale just for these hot dogs so we had no choice but to wait in this ridiculously long line. My toes were frozen and I really, really, really do not think I'll ever do something that dumb again. When we finally made it through the double doors, I was so delerious, I didn't even know where to start. There were so many different hot dogs to choose from and the menu had all kinds of celebrity specialites. But ok seriously . . . about the dogs. They do mean serious business when it comes to their encased meats. The hot dogs are creative, gourmet, and delicious. They come in all kinds of different flavors with all different kinds of combinations of spices, cheeses, and various ingredients. If I were to just rate the hot dogs, I would definitely give them a 5. However, my overall experience waiting in the freezing cold- birngs it down a couple notches. Come on I'm a California girl and I do not like standing outside in freezing temps. . .no matter how good the hot dogs really are.
