I think what it comes down to is that I do not like deep dish style pizza. The place was clean, the staff friendly, and apps tasty. The concept of the pizza just seems retarded. Why not just take a block of cheese and paste a flakey crust to it and spill a dash of sauce and call it deep dish? Again, no complaints about the place itself, i just can't say i enjoyed the flagship product.
