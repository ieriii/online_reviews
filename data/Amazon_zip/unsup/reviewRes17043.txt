As far as south asian aka "desi" food in Chicago goes, this place is the stinkers :( The food quality is sub par, the service is aggressively bad, and the environment is ugly. Not to mention it's like a furnace in there...literally! So much that I was actually glad to be out in the cold once I got outta there! Yeah, avoid it like a plague ppl!
