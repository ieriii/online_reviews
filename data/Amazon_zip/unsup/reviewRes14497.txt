I really wish this place was closer to home cuz the food is awesome here! I drove out here a few months ago after reading all the reviews and was definitele not disappointed! I ordered the lechon sandwich which was full of juicy shredded roast pork with grilled onions and sweet plaintains..soooo delicious. Decided to try a couple of empanadas.. one with meat, which was very good. But the goat cheese empanadas... I LOVED it! I'm such a cheese lover, so maybe that's why I liked it so much. Ordered a side of sweet plaintains and washed everything down with a refreshing mango shake! Definitely a place I would come back to over and over again!
