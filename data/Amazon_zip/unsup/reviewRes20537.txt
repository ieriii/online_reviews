Scotch egg! Such a fun treat you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. If I returned for drinks I would order it up at the bar - delicious. It was nice to be paid a visit by a sommelier in a restaurant with a bar atmosphere. They have quartinos -good deal for 2 to share. Entrees are pricey, so I was glad the service was good. Friendly wait staff and host whose priority was to keep us happy. Lively crowd at the bar, so request downstairs seating if you're looking for a quieter meal.
