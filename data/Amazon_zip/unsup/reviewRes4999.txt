You'll be happy if you go. Trust me.  FOOD: Modern, reasonably priced, interesting without being weird. (Pig's ear with kale, pork chop with 'nduja). SERVICE: Excellent, friendly. They have a cocktail service for the waiting area, which is big and outside but still tucked away - great setup, best I've seen in Chicago. We only waited about 30-40 minutes around 8pm on a Friday night, and it flew by. AMBIANCE: Not overly hip, but a cool place. Dylan-Jimi-Zeppelin-Bowie type music, fairly noisy. You might get put at the family-style bar-type seating, which some people don't like. It's tight inside, but not uncomfortable. It's European-feeling. We stayed in Chicago for a four-day weekend and went to a bunch of restaurants - this was the best all-around dinner spot we found. Highly recommend.
