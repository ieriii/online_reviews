I'm kind of a non-practicing vegan. I can see how this place could be intimidating. Imitation meat products can be scary. The vegan reuben is heavenly. I want to swim in their thousand island dressing. The vegan nachos are good, although the "cheese" is a little strange and... liquidy. 3 bean chili is yummy and satisfying. Dessert. I love you, dessert. The carrot cake was suggested by our server last time I was here (which is very often) and was heavenly. The frosting was delicious and the cake was moist and had raisins (yum) in it. Milkshakes are also awesome, and the cookie dough-y peanut butter-y cake thing is good too. Anywho, I say... come here with an open mind if you are not a vegetarian. Don't expect meat. It's not. But they do a damn good job without it.
