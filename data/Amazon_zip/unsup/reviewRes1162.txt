When you're but a novice, you get the caviar duck liver bacon brat or the Thai African elk dog with Pop Rocks, or whatever is like $7, and you will fucking love it. And you get a corn dog on the side. When you're settling in and really getting to know Doug's still, you get a simple char dog or a polish. And you get a corn dog on the side. When you know better and you are wise from experience, you just get two corn dogs. The corn dogs are like....like if a cake doughnut felated the best hot dog ever, maybe? Kind of like that. But the one thing everyone knows - everyone knows - you get the fries. Stupid long lines. Weird-ass hours. Cheap delights. But still cash only - boo that!
