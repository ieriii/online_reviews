Decided this would be the place to celebrate a friend's birthday this past Saturday evening.  We called for a reservation and they told us they had nothing open for a party of 6 until 10PM...we took it. We showed up @ 9 to have a couple of drinks @ their bar. The bar area was really nice and spacious as there were many people trying to get drinks. Pretty creative drink list...I originally went with the Victoria's Secret (Svedka Raspberry vodka, cranberry juice, limonada, ginger soda) and then an Alegria (Svedka Clementine vodka, pineapple juice, limonada,cilantro, ginger). The latin guy behind the bar was working his ass off by turning drinks out at a rapid pace. I told him he was doing a great job and he told me he was tired of making mojitos. While drinking we asked for a buzzer and were told we can't get one until our whole group was there. Luckily 5 of us had made it by 10. We started with the Ceviche tasting (all five for $29)...the Shrimp ceviche was the best by far. For my meal, I thought the Pernil would be the best option. The Pernil is Rum glazed pork shoulder, fried plantains Puerto Rican rice and beans. The was a really good meal..I could taste the rum in the pork...really good flavor!!! It needed to be good because we had a nice wait for our food. Great pics on all of the walls as they even had some provocative pics in certain areas...one in particular is one with a woman exposing her chest (funny that a kid was sitting in the area). We were done around midnight and were looking for somewhere else to have a drink. We decided to go to the Tasting Room, but thanks to the yelp phone app we found out they closed @ midnight. We said hey the bar is still open here, so lets just go back in. We wound up closing the joint. Good times @ Carnivale
