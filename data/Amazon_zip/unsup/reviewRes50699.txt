A handful of times my folks and I ate here. Rooster art in abundance here and very sharp service from the door to the door. The french toast is extra special with its crispy breading cover and the homestyle diced potatoes to a slight crisp are flavorful. Servcie is prompt (coffee is always) warm and very tip worthy.
