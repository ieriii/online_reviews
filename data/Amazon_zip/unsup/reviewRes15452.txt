I appreciate a good brew company and the beers they brew. I'm also glad that Logan Square has a place like this but my problem with most brew companies is that they are too into their own beers and other crafted bottle beers that they forget about the drinkers that just want a good 'ol bottle of Bud, Schlitz, High Life or Coors. They did have PBR but it was room temp, kind of a big let down! I understand the reason for going to a brew pub is to have crafted beer but sometimes it's too heavy and you cant drink it all night so thats why you need some normal beer offerings. I will say the food was the better of this place. Mussels were good, burgers were great, pizza was thin and crust was crunchy and the popcorn is just mean. First take popcorn which by itself is addictive and then toss in bacon and cheese. I could not stop eating it, I almost had to just throw it on the floor to stop myself from devouring it. I do agree with some other comments about the popcorn not being the best but top anything with bacon and cheese and it probably gets eaten. So if you really like crafted beers then this place is for you but I think i will stick to just eating there then head over to Cody's to get my drinking fix.
