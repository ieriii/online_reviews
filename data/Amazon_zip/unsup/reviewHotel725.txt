Location, location, location, this place has it. Right across the street form the John Hancock tower and right on the magnificent mile. An ideal location if your looking to shop! The actual rooms were pretty average, nothing to rave about; stayed in a 2 queen bed room. The door knob on the bathroom door actually came off, so we'd have to be very careful using the door or we'd pull off the knob every time. The rooms didn't look old, but not new either. When we checked in late at night there was no one at the desk to help us. We waited for a quite a while, we were all pretty exhausted from a long flight and just wanted to sleep, not very pleasant. I just give this hotel an avg rating, if not for the location I would have downgraded the place to a 2 star rating. Oh and the price wasn't horrendous either, we had a 3 night for the price of 2 deal through spg which made it bearable.
