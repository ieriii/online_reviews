Yummy, yummy in my tummy! This place was so good! Not to mention they have the most delicious, crisp Sauvignon Blanc I have tasted to date. I love my white wine! I felt like I was in cape cod while sitting in the dining room, it doesnt really resemble a BBQ joint, but no complaints here I liked the decor. For the food, we started off with the hush puppies, obviously, and they were so stinkin good. I usually dont like hush puppies, but then again, I've never had them with Jalapenos and Cheddar and that delicious dipping sauce. I ate 2.5 of those puppies! Seriously good. For my main, I had the Smoked Salmon and beet salad. The salad was soo fresh tasting. They diced it up for you, so that was nice, and the beets were sliced very thinly. They had the nerve to ask if the maple dressing would be ok, are you kidding, of course it will be! I also tried, the pulled brisket and that was seriously out of this world...especially with that spicy BBQ dipping sauce. The pulled pork just might have pulled ahead of the brisket as it was just cooked so perfectly! It pretty much melted in my mouth. And, we obvi, couldnt pass up the Mac 'n Cheese, I just polished it off as my lunch and it was just as cheesy, crunchy and delicious as it was last night! How could I forget about the pickles until the end of my review!? Those pickles! I had them box them up for me, I dont care how cheap it looked, I couldnt stop eating them and I knew I would want more today! Good thinking on my part! If you havent been, definitely go! I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, but this place definitely impressed. The service was top notch as well. The patio would be fun in the summer as well!
