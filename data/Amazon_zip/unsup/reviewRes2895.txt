I came here for New Years Eve '08 and overall was a tad disappointed in the whole "experience." I'd give the Thyme Infused Martini 5 stars! and that is really the only thing I'd go back for. The food was good, but it didn't blow me away. Perhaps after reading all the reviews I knew too much going in. At times I felt like I was in an episode of gossip girls. Overall, as a person that loves good food and a great dining out experience, I felt it was too much money to spend on one night for what we got, and I wasn't even the one paying.
