OK. Get ready for a totally biased review. I give EL MILAGRO 5 stars here on my review because that is all they let me post. I am going to say that El Milagro tacos, tamales, tortillas, chips and so on are the best, BEST not only in the Pilsen neighborhood, but all over the U.S.!! Why do I say this? Because like I said at the beginning, this is going to be a totally biased review. An unashamedly biased review. You see, El Milagro taquerias, and tortillerias was founded by my late uncle, and Godfather , Senior "Raul Lopez". The company is now run by my cousins. My Aunt " Linda Lopez" is still alive but she is retired. She still helps run the company though. I remember being in my uncles home in Pilsen in the 1970's and he would ask me and my siblings if we were hungry? He would have my cousins or my Aunt call down to the restaurant that was on the first floor, and still is, and have them send up whatever amount of tacos. If you think the tacos are huge now, let me tell you that they were GIGANTIC back in the day! Ok? It was like eating a beefsteak football! no joke. Well, I highly, HIGHLY reccommend you go to any EL MILAGRO restaurant and consume everything on the menu. I also recommend you try all of their tortillas, chips, and visit all of their family run stores.
