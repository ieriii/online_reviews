Best subs in Lakeview! Monstrous and size and an incredible deal. I am not a deep-dish fanatic but they serve great pizza here too. Tough to park and you gotta make way for the laws and firemen, etc., but a very well run business and the menu is solid top to bottom, anything you order is guaranteed to be top quality.
