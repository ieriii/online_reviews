First of all tne name is SAN SOO KAB SAN. We had lunch there on Dec, 12. 2011 . I wouldn't advise anyone to go there, it is filthy, everything is not cleaned , and at the last moments of the meal we were visited by a cockroach on our table. When we cried, they just came killed the cockroach with a napkin and said they were sorry. Thats it, go and enjoy ..
