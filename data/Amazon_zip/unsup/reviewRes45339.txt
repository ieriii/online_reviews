Came across Wilde by looking through Yelp Mobile while at the Lakeview Art Festival. My husband and I along with two friends were looking for a place to eat nearby. My friend is a very picky eater so when I saw Mac and Cheese on their menu, I knew she'd be ok with this place. I got the Fish and Chips and you'd think it'd be good because it's an Irish restaurant but it's one of the worst I've had. My friend enjoyed her Mac and Cheese while my husband devoured the Wilde Burger and his friend ate most of his buffalo chicken sandwich. I guess I'm the only one that didn't enjoy their meal so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars because 3 out of the 4 people in my group likes their food.
