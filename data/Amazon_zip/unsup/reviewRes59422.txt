Pizza was good. Service was really poor. I went in tonight with my wife, sister in law and my 2 yr old. Just flew in from SF. It was raining. I get in and I see the hostess and the first thing she says is "fold the stroller". No hi, welcome, come on in. Just " fold the stroller". Rude. The hostess here literally walk around trying to look busy. Losers. Pizza ok, service crap. And we had to ask 3 different bus boys to refill our root beer cause our waitress was never around. Poor reflection on our first restaurant in Chi Town.
