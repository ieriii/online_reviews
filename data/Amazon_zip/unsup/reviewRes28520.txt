After a hiatus of many months I was back at Graham Elliot on Monday. Monday is questionable at some restaurants: frequently the A-Team takes that night off, but Chef Bowles was there and the food was as spectacular as it was whimsical. Deconstructed Caesar salad was visually stunning and really tasty. The scallops were first rate: fresh and not overcooked or over "handled", the usual flaws I find with scallops. The braise was equally compelling: a perfect balance of savory and just a hint of natural sweetness. Dessert was worth the calories. Service was perfect. I Highly recommend G.E. for a fun and delicious meal that you won't readily be cooking at home.
