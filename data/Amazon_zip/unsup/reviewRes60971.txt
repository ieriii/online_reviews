I have given this place one star because I'm forced to give some sort of star rating. I had been to The Fifty/50 several times before and always had an alright time and decent service. After my last visit though, I will not be returning. I was there on a Friday night with a group of friends. We had bottle service to secure the tables so were there for a while and spent a lot of money. The service was not great all night but it was good enough for a night at a bar and we had a good time for most of the night. When it came time to close out our tab, my husband was informed that the waitress had lost our credit card. Annoying. Further though, the bar's manager was kind of arrogant about it which really was not appreciated. Had the bad experience ended there, I probably wouldn't have bothered writing a bad review. Unfortunately the manager of the bar had the nerve to re-approach our table and accuse us of stealing the iphone of an obnoxious drunk girl at the table next to us (who probably just left it in the bathroom or something). I let him know that no one at my table would do something like that and he left. He returned a few moments later to inform us that they would be pulling the surveillance tapes to confirm our story. WOW, now I'm not just annoyed but offended. I wish he would have offered to pull those tapes to see where the dumb waitress had misplaced our credit card. Bottom line...service is weak, the management staff is worse, and there are far better places to spend your money in Chicago. I will not be back.
