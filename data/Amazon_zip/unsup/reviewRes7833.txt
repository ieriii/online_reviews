I am a fan, of meat and Fogo de Chao. Here is my bulleted review. 1. Not a romantic date spot, it's busy, fun and great for groups. Also, might be OK for veggies, the salad bar is awesome, fresh and all you can eat! 2. Wait times are long, especially on the weekends, we had to wait 40 minutes for our reservation, which seemed odd, but then again, once we sat down, we were in no hurry to leave ourselves. 3. Meat is quite tasty, the servers are all quick and very accommodating if you want rare or well done! They were also great at sending over anything you asked for. 4. Last but not least, the thought of being "uncomfortably" happy. I walked out stuffed. Was it a great meal, yes, but the after-effects suck. My advice, go for lunch as you get all the same bang for your buck for half the price, then you won't gorge so bad ;)
