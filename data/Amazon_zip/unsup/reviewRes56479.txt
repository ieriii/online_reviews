BEST PLACE EVER. I absolutely love this place. My family and I are big Rick Bayless fans so we just had to try this. We were forced to schedule our 2 month in advance reservations after we found out we had to wait 3 hours to be seated one Friday evening. After much anticipation the day finally arrived for a dinner for 4 at Frontera. The waiter was very attentive and the atmosphere was very lively. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact names of the items we ordered, but I do remember their main components. Anyway -we began by ordering 2 appetizers: the Sopas and Tamales. They were amazing and I could not get enough! We also ordered drinks. My sister ordered some type of jamaica juice and I ordered a tequila cucumber (some type of margarita): both were delicious! I could have had 10 more if I wasn't driving. Lucky for us our main course came. I ordered the steak with plantains, my boyfriend ordered another steak dish with tamales, my sister ordered a shrimp dish, and our friend ordered the salmon. The meals were delicious! Finally, for dessert we ordered the two flans, an empanada plate, and homemade ice cream with caramel. My favorite was the ice cream it was scrumptious! I always recommend this place to everyone I know. I absolutely love this place. It beats other downtown restaurants like Rumba.
