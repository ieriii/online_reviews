I have always noticed this place each time I visit Artopolis....I would never see that many people over there and so I always thought it probably wasn't that good....that it was just another cute looking restaurant with not so good eats. Walking in, the place looks cute. I ordered the eggs with potatoes which are AMAZING and they give you a ton of 'em too. The eggs were ok, but I had asked for cheese and they had just thrown down a slice of cheese on top (at least it was melted). I was kind of hoping they had shredded cheese. The complimentary apricot jam is delicious! What's a breakfast spot without some good coffee? They serve one of my favorites....Lavazza! (The only coffee I can drink black) I will definitely be back to Meli!
