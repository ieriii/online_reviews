Update: I have been here three times in the last month and still love RB. Get the mussels. Just do it! I really loved Revolution Brewery. I came here for a special lady's birthday gathering, and we had tons of laughs and delicious food. Fantastic. I have a general rule of not going to restaurants that don't take reservations. I hate waiting... especially if I'm hungry! However, we only had to wait a short bit to get seated, which was good because I was starving. I wasn't too excited about the bacon fat popcorn, until it got to our table. It is delicious combination of salty, smokey, buttery and crunchy bliss. If it wasn't so damaging to the hips, I would have eaten the whole bowl. If you're going to choose a salad, the goat cheese croquette is the way to go. Two generous pieces of creamy delicious goat cheese topped a bed of baby arugula, slices of apples and candied walnuts. The serving size is definitely shareable by two people and it makes you feel like you are eating something healthy. So you can indulge in something bad next! I had their porcini mushroom and goat cheese flatbread pizza. Also a shareable dish, this pizza has a delicious chewy crust that will make you want to have another slice even though you are stuffed. I also had some of Miss B's margherita pizza with roasted garlic, which was very good. Even though Revolution Brewery doesn't take rezzies, I will be back.
