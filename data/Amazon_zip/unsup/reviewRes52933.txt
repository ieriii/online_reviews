BEST CUBAN FOOD out of grandmas kitchen! Love the environment (Music, amazing decor including all kinds of neat old school typewriters and sowing machines) And service was EXTRAORDINARY! It looks like whoever put this place together knew exactly what they were doing! Will be back! Tomorrow! like the owner mentioned on the way out! The Food is to die for! Simply amazing! Love the empanadas! ESPECIALLY the Guava and Cheese!!!!! But the Masas De Puerco took the cake on this one! TOO GOOD!!!!!! Great staff who will bend over backwards even if your not at their table!!!!! OH! and did i mention ... BYOB!!!!!! stop at CVS on ur way in! MOJITOS!!!!!!!! THE BEST! Love 90 Miles Cuban Cafe!
