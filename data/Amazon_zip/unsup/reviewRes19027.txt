Many people spoke to the long lines, we had no issues with lines or getting a table. Definitely get the chips and guacamole! So you aren't surprised a Torta is a baked sandwich. I had the Ahogada Torta: pork carnitas, black beans sandwich which is served in a bowl with tomato broth & spicy arbol chile sauce. Fantastic! My son had the Pepito which he loved and my daughter had the Chipotle Chicken which lacked some flavor. A little on the pricey side for 4 sandwiches and drinks ($90).
