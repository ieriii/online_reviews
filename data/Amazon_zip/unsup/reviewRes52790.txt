Fun, fun, fun! It was like a little - - I'd say Key West - - oasis in the middle of the city. Colorful, eclectic corner with blasts of pink, orange, turquoise, blue, yellow... The menu was the usual Cuban options which are what we want. The side order of yuca con mojo de ajo. (I know I missed that spanish - - yuca with garlic) was a great side dish. Also, the simple plate of avocado with a slight drizzle of oil and some onion slices was perfect as a starter on a warm summer night. Yes, BYOB was perfect and saves a few $$$. We made a reservation through Open Table and I'm glad we did. I saw all the reviews and thought better safe than sorry. We sat immediately on a saturday night but when we left at 8, I overheard there was over an hour wait for an outside table.
