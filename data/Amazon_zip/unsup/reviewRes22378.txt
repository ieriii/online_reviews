Twas my birthday. I wanted to have a family dinner...and my pops really only eats Chinese food [cuz ya know, we Chinese]. I got to talking to myself.. Me: So where oh where could I take the fam? Me: Umm..Chinatown. Me: Oh, okay...but where? Me: Where else? Tony Hu has taken over, so anywhere you go it's gonna be a Lao restaurant. Me: Good point, Me. Pops likes the spice, so let's go to Sze Chuan. ______________ So I busted out the smartphone and OpenTable app to make a reservation for 8 people. Done deal. ...until we got there. No reservation on file. Ouch. Server and manager[?] didn't understand that we had a reservation after repeated attempts in English, Cantonese, or Mandarin. Ouch. Party of 8 seated at the entrance...when there was an empty table in a different corner of the restaurant. Lame. But hey, that didn't stop us from enjoying the food. We ordered a lot of food...and ate it all. A few words of caution: the food is spicy. While eating, you'll feel like Buster Poindexter singing "Hot, hot hot!" You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu...but here are some Chinese Dad approved items: ---Dry chili chicken (think spicy popcorn chicken) ---Mongolian beef (a traditional approach to the American favorite) ---Salt and pepper squid I can tell when my dad is enjoying himself at a restaurant because he can't stop talking about his next visit to the restaurant. The funny thing is that on the way to Lao Sze Chuan, he was kinda downplaying the place. I guess I found a new Chinatown spot for him!
