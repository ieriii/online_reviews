I like Gino's deep dish pizza! we had some guests from texas that were looking for something good, local and filling. Since we were in the area, I thought this place fitted the bill. We ordered bread sticks, deep-dish crumbled sausage and Canadian bacon pizza and deep-dish peperoni (both large size). The service is good and the waiters are mostly friendly. I would go back if I am very hungry and in the area.
