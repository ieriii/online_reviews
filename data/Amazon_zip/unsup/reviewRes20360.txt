I'm a sushi fanatic and have tried a lot of different places that Chicago has the offer. Coast is of one the few places that I keep going back. The freshness of the sushi combined with the creativity of the chef is what keeps me coming back. A must try there is the Angry Salmon! There might be a wait for a table, especially on a weekend, but thats okay! Because this place is BYOB, and they allow you to open your bottle while waiting for your table.
