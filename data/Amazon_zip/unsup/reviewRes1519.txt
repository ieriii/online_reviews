I simply cannot put into words what a fine institution and emporium of encased meats this modest restaurant has become. I've stood outside when it's -5F and when it's 100F, in lines that wrapped halfway down the block. I've taken every one of my friends from out of town and I will continue to do so. Doug is a culinary genius and a hell of a nice guy to boot. Hint for vegetarians: order the Pete Shelley / Steve Diggle / Howard Devoto / Buzzcocks-themed veggie dog with any of the toppings off the specialty dogs. Doug wholeheartedly approves anytime my special lady or any of our vegetarian friends order in this manner. For carnivores, you can't go wrong with the weekly specials or game and go for the duck fat fries (Pommes de terre frites au gras de canard, Je pense ... Mon francais est tres mauvais). That plus a bottle of the spicy ginger ale (in winter) or a Green River (in summer) and you've got a fine meal. A few things to consider: this establishment takes cash and cash only, there is only one high chair for young whelps - only one by design, you will get stuck behind some jackass hipster who thinks he's funnier than Doug that holds up the line for half an hour & seating can be awfully tight at times. Don't panic - there are a billion ATMs nearby, rarely are there more than 2 kids at most inside, Doug's banter helps regulate the flow into/out of the restaurant and the food is always, always worth it. Turns out there aren't any finer words in the English language than "encased meats", my friends.
