Nice place to have a beer. V comfortable, no TVs, jazz music. Not pretentious either. If I was woody allen, I would write a screenplay about me going back in time and hanging out here w/ chicagoans from the 50s.  Or at least whip out my clarinet and play some gnarly dixieland licks. I was here Xmas day so I'm sure it was a little different visa v a normal day. For 1, it wasn't crowded. I heard sometimes this place is more crowded than Marvin. For numb 2, there was no food. Which was fine (not starvin). Anyway, if I ordered fries and was told they were frites it would've ruined the experience a little bit.  I highly recommend this place for me. I plan on going back soon.
