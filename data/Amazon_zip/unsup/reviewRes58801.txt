I've been going to Opart for at least six years since I'd moved near the restaurant. The interiors for a neighborhood restaurant are beautiful and authentic and I also love the femmie waiters! I know that's not PC but they are so interesting and nice! The one thing I love is the Shrimp Tom Yum soup. I always order a cup of brown rice to tone down the spice but I find the chinese food on the menu to mediocre and bland, however they do good thai! My advice is only order thai and you won't be disappointed, but veggies in boring gravy, forget about it! Curries, yes! Oh yes and it's BYOB so that's cool too!
