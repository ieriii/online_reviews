I was excited to check this place out and really wanted to like this place.. but I just wasn't that impressed. Came here at 9pm on a Thursday night for food and drinks. It was packed so it looked promising. We waited outside for 20 min for a table... but I not sure it would've been worth it to wait longer than that on a busy Fri or Sat.  The place was nice... although our table was awkwardly place so that people waiting around to be seated or just having drinks were constantly bumping and elbowing me while we were eating... I understand that it was crowded but still... The beers were good. Good selection of brews and bottles and not too pricey.  Our server was nice and attentive.  The bacon fat popcorn is good and probably the highlight of the night. Goes well with a cold beer. Slightly more greasy and salty than I would like it but my friend ate every single morsel of it! Upon recommendation from the server we split the pulled pork sandwich. Which to our disappointed was flavorless and very dry and probably the worse pulled pork I've had in Chicago.  Decent place to grab a drink with friends. I'm willing their food another try but I'm in no hurry to return.
