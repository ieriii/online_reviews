I can't claim expertise in Italian cuisine, but the food in this place really reminds me of what food was like when I was in Italy a few years ago -- really fresh ingredients, carefully cooked. This time, the appetizer specials were truly special - lightly fried small lake fish (smelts?) that were perfectly crispy and juicy without being greasy, with lemon rind and parsley perfectly, lightly, crunchily fried the same way and thrown into the mix! We also had a zucchini flower stuffed with riccotta, which turned out to be a baby zucchino (is that the singular?) with the flower growing out of it -- so that you got all three flavors and textures in a single bite!
