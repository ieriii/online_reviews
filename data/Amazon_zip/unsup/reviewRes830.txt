Hot Dougs is awesome.  I went today and got there early, around 1030 am, and still waited in a short line. It seemed part of the experience but I'd of waited longer having known what was in store. Doug was behind the counter and took our order. He was polite and actually thanked us for our order. Classy! We saw the Ribeye steak sausage was new today so we ordered one along with an Alsacienne, Italian, Linguica, corn dog, and fries. Everything was outstanding!!!!! Seriously awesome. The Ribeye tasted like steak in tube form and the horseradish sauce on it was perfect. The Linguica with Saffron sauce and Iberico cheese was a flavor punch and very rich. (Recomended by Hot Doug himself when I asked). The Bacon sausage aka Alsacienee was mild and not nearly as rich as I expected even when topped with a mild blue cheese and Creme Fresh....seriously gourmet and perfect. The corn dog was light and delicious too. Hot Doug's fresh cut fries...not the duck fat variety, were some dam good fries. Not greasy, crispy, well seasoned, and very tasty. I can't wait to get me some duck fat fries next time. Eating for the first time at Hot Dougs just makes we want to return again...heck even tomorrow if I could. This place makes me happy to be overweight. No guilt, only goodness. Thank you Doug for the encased meat Mecca experience. If I could buy stock......l would.
