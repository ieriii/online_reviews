The first mistake I made was getting so excited about Xoco that I accidentally stepped into Frontera Grill first, which was next door; they need clearer signs. The second mistake involved coming on a Saturday at 11:30am, which required a 45+ min wait. But luckily, the next move I made was order the woodland mushroom torta, churros, and almendrado as a take-out order, which took 12 mins. total. Even though the vegetarian torta and churros were good, the almendrado was waaaay too concentrated for me. Overall, my trek down to Xoco was not worth the series of unfortunate events.
