This is my favorite Mexican Restaurant by far. This is good because I love eating here, but bad because it has plagued every other Mexican food experience I have had since then...I'm always comparing any taco I have to Nuevo Leon's tacos, every bite of guacamole to theirs, every fajilta to theirs....it makes everything else way below par. Everything is amazing here, it's authentic, good quality, and cheap! The queso panela makes my life worth living. The enchiladas are so rich. And the fajitas are extra special, I love their tortillas! Oh AND it is BYOB...what more could anyone want?!
