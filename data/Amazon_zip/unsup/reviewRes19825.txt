It's time I review The Gage. I'm giving 5 stars for the customer service alone. I work close by and there is no better after work drinks and/or dinner loop restaurant. I don't always want a diner and get tired of the bar food scene that seems to dominate the rest of the area. This week alone I have gone twice and spent close to $100 on mostly drinks and some appetizers. Back to the customer service, many times when I walk in I feel like such a regular, I am always greeted warmly and within the first half hour at least one of the managers and usually the owner will stop by my table to welcome and check on us. This really goes a long way in building my loyalty. I like that the menu has more exotic spins on traditional dishes, such as the poutine with elk ragout or the scotch egg. I may not try everything on the menu but it is nice to know it's there. I also enjoy the comfort food dishes like fish and chips, crisp potatoes and brie, fried zucchini and the gage burger. Specialty Drinks- OK so the 5 stars is also given because of their wide selection of seasonal specialty drinks. Right now I am in love with the Cherry Lime Ricky and Sullivan's Elixir. These two are made with gin and the perfect spring cocktail. I dread the day I will no longer be working within a block of The Gage. That won't stop me from still visiting 1-2 times a week just to continue my friendship with them.
