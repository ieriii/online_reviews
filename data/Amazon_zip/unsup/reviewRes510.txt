Alinea is amazing, awesome, astounding, architectural... I am a Grant Achatz groupie for life now. As much of a luxury as it was, once in a lifetime does not feel like enough. While Alinea is sumptuous it also feels familiar and comforting and I just want more! The whole whimsical experience is equal parts visual and gustative. Truly a unique experience that provides a reminder about how much fun food and especially eating can be.
