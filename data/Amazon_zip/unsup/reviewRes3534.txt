To quote Rachel Ray I will say "YUMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" to Crisp. We were in the hood going to the theater and I had wanted to try something in the vicinity (aka didn't want to have to re-park). I had seen Crip on Yelp as a hot spot and looked at the reviews a few a weeks ago and off course the extremely appetizing and yes, even mouthwatering photos. I believe a little drool may have even sipped out when I was looking at the wings...gulp. Anyway, we went, we saw and boy did we conquer!  The place is tiny and let me tell you that on a Friday night at 8:15pm it was pretty packed. They have 2 "bar like" seating areas and the rest are family style tables, so there really is no privacy for intimate conversations...aka, not good for first dates.  I have to say that we (the fiance and I) didn't even talk much since we were concentrating on eating almost the whole time. This off course in between, breathing, drinking, licking our fingers and commenting on the deliciousness. We had the Big Buddha bowl with steak (I got both sauces on the side, which was great since it was nice merriment of sweet and spicy) and we also got wings. We did half and half - Spicy BBQ and Seoul. It was all wonderful and the quality was top notch. I have to admit I'm not much of a wing person b/c of 1. I'm REALLY picky, b/c they have to be crisp, and made just right (no slimy, stringy chicken skin 2. I don't like the actual wing, just the drum stick (I don't know why, so don't ask) 2. calories and fat (I know, I know). BUT, that being said...the wings here were just right and with those killer sauces....mmmmm.....I'm still licking the leftover sauce from my fingers...ok, not really. GO here and you won't be dissapointed...all these great reviews don't lie! The staff is friendly, efficient and give good suggestions (as they did for us).
