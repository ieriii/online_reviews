can everyone PLEASE stop it with the kumas comparison in every restaurant that sells a burger? i'm pretty sure "the lockdown" is not interested in competing with kumas corner.  the location is ideal, especially after watching 4 japanese bands across the street.  you can get food until 1am, which is GREAT. the burgers are fairly priced-around $9 & come with fries. i had the punk bitch, which was prosciutto, swiss & mustard cream sauce & my hubs had the one with kimchee & fried egg. both were massive & tasty. what really makes this place is the dozen+ plasma tvs with concerts. you can see them from any single seat in this little bar. we watched alice in chains unplugged & ended up staying 30 minutes longer because they showed the entire jimi hendrix set from woodstock-the rare footage i had not seen before. and the manager bought us drinks, which almost never happens anywhere i eat. friendly service, nice atmosphere-small but spacious. i'm sure i will be back. especially for the concerts.
