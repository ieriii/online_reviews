Best hotel I've ever stayed at. It's certainly not the most expensive, but it is the best in terms of service, amenities, and location. The lobby is smaller, but it is very stylish, elegant, and well-kept. J-bar (the hotel bar) offers great Grey Goose cocktails at reasonable prices. The decor of the rooms is super modern, elegant, and comfortable. The beds are piled with plush pillows and super soft bleach white cotton sheets and duvet covers which must be 600 thread count (yes! no crusty bed spreads! all cotton!). The service and amenities are phenomenal. Room service is super fast. If you ask for towels at 3 in the morning, someone will be there in a few minutes. Details such as free New York Times newspapers, free office center usage (including a flat-screen Mac computer), free late check in, free access to the equally stylish gym, robes, and free top of the line toiletries that you find at Neiman Marcus is what sets this hotel apart from the others. There is a chef concierge and a entertainment concierge. Enough said. They are more than willing to figure out your likes and dislikes to find out the best places for you. They make last minute reservations for you at places where most people have to wait two weeks to get in. I stayed at this hotel on NYE for only 150 for a standard. The room was spacious and had a nice office nook, a sexy red patent leather recliner chair, and a bar that boasted patron, grey goose, etc, with a lot of counter space. The marble bathrooms provide superb luxury. The downfall: the only mirror is in the bathroom, which makes it hard for a bunch of girls to get ready. Lighting could be better. Parking is 50 for valet or you're on your own with the public garage that charges you 17 dollars for the first 1/2 hour.
