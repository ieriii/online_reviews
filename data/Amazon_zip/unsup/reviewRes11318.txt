Prepare yourself for a long wait, but it's totally worth it. Once seated, the waitstaff was very friendly and it didn't take long to get our food. I had a sweet potato breakfast burrito that is definitely on my list of top 10 things ever eaten. The portions were huge so I was able to make 2 meals out of it.
