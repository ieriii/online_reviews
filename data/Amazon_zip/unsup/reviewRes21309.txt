A Chicago staple! I spent most of my childhood just down the street from Superdawg and never started going here til I moved away...what a huge regret! The still cannot get over how juicy the hot dogs are and served on a bed of delicious fries! Everything else I've tried is very good, but a Superdawg is a MUST try! If you want to live to eat your delicious dawg, DO NOT ask for ketchup on that dawg! (Note: you can always ask for ketchup with your fries ;O) if it's that important to you)
