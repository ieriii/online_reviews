A lot of loooong reviews for this restaurant. I'll spare you the heavy reading then: 1. Beautiful interior, you'll feel very classay. 2. Clientele is mixed, tourists, hotel guests, and dressy thirty-somethings 3. Food was very tastey, but expect to get about 2 [small] bites per item if you're sharing with one other person. 4. Very expensive. We paid $13 for three tiny butternut squash dumplings. While they were delicious...they weren't $4.33/each delicious. 5. Sangria = EXCELLENTE. We had the seasonal, which incorporated red wine and peppercorn without being heavy at all. Yum. Go for the interior, stay for the sangria. Pass on the food unless you're ready to spend some bank, oh, or already ate a full meal.
