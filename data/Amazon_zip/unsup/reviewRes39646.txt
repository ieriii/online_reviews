Any restaurant that can make me want to eat the food again right after I stuffed myself is alright in my book! The smells, oh the smells of this place are intoxicating! Be sure to get the bbq...marinated beef and the short ribs are fantastic, and the spicy calamari too. For apps the GIANT seafood pancake is delicious and the fried dumplings are surprisingly tasty. Warning: your food may or may not come out in the order you think it should and the servers are a bit salty but hey, its part of the charm! Did I mention they're open till 5am? Score.
