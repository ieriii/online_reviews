Last New Year's Eve I had drunk waaaay too much the night before. Since we were in Chicago for the holiday, I forced myself to get up and go with my boyfriend to Sun Wah. I had to make the cabbie stop so I could toss my cookies somewhere around Lincoln Park. It was awesome. My point is, there could not have been a more sub-optimal time for me to take in a meal. The Peking Duck meal was absolutely amazing. The amount of food that was garnered from that one carcass was baffling. The fact that this magical feast took place in a cavernous, noisy cafeteria was completely forgiven upon the first bite of expertly cooked duck wrapped in a fluffy, ethereal pancake. I didn't even want to eat. The last thing I wanted to do was eat. Regardless, I was forcing it down my irritated gullet simply because it was so damn delicious. Bravo, Sun Wah.
