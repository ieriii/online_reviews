well.. haven't been in in a while. went in. things went pretty poorly this time, mostly service related but the food was suffering as well. first the waiting in the tent out back. why not just serve us out back? the music. did somebody steal their 13 year old sisters ipod? horrible the girl with the water who reached across my face, across my food and poured me water I really didn't want, while spilling water onto my food. the insufferable 15 minute wait for someone to come get the check and bring us some freaking change. If you want me to loathe you, do this. there are people waiting for a table. I want to leave. you need to ask. you really need to ask. the general demeanor of the staff. stoned, talking to their friends. poor judgment. poor problem solving skills. Poor dressers. Your job is really easy and requires almost no skills, but you do need to be trained a bit. there needs to be something expected of you and a minimum competence you need to demonstrate to keep your jobs. the vegan cheese. undigestible and giving me horrible gas. it adds nothing to the food. oh I forgot to mention that once I got a muffin and there was a piece of metal in it. sorry Diner, I'm taking a long break from you.
