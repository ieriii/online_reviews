Wow, I don't know where to start! I had this place recommended to me by a friend, and the four of us headed out one night in April for my first Indie experience. I LOVE that it's BYOB...bring a couple bottles of wine and you're set for the night (no corkage fee).  For appetizers, they have the most dee-licious crab rangoon I have ever tried! The edamame is also tasty. I tried the Basil chicken thai entree, which is ground spicy chicken w/peppers and onions over rice...absolutely delicious! On another visit I tried the sushi (now..I was very afraid of sushi and was reluctant to try it, but the boyfriend convinced me because he was such a fan of Indie sushi). I had the 'sunny crunchy', which is perfect for a sushi newbie like myself (and plenty filling!) The green tea ice cream is pretty tasty for dessert and served in a martini glass. The presentation of this food is beautiful and the prices are very reasonable. The decor is very trendy and seating is comfortable....I love you, Indie Cafe!!
