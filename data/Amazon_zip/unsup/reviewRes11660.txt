listen up. pizza: 5 stars. their red pizza, pepperoni and giardiniera is so good that its my requested last meal on earth. so good that my friends don't bother asking me where i would prefer to order delivery from, because they know the answer never changes. so good that when i was fat and depressed, i used the piece delivery zone as my apartment hunting boundaries. i can't believe i just admitted that. crowd/ wait: 1 star. sometimes good people watching but mostly, horrendously annoying. do yourself a favor and pay the 3 bucks for delivery, unless you find yourself craving pizza at a time other than after 6 pm any night. service: 4 stars. ive never had anything less than pleasant and attentive, but sometimes things can be slow because of previously mentioned mass of humanity.
