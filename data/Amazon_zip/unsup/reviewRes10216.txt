Tony Priolo has always been one of my favorite chefs in Chicago. His food at Coco Pazzo was always a notch above everything else and defined the standard of great Italian food in Chicago. This was even better. W had the prosciutto e fichi appetizer, mixed grilled seafood. Both excellent. It was hard to pick the pasta because it all sounded good. The server recommended the malefatti. Unbelievable! Whole roasted Orata (which I believe is sea Bream in English) was also excellent. Fresh with the perfect salinity. Also, the wine list had plenty of options in all price ranges. we had Murgo, sparkling wine from Sicily made from a red Grape "nerello Mascalese". Awesome and priced fairly at $40. Besides all the high end stuff, I believe I saw a few bottles at $20 and $28. The garden looked spectacular, although we sat inside. I actually like that there was light inside, just like the restaurants I go to In Italy. You see in Italy, we like to see the people we are dining with, as well as our food! This is definitely going to be a regular place for me. Congratulations to Tony and his crew.
