Delicious and fresh. This is real food. What a find. We were in the city for a few days and lucked out finding this place. Walked in around 5:15 on a Saturday evening and had only a short wait. Ordered at the counter and were then seated. It's a small place so took some tall chairs at the counter. The host was very kind and offered seats away from the AC so the kids wouldn't get cold. Had wine (nice), and guacamole while waiting for our food. I had the pork belly vermicelli - it was excellent. The broth was rich and spicy, the meat tender, simply spiced, and the greens (rocket?) gave a nice earthy contrast to the decadence of the soup. The posole was the special last night - with chicken, summer squash and roasted pumpkin seeds. Asked for it hot and they added lots of jalapeos. Delicious. The kids split the cubana (torta). I didn't get to even try a bite
