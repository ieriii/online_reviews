I have been waiting forever to get encased meats from the Doug. Finally on the coldest day of the year so far, we decided to wait outside for hot dogs. The only thing keeping the review of Hot Doug's from reaching 5 stars is the lack of heating lamps outside for the 20 minute wait. We had a Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and the pheasant sausage with truffle and foie gras. The run down: 1.) The Chicago Dog was good, but standard. If it was just the Chicago dog, the wait would have not paid off. 2.) The duck fat fries were delectible and come in huge portions. These are some bad ass MF's. My first instinct was to grab them and run home where no one could steal them from me. 3.) The big ticket item was the Pheasant Sausage with foie gras and truffle. I can not describe the goodness that is encased pheasant with such rich ingredients other than to say, bring a friend and split it. It is way too good to scarf it by yourself. I feel that had I not had a Chicago dog and split the Pheasant dog, I would have enjoyed it less. All in all a very solid experience. Doug was very friendly. Now that I have had the duck fat fries, I could stand going on a weekday and skipping the line.
