My husband used to live in this building and was a regular, somewhat daily customer. The staff was always so friendly and welcoming to him, and then to me when I started visiting 3rd Coast with him. It's a unique setting with local artwork for sale on the walls, a cozy downstairs atmosphere, and clientele ranging from businessmen to students with their backpacks and laptops. Open late and early, convenient hours for busy folks. A nice mix of tasty entrees, breakfast food, desserts, wine, and coffee drinks. I like their pastas, apps, sandwiches (the chicken salad with curry and raisins was really unique), paninis, french toast, lox/bagels, scones, and lattes. Great locale to try out in this fun neighborhood.
