Must taste it to believe!!!Good Points: Best, the sauce is perfect and love the burnt edges. Get fresh garlic on top it makes it spicier but so good. Their pizza is not too thick with fillings like GIordanos or Lou Malnottis, its better. They are only rivaled by one pizza in the city of chicago and that is My Pie.Bad points: the only thing bad about the deep dish is it has too thick of bread on the bottom and not a lot of cheese, i wish they would thin it out!  It's like eating a huge amount of bread. Last, everything else here besides the pizza is disgusting, do not get appetizers or pasta, stick to just pizza.
