Let me preface this by saying I am a fan of New York pizza, and I don't consider Chicago Deep Dish (only 1 year older than the twinkie) to really be pizza. That being said this place was pretty decent. We asked if the dough was vegan, and they said it was, and with no cheese that means no caramelized. Crust was okay though, a little dry for me. Sauce was good, toppings as well. Next time I may get normal/thin crust. One waiter told us he loves putting the vegan parm on his pizza at home, but I don't think they had any here. They should get some Teese here! I like having the oregano and red pepper on the table without having to ask.  Staff was amazingly friendly and nimble despite the thick Saturday evening crowd. People were packed to the gills but I didn't feel cramped and the volume of the was still ok enough to have a conversation.
