Review for event space: we hosted a 10-person all-day meeting at the Dana's boardroom this weekend and while the space and food were good, the service was quite weak. We never received the tea and coffee refill mid-morning and there was not a soul around to remind. When we finally asked about it when the person charged with our event, he said he'll brew some in a bit, which he never did..
