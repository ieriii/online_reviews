The Palmer House is one of the most famous grand hotels in Chicago. The lobby on the second floor is gorgeous; there's lavish furnishings, majestic ceiling, and of course, impeccable service by their well trained staff. As far as location is concern, it can't be any better. It's in the historic Chicago loop, close to corporate office buildings, Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, theatre at Randolph Street and State Street shopping. But come evening, this area can be a little quiet but walking north from the hotel will get you to Grand/Chicago Ave where restaurants and clubs are. The executive rooms have wonderful perks such as private elevators to the rooms and all day snack bar offered to executive guests only. However, the rooms are a bit on the small side though. The room that I was in, had two bathrooms but the bed took up most of the bedroom space. Despite that, Palmer House should be on your places to check out in Chicago, especially if you like grand old hotels. Be careful not to walk past the hotel though because I find it hard to recognize it from the street level since loop buildings are so close one another.
