I have fond memories of this establishment, although they are linked to a previous and significant love relationship of my past. Recently my husband received a gift certificate to this place and since it had been like 7 years, I said why not. Nothing has changed and if you have read previous reviews here on yelp, you will again get some of the same comments. This is old school Chicago Italian. Decor is what it is....it's not even pretending to be anything else. Yes, the average age is over 50 and the place is always ALWAYS packed. Which is always a good sign. I thought the portions were good, the price right, the ambiance high end and a overall good experience. However, my husband didn't have the same sentiments. He thought the food was OK, but he had better and he thought it was loud, crowded and too confined of a space. "But it wasn't that bad, since we had a gift certificate" - those were his words exactly. Again, it is what it is, but maybe for me it holds sentimental memories....
