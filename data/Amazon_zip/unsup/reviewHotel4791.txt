This review is solely for the rooftop bar, not the hotel. So I finally made it out to this bar. I feel like I've heard so much hype about the place, maybe I had too high of an expectation. But when I finally went this weekend, I was pretty disappointed. 1) The crowd was mixed in terms of race and age, which I like. But the quality of the crowd was not so good in terms of looks. And I'm not trying to sound snobby or anything like that. Maybe it was just an off night, but it was a Saturday night, so I was hoping it was poppin' with some beautiful people. If you truly want to see some good looking people, go check out Y-Bar or Enclave. 2) So there was a good sized line, but we greased the bouncer some money to get in for our party (9 people: 5 girls, 4 guys). One of the bouncers flat out lied to our face saying there's cover so we need to pay him more. But when we asked the other bouncer, he was perplexed saying there is no cover for entrance. Oh, so I guess that's one of the positives. There's no cover. 3) When we finally got into the bar, we didn't feel it was that crowded. At least the line outside should have been moving a lot faster, but I guess that's how all bars/clubs work, trying to look like they're super busy. So I won't knock any points for that. 4) The outdoor bar section was pretty sharp. The flat screen tvs, and the fire pits, and the chic decor made it feel like I was in that Barcardi mojito commercial. The view was good, but not fantastic. 5) Nothing much to say about the drinks or prices. It was as expected. So overall, it was just OK. Definitely over-hyped from what I've heard. It doesn't compare to Pure in Vegas or even some of the rooftop bars in NYC.
