All I have to say is I pretty much cried when I left Chicago and I realized it would be a long time until I can return to my personal food Mecca. I've eaten at a lot of vegan places (both in Chicago and in the Seattle/Tacoma area) and this place by far tops them all. The food is delicious (and ingenious! sometimes I question if what I'm eating is actually vegan,) but the atmosphere is what really puts it over the top for me. I have a soft spot for diners and chill people and this place has both. I've tried a lot of the things on the menu at this point, but for any first timer I would definitely suggest the reuben (seriously, even if you don't like reuben sandwiches, you WILL like this one!) and any of the milkshakes... err.. hempshakes. :)
