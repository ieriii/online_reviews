Excellently located. Clean though tired rooms. Public areas have a great aura. Staff unobtrusive but helpful. Access to the exec floor was great. Simple breakfasts and access to a computer with printer made my day! Lake front room was wonderful to be in given the tulips, the blue lake, the Buckingham Fountain - pleasant to view at all hours. Small unpleasant incident was well taken care of by the hotel. Would stay again without hesitation.
