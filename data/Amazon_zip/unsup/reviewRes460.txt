I was really excited to eat at Alinea but I was sorely disappointed. I thought the food was awful, some of the dishes were completely tasteless. The first course "Rose"... a combination of rose petals and foam and celery or something equally as unappetizing. I kept looking around me and watching other couples act as if this stuff was the most amazing food they ever ate.. I thought I must be in a crazy house?? What phonies... Plus the price is absolutely ridiculous. The waiter service was good, I'll give them that but otherwise... I mean the desserts? A piece of caramelized bacon suspended from a little bow (and arrow) contraption... or the straw where you suck a milkshake out? It tasked like nothing and was a gross texture. Honestly, people must be kidding themselves.
