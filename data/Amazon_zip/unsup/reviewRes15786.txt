Violet Hour was pretty good. I went with the husband and a friend for the hub's birthday.  The guys drank, but I didn't feel like it. $12 for a cocktail is just a little steep for me, I guess. Our friend just drank gin while my husband had cocktails. The first one was fantastic, but the second one was pretty bad. None of us liked it-- it was waaay too strong. It was consumed in its entirety. We didn't have to wait more than a couple of minutes, which was great. I like how the chairs are arranged. We got to carry on a conversation without wondering whether the other tables could hear us. I didn't like having to hold a candle up to read the menu-- there just wasn't enough light. Maybe three candles per group would be beneficial. Overall, I like the Patterson House in Nashville a bit more-- and I believe it was designed based on Violet Hour.
