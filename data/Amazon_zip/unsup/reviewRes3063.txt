I hope I'm the 1000th review! This is like kyochon on crack. Big, crispy sweet wings that were juicy and meaty. I split this with 2 other people sharing 10 wings and a baby buddha. The meals together were really great and yes, can easily, easily be split between 3 people. There is a wait especially for community tables. The atomic sauce is good in very minimal form. Dousing the chicken your your bowl may be too atomic. Hipster central!
