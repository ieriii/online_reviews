We used to go to their old location across the street, usually with a bigger group of friends and it was always a great time. Cramped, but that added to the atmosphere. BYOB is always awesome. Now that they moved it seems like they've changed a lot, now it's more of an upscale, big roomy restaurant. It's nice to not have to wait so long for a table, but I feel like the integrity of the food isn't the same as it was before. I was just here this past weekend and overall had a good experience. They changed their BYOB to exclude weekends which kinda sucks, but they have a pretty good sangria. I got the carne asada which was really good, along with the chimichurri that comes with it, very tasty. I knew I didn't care to much for yuca, (basically a dry hard tasteless potato) so I substituted it for rice and received plain white rice. I didn't touch it. The grilled plantain was delicious though. Overall it was a good experience, and our waiter was very attentive. Not as good as it used to be but I'm still a fan.
