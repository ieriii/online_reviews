I have been a vegetarian for 4 years and just became vegan 9 months ago... The Chicago Diner is one of the best restaurants I have ever been too... EVER. Including restaurants visited during my meat-eating days... The Reuben is DELICIOUS... You literally might think you are eating a meat and dairy filled sandwich... But you're not!! I honestly believe I could eat it everyday. The sweet potato fries are amazing... And their baked goods to die for. All in all, just a really tasty place to eat! One thing... Don't go if you are in a hurry... They can be kind of slow. But it's really worth the wait.
