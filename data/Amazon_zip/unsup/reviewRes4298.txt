Chicago institution, frequented by Al Capone, now a living beast for jazz and world-class music. I've been wanting to come here for years upon years and only JUST made it out there. Green Mill looks like a small tiny bar from the outside.... one that I wouldn't make plans to come ahead of time. But inside, the music is bopping and the decore is right out of the old-tyme era. Wednesday nights host a group that mixes Spanish-style guitar with jazz standards (violin, accordian, upright bass, and rhythm guitar). This group was smoking great and had a great crowd cheering them on the whole night. For a Wednesday night show, it is rare to see a venue THIS packed, THIS frequently. It just shows the quality of the music acts and the love of Chicagoans for great music. I will undoubtedly come back here for more shows. Arrive early to get the nice velvet booths near the stage (otherwise, you'll be standing near the back and won't see anything).
