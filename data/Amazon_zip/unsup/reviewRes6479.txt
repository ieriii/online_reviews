I have been to Davanti several times and have been impressed every time! The wine is great and all of the small plates have been AMAZING! The polenta and ragu was one of the best things that I've had in a long time and the truffle egg toast is to die for. I've never had any of the desserts cause we are always so full when we are done! It is my new must go for friends visiting Chicago!
