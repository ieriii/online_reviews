My husband and I are still dumbfounded about tonight's meal at The Publican. We have been there before and have always had great experiences. Tonight we left Avec because the wait was too long, and now we truly wish we had stayed. We ordered the pickles, grilled broccoli, skate, short ribs, and sirloin. The highlights were the broccoli, pickles, and the sirloin. However, the lowlights far overshadowed the good dishes we had. The skate had great flavor, but the bone in it made it very difficult to eat. We moved on to the short rib. Echoing a previous review, the dish was made up of mostly bone, gristle, and fat. It was completely inedible. After searching through a pile of unappetizing meat and bone to find a bite you could actually eat, whatever flavor was lost in the chaos. I cannot describe how horrible this dish was and how disappointed we were. Leading to the next problem, the service was not attentive, missing for large portions of time and never asking about our experience. So now, after the fact we sit here thinking we should have just waited at Avec or gone somewhere else entirely. We would not have been hungry or disappointed, which we are both after dining at the Publican.
