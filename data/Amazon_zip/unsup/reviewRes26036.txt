One of my favorite pizza places in Chicago, Pequod's serves up delicious deep dish pizza with a "halo" of crispy cheese instead of a bready crust. I usually get it delivered, a nice treat since I live in Logan Square. I recently dined in for a friend's 30th birthday. I found out that they have upstairs seating and a bar up there. It was pretty busy since it was a Saturday, but service was attentive and the pizza never disappoints.
