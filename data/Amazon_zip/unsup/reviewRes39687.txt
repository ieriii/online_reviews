I really was torn between 3 stars and 4 stars. I am SURE i'll be back so maybe the next trip can bump it up one! Came here last week for dinner and drinks with a girlfriend. After being seated, we immediately jumped into both drink and food menus as we were two very hungry and thirsty ladies!  The server took a little longer than we would have liked to stop by for drink orders, and the drinks took a little longer than we would have liked to make their way to the table. Unfortunately, when they did arrive, mine wasn't correct but the server was very happy to switch it out. Although she was very sweet, she wasn't too helpful with our questions on the dinner menu. Anyhow, the important part is that the food was great as were my next couple drinks! I love the creative dinner menu and libations as well as the atmosphere! I can't wait to try more!
