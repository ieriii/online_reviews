I had a burger at their cafe, it was overpriced and nothing to write home about. Too much char. My friend had a salmon which looked nice and tasted pretty good. But it's not the cafe that is the forefront of this place, it's the market. The multitude of selections in their store is insaaaane. I just want to sit on the floor and stare at the packaging of their pretty little candies. It's the Dean & Deluca of Chicago as people say. But unlike Dean & Deluca it isn't small or convoluted, there is enough space for really finding what you need in regards to high end grocery shopping. Although the clientele is the same, can't afford it on a regular basis for sure. Good hours, good product, good location. If I'm baking anything for a special location I may be back.
