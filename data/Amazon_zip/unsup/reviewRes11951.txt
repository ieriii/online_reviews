This place is awesome. I have been more than 10 times and I always get the same thing.. start with the awesome mixed greens salad (order a small for 2 people, or a large for more than that), and you will LOVE it!! The dressing is light, and there are even candied walnuts. Fabulous! My go-to pizza choice is pepperoni with banana peppers. It is so so so good. Last week, I went and had my classic, and then tried a new one (shock!) which was also great. We got goat cheese, sausage and mushroom. The goat cheese was so good on a pizza. The place almost always has a wait... but the beers are so good, who cares!? It is a great place for a group or a date, if you're sure you like the person! If not, it could be a long night if it's busy!
