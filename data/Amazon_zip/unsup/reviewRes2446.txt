Love this place, its hot doug's, you can't go wrong. I've been going here since before Anthony Bourdain made it popular and the line was out the door. Even with the HUGE increase in customers and the wait, i still find myself going here and waiting in line 30+ minutes. Sigh, i still remember the good old days when i could go on a weekend and there'd be no line. The only thing i'll say is, the duck fat fries, i can tell a difference between the normal fries and the duck fat fries, but its not like "OMG" crazy this is the most amazing difference. Actually, for the difference in price i'll pass up the duck fat fries and get a side of cheese or a corn dog.
