Meli is slow. Not the food, the food will come, but you will reach your next birthday before you receive your check. You will also wait for hours if you show up past 9am on a Saturday. Luckily I'm all for devoting entire days to the pursuit of breakfast. Eggs Benedict. Caramel, Banana French Toast.  I woke up last Saturday morning, knowing I had a good 2 hours before the hangover would hit. After milling over my standard Saturday morning options (sleep, eat, throw up)-- I actually got out of bed at 6:30am and went to Meli. And it was glorious.
