The Eggstraordinary Egg Sandwich Today my boyfriend and I brunched at the C.D. He ordered the Breakfast Bowl (too good for words), and I ordered the Eggstatic Sandwich mainly because the name sounded fun.... OK, to begin with, although we had to wait for a table for a minute or two, we were impressed by the welcoming vibe of the very friendly staff, our server was super cool, and our food and drinks came quickly and had great presentations. When the food hit the table I was so eggcited about my choice! The potatoes were awesome and they got even better with the organic ketchup... I confess, I really wanted to steal that bottle of tomato joy.... Anyways, it wasn't until I got to the sandwich that the uneggspected happened... I held and bit that boy so hard that its over over-easy soul eggsploded spraying egg yolk all over the place. We started laughing eggstatically and our eggsperinece went from eggcelent to eggstrordinary! Yeah, my arm was kinda sticky, but it was worth it! I devoured the rest of my delicious sandwich and ineggsplicaby I developed this eggregious way of talking! C. D. you have far eggseeded my eggspectation and you've changed my life for the better! When it was time to eggsit your home I was eggceptionally sad, but I know that you will eggspress your gratitude by feeding me your egg love when I go back for more!
