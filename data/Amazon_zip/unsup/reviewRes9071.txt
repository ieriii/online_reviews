I ordered the Jujah Sultani. The serving size was definitely generous. Come prepared to eat. The chicken breast was excellent. It was juicy and flavorful and served hot. It was garnished with roasted onions, green peppers, and tomatos. The kabobs were served on a bed of dill rice (you can also order plain white rice and some other kind of rice) that was as delicious as everything else.  As an appetizer, I ordered the large hummus. It was served on an oblong dish with olives in the center and bread (noon) on the side. What can I say? Both the hummus and the noon were great. I had to stop eating the hummus and noon at one point so I could leave room for the main course. I would definitely recommend eating here.
