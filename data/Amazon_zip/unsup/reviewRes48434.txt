Total disappointment. I was only in Chicago for two nights and was THRILLED to try out this place. Beer and pork? Check. Good press? Check. Experienced chefs and restauranteurs? Check. Yeah no. We had a 9PM reservation (on a weeknight) and weren't seated until 9:45. We waited in the loud-as-fuck main dining area and spent days trying to flag down someone--anyone--to take our beer order. Shouldn't have been that hard since every other person in the joint was a server. When we finally got someone to acknowledge us, it then took another 10 mins or so before we actually got our beers. When our table was finally ready, we were told we had to settle out our beer tab before we sat down rather than just transferring to the table. I flagged down three different waiters and asked for our check. Finally I told the last one, "If y'all wanna get paid, come find me at my table" as it had been another 10 mins and the rest of my party had long been seated. The food? Eh. We started out with the pork rinds and I dunno, they had a funky, funky taste about them, like perhaps the grease they were fried in was a touch too old. We got a variety of other pork dishes, including one that our server assured us was their specialty (potee--all meat in this dish, overcooked). Let me assure you, it was not. Everything was across-the-board disappointing; much of it was overcooked. My cousin ordered the vegetarian plate and it came 20 mins after all of us had gotten our food and it was all out-of-season vegetables. Turnips in summer? Really? Oh, and half of what we wanted they were out of. The server, to his credit, kicked us a few desserts, most of which were solid but not insanely good or anything. I'm bummed that this was one of my very few, very precious meals in Chicago. What a waste.
