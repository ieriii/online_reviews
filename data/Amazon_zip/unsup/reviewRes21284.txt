Really good food - even better service. I ordered the fajitas, gf ordered the chimichunga - both were fantastic. The service was fast and not in your face. I attempted to order a margarita, however, I could only understand 'two hours' from the server - even though two tables around us had marg's. Im not sure what that meant. Anyways, if you like the mexi - this place is sure to satisfy your needs.
