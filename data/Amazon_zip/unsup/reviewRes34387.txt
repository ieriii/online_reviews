cheap, tasty, near-by. whats not to like? plus, I'd like to second Steve K. comments - the sum (the sandwich) is greater than all of its parts. if you are looking for Mediterranean food in WP, look no further, for the price, there is no competition. few notes though: - Falafel isnt good. its burnt, its heavy, its soaked. No. no. no. - Humus is average at best. everything else is just goooooooooood. oh, and you can buy pita-bread for home!
