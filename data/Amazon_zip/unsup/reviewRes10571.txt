The food is awesome! We had a cheese pizza as an appetizer and tortellini bolognese and ravioli for the meal. The tortellini was large and stuffed with plenty of cheese, and the bolognese sauce was absolutely delicious!! The only reasons I didn't give this place 5 stars are: expensive drinks, crowded table configuration, and they don't have meatballs on the menu. All that aside, this is one of my favorite Italian restaurants!
