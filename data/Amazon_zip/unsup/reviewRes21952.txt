So this place gets 4 stars because of ambiance/kitsch factor, killer shakes, pretty good sandwiches and it's a freakin' drive in. It is not a fancy dining establishment.....do not confuse it with Le Superdawg, that french bistro on the south side. We had a Super Chic and a Superdawg with fries, along with a blackkow and a chocolate shake. All was rather good, though I must say my expectations weren't THAT high. The place reminded me of my childhood A&W drive in. You sit in your car, yell your order into a distorted speaker box, then your tray hangs on your car window. Gotta keep it classy! The highlight here was the ice cream drinks. The shake was very thick and flavorful and the blackow was great. I would have had one more if I hadn't gorged myself on everything.  Overall, fun place to visit on a nice summer night.
