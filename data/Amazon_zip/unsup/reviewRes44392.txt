Best Sushi I've had in Chicago. I dream about the Oedipus roll, the Fire Dragon roll, and the Wakamono roll. The Spicy Trio is also great. The place is also BYOB, and now that it's getting so packed I am hesitant to point any more attention to the place. But if you have the chance, do go. You won't regret it!
