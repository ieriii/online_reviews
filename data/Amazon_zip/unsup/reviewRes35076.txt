how do i start this review? ok, let's just do it like this - the area might seem a bit cramped (the seating area is a bit smaller than the living room and dining room area of a standard chicago 2flat, literally). the lighting might even be stressful on the eyes. maybe you don't want to watch anime on the projection screen... maybe you think the decor is tacky. so why the 5-star review? BECAUSE SUSHI X HAS THE BEST SUSHI I'VE EVER HAD. PERIOD. every sushi restaurant has their rainbow roll and dragon roll. big whoop, who cares. but in terms of their own custom rolls, they're really damn good. order a roll with a name you hadn't heard before and you know what you're going to be thinking? "Wow mike, this tastes like nothing i've ever had before! you're absolutely right!" yeah i know i am, you're welcome. it's damn good memorable sushi, it's reasonably priced, and parking is plenty. the crab cakes are pretty good too.  if you're rollin at least 5deep with crew, the small space plays to your advantage because your group will take up a good portion of the seating area. if your in 10deep, your group has just about the full undivided attention of the restaurant staff. if it's just you and you date, don't be stupid - go when it's not too busy and the atmosphere is nice and intimate, otherwise you're just really pathetic trying to talk to your date while sitting next to my loudass crew that's 10deep lol. also don't sit by the damn door when it's freakin winter. food's really good for takeout too.
