Touristy, but good food. I came here the first time when my out of town girlfriend and I were shopping on Michigan Avenue. I've brought a couple of out of town friends back and the reviews have all been positive. My husband and I went for brunch on Easter figuring most of the smaller brunch places would have insane waits and we were seated right away. Brunch is delicious. Not someplace I would go out of my way to eat at, but definitely a great place for friends and family when touring Michigan Avenue.
