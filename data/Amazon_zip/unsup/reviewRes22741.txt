Ok, Just when I said Portillo's has the best Chicago hot dogs; I forgot one that eclipses it by a nudge. We like the many choices that Portillo's give us and locations. But really there is a better hot dog and it can be found at Superdawg. I found this place searching the local area using the Zagat guide. One look at the web site and it immediately became a quest. One look at this place and its' web site, and it's hard not too laugh. Please view FAQ - "Ask Mauri and Flaurie" it will put you in stitches. I particularly like the creation of the Whoopercheesie! So now that we are documenting our finds, we had to make a trip to Superdawg. This weekend our friend left us his car and with that we made way. It was a beautiful day and the Superdawg was packed. It's a functioning drive in. You simply pull under the awning and order through a speaker on the menu. When the order is ready a hop brings it to the car. As it was nice today, and though in the car, we chose to eat in the very small dining area attached to the back of the kitchen. Our order today was one Chicago dog without sports, two Cheesie's loaded and one Whoopskidawg. Fries and a pickle come with each order and the fries are fantastic. Each fattening delight comes in it's own sporty box where the contents lie comfortably until removed.                            The burgers were great, soft cheesy and topped with sauteed diced onions and the electric green Chicago relish. The dog was fantastic and the Whoopskidawg, a Polish dipped in BBQ sauce, and served with same sauteed onion, sports on an onion hog dog roll. I don't know if I have ever even seen an onion hot dog roll. We wanted to get the thick malts too, but we had already indulged a little too much. Maybe next time.
