My sister had her wedding reception here, and it was nice. They had a closed off area for us in the back with its own bar. We had a few options to choose from. They had these awesome corn cake pancakes for apps. Yum. The decorating is crazy. The lights are in the shapes of fried eggs. But the service was good and they had a decent selection of beverages. I had the black been patty cake type of thing. And it was excellent. It seemed like everything as a whole used good ingredients, and I did not hear a single complaint. I did not really see the full menu, but I'd definitely go back.
