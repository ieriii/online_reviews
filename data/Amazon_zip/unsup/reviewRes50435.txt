Best hamburger possible... my pregnant friend said she had a hamburger binge and ate something like 30 hamburgers all over the city and this was the best one. I believe her.  Great other options too... from the unique cocktails to fried chicken tuesdays and prix fix Thursdays(not sure if they always have this, but happened upon it during the locavore thing Chicago restaurants were doing in the fall and it was awesome.) Quality products such as Gunthorp Farms and Tallgrass... good wine and beer selection. I've probably been there about ten times since it opened, and my new year's resolution is to go ten more this year!
