Kinzie Chophouse is an average good restaurant. I am definitely glad that I went although I did not think it was anywhere close to 5 stars like numerous other reviews. The setting was ok. White tablecloths but nothing else really stood out. I looked forward to seeing the comfy booths that I had heard about but it turns out that there was really one long booth with lots of tables at it. Shrimp cocktail...amazing. 4 huge pieces of shrimp in a martini type glass. I had pepper crusted halibut on top of mushrooms and asparagus. While I was somewhat pleased with the dish and especially the sauce, I was so confused about the pepper crust as it seemed to be thrown on right before it was served. The BF had steak and although he enjoyed it, he said it doesn't compare to other steaks. I would like to go back for the happy hour deal which looks fantastic...
