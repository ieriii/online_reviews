I booked my stay via Travelocity and got a great rate (under $70 a night). I was a little worried about how I'd be treated by the hotel front desk because of this, but everything was wonderful. Check in wasn't until 3 but we arrived around 2 and were able to get to our room. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and she gave us a room away from the elevators on a high floor. Our room also had a view of lake Michigan which was a very nice surprise. The room was beautiful, the king sized bed was very comfy, and the bathroom was completely new...which leads me to why I give this hotel 4 stars. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door and it wasn't installed properly. There is a sizable gap, and you can see right into the bathroom. That's fine if you're staying alone, not so much with a traveling companion. You can also hear EVERYTHING that happens in the bathroom, including what your neighbors are doing if you catch my drift. One final complaint, the heating/cooling vents were loud. Everytime the heat kicked in at night, it woke me up. (I'm a light sleeper) Final verdict: I would stay here again, the location was great but I'd bring earplugs.
