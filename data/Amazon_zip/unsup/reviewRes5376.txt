Ending my last night in Chicago at The Purple Pig was such an awesome idea! It's exactly the kind of gem you'd tell friends and family about when you return from a stay in Chicago... which makes me wonder why I forgot to leave a review for the place (though I found time to leave a 2-star review for Blackbird - ha). I honestly can't remember much about the night except that I loved the whole experience of it. Sitting with friends at a long table with others, laughing over wine, and "pigging off" of each piggy dish that arrived (I loved the pig-themed dinnerware) - all translating into a great meal. I will tell you though that the olive oil ice cream and the dining experience itself are not to be missed.
