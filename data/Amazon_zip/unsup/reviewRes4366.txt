One of my favorite spots in Chicago! Fabulous music, great atmosphere and yummy (though overpriced) drinks. The history of this uptown haunt is tangible from the moment you step through the door. Don't miss Kimberly Gordon and her gorgeous voice on Sunday nights (reduced cover charge is $4) Be sure to bring CASH to avoid those ATM fees. They only do bar tabs with American Express.
