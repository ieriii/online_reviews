I stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and seriously wanted to go back for dinner. Tons of vegetarian options! I had the plantains appetizer which was absolutely delicious...not overly fried, just moist and tender. The soy meat empanadas were excellent. For my entree I ate a vegetarian sandwich that had a black bean base that had the perfect amount of heat. I loved it! Prices super reasonable, our server was great, value for the money is insane...THERE ARE HUGE PORTIONS GIVEN! I love this place!
