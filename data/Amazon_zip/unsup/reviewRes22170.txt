I can't tell you how many times I have driven past Irazu or how many times I've said "I've been meaning to check out Irazu." Well, I finally went last night with my boyfriend. It does not disappoint. We sat in the surprisingly warm and cozy front patio. Don't let the weather deter you. It was really comfortable. Warm chips and salsa verde were brought out quickly to our table. I love their chips. They have the right thickness. It is hard to find a place that doesn't serve those super thin wimpy chips. These were great. The squeeze bottle of salsa verde made them even better. In fact, several times I considered just doing salsa shots straight from the bottle. It was that good. They give you little flat plates with the chips. Pouring the salsa onto the plates and attempting to dip in the chips proved difficult. Just pour the salsa right on top of the chip. Much less messy that way. We ordered the Patacones (Double fried green plantains) to start. We opted for the additional black bean puree (an extra $2) and it was totally worth it. It also comes with some garlic oil but it was so overpowering that we didn't use it. The black bean puree is absolutely delicious on top of the patacones. You know, in addition to the salsa verde that I completely doused them with as well. For the entree I ordered the vegetarian burrito. My boyfriend ordered the chicken burrito. The veggie burrito is delicious though next time I'll ask for extra hot peppers. I had a bite of the chicken from my bf's burrito. For white meat it was really flavorful and sliced thin enough that it wasn't dry at all. I will definitely be back to eat my way through the rest of their menu and try that oatmeal milkshake that I've heard so much about.
