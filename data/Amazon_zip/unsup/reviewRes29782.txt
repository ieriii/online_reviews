I love this place. I'm a gluten-free,sometimes carnivore so it can be tough going out to eat sometimes. Sometimes it can take 15 minutes for the wait staff to figure out what I'm talking about... Not at Chicago diner. They have a gluten free vegetarian menu to die for. Everything is flavorful. I'm currently working my way down my list of options. The wait staff are excellent. They offer you great service always with a smile. They are friendly and speedy. That chat enough to be enjoyable while giving you the privacy you need. Thank you.
