I landed in Chicago yesterday and decided to pay a visit to a pizza joint, for what I heard was Chicago's best with deep dish pizzas. Anyway, with a pizzeria being a stone throws distant from home I decided to begin my Chicago experience with Giordano's! I ordered for a special deep dish with add on of Canadian bacon. It takes about 30mins for the pizza to be made so one can wait either at the attached bar or as I did, watched the pizza makers do their thing! It can be quite entertaining to watch them make those pizzas so gracefully! I was pleasantly surprised to find how huge the pizza actually is. Little did I imagine before ordering, that gobbling the pizza by myself was a joke! The portions are very generous and since they don't sell by the slice; you will have to buy a full pizza. The pizza itself was brilliant; crust wasn't too hard, generous amount of filling, soft and gooey cheese while my favorite part was the pizza sauce. The sauce is so flavorful and rich. O and the pizza is quite rich by the way, I just managed two slices! I will highly recommend any pizza lover, or for that matter , any foodie to give Giordano's a try. I'll definitely be going there again!
