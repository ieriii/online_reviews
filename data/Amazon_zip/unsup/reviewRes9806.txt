Sprout is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood! Love the prix fixe concept, especially with the surprise courses...the grilled cheese "surprise" with a dry white wine was one of the highlights of our meal. Desserts were also fantastic - highly recommend the apple shake & the lemon. Overall, the food was tasty & the service was very friendly. We plan to go back!
