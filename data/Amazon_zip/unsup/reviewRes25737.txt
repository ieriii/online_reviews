The people who run this place are so nice. The service and vibe approach five star. I found the food to be a little bland and rather dumbed down. It was not an amazing meal compared to other Vietnamese places farther north. Watery curry, unsophisticated mango salad however my friends pho was good and almost as good as what you can get on Argyle.
