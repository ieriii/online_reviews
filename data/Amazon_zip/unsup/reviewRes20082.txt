MMM - tasty and unique. I can't say I had ever eaten a Scotch egg or bacon foam before dining at The Gage but I guess there's a first for everything and these guys really nailed it. I'm not sure which cuisine genre this place falls into but whatever it is, I'm diggin' it. I had the pork chop with some lovely autumnal vegetables and a garnish of some white powdery/foamy stuff that tasted like bacon. Once I put it on the chop (which obviously needed more pork) it sort of melted in and gave the meat another dimension of deliciousness. I guess the chef likes to experiment with food and chemistry. Nice! Other good stuff: Excellent wine list and very helpful sommelier. Fantastic service. Cozy atmosphere Do it.
