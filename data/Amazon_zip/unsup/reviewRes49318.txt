So I haven't tried the pastries and I've never ordered a cake, but the coffee's decent and I'm a BIG fan of the lounge area, which is one door down from the actual bakery. It's very quiet, the music is nice, and the seating is comfortable. This might not be ideal for everyone, but I KILL to find places like this to read, write and relax. Also, as someone who spends countless hours in libraries, this is SO not a library. The fast and password-free Wi-Fi is a huge plus--in fact, I'm writing this review on it right now.
