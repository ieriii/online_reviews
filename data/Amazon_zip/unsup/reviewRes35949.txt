I have always loved this place, in fact, one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. It is not cheap but the food is good and the ambiance fun. Upscale but not stuffy in the least. One thing, the neighborhood is becoming increasingly ghetto. Every time we went out to smoke, crack head panhandlers approached us. Come on management! Can't you work something out to control this better? In case you are one of those "that's what you get for smoking" people, the annoying derelicts hit up everyone waiting for the valet too. The valet guys stand by and watch as if it is not their problem. Well Shaw's, you might begin to have a problem.
