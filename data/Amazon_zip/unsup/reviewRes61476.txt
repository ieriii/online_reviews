Despite the fact that I have to go completely out of my way to try either of Beavers Donuts two downtown locations, I've gone two days in a row. That should quickly tell you how much I liked the donuts. They're made fresh and they literally melt in your mouth. The donuts are so dang cute and because of their diminutive size, you will eat six of them before you know it. They have several combos that include coffee or toppings on the donuts. I myself eschew such overly sweet toppings and tend to go for the simple powdered or cinnamon sugar. Stuff like peanut butter and strawberry sauce just detract from the inherent pleasure of the donut itself. If I wanted that kind of stuff, I'd go eat at IHOP. The guys that work the truck are so sweet and friendly and both times I've ordered a half dozen, they've thrown in more than a few extra. If you "check-in" on Yelp, you get a free donut. Once everyone in line saw me do that, they all started whipping out their smart phones to take advantage. Another bonus: on your birthday, they give you a free half dozen. I'll never be so excited to turn another year older!
