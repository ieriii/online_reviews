that popcorn...it beats graham elliot. and i thought nothing could top that!! and the mussels...i swore i would never order them again after reading anthony bourdain's _kitchen confidential_, but the night of the girl talk concert, my comrades and i were deep into a steaming bowl of the blue cheese and apple variety...and lovin' every spoonful. and as weird as it sounds to order moroccan chicken salad at a brewery, it was phenomenally good. like, i still think about it, good. oh. and the beers are of course good. great prices too!! like $5 a pint for locally brewed creativity. yes please, and ah.
