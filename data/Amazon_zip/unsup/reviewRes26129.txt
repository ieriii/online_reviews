I finally went to Mercat last week. I was not disappointed. The food was delicious, very authentic Spanish tapas. The sangria was delicious and the wine list looked promising. My boyfriend is vegetarian and our waiter was very good with his suggestions to him.. he was very professional and friendly. I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars because It's very pricey. The plates are very small and not worth the price. I would go back there but not very often..
