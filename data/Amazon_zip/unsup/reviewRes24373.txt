The cheese and chocolate fondues at Geja's really are to die for. I was beyond full when the chocolate fondue came and I still scraped the bowl clean. Also, I loved that they gave 8 delicious dipping sauces as part of the main course. It really made each bite a new experience. I would recommend just sticking with chicken and beef for the main course. I ordered the Prince Geja's Combination, and even though I was so excited about the lobster, I think something as nice as lobster just isn't meant to be "fondued" - it was just bland, even when using the butter dipping sauce. Overall, a great place for a romantic meal!
