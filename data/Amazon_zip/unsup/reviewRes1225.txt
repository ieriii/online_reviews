Hmmmm hot dogs! Hmmmmm hot dogs with ketchup and mustard! (The way God thought they should be made) And hooray for Mr. Doug because he didn't laugh at me when I ordered my dog this way. My hot dog was super delicious and yummy. There really are no words (or at least words that haven't already been used by all the people that have already reviewed Hot Dougs's) to describe just how yummy this hot dog was...for once I think I am speechless! Oh and the duck fat fries are to die for! ZOMG! So yummy and so good! Definitely worth the hour wait in line and the whole time I couldn't believe I was standing there and was hoping the food would deliver. And it did! Go...now...run!!!!!!!!!!!!  Go get your hot dog!!!!!
