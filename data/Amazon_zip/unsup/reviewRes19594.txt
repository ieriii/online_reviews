I strongly recommend Coast if and only if you are planning to drink there. Bringing a bunch of beers and/or wine (no corking fee!) definitely brings out the true value of this restaurant. The sashimi selection as well as creativity of the rolls are quite impressive, though admittedly quite a pricey! Cons: -really into their tempura flakes. -not extremely attentive towards heavy byob'ers -costs extra to substitute anything Pros: BYOB! -very lounge-y ambiance -very fresh sushi -lots and lots of fresh jalapeno options! All in all definitely a good find in Wicker Park, though it's a bit more upscale than its surroundings / what I'm used to.
