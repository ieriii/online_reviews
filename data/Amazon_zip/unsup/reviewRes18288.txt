Tortas... best place for it. There's a couple of options when ordering tortas. We decided to try the Tortas off the Griddle. Milanesa: Crispy chicken and the pickled jalepenos. There's crunch and heat with each bite. Nom nom nom! Cubana: pork loin and bacon. Definitely for the pig lovers!!! Food was made pretty quickly. Portion sizes are large. I had to take the other half home. Service is super nice and accommodating. If you are unsure with the menu they are there to explain anything. Ordered jamica too for drinks. It was refreshing and wasn't too sweet. Perfect for a hot summer day. We went here close to closing time on a Saturday night. Still the place was packed. One of the annoying things of place is parking is difficult. There's valet which is totally a life-saver had I known after driving around for 30 minutes. The place is kinda small so I can imagine the lines to sit gets pretty long. Can't make reservations so be prepared to wait. Knowing that you are getting a high-quality meal is totally worth the wait. The caldos looked really good as I saw others ordered a couple near our table. There are also pastries made in house that I have to go back and taste. The prices are wayyy reasonable than its sister restaurants next door. I can't wait to go back!
