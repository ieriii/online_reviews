First off, this is a review for the relatively new Noon O Kabob carryout place a few doors south of the actual restaurant. I've never been to the restaurant and have just one encounter with the carryout place. One recent Saturday night I ordered some carryout for myself and the Mrs. First the negatives: - ordered the ground chicken kabobs, got ground beef kabobs. - ordered two appetizers, got one appetizer. - forlorn, challenged staff Positives: - a decent sized, dedicated off-street parking lot. Nice for the area. - the food was rather bland but not terrible. Admittedly, I am not a huge Persian fan and have had far better experiences with other restaurants in the area (Salam, Al-Khaymeih). I still might have convinced myself to give it another try had I not found Afghan Kabob about a third of the distance from my house. I've had much better luck there as I attempt to move past my initial disappointments with Persian food. These disappointments are not new, they date back over a decade to my first visits to Reza's.  Someday maybe I'll try the restaurant.
