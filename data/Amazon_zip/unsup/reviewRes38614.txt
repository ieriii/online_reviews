This is a friggin' sweet bar. As everyone else has mentioned, the extensive beer list is the reason to drop in. It is crowded on the weekends; however, if you venture out at 12:00am on a Tuesday (like I do), then it's pretty sparse. The only draw back is its "hipster-ness." Sometimes I feel a little too uncool being there...a lot of emo, punk, etc. people frequent the bar. But overall, it's pretty nice.
