Awesome food. I came here with friends on a Friday night and we were seated outside, where they have a cute eating area with lights and umbrella tables. We ordered the Papa Rellena to start, which is a potato stuffed with ground beef. It was delicious- the outside of the potato was crispy, I'm assuming fried, and inside it was like a mashed potato with the beef. We also got the avocado side, which was good, but for $4.50, I don't think worth the price. It was sliced avocado with olive oil and salt and pepper on top. I could easily make that at home for much cheaper. The entrees all sounded really good, and I went with the tofu dinner plate. It came with large chunks of tofu in a creole spice (mild) with some peppers, and served with a huge mound of really good white rice, and a bowl of soupy black beans. I finished it all! I would definitely come back, next time I'd like to try a more authentic Cuban entree, or make a dinner out of all the appetizers that sounded amazing. This is also BYOB.
