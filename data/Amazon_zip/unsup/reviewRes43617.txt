O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D. Why is this place always so crowded? The granola is very tasty but more like Garrett's caramel corn than granola, which is supposed to be healthy for you. People, if you soak your granola in butter of course its gonna taste good - enjoy those 20g's of saturated fat to start off your day! The people at the counter have an attitude problem too. Maybe its because the line's too long. I guess I can sympathize - if I was working there, knew my food was OK but not really that good, but every clown with their stroller and screaming baby wanted to line up to get in my face every morning I'd probably develop an attitude problem too.  A ginormous crowd for a very weak breakfast menu. Lunch here was OK I guess, I might come back for that as the crowd isn't as bad. I just don't get it.
