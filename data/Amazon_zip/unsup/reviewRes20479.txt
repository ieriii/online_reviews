Very satisfying meal. Duck was perfectly cooked medium rare, well seasoned and crispy skin. The duck confit, a nice addition was moist and full flavored. Along with the confit blood sausage (Rich, sweet and tasty), blueberries, charred escarole, deep fried kale, rye croutons, carrots and black pepper reduction (which could've been reduced a tad more).  I would order this again.
