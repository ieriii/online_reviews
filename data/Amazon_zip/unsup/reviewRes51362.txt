Ok, while no trip to Tijuana, Garcia's is pretty good Mexican food for the price. After spending a fair amount of time frequenting El Mariachi in Lakeview (and spending a lot of money in the process for OK food), I discovered this slice of paradise with the help of friends: The Good - After going to school in Central Illinois and being introduced to "La Bamba's Burritos as Big As Your Head", Garcia's fits the bill and does it better. The burrito's are seriously the size of a football (no joke). I love their steak burrito and several friends have had the other various barnyard animals wrapped in tortillas as well. Don't forget to get it suizo - adds so much to the dish - You can easily walk out with two meals worth of food after your binge at the restaurant. As a person on a budget, I appreciate this. - Chips and Pico are quite good. You also can't go wrong with the margaritas - try the pineapple. The Meh: - There is one male waiter who really needs a personality transplant. Though, as long as he keeps the chips coming, I can overlook his not so charming demeanor. In short, it's my go-to restaurant for Mexican. Ole!
