I am going to have to give 90 Miles a solid 3.5 stars. I was really looking forward to going here since I have heard rave reviews and I was not disappointed! I had the bistec sandwich, which had a great flavor and was a rather large portion. The only thing I thought was weird is it had the picnic shoestring potato chips in it. I had envisioned shoestring potatoes. Oh well. We also got the plantain chips and the french fries. The fries were "too" fried for me... with the extra coating or whatever on them. The plantain chips were very thin and crispy and had a garlic sauce... they were very good. BUT... at the bottom of the tray there was a huge puddle of oil, which just made us feel guilty. I would have to say the prices are reasonable but not cheap. The sandwiches are around $6 but they come alone and you have to order the sides as extras. I would have to compare 90 miles to Irazu, although one is Cuban and one is Costa Rican. But the sandwiches are similar. 90 miles does have more side options but Irazu is overall cheaper. I noticed they do have a nice back patio, which I would like to sit at when it isn't boiling hot outside. I think it is definitely worth trying and worth going back to, but I doubt that it will be a regular stop for me.
