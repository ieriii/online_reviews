I've had nothing but great experiences at Zed, and was excited to try their brunch menu this weekend for Valentine's Day. For $24 it was a great deal considering the quality and quantity of food we got to sample. As far as I know, the only difference between the V-Day brunch and a normal Sunday was the fact that we got a glass of champagne included - the food was the same as it normally is. Just a quick description of our experience: we had free reign over the harvest tables, which included the standard salads, breads/antipasto/meats and also a "DIY" oatmeal station and french toast. We returned to our table to find delicious thick-cut bacon, hash browns and cinnamon rolls waiting for us! In addition to a parade of meats, the servers also brought out special dishes like corned beef hash, Cajun crab cakes with poached eggs, seared ahi tuna, fritattas and (our personal favorite) buffalo chicken and waffles. As if that wasn't enough, they had desserts set out at one of the harvest table stations. Service was (and is always) attentive and friendly, the atmosphere is chic, and the food was delicious - a very memorable afternoon. I've always loved Zed for the cocktails and the ambiance and now I'm adding brunch to that list!
