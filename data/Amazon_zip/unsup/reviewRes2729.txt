At the forefront of gastronomic innovation, Tru offers a unique dinning experience in an elegant setting where the tone is set by the quality of the dishes and service. The impeccable service allows patrons to focus on the culinary experience without the slightest distraction. Our tasting menu included comt cheese gougre, cucumber salad on gele, white sturgeon "caviar", suspended foie gras, the "inside of an english pea soup", dashi flan, duroc pork belly, scottish salmon with smoked cream, glazed veal, assortment of cheeses, cucumber and vanilla, summer melons in ginger, and an assortment of desserts. The white sturgeon "caviar" is an outstanding concept and dish, best described and creamed smoked sturgeon condensed in small balls the size of salmon roe and served over a bed of creamed avocado puree. The suspended foie gras is a cryo-prepared foie grass mouse with all the flavor but without the overwhelming fatty texture. Just about every dish was well prepared and spectacularly presented. The salmon and the veal courses were a bit understated. The smoked cream on the salmon did make up for the lack of flavor and texture; the veal was rather flat however. Both appeared to have been prepared sous-vide but I have the feeling that the veal was not finished properly on the pan before serving. The cheese tray was heavy on soft-ripened double creamed cheeses. The wine list is, as expected, extensive, well documented, and well supported by the restaurant's sommelier. The restaurant offers valet parking on St. Claire, operating on both sides of the street (no need for u-turn in front of the restaurant). First time patrons might have a bit of difficulty finding the restaurant which is located at the northwest corner of St. Claire and Huron, with the entrance on St. Claire.
