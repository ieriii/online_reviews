I loved this place. First, the crowded, noisy vibe, and long waits coordinated by patient and friendly personnel fosters a euphoric dining experience. Go figure. It's just plain fun. Eclectic wine list with great choices. Had a smooth Burgundy recommended by the server who knew her stuff. Shared many small plates among a group of seven. Loved the pork shoulder, squash, beets, prosciutto balls, artichokes, cheese offerings. One suggestion:serve some good bread. The owners are friendly and gracious. Kudos to Jim and Jim Banos Jr. Great food, great fun, great evening.
