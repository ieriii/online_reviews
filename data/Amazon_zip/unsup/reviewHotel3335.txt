I stayed at the Hard Rock for 2 days and have to say the hotel is nice and has a cool look to it. But like so many people have said it does indeed have dimly lit rooms and equally dim hallways. But as two brothers on a trip to see Chicago it did not bother us. I can see how it would bother a woman trying to do her make up since it is darker than the usual hotel room. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Good view of the marina city buildings (aka the corn on the cob twin buildings) from room 811. It is located in a nice area of downtown Chicago with Millennium Park just 5 minutes away and close to many boat tours on Wacker Drive. We were granted a late check out (1pm instead of noon) so that was nice for us since our flight was not until 5pm. The hotel also has free wifi internet which was a nice touch since so many 4 star hotels charge for 24 use of their internet. I used the concierge to check into my airline and print out my boarding passes. They were quick with getting them for me as I checked out. I do agree with the previous post that paying more than $100-$150 a night is not worth it. But then again thats because I got this for $100 a night off of priceline. I could not imagine paying the $250 a night they wanted through their website. Even with the $25 itunes gift card offer thats just too much to pay for a room. I would recommend this hotel to a friend and I would definitely stay here again. But next time I'd prefer the Beatles floor (4th floor), we got stuck with Cheap Trick (8th floor).
