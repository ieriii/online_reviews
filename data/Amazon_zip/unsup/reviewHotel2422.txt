I've been coming here since the Boulevard Room had ice shows in the 1960's. And I still like this place quite a lot. Last night we met before and after Daughter NO. 2's high school graduation in the lobby bar for drinks and eats. Great service, very good enough, basic bar food which everyone enjoyed. The furniture and the air conditioning made it Wonderful!! A great little "off the beaten path" (NOT) to hang out.
