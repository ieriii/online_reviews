What a disappointment! The only romantic part is that the place is dark; probably to hide the grease and the worn decor. Upon first entering the restaurant I was overtaken with the smell of cooking oil. I didn't think much of it since it was a fondue restaurant. We were seated at a tiny table for two in chairs that you would expect to find at a VFW hall in the 1970's. The menu seemed larger then the table itself. I was afraid the menu would catch fire if I read it over the table, at the same time I was wondering how our plates, the food we were to cook, the fondue pot and our glasses would fit on the table. Not to mention that the table next to us was less then 6 inches away. We did ask to sit at a booth but were denied.  Luckily the couple seated there was pleasant and thanked us for dining with them as we were leaving.The cheese fondue was good. The meal we cooked was nothing worth mentioning unless you really like fried food. It's basically a few pieces of meat, shrimp, tiny lobster bits, onions, mushrooms, potatoes and peppers all of which were not seasoned. All fried in the same oil, at varying times. It was very bland; at least there were 10 different sauces for dipping. The meal was mediocre at best. The desert chocolate fondue was fine if you like fruit and marshmallows dipped into warm Hershey's chocolate syrup. I don't understand what the hype is. I was looking so forward to my fondue experience, instead I left very disappointed. Honestly, it was the worst dining experience I've ever had.My initial instinct when I first walked into the restaurant and saw the table we were getting seated at was to flee. I should have followed my instinct. I'd have a better, healthier meal at a fast food restaurant for a lot less money.
