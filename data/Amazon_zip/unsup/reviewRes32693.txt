The best place for vegan and veggie delights. I starve myself all day to gorge on the California Reuben...out of this world good, and cheap and the friendliest staff I've ever encountered...almost suspiciously so... ;) My boyfriend is a hard core meat eater and he says they have the best country fried steak he's ever had! Maybe there is hope for him after all...amazing, go check it out!!!
