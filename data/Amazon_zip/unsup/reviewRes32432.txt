This was the 5th time we've eaten at Demera,positive experiences each time- dinner inside twice and outside on the patio on the other visits- but this trip was a bit different because we ate lunch there inside around 12:30pm on a Sunday as opposed the usual dinner visit. They don't have a breakfast or lunch menu, and aside from the time of day and empty restaurant, the food was the same as it has been on our previous visits. it was breakfastinner. We ordered, loved, and reccommed the messob sampler. the dish was for four and we barely finished it- there were like 3 or 4 meats and 4 vegetables- standouts were the ye-siga wot and ye-awaze tibs- both lightly spicy. On previous visits we enjoyed ye- timatim fitfit, and this sitting we ordered the tomato salad instead. both were very good but the timatim fit fit has jalapenos which were missed today. The service was decent- the waitress brought us extra injera. there were only two or three tables- food came out quick and everyone agreed it was well worth the 15 per person tab. The downside was that the Ethiopian coffee which is served served in a clay pot tasted more harshly burnt than usual, but evenso- with the help of sugar, two of us finished the entire pot . we like demera. its not the best choice for brunch- but if eaten early, you are going to be full for the rest of the day.
