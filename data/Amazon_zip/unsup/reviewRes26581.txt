Oh holy mexican food. This place is amazing.  I can't exactly remember what we got but everything was absolutely flawless. The combo platters, tacos, and sopes were all soo yummy! Even the salsa and chips they brought out in the beginning were tasty. FYI, this place is BYOB (and I can't get enough of that ish). Honestly, I didn't even get drunk here because I was so stuffed with delicious authentic food.  This place is super well priced, and definitely worth the trip if you're in Chicago for a vacation!
