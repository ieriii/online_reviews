I'm a fan but I know my girlfriend isn't. Here's our different viewpoints. I really enjoyed the little tapas sized dishes, especially the smears. We got chicken thigh kebabs, pork neck bone smear (I think that was the name), and a couple of other dishes I forget the names of. Even though the tapas sizes are small, they are heavy in salt, grease (or lard for the smears) and meat. This is why I enjoyed the meal. My girlfriend though loves lighter, more veggie focused meals. So needless to say she got a little sick afterword. I'd go back again, but I'd have to drag my girlfriend kicking and screaming.
