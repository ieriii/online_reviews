I used to like Garcia's back when they weren't so big and popular. The food was great then and the service was not so bad. I went there sometime in december 2011 with my husband, and the food was bland, the service was even worse. It took the waitress way too long to get our check and didn't even pick it up after 10 minutes of the checkbook with our credit card hanging out sitting on the table. We tried to get her attention but she was just way too busy. Finally we got fed up and i just paid up front. I had better service in Paris, and there usually is only one waiter/waitress for an entire restaurant/bar there. The only reason for my one star is because they havent taken away the ridiculously large horchata cup, but even so, the quality of their horchata has gone down. Never ever ever will we go back to Garcia's. The only people who like it now are those out of towners who recently moved to chicago or tourists who don't know any better... I'd much rather eat at a hole in the wall mexican restaurant with excellent food than eat at a Mexican restaurant with bad service, bland food, and over priced to boot, (all of the above = garcia's).
