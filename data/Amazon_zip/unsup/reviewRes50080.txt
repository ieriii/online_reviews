Oh my, this place gets crowded and noisy! It is too small for all the patrons who want to eat there. The people waiting for a table on the weekends easily flood the first half of the main room, standing around people who are actually eating. The seats (some tables had wooden benches, others had hard wooden chairs) were rather uncomfortable; perhaps the owners were going for a rustic, outdoors-y feel? The decor was very cute. There were paintings of very round people enjoying everything from food to dancing. The service here was great - our waiter was attentive, helpful, and humorous. And last, but not least, the food! I've tried the combination platter ($30 for 2) that consisted of rib eye, pork, chicken, sausage, yuca, fried potato, and plantains. It was altogether, as a dish, too dry, in my opinion. The plantains, however, were very tasty. I also tried the steak & eggs dish, and THAT was great! The egg is made over easy on top of your steak, and I was impressed by how tasty egg could be! Lastly, it's a BYOB establishment, so it guarantees fun times in this casual restaurant.
