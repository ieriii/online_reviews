Excellent beer selection of every variety, both domestic and international. If you ask for a miller lite, they might laugh you out of the place. I've found the food to be so-so. The brisket tends to be fatty. The garlic fries are delish. On the down side, this place gets packed on weekends. And I mean packed. If you are in any way clostrophobic or have a social anxiety disorder you might have an episode here.
