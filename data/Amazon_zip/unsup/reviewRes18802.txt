Billy Lawless's Michigan Avenue sister to Henri is a great pub-style space to go for lunch, happy hour or dinner and won't disappoint on any level. i went there this week for lunch and tried the venison burger with spicy peppers which was succulent and delicious. Wow. Right across from the Bean sculpture on Michigan Avenue this Millennium Park spot has great food, drinks and service so if you are undernourished or under-watered head in for a respite.
