Glenn's Diner has a very large seafood selection. The prices do run a bit high, so I would recommend going for lunch. I would never be able to justify paying dinner prices for the food we got. Everything tasted good and I could live with paying a $60 tab for lunch for two but I wouldn't be able to justify what they charge for their dinner rate..... It's good but kind of a diner's version of seafood. I've had better but I have also had worse. The service was average. The wait for a seat was about 30 minutes. I can only see myself going back for their Tuesday all you can eat crab legs, other than that, probably not.
