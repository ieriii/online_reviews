I love this place. I have been going here as long as I remember and the food only seems to get better. I usually get the Veal but they don't always have it (their menu rotates everyday) or I get the chicken with potatoes which is FANTASTIC!!!!! I was there the other day and my niece ordered the kids pasta. I decided to take a bite and OMG that sauce IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! I later found out it was called Pomadore sauce and I think from now on I will try to get that on pasta in adult sized portions. Great staff and service. You will not be hungry when you leave this place. Five stars all the way.
