Bad Apple has one of the best beer lists in the City. Hard to find beer, like New Holland's Dragonmilk, is usually on tap. The hamburgers are big and have unusual (unusual in a good way) toppings. I cannot speak to food at Bad Apple other than the hamburgers. The staff is friendly and helpful. I like sitting at the bar. It can get a little loud when its busy. They are sometimes too packed and the wait is long. If you go there on a Friday or Saturday night, try to go early or late so you can get a table.
