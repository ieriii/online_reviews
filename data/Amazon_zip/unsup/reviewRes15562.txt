I moved to Chicago from NYC 6 months ago, and the first thing I noticed was how many vacant warehouse/factories there were. I mean what the hell is the plan to get rid of those eye sores!?!? Well CARNIVALE had a few ideas.... Carnivale takes over an entire building on the city's West Loop and with good reason. They have created a stunning dining room that encompasses the Latin America feel just perfectly. I know everyone knows about this place so I'll just run through some highlights: Guac - truly something special, some of the best prepared guac I have ever had Shrimp Civeche - The Shrimp are fresh, perfectly prepared and the market chilies offer the perfect amount of heat to this sour dish. I had the Paella for dinner and that was great! It had a generous head of mixed seafood on top which kept me very happy! Carnival has an extensive menu, you'll have to go out there multiple times to try it out. This place a gem, and as popular as it already is, I don't see it dying out anytime soon because the entire team has put in so much effort to make this a truly special dining experience.
