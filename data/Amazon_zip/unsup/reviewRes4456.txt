What a great place for my 100th review! The Green Mill is truly a Chicago gem. There is so much history...it is practically bursting at the seems. The whole place has this incredible ambiance from the 30's that completely envelopes you. I kept looking over at the tables expecting to see Al Capone or Bugsy staring back at me. As you sit there taking in the live jazz tones it is hard not to fall victim to a time warp. The bartender has that air of indifference and cool you would expect...and the drinks are stiff without any frills. This is the perfect place for sexy night out or an evening with some jazz lovers.
