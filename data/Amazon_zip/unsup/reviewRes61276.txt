While out shopping Belmont this weekend me and my party decided it was time to grab some dinner. A person in our party for the evening suggested we try 90 Miles Cuban Caf for "some of the best food Chicago had to offer", so we gave it a shot. We called a few hours prior to the time we would arrive and tried to make a reservation, we were told they did not take reservations, when we arrived after trying to park for an hour we were asked if we had a reservation. We explained to the host that we were told they did not take reservations, she said whoever told you that was wrong, so we could either wait the 45 minutes or come back some other time. The person who suggested the place persuaded us to stay. My party chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful night but I decided to take a look at what the place had to offer. I noticed that the host was sitting people that came in after us who did not have reservations, which I thought was unfair, but I kept quiet and waited our turn. The place seemed really unorganized and people were everywhere. Once we were sat, the server did a bad job of explaining what the dishes were to me. I am not familiar with Cuban food so I had a lot of questions, but it looked like she was getting annoyed so I just ordered something from the menu that sounded familiar. Once the food arrived I started sampling the dishes (empanadas, chuletas, cuban, and some potato muffin) and was not impressed with any of the 4 dishes we ordered. I sat there and watched them eat the food and could not wait to get to Maxwell Street since I was starving by this point. I am definitely not going back to this place.
