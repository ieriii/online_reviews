I was very surprised by my experience at Bin 36, which is right beside the House of Blues. Like others, I had read mixed reviews, but a friend from Kentucky was visiting Chicago with four other people and invited me out for dinner. The place wasn't too crowded for a Saturday night. Three of us arrived early and sat at the bar before being seated. They didn't hassle us about seating and gave us the option to seat without the full party or sit at the bar while waiting. The bartender was very helpful in helping me decide on a wine. I went with the "well-traveled wines" flight of white wines. [Being a wine idiot, I love places that offer flights]. Our server was excellent. She helped us make decisions. The others had oysters and mussels as an appetizer, but I passed. I was in the mood for fish as my entree, and our server recommended the blue marlin. I thought it was excellent, coming with mashed potatoes, super thin onion rings, and a beet sauce(?) that was very good. Others ordered the steak which I tried and was excellent!! The halibut was also good. One member of our dining party also ordered marlin (medium rare), and it was overcooked, but they were kind enough to bring another plate for her, which was also a bit overcooked. The server said she was happy to comp that dish for us. Along with the overcooked marlin, she ordered kale, instead of the mashed potatoes and onion rings like I had. The kale was excellent! We passed on dessert but was given a white and dark chocolate plate with our check. Overall, this place was very good. I had a great time talking and laughing with friends, old and new. I just hope some of the other guests didn't overhear parts of our conversation. I travel with groups that tend be very inappropriate, making for a great time.
