I now dream about this restaurant. Love the atmosphere, attitude, food, drink...there is seriously nothing wrong with this place. Pork rinds are a must. And I love that they even included pork rinds in their menu. All their food is totally accessible, yet made and served with thought and class. The bathrooms were really cool too- went along with the communal feel of everything.
