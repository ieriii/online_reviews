Am I the luckiest guy in the world to have this wonderful restaurant move into our slightly forgotten section of the city? I think I am. After a casual bike ride we stopped in for a late lunch on afternoon and were thoroughly impressed. The staff was very nice, and our lunch was followed by a visit from the owner, whom we have talked to on consequent visits, to make sure everything was great. How often does that happen??? It was indeed a pleasant and most welcome surprise. The main patio in front is large and fun.  The inside is small and cool, the back four season patio is like a vacation. The food is phenomenal! I wish I could go into more depth, but I can't resist ordering the Cubano sandwich every time we go. I swear next time I will try something else! I can say the empanadas and Cuban coffee would be a perfect start and finish to any meal there. I will return.
