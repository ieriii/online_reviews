Healthy? You're kidding me right? Well. Yay. Ok I get it. Honestly, one sip of their nummy lentil soup and my digestion does become 2 thumbs up! Oh, dont judge me! Cleanliness next to godliness, right? And they weren't talking about your hands! This place does rocks...they have amazing hummus, a salad bar that makes me all giddy inside (capers, shrimp, AND fava beans- pinch me!) wonderful falafel- when I am craving a ball of fried chick peas, and if someone doesnt give me their lentil/ rice recipe- rioting will commence. No offense workers of the sultan, but sometimes you are a tad daft and I understand you've had a long day of serving delicious vittles, nevertheless it hard to get your attention when its just me at the counter and you are all huddled in the back talking about last night's shenanigans. I know I'm just am a lowly gal from the hood but man, girl needs her lentil fix!
