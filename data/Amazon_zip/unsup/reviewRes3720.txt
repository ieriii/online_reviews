If I were stuck on a deserted island and could only have 5 things to eat, I think that chicken wings would be one of them! (That, along with french fries, lobster, chaco tacos and popcorn.) And, I would definitely have Crisp provide them for me. The wings are big and juicy and very, very fried. Okay, so not the healthiest thing to eat but still mighty good! I opted to be boring and went with the plain chicken wings. They were anything but plain, but didn't really have sauce on them... which I like. I am a fan of buffalo wings, but didn't feel the buffalo mood that evening. I thought the flavors of the wings were perfect... not too salty but not bland, either. And again, they are HUGE! I don't like eating the drumstick parts so I just left those so I would have room for the other part of the meal. I also tried the Buddha bowl with bulgogi (bibimbop). Again, the portion on this was massive! You would have to share it for sure. I have never been a huge bibimbop fan, but for what it is, I thought it was tasty! It was a nice pairing with the chicken wings because it seemed a bit healthier. I also tried the Seoul Sassy wings and was really not a fan. It's not that it wasn't good, it is just that I am more of a salty person rather than a sweet person. Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. They have communal seating and paper towels for their napkins. Totally casual and totally cheap. There were a lot of people getting their food to go which seemed like a good idea. I probably have to wait awhile before I indulge again in the yumminess of the wings. It's a little too heavy to be eating too much of. Next time, I am going to try the Korean burritos, as those looked rather tasty.
