mountains and mountains of side dishes!! keep em coming! wrap your tongue, teeth and gums over the yumminess that is brought before you. heed my advice and you will not regret it! then wash it down w/ some so-ju and you will leave there with a well-deserved smile and (more) hair on yo chest (from the so-ju). i like how the koreans use lean beef in their dishes. if it looks like meat, then slap that muthafugga on the grill!! and after you feel as if you have amply stuffed your belly, order another round!!!
