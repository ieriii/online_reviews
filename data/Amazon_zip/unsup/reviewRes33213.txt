Yummy! I hate when you get flavorless melon for your fruit choice, but not here! Fantastic fruit salad with my eggs benedict. Loved it! Very busy but they have a HUGE staff. Service was very quick. Comfy booths. Great coffee. Will be back when I'm in the city. We didn't wait at all, but we were very early on a Saturday morning.
