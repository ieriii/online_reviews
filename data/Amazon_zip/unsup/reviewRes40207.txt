Went Sunday at 11 am and waited about 40 minutes in the crowded entry area. Food was worth the wait. We had the Crab Benedict and the Market Scramble with greens. Coffee was great too. The ambiance was a step down from Lula just due to the constraints, but the food was on par. Will definitely go back to try dinner during a weeknight.
