I think this place was too hyped up and it ended up in a big disappointment. I came here with some coworkers for happy hour/dinner. They all love this place and I've heard nothing but great things as well. I think what people need to understand are the different types of pizza styles. Piece serves new haven style pizza, which until then, I realized I'm just not a big fan of. The crust is thin and stale textured, there's barely any sauce, but mostly flavored with cheese, garlic, and olive oil (white pizza). The red pizza was a little better. The pizzas are cooked in a coal oven. I thought overall, the pizza was really dry and lack a lot of flavor. I can see how pizza from Piece can be healthy. They were really busy on a week night and they messed up our order, but we ended up getting a pizza for free. I really love new york style the best and if you are like me, don't come to Piece with any expectations.
