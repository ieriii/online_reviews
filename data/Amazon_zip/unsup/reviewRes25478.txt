The one time I went to Mercat, we ordered the chef's tasting menu. I had a dietary restriction - I do not eat pork - and as my two friends did, I didn't want my restriction to affect them. The chef did an great job by tailoring our selections so there were only a couple of small plate items I couldn't eat. The restaurant was bustling when I went, so I really have to commend the chef for being able to be so flexible and keep everything straight without a hitch. I barely reviewed the menu before deciding on going with the chef's selection. Unfortunately cannot recall the names of the dishes I ate, as they provided several small plates within several courses. Just about everything was delicious - I left with a very happy tummy. Beautiful ambiance, attentive service, phenomenal food equated to an excellent meal. I would come back!
