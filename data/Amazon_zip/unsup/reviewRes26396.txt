Went for the first time yesterday with a group of friends. We had a reservation, but they didn't have a table for us for another half an hour. The restaurant is tiny. The food was okay; I didn't think the quality of any of the items we ordered was particularly high. The fondue cheese was okay, the bread was not fresh, the fruit was not great; the raw foods were okay, the vegetable selection was poor; the dessert chocolate was okay, the flaming marshmallows were neat, the rest of it was just all right. Nothing was outstanding. And that's why I'm giving them two stars. For the quality of the food, this place is crazy expensive, and the service was just average. I can dip low-quality food in boiling oil at home, and maybe it won't be as romantic there, but it definitely won't be as expensive, and I'll at least be seated far enough away from the oil not to get it all over my clothes. Meh indeed.
