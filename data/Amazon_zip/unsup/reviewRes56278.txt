I love everything about this place! Great fresh Vietnamese food. Very, very, very nice owner, family and staff. Service is extremely friendly. When your check comes you are stunned at the terrific value. it's BYOB. And it's a very nice room. Add it all up and it is a hard to beat combination. My particular favorites: ANY of the wonderful soups. The Fisherman's Soup is great and very flavorful. I really like the curry noodles. The Banh Mi sandwiches are all terrific. This is one of my favorite places to eat in this city overflowing with great places to eat. I eat here at least once a week, which is saying a lot when there are so many places to choose from.
