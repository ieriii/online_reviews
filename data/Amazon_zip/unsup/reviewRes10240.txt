Food is excellent, simple Italian--the sort of dishes you'd find at a typical trattoria. Well executed, reasonably priced, and accompanied by excellent service in a beautiful room next to an open kitchen with a wood-burning oven. Definitely my style. Most of the negative reviews seem to correlate with a busy dinner rush. I didn't experience any of those problems at my late lunch. In fact, the place was almost empty.
