Love it Love it Love it! .... ...Ok fine that's not really enough of a review. Let me say, the food is great, worth the extra $'s. The menu is smaller than other places, but it forces you to try things you've never had before or never thought about trying. As much as I hate those pesky fungi I've found a new appreciation for them at Sapori! Their Butternut Squash Ravioli is excellent and their mushroom risotto is also pretty fabulous.I'd say they have some pretty tasty options for vegetarians! The ambiance is really nice, but the only thing that bothers me is the seating arrangements. The place is very small and really crams everyone into a tiny space. The last time I was there I was with my bf and we were sat next to a few loud babies and their parents. I guess I can live with crammed seating, but it does create problems when you're trying to get a seat without a reservation. You should keep in mind you probably will have to wait a bit.  Service was equally as great as the food, and I say I will definitely be back many more times to come!
