My doctor booked my sleep study at this location, thinking it would be better than the sterile environment of a sleep clinic. Well, I've had to deal with drilling in the walls starting at 11:30pm. It's now 1:38am, and this has been going on every 30 minutes for 10-15 minutes at a time. I have taken video evidence, as this is ridiculous. When I called down to the front desk, I was told that the owner's brother was doing the construction and that it would not stop. I reminded them that their core business is having people pay to sleep in their facility, and that drilling in the walls late at night goes against it. He said there was nothing he could do. Never again will I stay in this pit, where they don't value business.
