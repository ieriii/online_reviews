walking by glens you might not know it but... inside is a magic place that could easily be found in east coast ocean side town. the food was amazing [ I had a bowl of new england clam chowder and poor boy shrimp sandwich ] . my server was real kind and nice.. this is going to be my weekday lunch spot for now on
