Get pepperoni on your deep dish. Trust me, it's worth the extra calories.  Also important to note: Lots of cops in this joint, which reaffirms my opinion that Chicago's Finest know how to sniff out good grub. And if you're under 21, it's probably not a good idea to try to pass off a fake ID with the po-po all up in here.
