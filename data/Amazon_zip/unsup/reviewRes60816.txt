Zed 451 Is a really unique spot to visit! I'd never been to a restaurant like this except for a Brazilian steakhouse. First off, my favorite thing about the restaurant is the service. Our server was Garren, this really friendly guy with a good sense of humor. He knew the menu from all sides and could answer all my questions without needing to ask. All the chefs that come out bearing various meat offerings once you lay your stone out were also friendly, knowledgable, and a diverse kitchen staff. (all ages, ethnicities, etc). They also taught us proper etiquette for taking the meats from the Kebaps or plates. (which in case you are wondering , the tongs are only used to grab the red meats).The harvest bar was an interesting appetizer bar with soups, breads, small salads, meats and cheeses, etc. definitely try the miso soup with pork belly and the watermelon, arugula, and feta salad. My two favorites. Also delish was the truffle butter with thinly sliced baguette. Mmmm. Unlimited meat that came around was also delish, but go light on the harvest bar if you plan on eating the main courses! The duck and the pork stomach were my favorites. And, because I'm such a lush, I saved my favorite part of any dining experience for the end - the cocktails. The cocktails here are updated regularly and are creative little twists on everyone's favorites. Fan of vino? Definitely hit this up because their selection is endless. I had the white peach sangria and it was deliciously light and refreshing. Yum. A little sweet for me as I prefer dry wine, but the sangria paired perfectly with my harvest bad selections.
