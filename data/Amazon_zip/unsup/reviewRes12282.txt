"They have the best butter I've ever tasted" I said to one of my friends as we were desperately trying to fulfill our need for a good steak with a latin flare. My friends responded with dirty looks of disgust and worry for my mental health. But they do (and my friends agreed)! It's just served with normal bread before your meal, I dunno what it is it's sweet but has a kick to it - I forgot what the waiter told me it was when I asked the first time I dined there. Anyway, besides the butter I've had the Almond Crusted Halibut and (that night) Bistec a La Cubana. Both were delicious dishes! The Jalapeno mashed potatoes were very yummy. The bistec portion was VERY generous, well cooked and seasoned although if you're not a big fan of beans don't forget to mention that to your server (the bistec was literally floating on a sea of it). I love beans, my friend uh not-so-much. For dessert we had the tres leches cake and some sort of chocolate dish. Both were good, I was a bigger fan of the tres leches cake, it wasn't drenched (as they usually are in most places) so i really enjoyed that. Our server told us that their pastry chef makes all the desserts at home then brings them in. I didn't give it a five because of their service. The place itself is nice, romantic atmosphere, dimmed lights, white table clothes and all. Both times that I've come here, the servers have made me feel like I dont belong (I'm kind of young looking). I don't quite know how to explain it. But other than that, I would come here more often :)
