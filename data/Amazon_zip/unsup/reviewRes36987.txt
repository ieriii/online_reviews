This very popular gastropub does not disappoint when it comes to beer. I tried Hopleaf on a late Sunday afternoon and the place was full. This makes the service less than stellar. It fits the bill of a typical Belgian cafe. The beer list is not a list but a book. The menu isn't huge but includes mussels, fries, and other pub food. My friends I nash-ed on a ham sandwich and fries. The waitress said it had won "Best Sandwich in the city." It was fine to snack on but not an award winner. It was greasy and I couldn't eat it by myself. I wish they offered more tasting flights. I got the sense that unless you are sitting at the bar, it is complicated to just get a tasting of the various beers. As for ambiance, the exposed brick and high ceiling in the back is pretty and makes it feel like a drinking hall. There is also a patio out back. Overall, this is a nice spot to get hopped on some craft beers, but I'd eat somewhere else.
