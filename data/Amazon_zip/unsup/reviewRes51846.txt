Ok, so 20 years ago I was younger and new to Chicago, but I don't think my memory has gone yet.  It seemed like I recalled good food and great atmosphere. So when I recommended to a coworker, who was in town with me, that we go eat there, I had high hopes. We were greeted at the door by a very efficient young lady, but it sort of served as the high point.  I used to think it's hard to mess up a calzone, but now I know it can be done. First, it was served as a white (no sauce or brown on the crust) lump on a bare white plate. Think mashed potatoes on one side of a white plate with nothing, nothing, else. No garnish, sauce, or even some taco meat sprinkled about for effect. Not a great meal, but I guess still fun to look around inside. Nothing lasts forever.
