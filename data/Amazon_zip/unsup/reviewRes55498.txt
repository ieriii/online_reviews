I hate to give Piccolo Sogno 5-stars because it's already crowded enough, but I have to be honest, the food was great as well as the service. It reminded me of another favorite nearby, La Scarola, only newer and bigger with a more eclectic menu.Reservations are usually tight so plan well in advance. See you there!
