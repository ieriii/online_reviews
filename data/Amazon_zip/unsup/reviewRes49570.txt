I have never been a "steak" kinda person. I mean, ordering it "rare" or "medium"...what is up with that?  Just give me pork or chicken or seafood and I'll be happy. But, lemme tell you...after my meal at Las Tablas, I'm considering converting to be a steak lover! It was THAT amazing. Their Entrana (or skirt steak) was super juicy, packed with flavor and just sooo gooood. It's also served with yuca, potato and plantains for $19! Whew. Their trio of empandas (chicken, beef and cheese) weren't that exciting, though. The cheese was the best, by far...and that's a little disappointing. The doughy crust was a little too greasy for my liking. My mojito ($8) was pretty good, but I think the BYOB option is a bigger draw here. Every group I saw walk in were clutching multiple bottles of their favorite wine. But, be warned - there's an $8 corkage fee Thursday - Sunday! (More than my favorite bottle of Barefoot Moscato. Sad, I know!) The atmosphere is great for either a big group or intimate dinner. I was a fan of the dim lighting. Service was pretty solid,too - the waiter even brought out candles for the birthday cake we brought, without charging us extra! Niice!
