Let's see, I LOVE Barbeque. I make it, I eat it, I LOVE it. Was very skeptical of an "upscale" joint, but will definitely give this place a second look. Brisket was on point, as was the mac and cheese, cornbread and the smoked wings. Non-competition ribs were so so, but was so blown away by the brisket that maybe I didn't give them a enough of a chance. Nice bourbon selection as well and very nice presentation to boot. Going back to try the competition ribs...or may just stick to the brisket because...did I mention I loved the brisket?
