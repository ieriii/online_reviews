I finally made my maiden voyage to Violet Hour last night after it had taunted me for months. Every time I planned to go, the line was so long, but I knew my time would come eventually. Well, fellow Yelpers. It came last night. And it was as wonderful as I thought it would be. If you've never been to Violet Hour, do yourself a favor and take a few suggestions from the VERY knowledgeable and helpful servers. After my first round of some sort of delicious brandy cocktail called the Miraflores, our server suggested a sipping cocktail with Liquor 43 base and hints of orange, vanilla, and something vaguely floral. The result was one of the best cocktails I've ever had in my entire life... Boozy, strong, delicious. We also ordered a few appetizers including a sampling of 3 sandwiches and the tempura green beans. The sandwiches were outstanding, but rich, so if you have a sensitive tummy, you may want something a bit lighter. The tempura green beans were to die for. Highly recommended. Now that I know Violet Hour opens at 6pm daily, I'll stop in after work for a cocktail and a few appetizers. The lines keep me from attempting a Saturday night excursion (unless you go ridiculously early), but keeping Violet Hour in my weekday rotation will be something to look forward to.
