This place is a treasure.  1. BYOB. Woo hoo! 2. So ridiculously affordable, literally every time I've eaten here, I've been shocked, SHOCKED, at how small the bill was.  3. You will not find a nicer, more attentive wait staff in the city (without paying considerably more). These guys are funny, accommodating and attentive. You kind of want to hang out with them later.  4. Delicious. Palmito salad is a revelation (and enormous). Fish tacos never disappoint, Chicken tico, a delight. Chifrijo, amazing. Oatmeal shake, oh my god.  5. Patio area, a fine perk. 6. Delivery! Seriously, to like the entire city of chicago. Check it out. Don't miss out on the fun, a great place for a small group and a six pack (or two) on a summer evening (or whenever). Be prepared to wait a little on the weekends, but tables turn fast.
