Good food, good wine, good value, and GREAT place for groups! I came with 10 other people and we were seated at a nice long table upstairs. We started with the quattro stagioni pizza which had proscuitto, artichoke, mushroom, olive, & egg. It had a crispy crust, lots of savory thinly sliced proscuitto - and the raw egg that cooked on top of the hot pizza just made it awesome. For my main course, I ordered the salmon fresca which came with lots of chopped asparagus, avocado, and tomatoes. Unfortunately, I forgot to tell them to not include the avocado and was not expecting it to be diced in everywhere. Despite this, I managed to enjoy my dish as it was fresh and light-tasting. Of the pasta dishes, I found the gnocchi to be really good - great texture and perfect chewiness. Portions are huge and no one was able to finish any of the pasta dishes. Despite this, a few of us found room for dessert. My friend and I decided to split 2 scoops of gelato and found both the white coffee and the pistachio really delicious. The chocolate lava cake and the banana cake were both too sweet and dense for my taste, but this sentiment's probably compounded because I was so stuffed from my main course. We paid about $45pp including tax, tip, and 3 bottles of wine. Would definitely come here again!
