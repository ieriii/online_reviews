The duck is amazing. Be advised you have to call a day in advance. You get tons of food with it too- soup, fried rice and dessert. They bring little buns that you put the duck meat on so you can make little sandwiches. I would highly recommend doing the duck meal. Feeds 4 people. The other food we ordered I thought was okay- Pretty standard Chinese food.
