The Gage is a perfect place in Chicago - perfect for location to bring out of town guests and clients and perfect to meet friends for happy hour or a fun week night dinner.  My last meal here was so fabulous. It was a deconstructed steak salad with watermelon, nuts and greens. The steak was cooked perfectly and the watermelon complemented it perfectly. We started with the stuffed peppers. They were mini sweet peppers in red sauce ... so fab!
