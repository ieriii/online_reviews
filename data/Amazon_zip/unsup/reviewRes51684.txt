We end up at Garcia's every couple months and then kind of remember why we haven't been in a while. There's nothing really wrong with Garcia's, even less now with the renovation: open space, better lighting, expanded bar, but they still make a very unauthentic margarita with extra sweet and sour mix. Juice some limes, yo! And the burritos, while huge, are kind of dry- chez dom delouise a few blocks further north on Lincoln is cheaper and tastier...and unfortunately a much more awkward place to sit down for a meal.
