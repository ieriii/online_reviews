I think Hot Doug's is more about the new and different, rather than super taste. After waiting half an hour (Saturday morning) to get into the door, and while looking at the menu, there was no way for me of actually visualizing what I was about the receive. I've never tried most of the sausages, let alone the exotic toppings that went with it. After randomly choosing a dog that sounded different but decent, we waited. I was surprised when I received my dog. I've never seen or tried anything like it, but it was good. The tastes were different, unique and tasty. But more than the dog, the duck fat fries were awesome. The texture and cut of the fry reminded me of In N' Out fries, but the duck fat gave it a duck fat taste. (I couldn't taste it, but that's how a friend described it). I was pleasantly surprised, however I feel that a place that serves something really good, end up only serving that item. Hot Doug's has an extensive menu, but nothing was absolutely out of the world superb. But it was an experience.
