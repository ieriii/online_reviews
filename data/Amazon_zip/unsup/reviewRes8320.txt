I don't know why Oprah was raving about Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix when the real awesome pizza is right in her hood. Our party ordered the Zucchine alla Scapece (grilled zucchini served cold) and Prosciutto e Bufala (prosciutto with buffalo mozzarella) to start. I wasn't a fan of he zucchini but the mozzarella was on point- fresh and creamy. I ordered the Salsiccia Pizza (Fior di Latte Mozzarella, Basil, ltalian Sausage). The personal sized pizza had a thin crispy crust that was pretty good minus the burned parts when cooked in a brick oven. The cheese and toppings slipped and slid across the slices and had to be man-handled at times. I wished the pizza was pre-cut though but maybe I was just lazy. They also offer some pretty affordable desserts ranging from $4-8 which is nice especially since the apps and pizzas were pretty pricey ($9-16) but I guess it's alright considering the high quality of food you're getting.
