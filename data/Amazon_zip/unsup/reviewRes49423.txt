Love it. Yummy wine and more yummy wine followed by more yummy wine and then a little over priced tiny portion food, which is ok because it leaves room for... more yummy wine... and some awesome cheese... and more yummy wine and oh... yeah... I have to go to work tomorrow... damn. But the best part is that when you have lost the ability to articulate full words the wines are numbered, so holding up fingers or just randomly pointing at the correct section of the menu gets you more yummy wine. leeeuuuuyyvvv it!!
