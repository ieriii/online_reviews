We came around 11:30am on a Saturday morning and didn't have to wait in line. Thankfully we arrived before the crowds because around 11:40am we had about 10 people in line behind us. Pheew! We ordered the Saturday special Goat Barbacoa which was Braised goat, Oaxacan pasilla-tomatillo salsa, avocado, onions & cilantro. We also ordered the pork belly vermicelli which was Crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra. It was all really good. The pork belly vermicelli was spicy but had great flavor. Food was prepared relatively quickly, about a 10-15 minute wait. They offered outside seating, but with winter coming soon, it may be limited to inside soon, which only seats 40. So glad we were able to eat something other than churros!
