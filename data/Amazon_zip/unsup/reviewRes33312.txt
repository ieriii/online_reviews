I've been to Yolk twice. The first time I thought it was very good. The endless cups of coffee were amazing, but the second time... eh, not so much. I don't know if the number of people on the weekends has affected Yolk (since I know they have three locations), but the quality of some of the food has decreased. I love breakfast foods and I don't think they can be done wrong, but I found the potatoes bland and dry. My meal, which to be honest wasn't one of the most elaborate meals, was ok. I guess I can't expect too much from eggs because in the end they're just eggs. The french toast was very good, that I admit. I'm sorry to say but Yolk has become an upscale Denny's or IHOP, and again this may all be due to the weekend crowd.
