Pizza and beer! Great pizza and even better beer! My favorite microbrew in the city always has a great selection of beers and offers my second favorite selection of thin crust pizza. The wait can seem excessively long but it's worth it. This is a great place to enjoy food and drink with many friends. And if you need to karaoke go there on Saturday when they have a live band to back up those sweet vocals of yours..
