Absolutely love this place. I have eaten here for brunch and dinner probably over two dozen times and have never, not once, been dissapointed. Service has always been at least good if not excellent.  Sunday brunch is the best in town. Breakfast burrito, egg benedict crab cake, cuban omelet, mexican steak and eggs-all to die for.  For dinner, my fav is the honey glazed pork chop, ceviche app, pappas rellenas app, cuban chicken and steak dish.  Great date place, eat on patio if in season. Owners are warm and friendly and quickly learned my name and the names of my family.
