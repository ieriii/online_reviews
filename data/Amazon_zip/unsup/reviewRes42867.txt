14 pan pizza is the only thing i have ever eaten from here and I will probably never venture off. Easily the best pan in the city. The crust, oh my its so good. And it keeps well even after two days. They deliver pretty far too which is a good thing, or a bad thing since me and the gf order it about once a week. Not too expensive and they always bring a liter of pop, boo to diet pepsi though. Only gripe is that the delivery is sometimes close to 90 minutes so be prepared to wait at busy times.
