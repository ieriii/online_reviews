This place is top noch. I made reservation at the last minute, and they were more than accommodating. Paul Ritchie, I think he was manager, was awesome. He was attentive to every table, and the place was packed. The wait staff with the team concept of waiting on tables , was a mirror reflection of good management. Even the guys who brought out the cuts of meat, often ask if they could do the extra whatever to make dining there enjoyable. Oh I almost forgot, for the price with all the sides and salad included, you can't go wrong. Great food
