Great selection of products, however due to it's amazingly trendy/touristy location, you pay up the a** for the stuff here. Anyone who does a lot of shopping here must have their chaffeur waiting outside in the Bentley... I can't justify shopping here when a trip to Whole Foods is more than adequate for me to throw some dead president's down
