I had written a fabulous review for this establishment but lately I've been either having "bad luck" or something is changing here and it's not for the better. We had two deliveries that forgot the pita bread. The second delivery not only forgot the bread, the cook forgot to season the dill rice!! At the restaurant, the dill rice had a metallic taste to it. I've been going to noonokabab for a long time and it NEVER had that taste. Then the last time we got a pick-up, the seasoning for the dill rice was changed. They said they lowered the salt content. It was ok but not as outstanding as I'm used to. I may stop going here and go back to Reza's...
