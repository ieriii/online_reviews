Again, like my review of The Girl & The Goat, I feel like everything in Chicago is salty. That being said, Purple Pig is a good place to eat. It's fun, lively, and the menu is broad. The only disappointment is the bone marrow spread. I thought it'll be some kind of spread instead of the cooked version of straight bone marrow inside the bone.
