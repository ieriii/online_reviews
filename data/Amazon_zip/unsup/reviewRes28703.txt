I've eaten here probably a couple dozen times over the years, and I don't remember a bad meal. BYOB a plus, and the Leland liquor store next door has plenty of libations (and their bar is a perfect place to wait for a table), If you want it spicy, ask; a lot of "farangs" (foreigners in Thailand) eat here.
