my first impression walking in was, 'whoa i can't see anything.' that's because you literally cannot see in the darkness until you let your eyes adjust for a few minutes. pretty standard river north crowd. lots of broskis out to find a honey and girls ready to smash by the end of the night. as expected, food was expensive, but surprisingly delicious. the fettucini with braised short trips and mushrooms was heavenly. the spicy pork sausage pasta was just as good. i wish more food came with the price tag, but it was definitely very good/fresh food.
