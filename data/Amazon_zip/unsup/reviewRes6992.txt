Love it!! I have been here before for various birthday parties. We went here over the weekend to use a YouSwoop coupon that we had purchased in the winter. The printer was not working but I spoke with the manager and was able to show my coupon via my phone. The bread is always amazing (and served HOT) and we shared the mixed green salad with cheese, raspberries, apples and a mustard vinegrette--which was quite good. Split the mushroom risotto which was rich and delicious! It was nice change from the regular pasta meals. I think that I would even go back to try some of the fish dishes. The ambiance was nice and romantic and the service was great. I was really pleased with our date night. Easily accessible from the Diversey El stop or the Halsted bus
