Totally worth the wait! Snuck into the bar and sat at a teeny-tiny tall top without much of a wait on a Wednesday evening. The service was great, waiter was very helpful and entertaining. We started off with the guac, yum! Nice bright, fresh flavors. I had the chef's daily special, roast suckling pig in banana leafs. So tender and flavorful, the tortillas (house made?) were fantastic.  Coworker had the chicken mole and also loved his meal. I would go back in a heartbeat, a really wonderful meal.
