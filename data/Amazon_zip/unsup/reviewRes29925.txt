Recently rediscovered Third Coast after a long hiatus from Chicago. Part cafe, part wine bar, part bistro, Third Coast is in a class of its own. Its one of a handful of "cafes" that truly takes its food seriously. The menu is both large and diverse. You can order anything from hummus to salads to pizzas. My personal favorite is the coronation chicken salad with its interesting yet tasty curry and raisin combination. Homemade baked goods are also very good including the carrot cake and scones. But food aside, the Third Coast is a great place to bring friends. Perhaps its the dimly lit room, comfy seats and plush carpeting, but for whatever reason, the later it is, the better the place gets, and the more engaging conversations become...
