I loved it, I took a date on a Tuesday and we both ate a ton and had a great time. What makes this especially telling is that my date was a Cuban woman who was complaining about how there was no good Cuban food in Chicago. From the moment we walked in we were in a great environment, The staff was super nice and the food smelled amazing, and the lighting was just right. The live band was also a very nice touch, but they were loud to the point that it was hard to hear my date. We both had the Chicken soup which was great (but we had only asked for cups and were given bowls). We both enjoyed our dinner plates, I had the Ropa Vieja and she had the Mesa de Puerco. Plus we brought a bottle of wine (I almost forgot to mention that they were BYOB). If someone invites, you please make the trip, you will not regret it. We ate a ton, and had a good bottle of wine, for $75 with tip. Not bad at all.
