consistently excellent sushi. it takes a lot to get me to venture outside my walkable world of bucktown & wicker park, and wakamono is totally on my list of taxi-fare-worthy locations. the atmosphere is very chic without being pretentious, the food is always delicious (my fave is the emerald roll), and i LOVE the piece of wrapped candy they give you with the bill. i was going to dock them for the new $5 per bottle corkage fee but, i can get over it.
