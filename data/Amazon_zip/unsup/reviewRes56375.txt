My girlfriend and I have been eating at Simply It for just over a year and decided today that we had to put the word out on how great this place has been!The service is great. Everyone is very helpful and extremely polite. The food is definetly the best Vietnamese food you can find in the Lincoln Park area. Anything you order from the menu will be great. Friends have given us the same reviews when they have gone there. On any given night this is the place to eat at instead of getting delivery.
