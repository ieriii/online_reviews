I too have had an on again-off again relationship with Calo's. Mainly, because I think it's unpredictable and uneven, from food to service. You might go and have a crabby, old school, know-it-all kinda waiter who is just a wet blanket about everything throughout the evening. Or, you might have a younger, nervous guy who forgets stuff and is frazzled over small things, but lovable just the same. I've never had really good service here, sadly. The pasta could be delicious and satisfying. Or, it could be flavorless/too soft and not authentic. Desserts are ok. Some good, some a tad bland, nothing not good. The bar is usually just ok. Mixed drinks seem to be watery, or crazy strong. So why do I still give it 4 stars? When it's good, it's good. And even the uneven service is ok with me. I'd rather have that than a trendy place with pushy servers and patrons I don't need to be around. I like the atmosphere most of the time, I like that it's been there forever and after 10+ years of coming and going, I will keep giving it another try I 'spose.
