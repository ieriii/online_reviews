This review is for a dinner date back in 2009. (I know, I'm many months too late but I just started yelping!) Mercat a la Planxa had a chef's tasting special for NYE. All I can say is "WOW"! I believe we had about 12 dishes and all of them were small portions, very tasty and filling. Our dinner lasted about a little less than 2 hours because of the multiple dishes served. It was well worth it. Service, food, ambiance were all equally great! I would love to come back here again. *hint hint* :)
