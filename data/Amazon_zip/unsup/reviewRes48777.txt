Amazing dining experience, but go open-minded about the seating situation. You're apt to be sharing your table with other diners. I am not a dessert person, but the powdered sugar waffle with rhubarb sauce paired with the limoncello after dinner drink was great. Also really enjoyed the asparagus, the spinach salad, the amazing grits (from Ashland, VA) and the three ham dish plate.. This is a place I will always recommend to friends who are passing through the windy city.
