Yep, we had our Holiday lunch here again and it was very good this time as well.They have tweaked the menu just a bit ,but still have most of the old favorites.Service was great, as it has been the other times I have been here. Our server was very attentive and informative. Wish it had not been so very noisy so I could have heard his name. I had a glass of a very nice and crisp Savignion Blanc. I love their mini decanters-just a bit off center and unique!I had the fish and chips(I know...I SHOULD have had a Guinness-but I am not an ale gal). The fish was Cod, nicely breaded and served in a newspaper cone, as was meant to be. Very good and a nice malt vinegar to compliment it just right! Had to get that French Toast dessert again, we shared that and the Coffee and Doughnuts dessert. I am still full,no need for dinner. I enjoy the food and service at The Gage.If you are in the area and looking for a casual ,but more upscale bite, drop in.
