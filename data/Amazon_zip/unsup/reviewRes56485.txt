Quite tasty but slightly overrated. And what's with having to call ahead 3 months to get a reservation? I meant the food is pretty impressive but it's 100% packed 100% of the time. We celebrated a birthday at Frontera last week. Everyone seemed to be quite happy with their meal. Specialty drinks were strong, expensive and good. Flautas and desserts were great. So was the mole sauce. I'd go back for another special occasion, assuming I have the foresight to plan 3 months ahead of time.
