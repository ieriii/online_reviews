Awful service. I was here a few weeks ago and was ready for a nice atmosphere. Everything about this place was rushed. I will never go back here. I will not recommend it to anyone. If you are planning on a nice, sit-down place in Greek town, I strongly advise you not to go here. I'm not one for writing bad reviews but the service was so bad that I couldn't help myself. Let it be known, there are plenty of businesses that will treat the customer with respect, unfortunately Greek Islands does not adhere to these standards.
