Four year annivesary of dating... Need a good place to go... Fiancee has never tried good steak in the city? Time to introduce her to Ruth Chris. As always, excellent service, superb quality food, and you definitely feel like you're being catered to the whole time you're there. There was a special they were running while we were there that we ended up ordering, as not only was the price superb, but it gave us a chance to try a variety of dishes in smaller portions. For around $100, it was a meal for two (each pick either salad or soup, each pick a main course, two sides to share, and one dessert to share). Even with all this food, they threw in another dessert for us knowing it was our 4 year annivesary! (Which we ended up taking home, as we were stuffed before the end of the night.) For our main courses, we ended up going with a "main course" sampler which had their stuffed chicken, crabcake, and filet mignon. The plate that it came out on was very crowded, as the three items really took up every inch of space possible. If you can, I would recommend asking for a larger plate so that the foods do not mix as much once you begin cutting. Crabcake: Fiancee - Average Me-Average Chicken: Fiancee - Tasty, would not reorder Me - Agreed Filet Mignon: Fiancee - Can we come back for this again next month??? Me - I don't think I can afford you, dear. =( Chocolate sin Dessert: You've gotta be a chocoholic to enjoy this one... which we both aren't, so after a few bites, we had to pack it up. Delicious, but overwhelmingly rich and smooth chocolate flavors. Apple Dessert: Oh.... now this is something that I could eat everyday. For the rest of my life.  For dessert. After every meal. I am a fan of apple pies/tarts/etc... so the caramel/apple/crust combination really did it for me. Fiancee was impressed, but not as much as I. For special occasions, this is definitely one of the top places to enjoy great food and excellent service.  Will definitely go back in the future!
