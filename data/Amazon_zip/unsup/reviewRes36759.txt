I've been to this place a few times since it opened last year. I love the diverse menu items-- regular breakfast stuff to fancy juices and smoothies and other things. The service is pretty good, but the place can get a bit crowded at lunch on the weekdays and breakfast on the weekends. However, it's worth the wait and it's always an excellent brunch option.
