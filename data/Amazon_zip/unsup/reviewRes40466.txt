A review by a vegetarian! I'm one of those people that just stares with disappointment when my meat-eating friends rave about the beautiful broth in pho. So, having never experienced it, I have been on the hunt for a broth in a vegetarian soup that makes me rave about it. The answer I found was in the rice noodle with curried tofu at Tank Noodle. YUM'O!! The coconut curry broth was nothing short of mind boggling. I also got to try the spring roll (4 stars), the stir fry with cripsy noodles and assorted veggies (4 stars) and the smoothie with mango, custard apple and tapioca (5 stars!!). The restaurant is in a neighborhood with a variety of vietnamese and other pan asian places but, this is by far the busiest and since me and the husband like the food here, we can't wait to be back on weeknights when they aren't so crowded.
