Sandwiches and soups are all really great. The hot chocolate is very traditional and thick, so if you don't know what Mexican chocolate is like, it may be a bit much for you. I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious here. Rick Bayless, thanks for bringing the tastes of the Mexican street and the home to Chicago. This is a great addition to the Frontera/Topolo family. Bottom line: awesome food, but not worth an hour-plus line, which occasionally builds up.
