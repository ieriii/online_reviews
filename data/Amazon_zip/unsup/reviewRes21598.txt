I cannot resist your loinclothed-hotdog siren call, Superdawg. These are my absolute favorite hotdogs in the city. Yes, they're a bit expensive, but for me it's absolutely worth it. The drive-in atmosphere is nice and the small area they have for eating at their tables isn't bad either. I think there's a video on their website where the owner goes into how much he hates ketchup and how it's a disgrace to hotdogs. Personally I love the stuff but you have to respect a man who sticks to his guns. I haven't had much there because I can hardly help but keep ordering my delicious hotdogs with my Crayola kelly green relish. The casings are slightly tougher than your average hotdog but it's because they're natural casings (so far as I know, but if anyone can prove me wrong I'll concede). The fries are always tasty but the onion chips are truly where it's at - the batter on them is fantastic and you don't have to worry about pulling the rest of your onion out of your onion ring (and I hate that). The malts are on the small side for the price but they're absolutely delicious. There's not too many places in the city where you get to eat off of the tray on your car window anymore and the service has always been pretty speedy, even when it's crowded. In summation, I have but this to say : No, thank YOU from the bottom of my pure beef heart.
