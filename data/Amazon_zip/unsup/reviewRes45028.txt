We had a ball last night at this charming Andersonville restaurant! We were immediately won over by our friendly and knowledgeable server who quickly brought out our 7-8 starters that we all shared. The starters come on little plates, like tapas, with a big basket of different breads and breadsticks. It was fun to pass around the little plates and talk about the unique ingredients. They were all so fresh and different. The onion chutney from the salami platter was so yummy. And the farro, corn and polenta/greens plates were delicate yet so filling. I am a vegetarian and found plenty to eat. Even the non-vegetarians praised the vegan starters! I also heard that the calamari, salami platter and shrimp starters were great. The half-order of pasta I ordered for my meal was a little on the small side, so I would encourage diners to order the dinner-portion if you have a typical appetite. The dessert menu offered a seasonal fruit crisp, which was strawberry last night. It came with homemade whip cream and was fantastic. Parking was wide open and convenient, even at 6 pm on a Saturday night, which was a nice surprise. Service was excellent. Loved the experience and would definitely return.
