I love this pizza but I wish that the deliveries didn't come with soda. I would rather pay a dollar less than get the stupid obligatory bottle of soda that I am not going to drink. I have told them not to bring it but the delivery guys don't seem to get it so I have quit arguing. And of course they only have Pepsi products, yecch. But back to the pizza. It is so damn good. The whole pizzas are excellent and well packaged for delivery but the slices may be the best. I love it that this is the closest pizza joint to my house. You have to limit yourself to one slice unless you are a teenage male and then maybe you should just live there.
