We went there over the weekend for a birthday celebration this past weekend and knew there would be trouble from the beginning. Called ahead of time to verify they would not be too busy was told when to come in. Got there 15 minutes prior to reservation. They were extremely busy. Got the last table. The pizza bread came on an ice cold plate. When we told one of the servers that a hot hor d'ourve should not be on an ice cold plate, he took the plate and we do not know where he went with it, but came back and placed the plate down in front of a person and did not say that the plate was extremely hot. The person picked up the plate and burned their fingers. Then the person whose birthday it was ordered the New York Strip steak. When the dinner came, they could not even pierce the steak with their fork and it was full of grizzle. When we mentioned it to one of the owners, he took it away and came back a few minutes later and asked if they wanted something else. The person said no because everyone else at the table was finished. The owner did nothing else. Not even removing the price of the meal for that person. the server tried to talk to the owner, but they were all very busy and told us to talk to someone at the front desk. There was noone there!!!!Do not go to this restaurant on any major Holiday or even 1 week before a major Holiday!!!!!
