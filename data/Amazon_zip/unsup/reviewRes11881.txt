If I were wandering around in the desert for 40 years starving to death and I cried out to God for food, I would earnestly pray that he would make it rain down white chocolate pretzel pancakes and BLT eggs benedict from Bongo Room! Literally, THE. BEST. BREAKFAST. EVER. My friend and I woke up at 7am so that we would be the first few in line and yes, like all the other reviews said, there is a line. Once we were seated we were brought over water right away and our waitress was super cute and friendly. Can't wait to go back and gorge some more!
