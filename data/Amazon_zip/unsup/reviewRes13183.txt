Have written many times regarding Glenn's, yet this time it's not a good one. Mediterranean scramble should have feta cheese, not parmesan. Toast should come with the meal, not 8 minutes into eating. I usually love this place, but this time I was just very disappointed. Will probably only go for dinner.
