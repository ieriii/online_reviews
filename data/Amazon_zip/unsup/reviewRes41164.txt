Big Letdown. Should say that I only dined here once, but I do not plan on coming back. Went on a Tuesday, expecting the 3 course for $30, was informed they just had the 5 course for $40...a little annoying as those extra two dishes were not worth it... amuse of sashimi: good bite "Psychedelic Salad": Not good...a few beans, some daikon and then some sweet stuff and crunchy stuff...it was a hot mess Scallop Motoyaki: delicious, the best course, great flavors Gazpacho: Again, not good...caveat: I don't generally like gazpacho...but even still I only ate half of it and my companion took maybe 3 spoonfuls...fried green tomato was good tho Lamb: My choice...rare ordering mistake of not going with the pig...was ok-good,nothing special, rack of lamb in au jus Trout In a beurre blanc sauce with yummy crust too: Was date's choice, very good dish. Dessert: Chocolate mousse....not usually a fan of overly chocolately dessert, but this was decadent and yummy...mmmm...block of chocolate... Other than that the waiter was schooled well, but a little too well/intense, as he seemed to be making too much of an effort....after learning we didn't like the gazpacho he added an extra bite with a szechuan peppercorn on it, he also was going to bring a substitute dessert, but never did...also, the outside patio was good for a date. The BYOB should make it a 3 star place, but I just left with an annoyed feeling as 2/5 dishes were actually bad, and if I am shelling out over a C note then wtf.
