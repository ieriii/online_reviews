I had been wanting to check out Violet Hour for quite a few months, but finally got around to it this past weekend. We arrived a little before 9pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes before being ushered inside.  Love the soothing blue walls with white accents and chandeliers hanging over the Alice in Wonderland chairs. There are just enough seats for each person in the bar and music is kept to a minimum so that you can actually have a conversation without screaming (imagine that).  The drinks are fantastic and our bartender outstanding. He listened to my limited selection of drinks that I typically enjoy and was able to make something I had never experienced before. The drinks are strong, tasty, and worth the price. The desserts are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I felt so comfortable at Violet Hour and had such an enjoyable experience. The perfect place to go on a Saturday night with great company. I can't wait to go back!
