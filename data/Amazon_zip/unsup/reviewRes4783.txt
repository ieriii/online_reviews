YUM! there's always a long wait, but now i understand why - pigs, pigs and more pigs galore! even if a dish doesn't have pork in it, it's brought out in a pork-shaped bowl so it's still porky! i came here yesterday afternoon past 2PM and had to wait 45 minutes to get seated for a party of four. we were starving, since that was the first thing we'd eaten all day. we quickly gobbled up all the food: - clams in tomato sauce with sausage: the sauce was oh-so-soppable - beets with pistachio vinaigrette: i'm not a huge fan of beets or pistachios, but i have to admit this was quite tasty - milk-braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: this was the money dish - cheese platter: so-so, not my favorite - cauliflowers: delicious morsels of fresh green and purple leaves - fried brussel sprouts: perfectly salted - eggplant parmesan fried balls: not my favorite, but decent - pork sammich with egg: well-seasoned guilty pleasure - burrata: so-so, the cheese itself didn't have a ton of flavor wow, those were quite a few dishes for four people. and trust me, there wasn't even a crumb left at the end of the meal...
