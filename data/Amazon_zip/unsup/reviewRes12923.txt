Took the gf here for her birthday. I have been to fogo de chao several times as well as brazazz. So Texas de Brazil is the only Brazillian steakhouse I have not been to so I was excited to try it. Meats: Delicious, well seasoned (some meats were almost over seasoned). They offer a variety of cuts, but falls short from what Brazzaz has to offer. The meat is however cooked to perfection and served at whatever temperature you like. Salad bar: Lots of choices, but I would say pretty typical compared to the other two. Lobster bisque was okay, way too salty for my taste though. Ambiance/Decor: Was okay as well. The decor was not as nice when compared to the other two places either. Service: Service was good. Last time I went to Fogo De Chao for an anniversary dinner, they comp'd the dessert and did decorations on the cake. They also did that for me for a past birthday at Ruth Chris. But here, I told the waiter specifically that it was my gf's birthday and I mentioned to the host to at least write happy birthday with a candle on the dessert. however none of that was done, so i was a bit disappointed. but the servers were friendly and good at making their stops, refilling water, etc. overall: Pretty average compared to the other two places. I would recommend Fogo De Chao as my #1 Brazillian steakhouse in Chicago.
