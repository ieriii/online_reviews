The kitsch decor, self-depricating owner and fabulously inventive sausage makes this the hands down best hotdog stand known to western civilization. Doug, looking every bit Elvis Costello's long lost brother, throws himself amongst the hoi palloi, working the counter with gusto and providing some excellent customer service. Last weekend I snacked on elk sausage with mustard and sage derby, the time before alligator, and before that buffalo... and just to keep it real I always get a corndog - for $1.50 I just can't bear to turn one down (they even offer a vegetarian corndog option which is nearly as good for the non-carnivores out there). We had a side by side taste test of the regular fries and duck fat fries, and while both good the duck fat fry is worth a couple extra bucks (hey - if mcdonald's made their fries in beef tallow for years, how much can a little duck fat hurt ya?) I've had to wait over an hour to get my order in before, and if I didn't have to wait I'd probably be pissed - pissed that everyone else was stupid and missing out. For my money, the wait just increases the expectancy, and helps you savor the sausage all the more. Just think of it as waiting in line for a roller coaster - a 30 minute wait for a couple minute thrill. Ah... but what a thrill it is.
