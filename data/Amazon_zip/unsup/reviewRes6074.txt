Davanti Enoteca is Little Itlay's not so hidden gem, especially if you dine at the right time (ie exclude Wed-Sat 4PM-close unless you want the standard wait which usually isn't even that bad anymore). Stop in Sat and Sunday afternoons and head straight for the new upstairs outdoor patio dining that will leave you wondering why anyone would sit inside on a beautiful spring afternoon. The wine is generally a great deal as the "corkage fee" is cheap and pulled directly from their "store" which may just be a clever way to get around some strange liquor laws. Its a great way to make patrons happy and keep the bill reasonable. Go for something off the great Italian wine list. As for food, its always been great for me. Definitely start with several of the house bruschettas and try a few other small plates and woodfire pizzas. Some of my favorites: Salad: Escarole + gala apple + pecorino dolce + celery + hazelnuts Pizza della Fattoria: Farm egg + pork belly + potato + scallions + asiago + bechamel Pizza con Salsiccia e Rapini: Italian mild sausage + broccoli rabe + garlic + chili oil + fresh mozzarella + tomato Bistecca con Funghi e Ravenllo: Grilled hanger steak + saba marinated oyster mushrooms + roasted radish + salsa verde Davanti Burger: beef burger + bacon jam + roasted tomato + cheese curd + arugula + roasted garlic mayo + shoestring fries The biggest surprise at the end of the meal is usually the seemingly impossibly low bill that never makes sense how it is not any higher. I always feel a bit dirty thinking Im stealing from Davanti. Davanti is a great deal and a high quality choice in Little Italy.
