Here is the update on this hotel after my stay this last weekend. I can really tell they are working hard on their customer service skills...this time was alot better and if I was coming in without the bad experiences, I would probably rate at 4 stars. The restaurant was open at the time we needed with a buffet that was affordable and kid friendly. The front desk manager ( I think), Sarah was extremely welcoming and went above and beyond. This was the biggest improvement of all and I believe the most important. I still have the unresolved phone issue that is affecting my view but maybe by next year, I can get over that. All in all, much better this time. The location is still an inconvenience though.
