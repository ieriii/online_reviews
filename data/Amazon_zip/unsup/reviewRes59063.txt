Having just left a review for a breakfast restaurant that I love, I thought that I would take a moment to write a review for one that was a bit of a disappointment. I only knew about this place from walking by it on Michigan Avenue. To be fair I hadn't heard anything about it at all. I just assumed that it must be good based on the size of the crowd I often see waiting outside. My first problem, as is the first problem with all disappointing restaurants, - the service was awful. Normally I give hostesses and waitresses the benefit of the doubt because I was there once and I am fully aware that sometimes it is simply impossible to serve all your tables well, especially when the place is packed and you are short on staff. The problem here was we went on Tuesday, late in the morning, and we were the ONLY customers there. The waitress came out, asked if we knew what we wanted, we said no, and then we were given a generous menu browsing time of about 20 minutes. The time between ordering and receiving food was equally extreme. My second problem was that the food was OK, it wasn't terrible, but when one goes to a breakfast restaurant and pays ridiculous prices for some fairly simple to make breakfast foods, one expects to be given a fairly good meal. This food was more on par with Denny's on the late late shift. Unfortunately, this time I simply wasn't drunk enough to enjoy it. You never know, I might have just hit this place at the wrong time, so check it out for yourself. But It wouldn't be my first recommendation.
