Oh man...get ready for this people. I've done the Tasting menu (12 courses) once and the Tour menu (yesterday was 29 courses! Took 5 hrs!!!) twice. It's SOOO expensive but worth every penny. The quality of food is out of this world and the way everything is presented to you is nothing short of innovative and simply amazing. The chef can be classified more as a chemist than anything. The way flavors are mixed and presented you is a journey all on it's own. The best meal you will ever have, gauranteed.
