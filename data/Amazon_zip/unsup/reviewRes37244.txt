It had been some time since I had visited The Hopleaf- and in many ways it was like being there for the first time. As others have said- the Hopleaf is a well executed example of what a great neighborhood bar should be. I appreciated that the bartenders the night we visited were efficient and attentive- even though the bar was very crowded. Service all around was excellent and a model of how any business who serves the public should be. We sat at the bar and it was so cool how others around us were friendly and kind. I can't describe it other than it was a feeling of community that seems to be lacking in other bars I have been to. Although Hopleaf is known as a beer bar (with an excellent selection), they do have cocktails and a nice selection of eclectic liquors to choose from. I had the CB&J- it was everything that other reviewers said it was and more. What a great sandwich! Whoever came up with the idea should be given a special award or perhaps 10% of the sale of each one. If you have never tried it, please do. Seriously.
