We went to Crisp a week ago, not knowing what to expect. I thought the food was decent, but nothing overwhelmingly great. They have some cool ideas - i.e. Korean burritos - but I didn't find the actual meals to be anything more than average. I must give Crisp props though for its excellent service. The guys in charge were extremely friendly and sociable, and they made sure we had a pleasant visit. If you like Korean food, you will probably love Crisp. For everyone else, it's worth checking out but don't make it a huge priority.
