Ate here a few times for eat in, delivery, and to go. Seoul sassy wings are the best item on the menu. The sauce is exactly my taste, and wings themselves live up to the name of the restaurant. Delivery was kind of slow and not as good as eating it right out of the kitchen at one of their big picnic-style tables. It can get pretty hectic in there at busy times, which is why I tried delivery, but I think it's worth the wait.
