Heaven, I see you have found a home on Earth, and it's Mayan Palace Mexican Cuisine. I also see that you, Heaven, have reincarnated yourself as a plate of Nachos, half of a plate of Fajitas, and a House Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim. The trumpeting of angels filled the small and dimly lit room as I ingested Nachos which were no doubt a combination of chiuhuahua cheese, instant nacho cheese, and some sort of nectar not typically fed to humans because of it's side-effect of pure euphoria... ...Or maybe that was the House Margarita. It's hard to tell as I was distracted by the visions of Santa Margarita replenishing my glass and San Pascual scooping up lost pieces of steak and placing them in my tortilla. I'm fairly certain that Santa Elizabeth hand fed me this Dinner as children playfully wandered about the Restaurant and dozens of women secretly observed while lounging in hammocks as they quietly glowed and basked in the titillating wasps of the heavenly aromas escaping the kitchen. It was all a blur of bliss until I noticed that the fajitas don't actually come with cheese ... so I just made believe that they did. Really, anything is possible if you can dream it to be true.
