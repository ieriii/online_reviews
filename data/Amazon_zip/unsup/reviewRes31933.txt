I am a meat eater and I love this place.  Not a single dish has disappointed....Love me some Polenta fiesta.  The dessert is great too and the outdoor patio is nice....don't like that you have to walk through the kitchen, but the guys back there were nice.  Don't recommend it for large groups, it can be a bit slow.  But it's a good meal.
