Boy did we get lucky here! We bid on a gift certificate in a silent auction without knowing anything about the place and we went for my birthday the week before it was on Check, Please! What a great dining experience. The service was friendly and informative and the food . . . well the food was incredible. I'm not even going to try and remember all the dishes we had, but I will say ordering the extra Duck, Duck, Goose which isn't part of the tasting menu was an excellent idea (if I do say so myself).
