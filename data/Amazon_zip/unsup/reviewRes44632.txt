This place is good. Went there for lunch. Wait was quick and lunch special ( 1 topping deep dish) came out fast. I'm sure they already have many pre made.  Lunch special was $8.25 with soup or salad and drink. I had spinach stuffed pizza and clam chowder soup. Both very good. Staff was fast and efficient. They were not rude,but not nice either. Just super efficient
