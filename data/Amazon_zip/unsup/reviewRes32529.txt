My fiance and I went to Demera Ethiopian on Saturday night. We had a reservation for 7pm and got there at about 6:30. The host seated us at a table for 2 right near the window. We noticed that the window and the side of the building had a gaping hole from the floor to the ceiling. Being that it was 40 degrees, we asked to be moved. The man seemed annoyed and told us that we'd have to wait. We looked around the restaurant and there were about 8 empty tables. I asked about those tables and the host replied in a very rude manner, and almost yelling at us: "We have thousands of reservations. We have tables of 4 coming at 7pm." I responded that we had a reservation. He responded that we were early and that he couldn't seat us there and we'd have to wait. After about 5 minutes we decided to go to our regular Ethiopian place, Ras Dashen. We told the man that we were leaving and to cancel the reservation and again, he was rude again with his response, in which I could detail here, but the main point is that the man was yelling at us, the customer! I really couldn't believe it!  Not only were we treated very bad, but there is a huge HOLE in the restaurant! I assume there are bugs and rats and other animals running around that place. I am certainly glad that we did not eat there, and we will never eat there. Bad service is one thing that can be hit or miss at a place, but a huge gaping hole? Well, that is another thing.
