Sultans is a tricky, tricky place. Thanks to Sultans, I realized I could eat vegan for lunch and not even realize it. I know, you're thinking, "Say whaaa!?!?!? This from the gal with the beef list?!?!!" Alas my friends, it's true. And I liked it. True story. Raves from my friends didn't get me to this hot spot soon enough. I'm not entirely sure why, being as I'm a HUGE fan of lentil soups and falafel sandwiches. But the word on the street is true, ladies and gents. Sultan is the real deal when it comes to fulfilling your falafel needs. If you wanna get down with some crispy falafel and creamy hummus all married into a soft and delicious pita, this is the spot to do it. I'd also get on the lentil soup bandwagon, having mowed on a large portion alongside my falafel sammie (oh, alright, I kinda shared with my man, but still...). Cheap (cash only, but know before you go), we had a very filling lunch consisting of two falafel sandwiches and a large lentil soup for less than $12. Oh yes. And vegan? I mean, I don't usually swing that way, but as I mentioned before, Sultan is tricky like that. Mmmmm, buy me a monthly pass to this falafel train, I'm hopping on board. Choo choo!!!!
