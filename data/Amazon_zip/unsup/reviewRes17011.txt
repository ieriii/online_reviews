My first experience here will most certainly not be my last. The service was top notch. I was there with family so we all shared appetizers and entrees; everyone's food was perfect and the presentation was nice. Standouts: Mac and cheese with bacon; simple and delicious. Escolar Ceviche; slightly spicy and lots of flavor. Get the sampler and be adventurous. Arrachera; a nice skirt steak, marinated in something wonderful. I wanted another one. Cappuccino; nicely served with a mushroom top of foam and cinnamon. Fruit pie (dessert); excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I've seen this place from the expressway for years and I wish I'd tried it sooner!
