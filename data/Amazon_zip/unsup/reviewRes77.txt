For being the sixth ranked restaurant in the world, Alinea of course delivers top notch creative foods that were mind boggling for the regular diners. I had my highs and lows of my experience there. However, if you're going to spend over $300 on food, do check my complete report http://www.thingsonmytop All in all, I would come back there again, not anytime soon. Maybe, sometime when they change their menu and I have more money to spare.
