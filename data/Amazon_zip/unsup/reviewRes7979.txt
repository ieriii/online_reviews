Words cannot even describe how much I love this place. Words cannot truly capture its wonderful attributes. But I'm sure as fudge gonna try. :) First of all, yes. It's slightly pricey (40-something per person, without drinks, desset, tax, and tip). GET OVER IT! This place is worth every FUCKING penny, let me tell you. But if you're really being a bastard about the price, despite the RAVE reviews and your obnoxious desperation to try this place out, try coming here during the week for their lunch special. It's 20-something bucks per person (without drinks, dessert, tax, and tip). The salad bar is fresh, vast, and delicious. The sides (that are constantly replenished at your table, free of charge) are amazing. Polenta, S-mashed potatoes, and sweet fried banana. The flan (for dessert, obviously) is the best I've EVER had. Ever. I mean it. And the meat...the endless supply of meat repeatedly brought to your table by cordial men in spank-tastic goucho pants...is always cooked to perfection. Every single carnivorous option is superb. Try everything. TWICE! Keep flipping that card over until your plate is piled high with meat. And then when your plate is full...just inhale it all without breathing. Trust me. This is 100% safe and good for your body and health. If you don't like meat...well...what the FUCK are you doing here? Just leave now. This places thrives off of meat-hungry patrons. You do NOT belong here if you don't fall into that category. To sum up my feelings on this place in one sentence: If Fogo de Chao were a dude, I'd totally hit it.
