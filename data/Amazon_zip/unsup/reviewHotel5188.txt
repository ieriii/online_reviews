It all started when the Bellman lost control of the luggage cart and it hit and left a dent in our rental car. Long story short, I had to contact my insurance company and the hotel would not admit liability, They told me I had to get a police report to document the accident for the hotel insurance. If it hadn't been for Mike E. the assistant manager at the Front Desk who called the police and asked them to repond to a non-emergency at the hotel I would have had to give up precious vacation time and go to the police station. It ended up the police came at 11 pm and Mike was there to offer support. The Director of Security ,who is in charge of handling these kinds of incidents, has had limited contact with me and his follow-through has been an email 6 weeks after the incident.To top it all off when checking-out of the hotel, they only charged me for 2 days of parking vs. the actual 4 days I parked. I was honest and paid the bill in full.Do you think that Hotel 71 offered any "good will" compensation for my time and trouble for the what they say was a "training issue" on the part of their employee the Bellman? Nada, nothing Regarding our room, while it is great there are two sinks and the room is spacious, we had to call two times that the bathtub drain was not working and it was never fixed properly during our 4 day stay.
