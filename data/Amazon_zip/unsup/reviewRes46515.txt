It seems like people are reviewing their memories from days past. Well, as someone who wasn't around in the 1970s, I can only review this place on its merits today. We picked this place because it has been a while since we spent a day at the zoo, and I had a LEYE gift card from Christmas still. A "Yowza" burger with sweet potato French fries sets you back $12.50, $5 Blue Moons and Coronas? I think $17+ before tax and tip is asking a bit much for a burger and a beer. The decor is okay, too. The music is a bit much to take... we were treated to the 5 minute version of the Laverne & Shirley. Not my cup of tea.
