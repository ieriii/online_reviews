Would not return to Mia Francesca for a million dollars. A place like this is precisely why Lakeview struggles to hold onto high-quality restaurants in any number (there are a few, such as Chen's). As business has grown, Mia's has become arrogant, disrespectful of customers, rigid in adherence to corporate-style policies, and a 'get 'em in, get 'em out' mentality, a cash cow. A friend made reservations for his wife's 30th birthday here (her favorite place), and all were present in our group but the guest-of-honor's parents, driving in from Iowa in a snowstorm, about an hour away. The manager would not seat our party! Even when we agreed to order food for the missing pair--from a party of 12!--they adhered, ridiculously, to the policy that all must be present. Even the server tried to talk some sense into the management. After waiting about 45 minutes, we went to El Jardin, down the street, instead, where we were welcomed and treated like valued and loyal customers. With service and arrogance like this, Mia's may be doing well now, but it's just a matter of time before this kind of stuff turns people off in large numbers. I say good riddance.
