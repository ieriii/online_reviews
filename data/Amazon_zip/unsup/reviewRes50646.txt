Came here for dinner with friends on a weeknight. It wasn't that busy, but still quite cozy. Andy--who my dining companions knew from previous visits--is an excellent server and helped make our experience even better. But oh, the food! So good. From the well thought-out cocktails on, everything was quite good. The pork belly and fried green tomatoes were well executed and not fatty or greasy. My steak came with fried--yes! fried!--mashed potatoes that were really amazing: crunchy outside and totally light and fluffy inside. Wow. I was disappointed I was so stuffed I couldn't manage to order dessert... oh well, a reason to come back!
