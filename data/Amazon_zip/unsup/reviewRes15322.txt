Oh my dog, their pizza is so damn good. I've tried two varieties (pan and stuffed) on three occasions and it's been great each time. Plus, our experiment in delivery last night was successful - it came well under the quoted time, and it was hot when we opened the box.  The stuffed is covered in sauce, which is great because that's how I like it and also because the sauce is very good. It's not too chunky, which I feel is a weakness sometimes with other deep dish/stuffed places. I am a lover of tomatoes in sauce form, but really do not go for tomatoes in tomato form. Also, the crust is so buttery. It really comes through in every pizza-bite, not just the crust-bites.  The pan is a great example of its type as well. I sometimes feel like pan is a real carbo indulgence, which it is, but then again, sometimes it's totally worth it. For Calo's, I will take the hit and add another lap or set of reps to work it off. Who am I kidding, I don't do sets.  I think we'll be seeing a lot of each other, Calo.
