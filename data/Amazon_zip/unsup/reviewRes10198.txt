If I could tack an exclamation point onto my 5th star I would. This is one of the most delicious and beautiful dinners I've ever had. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary on a very warm night in April. They sat us on their goooorgeous patio in a secluded little corner. So very romantic. We had the grilled calamari and octopus appetizer and it was fantastic. The flavor of the wood fire permeated the food nicely and it was perfect with just a spray of lemon juice. We ordered two pastas in appetizer sizes (I love that they do that, by the way) and they were amazing. You could tell the pasta was all homemade. I had salmon for my entree and the man had braised short ribs. Delicious. Delectable. And any other words that could possibly describe my food-happiness. We ordered a puff pastry custard type napolean for dessert and they wrote "Happy Anniversary" across the plate in chocolate. Nice touch. The wine list was fantastic and my wine snob boyfriend spent a long time perusing and making choices for us. I had a lovely Moscato with dessert and he had something too. Honestly by that time I was in such a pleasure induced fog that I'm not even sure what he had. Special mention goes to our server, Alfredo, who wins my "best server ever" award. It's the only one I've ever given out. He could not have been better. Appropriately friendly and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing. It was the best and most romantic anniversary dinner either of us could have asked for, and I highly HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone in Chicago and possibly the world.
