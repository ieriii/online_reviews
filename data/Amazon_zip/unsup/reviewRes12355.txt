I like the service better at dinner than at lunch, but the food is great. My office is not to far away so it has become the spot for celebrations and good bye lunches.  In the evening the place can really get packed so be prepared for a wait. But the wait at this place gives you the chance to sample some excellent bartender concoctions, like the mojitio. Regarding food, be adventurous, I always go for the fresh catch of the day and have yet to be disappointed. I first experienced Cafe 28, 15 years ago when Irving Park Road and the Brownline (it was called the Ravenswood line at that time) were considered the "outer limits" of Chicago civilization. I am happy to see that it is matured with the neighborhood.
