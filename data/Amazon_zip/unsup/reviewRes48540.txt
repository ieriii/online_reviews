Do NOT bring your rabbi to this restaurant. They specialize in the pig, and serve every part of it, even the non-kosher parts. I was part of a party of three on a Thursday night, early. We started out with beers at one of the the stand-up tables in the bar. The beer list is impressive. Heavy on Belgians, but also French, German, Scandinavian, and American.  A bunch of interesting beers on draught. Someone gave this some serious thought and it shows. Food was very good, although not something I'd want to have regularly. We started out with the ham selection. It was delicious. Thin slices of domestic, Prosciutto, and Serrano, along with great bread and butter. We also had the marrow bones. These are served with parsley and onions and bread. The bones were hot out of the oven and very marrowy. This is a bit of an acquired taste, but it was delicious. Then we had country ribs -- these were awesome, with a great smoky taste.  And finally we had the poteen, which is a combo of veal breast, sausage, and pork tenderloin. The veal breast was the best part of that dish. The pork was a bit dry (as pork tenderloin tends to be) and the sausage extremely salty. For sides we had beets with aioli and french fries with fried eggs on top. Thumbs way up on both. And for dessert, an excellent peanut butter/chocolate cake. The room is nice looking with a great buzz. The hosts are sweet. There are lots of communal tables, which you should know if you are thinking of going.  This is a thinking-person's restaurant, great for foodies. I would expect to find it in Portland, Oregon; the fact that it is here in Chicago is a great thing. The food is unusual enough to keep your interest on repeated visits, but a bit heavy and organy.  Best to balance out all the meat with a bit of seafood, which we did not do but I wish we had.
