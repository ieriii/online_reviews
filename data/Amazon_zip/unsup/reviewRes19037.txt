the good:  what's that?! i can have a beer i actually like under $5? ...and you have more than one beer i like under $5? half acre, great lakes, dark horse, dogfish head...my head is spinning a little the bad: luckily we are sitting at the bar, sitting at the bar means we will have better service, right bar..ten......der? where did she go? hello?! anyone? *tick tock tick tock*  she's completely disappeared!  *tick tock tick tock* oh finally another bartender has noticed that look in our eyes means we will skip out on the check if someone doesn't help us soon. amazing! right when he said, "do you want another?" our bartender appeared suddenly behind him the ugly: yum this turkey pesto sandwich is delicious! and these fries look delicious! blech! but they are drowning in salt...why would they do that to these poor little fries...not even ketchup can hide the fact a whole shaker was dumped on them. poor little fries. the sandwich was devoured and there they sit all alone on the plate.
