This place looks a little dumpy from the outside and I was hesitant at first, but heard it was really good from a friend and have thanked them many times since! The tortilla soup is the best in town, hands down! They also have really good guac and fajitas. This place is delicious and I feel like Mexican, I am heading to the Mayan Palace on Halsted.
