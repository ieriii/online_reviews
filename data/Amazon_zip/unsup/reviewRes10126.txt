Second time around, we tried other items on the menu. fried zucchini flower: good grilled seafood: ok, slightly dry lasagna tipica di bologna: very good spaghetti nero: good pappardelle con spicy lamb meat balls: very good gnocchi di spinaci: very bad hazelnut chocolate cake: good panna cotta: too stiff, not soft enough I love gnocchi, and I order it whenever it's available. These are the worst (aside from the Costco ones) I have ever had in a restaurant. They were doughy, chewy and blend. The dish itself came with tomatoes & spinach, and everything was blend. As a gnocchi lover, I deemed this unacceptable, and am very disappointed.
