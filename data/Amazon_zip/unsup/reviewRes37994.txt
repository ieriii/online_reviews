Went here Saturday on a second try(the first time the wait was too long)and wasn't disappointed. Word to the wise...get there either early or not too hungry! The mussels for 2 fed 3 of us and then some. I had the CB&J and it was really good. My Dad had the brisket...good. My sister had the reuben...good. Now me saying good to a sandwich is probably really good to most standards! Love the selection of beers and lambics...that's just awesome!
