I went here for my birthday and was not impressed at all. We had made reservations for a group of 12 and when we got there, they didn't have a big enough table so we had to sit at two different booths with 6 people in each. It would have been nice to know that when we made the reservation so we could find somewhere else. The food was ok, you have to cook it in oil so everyone left smelling like oil. This is the only case in the city where I would go to a chain restaurant over a local establishment. If you want good fondue, go to the melting pot.
