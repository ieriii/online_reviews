I love this place. The waitstaff was amazing. The atmosphere was wonderful. Every little thing there has a story and provokes a conversation. It was so charming. And the Food..... Okay I love Cuban Food I was a bit of a snob and only ate it at a particular place on western near fullerton and thought theirs was the best but 90 Miles has proved me wrong. I tried the Garlic shrimp and the "lechon". It was wonderful. Great even. The lechon was seasoned just like mami seasons lechon christmas time. You know the food is good when it creates a wonderful memory or it reminds you of mami's cooking. 90 Miles did both for me. Oh it's a BYOB. I forget my rum to try the Mojito's but don't forget yours ;-)
