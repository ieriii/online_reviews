I love meat and this place has a lot of it. All you can eat and the meat servers are endless. The salad bar could be a lot better but what do you expect at a meat place. Pricey but you get what you pay for. The woman in the wine area doing acrobats are cool. The bananas that cleanse your pallet are to die for.
