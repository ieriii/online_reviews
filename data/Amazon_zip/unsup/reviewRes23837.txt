As a long time traveler to Costa Rica, Irazu serves up authentic, tasty dishes that won't disappoint. It's a busy, comfortable little place that really just focuses on true and tried Costa Rican favorites. Of course, don't forget the national staple of Salsa Lizano--it's a sauce used on everything from eggs to beans to steaks--delicious! They use it like we use ketchup, but on many more foods. With all the pretentious and fancy places out there, it's refreshing to find local, small, comfortable, restaurants that feel authentic and offer great food at a great price. Irazu is all that and more. Like the volcano this place is named after, this place is hot stuff!
