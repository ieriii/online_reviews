Grab a coupon and hit up this place for fair-to-good Italian food in large enough portions to take home for the next day's lunch. The atmosphere is simple and relaxing, and the staff is very friendly. The veal osobuco and the butternut squash ravioli are my favorite dishes here! Definitley worth checking out any night of the week - a perfect spot for midweek, not too involved dining.
