love the concept, hate the place! I am sure the one in NY suits its neighborhood better! Overpriced. Under deserving of many stars. Good staff. Mike is an excellent bartender! I live down the street and have not had a desire to go back! Gimmicky in my opinion and trying just a little too hard. Maybe they could have gotten away with their theme and goals in Lincoln Park, but I am just so over overly pretentious people!!! We are breathe and defecate the same thing, so why must there be a set of rules prior to entering the place?!? Money is green regardless right?????? I shouldn't be complaining, because they treated me like royalty, but I just can't respect discrimination in any form, whether its covert or not and I really have a problem with their rules. The place isn't conducive to socializing either and if I am going to spend that much money, then I want to talk to at least do as I please!
