Pretty good. The server annoyed both of us for different reasons, and she forgot part of the order, then ordered the wrong items.. so suffice it to say- service was poor. We ordered quite a few things and can't I remember all, but I do remember the pigs ear-which was good but I expected more piggy earness. The best part was the grilled cheese, not sure if it was the best grilled cheese I've ever had but that's how I'm remembering it....it was sooo creammmy cheeeezy goooey, with just the right salty, crunchy, greasiness. I think I got the prosciutto bread balls, but I think they weren't great-cant really remember. And I can't remember what else. Oh well I'll try everything else next time. The salads were good but- I wasn't too worried about salad with everything else on the menu. I'll definitely go back, and I'll cross my fingers that I'll get a different server. Sounds like I'm not the only one hoping for better service.
