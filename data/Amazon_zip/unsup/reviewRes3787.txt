Great twist on Korean fried chicken. Had the chicken wings which were bigger than most chicken wings. DELICIOUS. The owner explained to me that they were different from traditional fried chicken wings, but it probably depends on which sauce you choose. I got the Sassy Seoul and the only thing I say is that it does get a bit heavy and not sure if I could eat more than 5 pieces. However, it was yummy in my tummy and I will definitely be coming back here while I'm in Chicago.
