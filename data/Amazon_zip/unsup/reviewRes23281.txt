I've never been a crepe fan, but I did decide to come here a second time. I ordered the same thing twice, but sampled one of my friend's crepes, too. I had the apricot and brie, which is good and simple. I tried my friend's blueberry/rose petal jam/brie crepe and found the first few bites to be amazing, but the rose petal jam became a bit overwhelming. Awesome concept, though. Unfortunately, when my friends ordered their coffee, the cream had turned and the waitress had to bring a new little cup of fresh cream, as well as fresh coffee. Other than that, Icosium is A-ok!
