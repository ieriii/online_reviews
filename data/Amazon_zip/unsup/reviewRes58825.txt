Easily the best, most authentic Pad Thai I've ever had!! the tiger cry is something everyone in chicago should try at least once. Blending citrus with spicy and making it just a little sweet is pure genius.To recap my evening at Opart: excellent food, extremely friendly staff, and a price that just could not be beat!
