I've eaten here a handful of times and have always enjoyed it. It's my go to lunch spot for out of town visitors.  Their sandwiches are delicious and decently sized. The side dishes are pretty tasty, too. The prices are reasonable. The lunch burrito was drowning in a bit too much sauce that got a little sickening after eating a bit of it, but it was not horrible.  The only thing that sucks is the hours. Only til 2:30? Come on!
