I would give this 3.5 stars. I have to admit that I am biased in writing this review since I'm not a huge deep-dish pizza fan, but I wasn't impressed with Giordano's. Maybe it's too much hype, but I just didn't find it to be that tasty. Too much tomato sauce, too long of a line. Really nothing that distinguishes this deep dish pizza over other pizza joints. I did like how they take your pizza order before you get to your table, so that the pizza is practically there when you sit down. Good for the hungry customers and good for restaurant turnover!
