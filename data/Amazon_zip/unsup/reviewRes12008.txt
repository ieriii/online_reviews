Finally had the chance to eat at Piece since the wait was only 20 minutes at 6:00pm on a Saturday. The place was crowded but I am sure it gets much worse the later it gets. We ordered a large with sausage, tomato, and green peppers. The pizza was big enough for 4 of us except we split a couple of salads to start. The pizza was good but not great. The beer was good. The atmosphere was good. The only thing that is not good is how crowded it is all the time.
