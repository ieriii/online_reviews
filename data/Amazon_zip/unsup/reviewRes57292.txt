The service is hit or miss for me - sometimes the staff is attentive, sometimes I'd rather get up and do everything myself. The people at the host stand have NEVER once been polite or friendly, in fact, they're often snooty. (That's why they get 3 stars instead of 5)What they lack in service, they make up for with their menu. Food always tastes amazing, my favorite is the Spicy Miso Soup. They have a wonderful selection of specialty rolls as well.
