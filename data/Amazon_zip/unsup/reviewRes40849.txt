The fact that I don't understand why everyone seems to LOVE this place may allude to the fact that I'm just not a pho person...the 3 stars are for the freshness and relative healthfulness of Tank's food.That said, flavor is lacking...seriously. lacking. bland. Service is communal-style, whereas you can ask any passing employee for assistance, not just your server, who will inevitably be absentee, upon serving your...canned. soda. The two times I have been to Tank, my table was not actually waited on, past initial orders being placed. You have to flag someone down, if you want anything. No standard inquires were made as to whether everything was okay, etc. I realize blase' service may be accounted for by cultural differences - but hey, Tank Noodle - when in Rome... Lastly, the decor is reminiscent of a high school cafeteria, complete with laminate, fold out furniture - and harsh, white light. Sorry.
