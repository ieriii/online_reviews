I moved to Phoenix 10 years ago. My family goes straight from O'Hare to Super Dawg. The dogs are the best in the world and the fries are just as delicious. The retro feel of the drive-in is fun and nostalgic but nothing should take away from the food. Not only are the dogs amazing but the accoutrements make it better. From pickled tomatoes to onion petals, you can't go wrong with Super Dawg.
