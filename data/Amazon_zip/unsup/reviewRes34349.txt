On a recent trip to Chicago, we stopped by Yolk before visit the Shedd Aquarium on a Thursday and loved it. The wait when we got there was 10 minutes and when we left the wait was over 30-45 minutes long. The portions are huge. I ordered the Eggs Florentine and my sister had their crepes. All of it was delicious. Can't wait to return! Perfect place to go prior to visit the museums in Museum Campus.
