Pretty good, I must say. Nice presentation, though the tables for two are so miniscule! I had the super white tuna roll and the fire dragon roll... both fairly good, but not the best I've had. They have jalapeno miso soup, which was definitely interesting. My favorite part was the drink "The Naked Surfer." Quite tasty! Gotta come back for the other special drinks, which I think you can also get at Wang's, the connected lounge.
