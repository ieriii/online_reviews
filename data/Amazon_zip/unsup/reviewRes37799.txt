Meh. I am not sure if it was because of the extrem hype I received before going here, but I was not THAT impressed. I mean the pizza is good and the service is okay but I would not call it the best pizza ever. The salad was also just okay. Pros--the crust is really thick and crunch (which I loved); the toppings are plentiful. Cons--the cheese almost felt plastic.
