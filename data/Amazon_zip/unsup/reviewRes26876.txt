The best Mexican food north of the border. This the third best Mexican food meal I have ever had. One and two were in Mexico City. One at at a private residence in DF and the second in a restaurant in Polanco. Nothing in the US comes close to this place. Make reservations. We waited over two hours for a table...worth it nonetheless.
