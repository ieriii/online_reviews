How can you fault the place? The motto on the back of the T-shirts: "There are no two finer words in the english language than encased meats, my friend" That pretty much says it all. Doug is serious about his sausages and sausage kitch. The place is decorated in preposterous primary colors and the air is filled with Violent Femmes era catchy post-punk. Often there will no free tables and a line out the door, but Doug gets people in and out as fast as he might, never hurrying anyone off the tables or counterspace. They offer a range of traditional sausages at amazingly reasonable prices($1.50 dogs?!?! Seriously.), and they also offer specialty sausages, like the celeb of the week for between $5 and $10. Nice. To have these exotic combinations, like Thai chicken dog, or a tequila chicken sausage with diablo mustard and salsa is a treat for someone like me who wouldn't eat hot dogs otherwise. The duck fat fries are excpetional and decadent...I think my heart stopped for a second mid-consumption, but oh so worth it. And if you're a little more skittish, the regular fries are fresh cut and of quality, so if you're there on weekdays, it's no great loss. Plus, they've got Green River in the can. Pure Chicago. http://www.bevnet.com/re Doug strikes me as a compressed and tightly wound man, but he never inflcits it on the customers, except in his finicky affinity to serve the hell out of them. He's friendly and decent, and even the most complex order is up under 10 minutes. Whether you're a lifelong chicagoan looking for a chicago style-dog, or a gourmand looking for a new experience, the place afor you is Hot Doug's, THE sausage superstore.
