We had just gotten off one of those boat architecture tours & stumbled upon this place by accident. It was definitely our best meal in Chicago. Wow! All of the flavors were perfect--balanced, well-thought-out, well-executed. We had the butternut squash (best I've ever tasted), the beets, the octopus (not normally a fan of octopus due to the chewiness, but this was unbelievably tender), 3 cheeses which our server picked for us, & the wine complemented everything. Dessert was fabulous too--best butterscotch pudding ever!
