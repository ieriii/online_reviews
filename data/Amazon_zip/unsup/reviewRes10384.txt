This has become my favorite Italian place in the city, and that says a lot for Chicago. It has all the staples of a great place. Nice decor (including a great outdoor space), intelligent staff (with sexy accents), and a simple menu. However, that last part may not be as simple as you may think. The food at Piccolo Sogno is very reminiscent of classic dishes. They sound and look familiar, but the taste is nothing but. Not only do all the dishes taste great but they taste new. Instead of a regular beef with a dish they'll throw in bison. Instead of a standard pesto sauce it'll use pumpkin. I love the experimentation done here yet I could still take my parents and they'd love it. Looking forward to coming back here for more.
