When it comes to *pan* pizza--a largely overlooked style of pie here in deep dish heaven--Pequod's is God. Pan style, of course, is marked by its crust-centric presentation, and nobody does carbo-riffic, pan style pizza better than Pequod's. It's bread-tastic: light, crispy, and the caramelized crust is perfection. The sauce is just right: slightly sweet and not layered on too heavily. And their sausage is the Best. Ever. (And this is from an avowed pepperoni-only devotee.) And if you end up with leftovers? They hold up better in the fridge than any pizza in the city.
