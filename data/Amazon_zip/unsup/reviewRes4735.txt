I really do not like community seating. No matter what I know ppl. are listening to my conversation, and the women across kept trying to give us there food suggestions - which we did not want/need. I think this place is a bit overrated. The food was okay, but nothing that I am eager to go back for. One tip: I did not like the bone marrow. I read the reviews before going .... gave it a try, and now when I reflect on eating it I want to PUKE!  I also thought it was a tiny bit snotty. Not really my style, at all.
