I expected a typical diner when I walked in. Glenn's is definitely not that at all. I'd eat here everyday if I could afford to. The food is excellent for the most part and the staff is super friendly. Glenn is there pretty much all of the time and he's pretty hands on. My favorites are the French Toast, Burgers and Russian Ruben. The only not so hot factor is the the the potato pancake is not always as hot as I would like it to be. I've learned to ask them to cook it longer. They get fresh fish in daily. Have not tried any of the fish yet but being the East Coast guy that I am, I will try it out soon. UPDATE: I ordered the Crab Cakes a few weeks ago. All I can say is that they were EXCELLENT! They are fresh from Maryland. This East Coast boy was a happy camper!
