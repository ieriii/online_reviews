Overall good experience. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Got Mozzarella sticks and deep dish pizza with sausage topping recommended by the waitress. The Mozzarella sticks was nearly perfect. The crispiness was just right, and the cheese.. oh my the cheese.. tastes so good that I could finish them even without the dipping sauce. Now the deep dish.. maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I can't say it tasted amazing. The cheese, again, was really really good, and I definitely loved the crust. But the sauce and sausage somehow lacked some 'character'. It tasted alright, but not so impressive to me. That's the main reason for 3 stars. Next time you go to the neighborhood, at least grab some Mozzarella sticks there. You won't be disappointed!
