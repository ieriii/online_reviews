I am a fan; however, almost was not because of the unfriendly welcome we had. The two hostesses could learn alot from their fellow employees. I am happy we stayed because the place made me feel like I was on vacation with the decor and music. Food? flat-out delicious. Wait staff? articulate, and friendly. Hostesses? get over yourselves.
