Absolutely loved this place! I was initially discouraged when I found out Frontera does not take reservations and when we showed up we were told the wait was about an hour and a half. Celine and I had just flown in from San Diego a few hours earlier and the airline snacks were well past worn off. Luckily the hostess gave us an option to sit at the chefs bar and the wait would be about 15 minutes. 15 minutes came up and to my surprise we were given a full table. The mens bathroom lacked toilet seat covers and I hate to be a complainer, but I feel like no one invests in toilet paper that feels any better than sandpaper. The soap left my hands feeling really dry and chalky. Not a deal breaker but could use some improvement. The real reason why I give this place 5 stars is for the service. Thomas is a class act and definitely needs to be moved up in the ranks because he is doing this business all sorts of justice. Very thorough in explaining the menu (getting down to specific details about ingredients and what particularly is in season, etc...) So Thomas if you read this, keep doing what you're doing! Our food did not disappoint either. The mole' enchiladas I had were so delicious. The sauce had the perfect amount of chocolate, peanut butter and surprisingly a little kick. I told her that this was one of those times I was going to stuff myself stupid and I didn't have any regrets about it because it just tasted so damn good. Open a restaurant in San Diego already!
