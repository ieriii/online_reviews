This pizza is good but not great. The price is right: $3 for any slice, whether it's a stuffed, just cheese, deep dish, or not.. It's not the kind of pizzeria that heats up your slices in a pizza oven after you ordered. The slices are all kept in some heat-lamp pod and served right away. I didn't think it was very tasty, but my sausage stuffed deep dish was pleasant and filling. The cheese non-pan slice was just that--plain.
