3 stars. Full disclosure: I didn't get the Pho. We came here with about 10 people for the boyfriend's birthday. The staff was nice and found us a sufficiently large table. Service was a little slow, but hey, there *were* 10 of us. The shrimp spring rolls were OK. Nothing to write home about. The egg rolls, God bless 'em, were TINY. Seriously, they looked sad. The boyfriend said he liked the Pho; everyone else seemed satisfied. I was neither pleased nor displeased with my shrimp noodle dish. Would I come back? Only if the boy wanted to. Other than that, the Thai Milk Bubble Tea was a standout.
