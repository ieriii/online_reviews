Steak tacos are the BEST! I wish the drive was so much closer to where I live, otherwise I'd frequent this place more often...or should I say every other day! The steak is seasoned well and for the price it sells for, can't beat that! I remember when the burrito was only $3.75, but that was about 8 years ago. You have to try this place and there's 3 of them, next door to each other, but one across the street. Whether you are looking for a place to coat your taco cravings or you stumble at this place when you are DRUNK...the food taste the same!
