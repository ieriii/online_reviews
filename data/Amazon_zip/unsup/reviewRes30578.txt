I was super stoked that I was able to experience the greatness of Nana's. After seeing Buddy Guy's visit on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, it was a must that I visit too on my next trip to Chicago. It happened on Satuday just in time for Brunch!!! First let me say, the portions/entrees are not skimpy by any means. I ordered the Nanadict (her spin on Eggs Benedict). IT WAS SUPERB and flavorful! I'd now opt for a pupusa over an english muffin any day. The chorizo added a nice spice and the eggs were poached to perfection. The homstyle fries were perfectly crunchy on the outside, yet still soft on the inside. It was also served with a green and red leaf lettuce where I used the poblano cream and egg yolk as a little dressing for it. Also, I just had to try the buscuits with duck gravy. Or shall I say order a side dish to taste. Surprisingly, I enjoyed my taste. I say taste because after eating my entree, I was not able to take in anymore food. I was so full. The buscuits side dish was much larger than I expected, so I had to take it to go. And it was still delish two days later. On the decor on the inside is outstanding and perfectly suiting. Numerous cafe tables, a small bar to seat about 4 or 5 people, and an open kitchen. It is a little small, so I can definitely see why people sometimes experience a wait to be seated. (Brunch is just not a rush and go type of meal/get-together.) I will have to make this a monthly visit once I move to the city. I WILL BE BACK (again and again and again)!!!
