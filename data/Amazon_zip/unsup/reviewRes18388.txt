Burgers & beer....that's what I was looking for when I stepped into The Bad Apple. I sat at the bar and peeped the beer menu. I love that feeling of looking at an extensive beer list and feeling like I'm in a toy store. They had Coup d'etat on draft....done. The place felt cozy. I was digging the exposed brick. In the back they have shuffleboard. I friggin' love shuffleboard. There were several burgers on the menu that sounded tasty. I went with the Red Dragon, a burger topped with brisket hash, an over easy egg, pepper jack, & roasted red pepper sauce. I opted to upgrade my fries to truffle fries. The burger came out with a perfect yolk, begging to be popped. I placed the other half of the bun on top and did my duty. It was delicious. The brisket hash was very apparent. It tasted as though it had been properly smoked! The portion was good. This burger reminded me what I had once forgotten...that you don't need a pretzel bun to have a delicious burger. Although if you must, they do offer pretzel buns with some of their burgers. The fries were nice and toasty, but I would have preferred truffle oil rather than truffle salt. Nevertheless, they weren't bad. The ketchup they provide is homemade. I asked for a side of chipotle sauce...they told me they had chipotle ranch. Even better! My fat ass also consumed a side of cheese curds. They were great. My mission of pushing maximum density was complete. The Bad Apple is pretty spacious...there seem to be an adequate amount of tables. I have already come back here to eat and drink with friends. Once again the beer selection here is on point. They even have "butter beer"! (yes, I'm a nerd) The service was great and the bartenders were pleasant. I recommend stopping by for a drink or ten.
