I did another round of Duckmas here. What's Duckmas? Well, it's the same day as Christmas, only we celebrate friendship and gluttony, and duck! I was worried after a bunch of rounds of phone tag and telephone with the staff that Duckmas might not happen, but it was all sorted out and ran smoothly on the big day. If you want the Beijing Duck Feast then you MUST call ahead and place an order. Their website says it takes them about 24 hours to prepare, so don't just show up expecting duck to magically appear. Not even on Christmas. They also say that a single duck dinner feeds 4-5 people. We had exactly 12 guests at our giant table and ordered 3 Duck Feasts. It was the perfect amount, but 2 people did not eat duck and ordered something else. We also ordered a couple sides of veggies and extra buns. Sun Wah is still BYOB even though they also have a liquor license and sell drinks. Corkage fee is $5 per bottle of wine. With all the food + corkage each person paid $18 for a ginormous meal. If that's not a Christmas miracle, I don't know what is!
