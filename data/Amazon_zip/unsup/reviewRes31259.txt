Oh how I wish we had this place in the SF Bay Area. I've been here twice -- had some fake chicken parmigiana the first time and then breakfast the last time. Both were really great. I bought a bunch of vegan baked goods to take home -- muffins, cookies...mmmm...I can still taste the yumminess. They also have a cookbook, t-shirts...heavy on the merchandising. I guess they know how a vegan can go all groupie on this place.
