Carnivale has a really cool atmosphere, but the food is not really to my liking. I had a hard time finding something on the menu that really jumped off the page to me and had me really excited to order. I eventually ordered the halibut, it was good, but not spectacular, and a little pricey. I do have to again give this place props on the atmosphere though.
