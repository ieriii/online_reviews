An absolutely amazing restaurant. They really have it together for such a new restaurant.  From the moment you walk in til the time you leave, the front of the house seems to work in perfect concert in making sure everything is taken care off and done so unobtrusively. Thankfully, my wife and I had a sitter for the kids this past Thursday to enjoy this new establishment on our almost weekly Thursday date night... We both did the three courses for $60 - - she had the octopus, wagyu and eggnog with bread pudding - - all absolutely amazing!!! The sauce dribbled over the wagyu was out of this world! I had the foie gras, sturgeon and pear - - the broth that the fish was in was so freakin' delicious... And the foie gras, good grief... The problem with going to a restaurant like this is knowing that we can't afford to do this every night... Sprout should be around for a long time to come. Can't wait til the weather gets warm again to be able to sit out for dinner on their front patio!
