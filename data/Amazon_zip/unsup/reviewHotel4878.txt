I expected a great hotel but was further impressed by the look, feel and service. The look is nothing short of breathtaking, the tall glass exterior is stunningly beautiful. The feel is professional, yet manages to incorporate that human factor. They literally make you feel appreciated, welcomed and cater to your every need! From the concierge, Anderson, who welcomes you thoroughly and lets you know just how much he enjoys his job and loves the city to the door men, especially Christopher who knows the city and can give you pointers like he were describing the a neighbor hood he had grown up in all his life. Again, the service. GREAT!! I can't think of the last time I had the pleasure of being happy to be around such magnificent personalities. My girlfriend and I truly didn't want to leave. Hence, the extention.I'd mention the breathtaking lounge Vertigo a top the roof of the hotel or the deliciously snuck in yet sophisticated restaraunt Aja but they are so great respectively that they all deserve seperate reviews.Whoever wants their hotel staffers to get better training to be 5 star should send their employees here so they can understand what makes a place such as Dana, dare I say greatest thus so far hotel
