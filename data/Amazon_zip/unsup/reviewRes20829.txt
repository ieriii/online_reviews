Why, XOCO, why?? WHY do I live so far away from you?? No lunch will ever measure up to you and your scrumptious greatness! Why we Americans didn't pick up on the sandwich-in-broth = best thing EVER is beyond me! I will crave your Ahogada Torta with it's oh so tender pork and sweet/spicy tomato broth...dream about your Aztec hot chocolate...of your churros!! Never will I wait 45 minutes for something less delicious than your fare, XOCO. You have ruined me for all future lunches...maybe even all future meals! Damn you XOCO, damn you!
