I absolutely love this place! The restaurant itself has a very chill vibe, our waiter was very cool too. I was never a huge fan of sushi until I tried theirs. It was simply awesome! I've had the Gyoza, Crab Rangoon, Chicken Pad Thai & Fried Rice, and my favorites are Indie's Signature Maki... The Summer Passion is phenomenal, as was the Sunny Crunchy.
