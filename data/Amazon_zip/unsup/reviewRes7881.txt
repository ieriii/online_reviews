I basically joined Yelp to rave about this place. I was browsing the low reviews of Spacca Napoli for kicks, and I have to laugh at those who say the pizza is "soggy". Oh, you silly Philistines, that is because this is real, fresh cheese, not the processed melted-disc garbage "cheese" you get at Domino's. In Italy, this is how pizza is made. You eat it with a knife and fork (I know, what a slog, when we Americans love to shove things in our faces) to really enjoy and savor your experience. Neapolitan pizzaioli are akin to artists, as they should be, and Spacca Napoli pays perfect tribute to their overseas counterparts. I can tell why this is considered the only true Neapolitan pizza in America-- it's exactly what you would expect in Southern Italy. I've been coming here for years, now, and every time I think I just want the Margherita, their daily specials always steer me in another direction. The ingredients in the specials are original, ever-changing, and so fresh! I feel like telling them they should call me whenever the fig and gorgonzola is the special because I WILL come in. However, don't think that pizza is all they do well here. Don't forget to ask your waiter or waitress what the daily Fritti is-- I guarantee you will love it no matter what it is, though. Save room for dessert and try any of their seriously awesome gelatos (especially pistachio with whole pistachios and the banana!) or be adventurous and try the panna cotta, which is the best I've had in the city. Spacca Napoli, you are my mistress.
