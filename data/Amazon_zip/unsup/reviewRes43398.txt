Best pizza in the city, hands down. We live down the street from here and visit "Art" at least once a week....sometimes twice!  Typically go for the deep dish (stuffed), but we've had the thin crust and love that too. Toppings, especially the veggies, are fresh and plentiful and the prices can't be beat.  Plus, the employees are friendly and always recognize repeat customers.  Can't go wrong at Art!
