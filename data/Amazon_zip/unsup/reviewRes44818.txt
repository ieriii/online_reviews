I was in Chicago for a conference and during a lunch break several of us went and hit up Giordano's because it was close and because it seems to have a bit of a reputation around Chicago. I was excited to have my first taste of real Chicago deep dish and expected it to easily top the imitation deep dish I had had at Sacramento's "Chicago Fire" just a few weeks earlier. I was a bit disappointed. The pizza was good, don't get me wrong. I just didn't think it was that great. In fact I liked Sacramento's imitation a bit better. Believe it or not the ingredients at Chicago Fire seemed to be of a higher quality and there seemed to be more care put into the pizza. Plus it was cheaper. We had the super veggie and the meat. Both were good, but they didn't blow me away. Giordano's was easily bested by Gino's East (which I had a few days later).
