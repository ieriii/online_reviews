So, I'm guilty of buying into the hype of this place. It does have its issues, but I still really enjoy it and have had great experiences each time I've gone. I love that it's BYOB because it cuts down on the cost. Their specialty maki can be pretty pricey, so I like the option of bringing my own wine or sake. Like a lot of others, I love the white dragon roll, and I can't say there is anything on the menu that I didn't enjoy. I had the oysters one night and a few of the other menu items, which have all been fresh. The service has always been fine...not amazing, but nothing to get your panties in a bunch about. Besides, it's always packed in there, so you have cut your service people a little bit of slack. I'll definitely be back.
