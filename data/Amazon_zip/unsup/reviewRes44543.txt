Ping Pong's little sister? Is not so little any more... She has come to be a Bold Red Head with a personality of her own. This place is currently working on a new addition with Dragon Pillars, Red Lanterns and all that one could put into a traditional sake bar. Each day I walk pass this place I await the opening of their expansion. I remember the days of the small wakamono, long waits and sometimes attitudes of the servers...I still love what they delivered. Fresh, Amazing and NEVER the Norm take on sushi. This place won me over and has become a special place I love to take my friends, family and that special one. For us it has become even more enjoyable. Table window next to the new koi pond, if you sit there give a shout out to "Wisconsin" for us. He's the white one with black spots.. Always a great spot to enjoy "Peter Parker" and "Godzilla" The Place is BYOB. which is fine with me. It's a great little walk between Kafka and Wakamono. Perhaps one day they can take over the hair salon on the right and create tea rooms... by reservation. Well, surprise after surprise... I will always enjoy sitting at a table with a window view of the "Big Sister" and smile inside knowing red heads really do have more fun.
