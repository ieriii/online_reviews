I am not a cheerleader. And I don't give bad places a second chance...As for Wildfire, this is obviously a big, charismatic chain outlet of Lettuce Entertain You. Beyond that, it completely satisfies the pallette in every way. Big flavors match the big atmosphere. Yes, it's crowded and thus noisy, but the food is what counts for me. Never, and when I say this, I refer to the three occasions I have eatin here in the last two years, NEVER have I had a bad meal here. Every person I go with has been equally satisfied. If anything, overly satisfied. You want to keep eating until you are stuffed. The secret is to try for the "perfect meal". Get the full experience, but leave feeling 99.99% full. (I hate to feel bloated after a meal. Ruins my night.)  Get an appetizer, but be careful, you must save lots of room for the entree AND drinks/water. Best to share here. Great for date #3 or more. Pecan encrusted Halibut IS always wonderful. The filet tip trio is always devine. But my favorite, and perhaps the most decadent (and healthy) is the BBQ rubbed sweet potato. This is worth the price of admission. Tender and sweet. And it's huge. Please be careful as all items are quite (Americanized), thus large. You need a big appetite here or count on a heavy doggie bag.   The key is to eat slow, enjoy each bite and let the experience envelope you. Moderation will pay huge dividends and your stomach will thank you. Dessert? Don't get it. Why break the bank and bust a gut for sugar when the "food" is so darn tasty? You be the judge.
