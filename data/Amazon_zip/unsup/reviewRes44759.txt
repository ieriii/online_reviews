Best pizza in Chicago!!! Anywhere else in this town pales in comparision, seriously. It's a chain and thank GOD cuz otherwise I'd be limited as to where I could get my carbo-loaded fill of this cheesy goodness. Oh yes, and their meals/appetizers/salads are worth trying out as well with your side of pizza ;-) GIORDANOS FOLIFE!!!
