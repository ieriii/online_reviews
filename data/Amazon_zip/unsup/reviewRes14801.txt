Northern Italian gourmet. I first came here 5 yrs ago with an old roommate for his birthday. It's very hard to forget such a mysterious place. There are no windows. The decor is stuck in the 70's- which isn't a bad thing. There is a piano bar. It's quite amusing. This is full service Italian- I'm talking bread and oil, soup, salad, appetizer, entree. And if you can make it through all that, there's dessert too. Expect superb service from waitstaff. This is an old school joint. Huge portions, heavy garlic, lamb, sausage and beef. However there are vegetarian options- but that just means pasta without meat. The food is excellent- very hearty. This is a trip- its a little vacation in a big city. You have to experience Sabatino's at least once to call yourself a Chicagoan.
