Delicious Peking duck...! I can't begin to tell you how disappointing the duck in LA is. The duck retain moisture yet doesn't slide in a slime of oil. What makes the whole experience memorable is when the servers carve the beautiful bird in front of you! The pickled carrots and radish with the sliced duck inside the bun create a medley of flavors in your mouth. I never have an appetite for the duck fried rice or soup, but visiting this place for the duck is a must!
