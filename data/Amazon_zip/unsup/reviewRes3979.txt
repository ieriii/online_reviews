NO STARS! I just now called for reservations, some punk picked up and said hello, I asked if it was Schwa. He said no. I hung up. I looked at my caller ID. I had called the right number. I called again. He said, "Welcome to Burger King, home of the whopper." I said, is this 773-252-1466. He said no. I said is this Schwa or not. He said yes it it. I said wow. I can't believe a restaurant of your caliber is acting like this. I said, never mind. I was appalled. He said, "ok, eff off then." SERIOUSLY????
