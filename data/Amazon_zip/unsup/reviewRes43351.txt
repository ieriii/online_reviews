This is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch. They have some interesting places on the menu, and wonderful desserts! My only complaint is that it is sort of a self serve. A waiter brings you your food, but you have to wait in line to order. The line can be kind of long. However, I will say that it was worth the wait. The food was delicious! I will definitely go back. I would say it's a better place in the summer though since they have a nice sidewalk cafe.
