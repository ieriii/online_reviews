I really want to return to bump this place up to five stars, because I know it's got such great potential! However, my experience was not QUITE 5-star quality. First of all, the restaurant was uncomfortably crowded with a long wait. I tried to go the healthy route and got an eggwhite and veggie scramble. Please, please, PLEASE leave your guilt at home and do NOT order healthy. My dish was also incredibly spicy, but the server was very great and brought me a new plate. Everyone else's food was amazing and we ordered an extra order of chocolate french toast for our table to split, which I ended up really wishing I had just ordered as my own meal- TOO GOOD!
