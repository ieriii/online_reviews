Holy sh*t is the habenero salsa hot. Maybe I just got a super spicy batch or maybe i'm just becoming a pussy but it made me sweat in the middle of the restaurant. That would have been great to see me all red faced when Rick Bayless himself walks in to do a quick line check. Awesome to get to see him in person and know he is still so active in all of his places. So the above mentioned salsa was on the pibil. Even though it was spicy it worked well with the juicy pork and the pickled onions took the edge off. The mushroom torta was about as good of a vegetarian option your gonna find. The grilled shrooms with goat cheese is like tomatoes and basil - it just works so perfectly. As if that wasn't enough we also got the carnitas caldo that was crazy good. The porky broth was seasoned just right and the greens added a nice pepper bite to ward off the richness. The limonada was more limey then lemony but in a good way. I had a 5 rabbits golden ale that was had some good citrus note and helped to calm the demon spawn habenero salsa that i was choking down. We also took one of the almond hot chocolates to go - it was a little chilly this night. It was small but sooooo rich - it prob could have been diluted by half and still be knock your socks off good. Anyways after all of that this place is crazy good. Tortas are a very overlooked sandwich especially with all the Jimmy Johns and other sub shops. I can't wait to go back and try some more of the porky delicious menu!
