I was a little disappointed after the hundreds of reviews I've read here. The restaurant did not measure up to authentic middle eastern food in the middle east (i'm part Lebanese/ part Egyptian) nor to Lebanese food in the Dearborn, MI area. Their hummous was not that great, the lamb shawerma was not cooked nor seasoned properly, and the tabbouleh was not impressive either. I have to say though, their mjaddara (rice/lentils/onions) was fantastic! I'd probably go back for the cheap prices and the big cafeteria style selection and the generous portions and because it's what I can find in the area. But if this your first time with middle eastern food, or taking a first timer, please try another place.
