We wanted to try everything, so my wife and I are going to try each others dishes. We started with a spinach soup, nice and light to start, great flavor and texture. Then onto Gunthrop Chicken sandwich and the Ahodaga. The Ahodaga was awesome!!! It's a pork sandwich in a spicy pickled broth, it is hot!!! I enjoy spicy so it was perfect for me. The gunthrop chicken was tasty but I really was enjoying the Ahodaga and my wife thought it was a little too spicy. Then we asked what sweats they liked, the recomendation was churros with a mexacan vanilla icecream to dip them into. Great taste and fun to eat, if I wasnt so full I would have had another order. Along with that we had a Mexican hot coco with almond milk. Don't miss this place the quality and flavor is incredible!
