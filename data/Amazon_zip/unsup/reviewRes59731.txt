Ruth's Chris is by far the best steak in Chicago. I am a steak lover and have eaten at most of the steak restaurants.  Everything from the martinis to dessert is delectable. The filet mignon is absolutely perfect. The 500 degree plates and the melted butter makes the steaks, any steak, melt in your mouth. I have never been disappointed in any thing from Ruth's Chris. Their Caesar salad is awesome, as well as the mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. The service is incredible as well. We have had some of the most outstanding servers at Ruth's Chris. They always call you by your name, acknowledge if you are celebrating a special occasion and make you feel 100% taken care of. Ruth's Chris is the best.
