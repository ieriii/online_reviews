WOW! Best pizza I have ever had in my life! We were told that we could pre-order our pizza while we waited in line but since we were not in a hurry we decided not to. 35 minutes from order to serve - well worth the wait. Small 10" is plenty for 4 regular eaters. Delicious tall, crispy biscuit crust and very very cheesy. Beer was cheap enough but I really wish they served Guinness. The waitstaff was fast and friendly. This place is super clean- not a speck of ick. I held back one star because the womens bathroom was clean. But it is very tiny, falling apart and impossible for a wheelchair. They certainly seemed to get enough traffic $ to fix that problem.
