I'm a little biased on this review, because my wife and I have been spoiled at other hotels we have stayed at. Not that Hotel 71 is terrible, they just don't measure up to some of the other hotels we have stayed at such as the Westin and our new favorite, Hotel Monaco. One thing that is important to us is a great view, which Hotel 71 has, but the other hotels we have stayed at have a place at their windows where you can lounge and just relax and enjoy the view. You have to stand and stare out the window at Hotel 71. I know I'm being picky, but you would be surprised how nice it is after walking around all day in Chicago and to be able to kick back and just watch either the city lights or the river (Hotel Monaco actually has a little lounging area built into all their windows - very nice). Also, the walls must be super thin, because we heard our neighbors, talking, not shouting, until 2:30 in the morning! On the plus side, the rooms were clean, but are starting to show wear, which is ok. I know hotels can't stay pristine forever, but I just haven't seen this at our other favorite hotels. They also need to have in-room safes. This is pretty standard in hotels now, so I was surprised we didn't have one in our room. On the plus side, their personnel are very friendly and do their jobs well. Good customer service is important to me and this is why I'm giving Hotel 71 3 stars. I think Hotel 71 is a nice hotel, but there are other hotels in the area that are better, at least in my humble opinion.
