Before a recent trip to Chicago, a friend sent me a link to the L&E website. It turned out to be one of the most prized recommendations I've ever received. Not only was the dining an unparalleled experience, but what I realized even many locals don't know, is that they offer slick, stylish accommodations upstairs.There are only about 6 rooms, ranging in size and price (from affordable to really affordable!!). And one of the best perks of being a guest - you can make a reservation at the restaurant, something they otherwise don't allow. The rooms are above the busy bar, but my friend and I weren't bothered by the noise. It only seemed to add to the flavor of the experience.As far as the restaurant, the accolades L&E has received speak for themselves. I had the crispy pork belly and they coaxed a more delicate blend of flavors from the dish than I would ever have thought possible. Nothing that hit the table went without praise, with the exception of the Gruyere dough nuts that were a bit polarizing (you can see where I stood by the full compliment of stars above). Our server wasn't the most knowledgeable I've ever had, but she was attentive and unpretentious.Finally, there is the bar itself. The whiskey menu is unreal. If memory serves, after the small sampling I had, there are some 300 offerings, three dozen of which are only three dollars a pour. We visited the bar during the day for coffee and again after dinner, and the bartender were all fantastically amicable, knowledgeable, and, like our server, unpretentious in an environment that could, with all of it's great qualities, toe that line if the staff weren't so carefully selected.All in all, Longman & Eagle is well worth the experience and it couldn't be closer to the blue line train station. If you're anywhere near Logan Square, seek it out. Better yet, if you're looking for a place to stay that beats the banality of overpriced, lack luster hotel chains, get a room!
