The atmosphere is nice but you can def. find better Japanese food in chi-town. I ordered an Uni sushi and it's not even fresh! The walnut shrimp breading was incredibly thick. They chop the shrimp in half and bread it, you can't really taste the shrimp but breading with sauce! None of the maki really stands out and they offer very ordinary menu. If you are a beginner you may like it but if you are an experienced sushi lover, this place is def. not for you. Don't waste your time and $$.
