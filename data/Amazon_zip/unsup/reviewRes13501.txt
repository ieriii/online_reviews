PROS: The porter was outstanding, and the forest burger was really, really good and really huge. CONS: This has to be the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. We went in here on a Sunday afternoon. Bad disco music was blaring out of the sound system so loud that we were practically shouting at each other the whole time, conversation had to actually be shouted. Everyone else in the restaurant is talking loud as hell to compete with the speakers, which overall makes this place loud to the point of being unpleasant, it was really annoying and didn't make us want to hang around. Also the prices here are astronomical. A burger and two of the house brews costed almost $30. It was a damn good hamburger though, and big, but geez. House beers are all $5-$6 a glass which is way too expensive if you ask me, every other brewpub I've been to had their house beers at least a buck less than that. My other gripe is that the tables (over by the wall anyway) are so incredibly long, your dining/drinking companion is like six feet away from you. Why in the hell did they pick tables like this?!?! It's so stupid. It makes holding a conversation that much more impossible when the person sitting across from you is so far away. Dumb. My girlfriend and I were laughing when we were seated because we had to be like five feet accross the table from each other, it was retarded.  Service was all right but didn't match the price tag.  We vowed to never return... it's deafeningly loud (which is a buzzkill), the atmosphere sucks, and it's way too pricey. Plus it's filled with pretentious pseudo-intellectual hipster douchebags with beards, glasses, and messenger bags talking about their fixed gear bikes and Pitchfork festivals. And the whole "revolution" theme is dumb.
