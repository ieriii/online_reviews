We absolutely LOVE Sabatino's! The staff is so friendly, efficient, and knowledgable. The floor managers are so friendly and are always happy to see us. The food...oh the food is delightful! And there's SO much. You will always take some home as they give you enormous and tasty portions. We love the veal entree's and the seafood entrees...but everything is really delicious there. Never have eaten dessert there as we are always stuffed from everything else. Try it...you'll definitely enjoy. And the prices are AWESOME! See you soon Sabatino's!!
