Devon Ave. is definitely the place to go get an Indian buffet, but India House delivers with a great location and a great staff. Not much to say, other than completely deserving of 5-stars for such a consistently great experience. My water wasn't close to half empty the entire time, even after we paid our bill. The buffet is always wonderful, I have never had anything bad here. I have always left full and stayed full for hhhhooourrrssss.....my only complaint is that I wish I could always eat more! P.S. I'm not a huge fan of chicken, but their tandori chicken is a must-try (free with lunch buffet, along with fresh naan bread :)
