The Seoul Sassy whole chicken came with 8 pieces of chicken (I didn't count, but I presume there were 2 legs, 2 breasts, 2 wings, and 2 thighs) and is garnished with some green onions. At $14 dollars pre-tax, I found the price of this chicken to be very reasonable and much cheaper than the other options I've had (I think the KyoChon whole chicken is about $18-19, and the Korean chicken at Momofuku is... well... $100 for the entire dinner (which is just two chickens)). In terms of taste, I thought it was solid, but not spectacular. The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, and the garlic flavor is not as pronounced as other soy-garlic sauces I've had. In terms of the crunch factor, the fried chicken could have been a bit crispier. I'm not sure if they double fry this chicken - I don't think they do because it just wasn't as crunchy as places to do this, and once you add the sauce, you will lose a bit of crunch. However, overall, the chicken did not seem overly oily or heavy, and the dark meat pieces were still juicy and good (the white meat breast pieces were a bit dry). Overall, the chicken was solid - not as good as KyoChon, but worth coming back to again. Surprisingly, I think the bibimbap was the highlight of my meal. Now, I'm not sure if that implicates the chicken as just being average, but I think it was more that this was some awesome bibimbap. To me, this bibimbap was pretty perfect - they used bulgogi as the beef (which is far superior to ground beef), the egg is half fried and not too runny, and there was a diverse selection of vegetables, of both the crunchy and chewy variety. After adding the hot sauce into this bowl and mixing it up, there just wasn't much else I could ask for. At $9 pre-tax, I think this is a good deal, considering that you will definitely be full after eating one of these bowls by yourself. More at: http://www.thegluttonous
