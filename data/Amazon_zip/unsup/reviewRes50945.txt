We went here for brunch on a Saturday. The menu has more than enough variety to make anyone happy. There are plenty of omlettes and variations of eggs benedict, as well as typical pancakes, waffles, etc. The Red Eye Benedict was out of this world. It was incredible, and the portion is huge so you will have to use some serious restraint to not eat the whole thing. The fresh squeezed orange juice was also great. Definitely our new breakfast spot
