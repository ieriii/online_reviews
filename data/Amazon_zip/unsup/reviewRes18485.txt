I was visiting from San Diego, Ca. I was raised with this food since mother is Mexican and father is Cuban, so i had high expectations. Also, we are about 10 miles from the mexican border where the authentic stuff is. Knowing that Mr. Bayless makes the food with his own twists i took that in mind. Hubby and i ordered the Ahogada torta, Cubana torta, Champurado and Churros. Both tortas were quite impressive. The salsa's were amazing and tasted just like mom's. The pork in the Cubana torta was just like the way my uncle's make it. The champurrado was the best I've ever had. The churros were good, not great. I grew up with Tijuana style churros and therefore that is why i gave the 4 stars instead of 5. We also had a Rick Bayless sighting while enjoying our food, that was neat. :)
