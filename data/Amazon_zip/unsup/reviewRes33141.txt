Little Bucharest is very authentic...from the menu to the decor to the service, I really felt like I was there. Part of that was quite charming, but unfortunately it lead to a mishap with the ordering of something I thought was vegetarian (as listed on the menu as such) coming out with meat in it. Oh well, my husband enjoyed it. On the plus side, the manager (perhaps owner) ran around the dining room with a bottle full of some kind of spicy liquor... pouring shots into all the diner's mouths! The atmosphere was lively and everyone seemed to be having a good time.
