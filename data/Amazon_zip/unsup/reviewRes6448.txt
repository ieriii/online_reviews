Another fantastic restaurant in Chicago. I am an NY kind of guy, but Chicago has really impressed via the likes of Girl and Goat and Davanti Enoteca. This place was really good. The mascarpone polenta and ragu was to die for. The oven fired pizzas were up there with New York and New Haven's (my favorite, check Modern Pizza) best. Service was great and the atmosphere even better. Tapas style plates where my friends and I sampled 4-6 different styles and all left feeling nourished yet not too full. Wine list was admirable and the ambiance and style really lent themselves to a pleasurable overall dining experience.
