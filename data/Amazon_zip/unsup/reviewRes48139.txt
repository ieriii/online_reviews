Took my girlfriend to eat here last week and absiolutely loved it. We sat at the communial tables, which was great because the couple next to us made a fantastic menu recommendation.  We did a half order of oisters, half order of mussels, half order of the charcuterie plate and then an order of the country ribs. (Keep in mind, they do change the menu daily). The seafood and meats were all excellent. Everything was cooked to perfection. I have been recommending this place to everyone I know since I ate there.
