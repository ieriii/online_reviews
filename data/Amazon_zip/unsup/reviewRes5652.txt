Great for wine and tapas! Nice atmosphaire and decoration. I loved the eggplant goat cheese spread and the hazelnut salad (I trully appreciate when people know how much dressing to put - perfect amount and throughout the salad. Good wine selection but rude waitress. Oh well. That happens. Highly recommend.
