Tried the Family Style Mondays last night with my husband. What a great deal - $21/person and we got 2 app's, 2 soup/salads, 3 ENTREES, and 1 dessert! We also went home had two doggie bags. Everything was pretty good but my two favorites were the Cappellacci all'Aragosta (Lobster stuffed pasta in creamy tomato sauce) and the Caprese salad. It seemed a bit like they were trying to over-Americanize the Italian with too much sauce on the other dishes, but I'd still go back. Great service too!
