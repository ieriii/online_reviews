Calo's was one of my buddy's favorite restaurants , so we ended up there a few times. I am not the biggest fan of pasta and only marginally interested in most other Italian food , so take that into account. I ordered the chicken parm , which did nothing to garner a reaction , either good or bad , it was ok. I also got the Chicken Vesuvio , this one was a boneless breast (I prefer the bone in skin on kind) , and again it was ok , nothing exciting. The linguine with red clam sauce was pretty good , the baked clams my favorite thing there and the fried calamari ... OK to a little overcooked (i ordered it a few times , and the results were inconsistent. When we ordered the pizza , I neither objected nor was I really excited , are you seeing a pattern. Sorry if I can't say this place sucks , because it doesn't. I also can't rave about this place either , I've had better . If you are in the delivery area , give it a shot , if you are in the area stop by. I would never make a special trip to this place , but if my buddy wants to go here next time he's in town , I really have no problem stopping by.
