excellent overall experience. da wife and i happened to be a few min away from the place and decided to try to eat here. it was friday at 8pm though. i called over there and asked what it looked like. spoke to Francisco who said they wouldn't have tables until 9 inside the restaurant but he could probably set us up at one of the 5 tables neat the bar, or outside under a heat lamp (it was windy and probably about 55 degrees). he was super friendly and accommodating and it sounded busy in the back ground. so we get there a few min later and there were probably 60 people standing around in the bar area and we told the hostess that francisco was saving us a table and 30 sec later we were being seated! (on the bar side, but we were ok with that). anyways, server was great too. squash blossom appetizers were not all that, but we ordered two separate dishes: stracci di farro (Farro flour pasta triangles, asparagus, leeks, garlic, truffle oil) tortelloni alla primavera (Artichoke and buffalo milk ricotta stuffed pasta tossed with fava beans, peas and parsley) both were excellent. we will be back. pricing was reasonable for the food, but we got a $40 bottle of wine so that really jacked our tab up.
