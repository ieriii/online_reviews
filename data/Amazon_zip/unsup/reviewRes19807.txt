I first ordered from Coast because they delivered to my hood. (Ukrainian village) When I got my order I was impressed with the deliciousness of the food and how big the rolls were. The rice was perfect and the fish was so pretty and yummy. Now for the bad part. It cost me a better part of a paycheck and I had to wait an hour. I know that is sort of standard, but it still sucks for something that isn't cooked. I had been ordering in for months until I actually went in and I had a very similar experience to Ms. McButter. My friend and I went in during off hours. I should tell you that my friend collects comic books and looks very much like a 40 year old comic book collector. (No offense to the adult comic book collecting community, but there is a certain look that some of you have and I find it endearing) Needless to say that this is not the "look" that most people at Coast have. It is very much a yuppie refuge, and my friend was stared at. I wasn't immune to such treatment by others either having bright red hair at the time. We got a feeling that we were thought of as amusing by others. The waitress was very nice to us, but I would never go here on a Saturday night. This place leaves me conflicted. I love the sushi, but I dislike the yuppie crowd that ostracizes others who don't conform to them. There is a reason that I don't hang out in Lincoln Park. Coast should move there.
