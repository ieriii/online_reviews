We couldn't have had a nicer time at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza. My husband, daughter, and I live in Chicago but stayed there for the weekend of our wedding anniversary just to be closer to the downtown attractions and play tourist in our own town. The staff was SO sweet and so very friendly. --As nice as any of the 4 star hotels I've stayed in. I just can't stress that enough. --Just lovely people. The rooms are nice, very clean, decently appointed but nothing too fancy. The indoor pool area was great, again very clean, lots of towels. Room service was super fast and accurate. The food in the on-site restaurant was delicious and served in a very upscale manner. It's close to everything, easy access to all sorts of transportation, beautiful views of the skyline if you're on the river side, big rooms, lots to do. I'd happily stay there again. We had a great time.
