I'd cross the Sahara, handstand on hot coals, and let a go 1 round with a thai kick boxer just to smell the Pepito Sandwich. Arite, Arite, maybe not to that extreme. Irazu is located perfectly on the corner of N Milwaukee annnnd some other street. I love their building, it has a nice bamboo fence that secludes diners during a hot summer day while they munch down on some Costa Rican cuisine. We started with their Spinach and Cheese Empenadas, which are DA BOMB! I'm willing to put my integrity on the line by saying any of their empenadas are good. Their Pepito sandwich is yumazing and its less than $5. WHAAAAAAHHHHH?!?! That's right. The ribeye is juicy and tender, the Lizano sauce is perfect, and the cheese gives it that gooey interior most of us love on a sandwich. The bread is of good quality too boot. The menu is littered with other good stuff like smoothies, tacos, and an arsenal of Costa Rican dinners. I remember them even having a good amount of vegetarian options. Irazu is a perfect place to grab lunch or dinner in the late spring, summer, or early fall. It's a blast to sit outside, drink a smoothie, and enjoy their great food. GO GIT YOU DAT PEPITO!
