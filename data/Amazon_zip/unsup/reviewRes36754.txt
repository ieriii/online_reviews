Found Meli based off a recommendation from a friend on the last day of my Chicago trip. The lines and the happy faces inside said it all and I had to wait to get a table and try their brunch food. Love Brunch! The portions are HUGE. Their espresso bar was really good actually, the waitress gave us a "really? all you want is a regular cup of coffee" speech when we ordered coffee and we got pressured to getting lattes. Well, no regrets there. We also had 2 of their freshly squeezed juices. Only critique I have is that I wish they were served more chilled, the juices came room temperature and I rather it be chilled. Food wise, it was great. The skillets were awesome- inspired me to make something similar at home. They were generously portioned, flavorful, and packed with meat, veggies, potatoes, and topped with 2 fried eggs. We also ordered the stuffed strawberry french toast to add a bit of sweetness to the brunch. It was beautifully presented and equally as delicious. Meli was definitely worth the trek to the other side of town!
