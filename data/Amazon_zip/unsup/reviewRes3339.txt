I decided to try Crisp out last night, I was boycotting the place because it use to be the Rice Bowl and I loved the Rice Bowl. Sadness. Wow, it was definitely packed, however I feel the extremely warm weather yesterday got people out of there homes. The service is warm, friendly and quick. The meals are priced extremely reasonably, especially for the large portion you get. If I wasn't going somewhere afterwards I would have had leftovers to take with me. Food: I ordered the BBQ chicken and it was fabulous, spicy and sweet at the same time, great combination. The chicken pieces were large and mostly meat, barely any bones. I really did appreciate that. I reviewed the menu and it looks like they have a lot of other popular Koren dishes. Definitely recommend everyone to stop by for some Koren BBQ.
