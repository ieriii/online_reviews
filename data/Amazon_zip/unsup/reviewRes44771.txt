OMG! This is the best stuffed pizza ever!!! Went to the location in rosemont and it was fabu! Had a few drinks too... i think it made it even better. It was late on a sunday night and the staff was ready to go. They started picking up early and it was kind of annoying but it didnt affect the food. Even though it takes almost 1/2 to make, it was amazing! 1 piece and i was filled. 1 pizza could easily feed 4 people. It was even better cold the next morning. Enjoy!
