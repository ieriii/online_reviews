I thought it was great. I did not say a word while eating my pizza; it was that good. I thought that it was a bad sign when the pizza came out before I had closed the menu and handed it back to the waitress, but I was wrong. The pizza was good from the first bite to the last. The ingredients were fresh and perfectly proportioned. The crust, though a little burnt, did not detract at all from the overall pizza. My date has labeled me as a "picky" eater and to a sense, I agree. I never thought I would give something 5 stars, but this was worth it. It was even worth the $15 price tag per personal pizza--actually, it was worth more. Spacca owners, if you read this, charge more for your pizza!
