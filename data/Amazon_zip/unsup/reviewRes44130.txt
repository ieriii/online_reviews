I'm having a bit of a moral dilemma about this place. Wakamono was my go-to sushi spot for awhile. Their sushi is usually pretty yum, the ambiance is good, and the location is super convenient for me. However, the service I experienced here last weekend was simply appalling. I've never been treated so rudely by a restaurant employee in my life, and I won't be back.  After enjoying several rounds of rolls and wine with a few of my friends we were finishing up our drinks and discussing where we would head next when the manager approached our table. I expected him to ask us how our meal was, as we had just spent over $150 on dinner, but instead he snapped at us that people were waiting for our table and we needed to leave. Shocked and frightened we obeyed his command. I really wanted to write this off as an out of the ordinary occurrence, but after reading other reviews on here I see that accosting customers is Wakamono's M.O. If you want a side of verbal abuse with your meal head to Ed Debevic's or The Wiener Circle, don't waste your money here.
