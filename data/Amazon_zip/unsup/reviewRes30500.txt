I love Nana! My husband and I went to Chicago for a weekend and made reservations at five different highly recommended local restaurants. Nana was BY FAR our favorite of all our stops. The food was mouthwatering. The atmosphere was really nice. The restaurant is clean and cute. Our server was very kind and attentive and made great suggestions. She knew the menu well and was able to help me avoid gluten. I sort of wish I'd just made five reservations at Nana and forgotten about all those other places. We'll definitely go back.
