I finally made it here. I had dipped my toes into the steaming hot waters of Pho sometime earlier, and so going to Tank Noodle seemed like the logical next step. I enjoyed the experience very much, and the crowds didn't bother me whatsoever. It gave me a strange sense of enjoyment, knowing that everyone else was undergoing the same experience that I was. I forgot which number I picked, but it had the flank, round, tendons, and some other stuff in it. Because I had done Pho before, I knew how I liked it in terms of how much sriracha I like, etc. So I had it all down to an art form, and as cheesy as this sounds, Tank noodle gave me stuff to paint with. And man was it delicious. I'm moving in June to an area that's a ten minute walk to Tank Noodle. Let's just say I'm looking forward to it.
