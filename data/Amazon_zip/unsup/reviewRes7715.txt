I have mixed feelings about this place. The endless quantities of meat brought to your table is not a bad thing, but I think you give up a little of quality for quantity. I liked the salad bar, though. The service was fantastic, and it's a fun restaurant to go to.  In all honesty though, I would rather go to one of the numerous steak houses in the city and get a higher quality cut, but that is just my preference. I don't have anything negative to say about Fogo, and if I were with some people that wanted to go, I wouldn't object. Just be ready for a LOT of meat.
