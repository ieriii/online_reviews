I just went to Brazzaz over the weekend for restaurant week. It's difficult to give a fair review as I don't care much for red meat or pork. We arrived at 4pm on Saturday, but waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Our server was friendly, but kept discouraging my husband from ordering a caipirinha and suggesting a mojito instead. when I told him we've tried this drink before, he seemed surprised! BTW, best Caipirinha I've ever had in the city! The buffet was small, but did have some great salads. The different types of meat were brought around often and if you love to eat, this is the place. I'm not sure If I'll be going back, as I can't see myself paying over $50.00 for salads, but my husband's a fan and will be visiting again with friends.
