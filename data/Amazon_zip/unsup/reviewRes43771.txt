I have been twice with friends for brunch on the weekend, so of course it was busy.  I don't mind waiting for a table if there is a little area, and you are not hovering over people or constantly having to move out of the way for people. But this is not the case here! They should just give servers sections like any other normal restaurant. But, on to the food... the huevos rancheros look good but are boring tasting. The panini's are good, but not amazing. The restaurant looks so cute and promising, but I don't think I'll be heading back.
