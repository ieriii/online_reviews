Omg delicious breakfast!!! Get there at 845am and you'll get a seat when they open at 9, and view the menu ahead of your visit to order as soon as you sit down. This place gets filled up quick, so this is the best way to get served quickly. Although I actually enjoyed sitting and watching everyone's dishes come out. I usually don't like sweets for breakfast, but the blueberry cream hotcakes were AMAZING! I split this sweet dish & the savory Veggie B'fast Burrito with my friend and it was a great combo. The burrito was the best breakfast one I've EVER tasted. Very pretty interior design and quick service -- no way could you be disappointed!!
