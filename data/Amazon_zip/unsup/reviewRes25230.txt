The short: -Very romantic -Live acoustic guitar which was awesome -The food was good, particularly the appetizer/dessert -You basically deep fry everything for the main course which I didn't like -Was very glad I got the restaurant week deal otherwise I would have felt it was too expensive The Longer: My fiancee and I went here on a Friday night for the Restaurant Week dinner because I had heard such great things about Gejas. We were really impressed by the atmosphere, it was super cozy and romantic with a live acoustic guitar playing not 5 feet from our table. The staff was quick to attend to us and brought us everything we requested in a timely fashion. The staff was also incredibly kind and knowledgeable about the menu when we asked questions about timing to cook things etc. The appetizer was a cheese fondue with a few different kinds of fruits and lots of bread. The cheese itself was quite good in my opinion, but my fiancee considered it too salty. We got 4 different kinds of meat (scallops, shrimp, chicken and beef) for the main course with a variety of vegetables. It was somewhat fun to cook, but due to the fact they cook in oil, sometimes it was splattering over the side of the pot which was a bit annoying. We also did manage to lose a few things on the skewers, but I think that was due to the fact we're newbies! There were also 8 dipping sauces with the main coarse, we really enjoyed the BBQ, the Garlic and the Peppercorn. The flaming chocolate dessert was delicious! I managed to burn all of my marshmallows, but that's just cause I'm awful at roasting marshmallows in general. I'm also a pyro, so flaming marshmallows look pretty cool :). All in all a very solid dinner. I'm not sure I would have been happy if I had bought a bottle of wine and paid full price though. A worth restaurant week visit!
