Food was pretty tasty, but I was disappointed with the service. Granted, I went on a Friday, but when your waiter disappears and you assume he went on break that's not a good sign. They have a big salad bar, which seems to be popular and their claim to fame. The waiter made the assertion that they "invented" the salad bar, which sounds ridiculous to me. A lot of customers took advantage, but I was not among them (salad bars don't seem entirely sanitary to me.) A bonus for me is that this place is literally a block away from me. Considering the big convenience points, I might go back, but for others I wouldn't go out of my way. Good sandwiches and burgers.
