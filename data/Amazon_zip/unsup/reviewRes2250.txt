Career, marriage, kids...these are all things you do to kill time between trips to Hot Doug's. You will wait in line for a while, but that makes the reward all the more tasty. The duck fries are fantastic, and Doug has yet to serve me an encased meat that I didn't like. It will not be your lowest calorie meal of the day, but it will probably be your most delicious.
