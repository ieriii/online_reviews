I came here about two years ago for a special birthday party. I remember just being blown away. The entrance is so non descript it is amazing, its next to a corner bakery! The service and presentation is fantastic. This was the first place I had tried Kobe Beef. If I remember correctly I had the 30-45 day dry aged kobe beef...wow. It was better than sex. This is a once in a lifetime kind of experience.
