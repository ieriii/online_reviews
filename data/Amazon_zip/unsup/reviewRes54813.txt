I can understand the appeal of this place, but I will always choose good food over big portions. This place is about big portions and not much else. We shared a skillet and their strawberry and banana french toast. He got coffee. I got an earl grey tea. Let's start with the tea - it was the most bland, un-fragrant earl grey I've ever had. Really disappointing given how good earl grey tea should taste. But I won't give them too much crap for their tea. It's tea, after all. Their skillet was about the size of my head, which was amusing at first. First bite: there's something funny about this egg. Second bite: this egg tastes like it's laced with metal. Didn't have much more of that. The french toast: they used challah bread and provided real maple syrup, which should have made just about anything delicious. It was boring. My taste buds were so excited, but upon the first bite, disappointment swept over me. How could something so beautiful taste so bland? So, if you like beautiful food that could feed a small African nation, you'll love this place. If you want your taste buds to have as much fun as your eyes, you'll be pretty disappointed.
