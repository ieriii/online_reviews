I'm crazy about beer. And so is the Hopleaf Bar--huge points in my book!!! While they may not provide the bulk of their beers on draft, what little they lack in drafts they make up for with their wide selection of bottled beers. Where else in the city can you score a kriek lambic, a Corsendonk ale, and mead? And, to be fair, the beers that they do have on draft fairly represent the seriously fearless brew-masters of our own proud nation and of those abroad (namely Belgium--sweet, sweet Belgium).  But don't let the "Bar" in the name steer you away from a solid Hopleaf meal! They've got the wherewith all to sate your hankering for some ridonkulously well-paired beer-drinking fare with (my personal favorite) moules frites/mussels and fries served with a decadently rich garlic aoli. Mmmm...or the Sausage Plate appetizer--super hearty and perfect alongside a German beer. Yes. I am drooling as I type. However, I wouldn't attempt anything adventurous there. I was sorely disappointed with their squash flower appetizers (a special for the season). Something like $14-16 for three measly, and unimpressive flowers.  A fantastic reason to check it out: having your beer served in the glassware that was made especially for the beer you've selected is quite the treat.  The only downside: this fancy-schmancy beer place will burn a massive hole in your sad little wallet. The Hopleaf provides quality and expects us to pay for it. How could they!!! In a perfect world I would be paid to drink beer and not the other way around. Alas, at the Hopleaf one must shell out some serious cash to drink more than one beer. But, really, isn't it worth it? Check out: -their wide range of Belgian beers -their cute, but somewhat squashed and small, upstairs area -their fries--it's a massive serving in a fun presentation, and perfect to munch on whilst savoring every last drop of liquid gold (beer) in your glass
