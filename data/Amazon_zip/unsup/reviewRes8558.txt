I just had lunch there today after not going for about 8 months and I am so sad. Spacca pizza is forever changed from the airy, Roman/Napoli style to a spongy, doughy crust that is a perfect circle, which leaves me wondering if they use a tool to make them all exactly the same size. I have been to Rome 6 times and I used to go to Spacca to get my fix, but I am not going back. They did something to change the dough and the pizza sauce was unimpressive. No more of the bubbles in the dough like in italy. First it was Pizza DOC to take a nose dive and now this place. The pizza resembled the spongy bread served at Ethiopian restaurants in the middle, and the crust was heavy and thick. Definitely NOT worth the money. I am so sad about this place :(
