My Canadian cousin visited me in Chicago for her birthday, so I decided to take her to Davanti after reading the rave reviews. It could not have been a better experience! We had a glass each of wine on the house, and they still brought us an amazing chocolate mousse dessert after! They treated us amazingly, and really, who doesn't love being spoiled?? Food was eyes closed, mouth wateringly good. I can't stop talking about this place, and if it wasn't out of the way for me, I would go allllllll the time. Dying to go back just for the Foccia di Recco (cannot stop thinking about it omg soooo good), but everything else we had was equally delicious. Hope to make it out to Little Italy again soon, I need my friends to come with so they can obsess too!
