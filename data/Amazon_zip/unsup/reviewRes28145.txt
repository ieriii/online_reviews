The pan pizza is all I've had and it's pretty great - my fave is spinach, mushrooms and black olives. Staff is friendly, the place is busy (but I've never had to wait to be seated), and it's not expensive at all. I recommend going before a movie at Webster Place -- park at the theater, eat dinner, and parking is only $2 once you get the movie validation..... cheaper than the meters (and movie theater crap food), you've hopefully seen a decent flick and you're belly is full of yum-o pizza. Perfect Date Night.
