HOT TIP: BYOB but you cannot bring your own soft drink/juice/water atmosphere: lighting is really dim. two spacey rooms for dining, loud service: quick, knowledgeable, pleasant food: sushi is enjoyable. enjoyed the baked scallops (ordered it twice on two separate occasions). Price: $$ Washroom: only one bathroom for each gender
