A wonderful dining experience. The food was very good, but at Tru it's the service and the presentation that is to be lauded. I have never had such wonderful service, anywhere, for that alone they deserve 5 stars. Yes, it's a restaurant, so of course the food has to be good, and it is. Got the prixe fix 7 or 8 courses...I lost track. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented (the dishware and cutlery for each course are gorgeous), but no, it wasn't the best meal I've ever eaten. It was close though. They started to lose me with the dessert, the rootbeer float, the chocolates, the cheese cart, and more chocolates...there comes a point (and this was it) when it's all just too much.  But back to the service. A carpeted stool for my handbag (which it deserves, thank you), an orchestra of finely tuned servers attending to our every need (At one point I asked my dining companion where the bathroom was, he had just returned, he just smiled and told me to start standing up, so I did and had an escort to the ladies room before I could put one foot in front of the other). During the meat course (veal...mmmm....I feel no guilt) we were struck by the beauty of the steak knife. We asked the server who makes it, she didn't know, but said she would get back to us. 7 minutes later she's standing at our table with a printout of the website where we could purchase said knife (which, at over $50 a pop, we did not do...I wonder how many of those knives go missing every year, they really were lovely). That is service. We paid for it, but with the way so many businesses disappoint, over- promising, under-delivering, sometimes, it's worth every penny to have your ass, unabashedly, kissed for 3 hours.
