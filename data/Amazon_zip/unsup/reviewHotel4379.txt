I stayed here over the weekend while in town for the Dave Matthews Caravan. I noticed that rooms were going for 200+ a night, however, my friend got an amazing deal on Priceline for 90 bucks/night. When you walked into the room, instantly, I knew why the room was so inexpensive. They gave us a queen size bed after informing us that they were all out of king sizes (we had a late check-in). The bed seemed to take up the entire room. When I looked out the window, my "view" consisted of brick walls and the windows of other rooms. I now realized why other rooms had their curtains drawn. The bathroom was fairly large, however, we couldn't get the stopper to stay up and keep the bathtub from filling with water, not to mention the fact that the the bathroom had no ventilation of any kind, which makes for a pretty stinky deal, if you catch my drift (pun intended). All in all, the room served its purpose: Sleeping, showering and changing for a very short stint in Chicago. If I were on "vacation", I would have definitely opted to upgrade to a suite for a more comfortable stay.  The pros of the hotel: Nice bar, lobby/lounge area, Starbucks is conveniently located downstars. It was conveniently central to everything: Millennium Park, Grant Park, a few blocks walking distance from Magnificent Mile. However, the best part about this hotel: It had a UPS connected to one of its South entrances, which was open on Sunday! I ended up getting stamps and sending postcards to family, as well as mailed a t-shirt I had purchased for my niece. That UPS was the saving grace of my trip. Had it not been open, I'm sure the t-shirt would still be sitting in the corner of my room, a miserable heap, begging to be shipped to a pretty princess in San Diego.
