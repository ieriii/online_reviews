If I could give this place zero stars I would.Lets just say if your sister gets back from Iraq and you want to meet her in Chicago at the government rate (which she had MORE than earned). DO NOT come here. They refuse to accomodate military personnel in any room with two beds. So instead of a great rate for a returning soldier (190) you can instead pay more than you do on any travel site if you need more than one bed (415 was the quote for a double).Sad. You can have my priority club card back. PS your hotel front desk was just as bad if not worse than your 800 number rude staff. Trust me I will be telling everyone I know about this. The Holiday Inn/Intercontential?Crowne Plaza people DO NOT CARE about our returning soldiers. So much for our girls weekend.
