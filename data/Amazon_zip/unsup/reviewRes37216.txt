One star from a loyal customer for the past five years. New owners, new management = fire all the good employees and only have the absolute minimum of staff working even at peak times. It's obviously all about the bottom line now. Deli section? Be prepared to wait for about 20 minutes before someone notices that you need help. Meat section? Stand in line for 30 minutes. I've been given old stinky chicken twice and almost gagged from the smell. Yes, F&O is great if you want olive oil that was cold pressed in Rome by the Pope (and you're prepard to pay for it).  They're usually out of everything else. Simple basic things that you want they never seem to have in stock. The cashiers frequently over charge so I always have to check my bill and I find mistakes more often than not. I still shop here for bakery products and tall grass beef, but everything else I get at Dominick's. As Holden Caufield said "I quit going there entirely, eventually". EDIT: Just found out this morning that the new Cafe manager informed all the employees that they will no longer be allowed to accept tips, and that any tips received by management will be donated to the Chicago Food Depository. WTF??? These are hard working people who work in the food service industry, probably struggle to make a living wage as it is, and now they will be giving their tips to a Chicago food bank, at which many of them probably eat anyway. Get a clue management - you are idiots. I'm done with F&O forever.
