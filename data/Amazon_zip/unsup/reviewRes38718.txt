I had a drink at the Hopleaf tonight and was really happy with the atmosphere, prices, and of course the AMAZING selection of delicious craft beer. I've read that the people here were pretentious and stuffy, and I couldn't disagree more. The bartender was very friendly and the place had a great atmosphere. All of the food sounded awesome, so I'll be going back tomorrow night for dinner!
