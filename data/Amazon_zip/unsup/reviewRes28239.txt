Can't really describe what it is, but Graham Elliot has a very unique ambiance. They totally do their own thing and seem almost snobby in doing so but they're able to pull it off. The popcorn that they start you off with is totally cool and tastes amazing. It's nice to have a place that doesn't go the normal boring bread route, and plus popcorn doesn't fill you up like bread does. We started with the Deconstructed Caesar Salad, which was really cool too. I loved the brioche twinkie, totally innovative. The twinkie filling was a little heavy on the garlic though, almost overpowering. The romaine was a little bitter too. But the twinkie makes the dish completely worth it. For the main dish, we had the cod and the beef filet. The cod was very nicely cooked, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. There were a ton of components on the dish like wheat puree, herbs, sauces etc., most of them I didn't even know what they were but each had its own distinct flavor that combined to make a phenomenal dish. The beef filet medallions were ok. The beef was kind of dry and tough. This dish also had a bunch of other components, I especially liked the roquefurt panna cotta. So creative. For dessert, we had the pineapple and the cocoa gateu. Honestly, these weren't that great. They looked cool but the flavors were too bitter and salty and the portions were like the size of sprinkles honestly. I may be unrefined in my taste, but I like my dessert sweet and filling. The alcohol infused brownies they give you at the end were really good though. Overall, Graham Elliot is a very chic and super creative experience. They could do better on some basics like not overpowering with certain flavors and cooking beef right, but the ambiance and creativity totally covers for it.
