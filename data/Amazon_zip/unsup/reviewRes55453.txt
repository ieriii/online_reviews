My failed attempt at dinner at Piccolo Sogno was the worst dining experience I've ever had in Chicago. The staff was inattentive and rude. I had called in advance to see if it was possible to reserve a table in their courtyard and I was assured it was. Upon arriving, I found out that they do not reserve tables outside and I would have to wait, despite having a reservation. When I mentioned that I was assured a table outside by the woman I spoke to on the phone, the hostess told me I was mistaken, and I was immediately brushed off. Despite this initial disappointment we decided to get a drink at the bar and wait. After being ignored for 15 minutes at the bar by all 4 bartenders, I decided to abandon the drinks and return to the waiting area. While waiting, I spoke with another couple that was told the same as us about a table outside. They had been told their wait would be 30 minutes, and after checking the status of their table after 45 minutes they were told they would have to wait longer, and the hostess did not know how long it would be. After hearing this, we finally decided to leave. It was an incredibly uncomfortable and disappointing situation, which is inexcusable. There are plenty of great dining options in Chicago, and I would recommend planning a night out somewhere other than Piccolo Sogno. The food may have been great, but I'll never know.
