My husband and I hosted our October 16, 2010 wedding ceremony and reception at Hotel 71. This review is of the hotel as a wedding venue, although the rooms are also lovely. The greatest asset to hosting our wedding at Hotel 71 was Rebecca, the Conference Services Manager. She was prompt, professional and lots of fun to work with. My husband and I weren't very knowledgeable about weddings prior to the planning process, and Rebecca was very quick to respond to inquiries and find answers for us. She always had great suggestions and helped us structure the entire event so that everything went smoothly.  The venue itself is beautiful. Weddings are hosted in the 39th floor ballroom. The room has tons of windows with gorgeous views of the city. My husband and I were looking for a venue that was modern, urban and quintessentially Chicago, and Hotel 71 definitely fits that description. The location and views really can't be beat. Our ceremony was held at sunset and the reception started later that evening. The lighting and scenery really helped create a beautiful event.  Our guests loved the venue and we are still getting tons of compliments more than two months later. Thank you so much to Rebecca and Hotel 71 for helping us put together such a memorable day!
