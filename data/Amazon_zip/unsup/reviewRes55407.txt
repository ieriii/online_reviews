I'm a first time Yelp-er, but my experience at Sprout was far too Yelp-worthy to deny my compulsion to do so . The space is very pretty, the menu reads like a dream, the food sings like a song, and the plates are all so visually stunning. It's an interesting combination of flavors and employing unique components that's very very neat and it still is very very soulful. The service was also impeccable, and I'm highly grateful for a lovely night.
