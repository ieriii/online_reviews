A few of my girlfriends and I have a dinner club where we try out new restaurants (it's like our own version of check please!). This was one of the picks we tried this year. I'm not a rich woman so I typically avoid places that are billed as fine dining because I don't want to spend $100 on a meal. So it was a real treat to find this place...it's fine dining that doesn't break the bank! Of course the BYOB helps with that since that's usually about 1/2 the cost of my bill at any meal (call me a lush). THis place lives up to the hype though. The food is above average and our server was really helpful with suggestions. The place is super small (like 10 tables maybe?) so I would highly recommend a reservation. And bring an extra bottle of wine because this isn't the type of place where you'll want to hurry through your meal!
