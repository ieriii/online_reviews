I have been going to this hamburger and salad bar place for the better part of two decades. It's a "feel-good" restaurant if you long for the 1970s and all of its corny music and fashion. The Gruntburger is my favorite, although people have stuffed themselves at the very large salad bar, which is an adventure on it own.
