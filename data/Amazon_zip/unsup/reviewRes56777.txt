yum. it has been hard for me to find pizza i like in the city. for some reason everywhere I try has a cardboard tasting crust (besides Ian's). Spacca Napoli, why have I not tried you before? Yum, that's all I can say, great crust, stringy cheese, tasty sausage, fresh ingredients. Thank you Spacca Napoli, I knew I could find a place near my apt that was great.
