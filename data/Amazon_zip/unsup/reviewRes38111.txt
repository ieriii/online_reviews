UPDATE 8.1.07: Maybe I was in a really good mood when I first reviewed Giordano's. Or, maybe I'm in a really foul mood now. Either way, my opinion has changed - and thus, two less stars for you, Giordano's. With an ever-soggy crust and a mediocre sauce, this place is merely riding the coat tails of the Legend of Chicago Pizza. It's just another chain, and it's no better in my book than your neighborhood Pizza Hut. And the real shame (or should I say blessing?) is that all the tourists flock to this place like it's the only worthy place to get a pie in town. Oh, the horror! _______________________ Good pizza and they deliver. We get it a lot for meetings at work. I always stick with the stuffed spinach, but I've wanted to venture elsewhere. Any suggestions? Still don't think it's the best in Chicago, but definitely Top 5.
