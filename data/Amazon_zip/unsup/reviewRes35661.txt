Had the pleasure of eating at this Restaurant for my bffs 40Th Birthday Celebration and it was worth every penny!! I Had the clam chowder and it was the best I ever had!!! I also had sushi and shrimp cocktail... For my main course I had the king crab legs and the fillet mignon with creamed spinach and caesar salad...This was by far one of the best meals I ever had!!! The prices are a little high but worth every penny you pay!!! I Will Definitely be back!..
