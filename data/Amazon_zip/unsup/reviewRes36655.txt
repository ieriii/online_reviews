Going to have to agree with Katie W. on this one. Place was pretty good but verrrry loud (tables are packed in there). Some of the decor and lighting was very pleasing to the eyeballs and the food was good. Overall though any place that is BYOB gets a bump up in my book! Couldn't shake the feeling of infidelity with Thai Grill though......
