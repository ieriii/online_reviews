I am extremely picky when it comes to my margaritas, and when I first went to Mayan Palace, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. They were delicious! Plus, they are half price on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Oh, and the food is great as well! Definitely one of my fav restaurants in the neighborhood!
