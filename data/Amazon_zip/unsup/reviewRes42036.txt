Now this is probably the place I should order some pho. It is always bustling and crowded for a reason besides the great bubble tea. I've been twice just for the bubble tea and I highly recommend the watermelon flavor. It is much better than the mango one. The bubble tea is sweet, tasty and refreshing. The bottom was filled with yummy black tapioca balls, and chunks of fresh fruit. Definitely worth it and worth repeat visits.
