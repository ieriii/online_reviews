For $7, I got this big ass bowl of the Korean equivalent of chicken fried rice (I would have opted for one of the Korean dishes, but I already had a fried egg, and many of them came with that), and it was SOOO good. That's really all I have to day ... it's a pretty great lunch place, quick service ... big portions. They were blaring Radiohead though, which made talking to my buddy kinda tough, but I can live with that. I think I would actually go here for carry-out next time. It got kinda crowded, and as ushe, the fact that there's no free refills on soft drinks bugs me. But, it's another great restaurant on one of my favorite shopping streets in the city (Broadway, between Diversey and Belmont).
