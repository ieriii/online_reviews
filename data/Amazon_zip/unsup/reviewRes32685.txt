demera demera demera... i grew up around uptown and pass by this place a million times and finally decided to try it with my cousin and sister. let me just tell you, it was a very different eating experience. i really don't like eating with my hands, yes, i eat pizza and chicken with utensils, lol. well anyways we all ordered something different, the chicken, beef and pork spicy stew. the sides were really good and tasty, and we ate the entrees with this mushy, lime, soft bread. i wish there was rice instead! because after awhile i couldn't get use to the bread. but overrall it was a good. next time i want to try the honey wine that everyone is talking about. and our waitress was very nice and helpful in helping us pick our foods.
