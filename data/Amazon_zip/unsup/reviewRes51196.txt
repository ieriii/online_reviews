Wishbone is great! Family friendly and adult friendly. The service is always very good, too. Once a week they have live dinner music - acoustic trios and quartets. The decor is funky (in a good way) and they have the best black bean cakes ever. Ever. Also, the breakfast at Wishbone is excellent. My favorite thing to recommend to everyone is "Crunchy French Toast." It's delicious and available all day long. Try it.
