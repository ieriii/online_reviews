Some friends and I went to Glenn's for Sunday brunch and were generally pretty happy with our meals. The wait was only 15 minutes, and we were seated on the patio on a gorgeous spring afternoon, so one star is for the atmosphere - the only negative was the close proximity to the Montrose Brown Line stop, but the trains run so infrequently on Sundays that the noise wasn't really an issue. Two of us got omelettes (mine with ham, peppers and tomatoes, hers with mushrooms and spinach) and they were good - fluffy and big and not even a little greasy, and they didn't skimp on fillings. She had to ask for ketchup with hers, but our waiter was more than happy to oblige. My boyfriend had the steak sandwich, which is apparently their best-selling, and it was fine - the horseradish mayo was a little strong for my taste, and the steak was cooked medium when he'd asked for it rare. My other friend's French toast was disappointing because it sounded so good on the menu (cinnamon custard egg wash! Crme anglaise! Choose your own bread!) but ended up being on about the same level as my boyfriend's sandwich - no major complaints, but would order something else next time. The brunch standout is clearly the potato pancakes. The insides are sour creamy and oniony and gooey and the outside crust is thick and tastes like the grill, which sounds gross but is, in fact, delicious. I would go back to try a bloody Mary or a seafood dish - one of their blackboard scallop specials with Dijon mustard sounded awesome.
