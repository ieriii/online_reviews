oopa!!! went to the greek islands restaurant this past weekend for dinner & i gotta say i kinda felt like i was there in the mediterranean w/ the decor, service & of course the food! got here after 9 on a friday night, it was busy but we were seated quickly. we started with fried calamari, dolmades & the flaming sagnaki cheese for appetizers. the flaming sagnaki was flambeed tableside & it was extremely tasty...nice & gooey w/ a hint of lemon. i was also interested in trying the dolmades b/c i had never had it before...stuffed grape leaves w/ ground meat & rice. i was glad i tried the dolmades b/c it was really good & was topped w/ a nice sauce..definitely worth trying if you've never had it before..comes in a good size portion of 3 dolmades for $4.95. for dinner i couldn't decide between ordering the mousaka or the pastichio, so our server recommended that i do the combination plate of half portions of both. so i got half portion of the mousaka (baked eggplant meat casserole) & half portion of the pastichio which was kind of like a greek lasagna..similar to the mousaka, but w/ pasta instead of layers of eggplant. overall everone seemed to enjoy their meals & the prices are not too bad either! with appetizers, entree & drinks it averages to $20-25/person. don't forget to buy a bottle of olive oil that they serve w/ the bread on your way out..great to have for cooking at home! *another plus is that greek islands has free valet parking!!!...where else can u find free parking in chicago?!
