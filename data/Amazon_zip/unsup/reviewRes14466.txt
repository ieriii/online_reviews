How did I miss out on this place? They have so many attractive items on the menu that it was hard to choose. The sandwiches are really good and the greenish sauce is a great touch to most of their sandwiches. I was glad that they had Malta to drink. The prices are cheap but I just wish it was located a little closer. Still gets 5 stars
