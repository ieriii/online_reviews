Boo.  I called in to make a reservation and was rudely told they don't take them. Even for a party of 12? Nope, email our event planner. Ok. I did. Was again told no, no reservations. Come at 5pm. 5pm for dinner? We are not 65 years old.  I guess we will take our big party elsewhere. Stupid and disappointing because the food and beer at Revolution are good and it seemed like the perfect place for my friend's birthday. Oh well I guess.
