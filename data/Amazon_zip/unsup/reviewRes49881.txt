Probably the rudest bartender in the United States of America. My fiance and I went to the fifty fifty after her 14 hour shift at the hospital. After downloading an app to my iPhone which claimed to have "one free shot, on the fifty fifty" we decided to check it out. Why not? A free shot is seductive, right? Rolled inside, showed the bartender the coupon, she said "its only on mon-wed".... well today was Thurs. After asking her why I had an app that claimed I could receive something that I couldn't she simply replied " Um, Im not going to argue with you, and your not getting a free drink". Fair enough, I asked to speak to her manager, not because her attitude is what I would have expected from my nine year old, but to find out the reason behind the false advertising. She came back, said "you know what, the manager is busy, he said you can have a free drink". We were so disgusted with her attitude, we just left. I have never turned down a drink before, but I am not a basket case, and she tried to humiliate me in front of my fiance. Unreal. For the record, I was looking to bring my friend who was just discharged out of the Navy (I am a veteran too) to have some drinks this weekend, I will not be taking him or anyone, including my fiance, to the Fifty/50. My fiance is a recent graduate of medical school, and we just wanted to capitalize on a "free shot" which was A COMPLETE FAILURE ON BOTH ENDS. Completely disgusted. For the record, I am not a cheap skate, I always tip extremely well, and I have worked in the restraunt buisness before.
