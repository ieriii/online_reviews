I was a little disappointed in Chicago Q, but only because I'd spent a week reading the lavish praises of fellow Yelpers and had probably built my hopes up way too high. One thing I will say: their pulled meats are dee-li-cious! The boyfriend and I shared the q3, which includes 2 pulled meats (we got the pork and chicken), a half rack of St. Louis ribs, and honey-butter cornbread. We also got the bruleed mac and cheese, which wasn't nearly hot and gooey enough for my taste. Too much crumb crunch and spice, not enough melt-in-your-mouth goodness. However, I don't mean to sound overly disparaging. It's definitely a solid establishment. The pickles and bbq chips served as a pre-appetizer rocked my world. After I had tasted the cornbread and mac, I just gave in and turned my attention directly to the pickles, which are big slices of tangy, garlicky goodness. Definitely worth picking up a jar to take home, if they have them. Like I said, the meats were tasty. I recommend the spicy bbq sauce, which isn't really spicy at all but has a nice subtle kick, and the mustard sauce. Next time, I think we'd skip all the extras and just go for a big plate of the pulled meats and some pickles on the side :) To be fair, we went at a somewhat awkward time (2pm on a Saturday, neither lunch nor dinner). The service, however, was still excellent--we had a very cheery waitress who made our dining experience pleasant. The space is beautiful too--its tucked around a busy corner, so the area is lively but not overcrowded, and both the interior and exterior are charming and refreshing. Almost like you're eating at a friend's house, rather than at a restaurant. Just lovely. We sat at the bar area near a cute little patio at a high round table, where we could see the Manchester v. FCBarcelona final. Nice touch.
