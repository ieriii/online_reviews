I love this place. It's consistently excellent food and great service. I love how the menu is always changing, and the basic ingredients they cook with. ( You might leave a little garlicky, but I'm married so that's fine with me.) The atmosphere is VERY hustling and bustling. It's always noisy and packed, so I suggest a reservation. I love everything I have had here...pasta, fish and roast chicken. All of the apps are always delicious as well!! It would be 5 stars if they had a drink list and better wine by the glass....
