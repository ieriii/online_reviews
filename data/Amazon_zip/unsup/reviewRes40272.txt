I don't usually believe the hype, but everything I heard about this place was true. And I've eaten at all three locations. The burritos are packed, and I mean PACKED, with the best asada I've ever tasted. Throw in a little cilantro and onion with some salsa verde squirted on each bite, and you're in business. Simple and delicious. These are the burritos by which all others should be judged. Pure, simple, and as close to perfect as you can get. These are not Mission-style burritos. These are packed meat logs. God I want one right now. UPDATE: I've heard that the quality has declined considerably. I'll have to investigate...
