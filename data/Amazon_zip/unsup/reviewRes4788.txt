Being a popular place, I am surprised we got seated within 30 minutes on a Friday night. Although a bit cramped, I kind of like the community table atmosphere which allows for some interesting "single serving friends" Food is pricy, but amazing. wonderful flavor combinations I would have never thought of! The wine list might be the most extensive I have seen in Chicago, and it is all imported to boot. While I don't think I will be a regular, it is definitely worth a visit now and then.
