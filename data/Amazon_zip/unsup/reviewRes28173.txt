delicious. After my Lou Malnati's experience i am now obsessed with deep dish pizza. we ended up here at 6pm on sunday night and had no wait. The only bad part about deep dish is having to wait for your pizza to get cooked (about 30+ minutes). however, it was worth it. SO GOOD! my husband had to stop me at piece number 4 which was a good thing b/c now i have leftovers to eat tonight :)
