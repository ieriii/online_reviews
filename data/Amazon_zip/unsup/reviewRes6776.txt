When I was up in Chicago recently, I went here twice. Nice ambiance for the area and quick, prompt service. Definitely appreciate the warm bread served after you're seated and the good attention on if your glass is filled. My first time I had the rabbit ravioli. The pasta was cooked very well, but I found the overall appeal and taste a bit bland. Maybe it was the sauce? I could barely taste the rabbit. But, the quality was good so I didn't make an issue of it. My second time I had the pasta with sausage and meatballs. The star of this dish are the veal meatballs. The sausage is good as well and the pasta was pretty standard noodles and red sauce.  Good little neighborhood spot, not too expensive with a decent wine list.
