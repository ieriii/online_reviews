Great selection of beer. They brew some of their own as well. Food is excellent. Overall great place to go. It gets very crowded around dinner time. Street parking is easy to fine. My only problem with this place is their TV policy. They won't turn it on unless it's a Chicago game. It's more of a dinner place than a hang out, drink beer, and watch sports place.
