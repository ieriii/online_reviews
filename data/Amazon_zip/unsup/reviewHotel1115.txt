Maybe 10 years ago this was the place to be, but not so much anymore. There were a few highlights of my stay; the great personalities of their bellmen, a terrific waiter that took care of our table in the wine bar as girls came and went for spa services, and of course my girls that spent the weekend in town. Outside of that, really nothing impressive.  The room was kind of standard and blah. Our main bathroom door wouldn't close without throwing your weight into it, so thankfully our public bathroom looking toilet had it's own door. The towels felt like my mom's, no fabric softener and line dried. I at least got a decent exfoliation out of it that. And really, over $15 for internet service. I did get a great deal on the hotel rooms, so I'm not torn up about our stay. I suppose I would have more to say if I had paid full price.
