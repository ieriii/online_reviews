I love this place! They have an adventurous food menu and a mile long beer list! HEAVEN! The only draw back is the wait. Not sure if they take reservations but this isn't a bar you can just call your girlfriends to meet you at for dinner. You would have to plan in advance to go there and wait for at least 45 minutes. I had the sausage plate and frites. My friends got the mussels and some kind of sandwhich they were raving about. The server suggesting food/drink pairing which was great for us. The service was great, the atmosphere was great and the wait was worth it. But I may not stop in as often as I'd like if I'm crunched for time or hungry!
