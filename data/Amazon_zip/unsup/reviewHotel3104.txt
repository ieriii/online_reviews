I'm reviewing the bar/restaurant...Bliss on LSD. This is another cool place to meet for a date...The food is awesome but a bit pricey. Have something light like the raw tuna & avocado appetizer that comes in a martini glass..delicious. Sit at the baby blue lit up bar and have a drink. If the weather is nice you can then move outside with your drink and date & sit in the cool wooden lounge chairs right off LSD and watch the sun set over the lake....really laid back. People are upper class folks but friendly. And the best part...if the date goes well, you're inside a hotel;-) This is one of my favorite hotel bars around...doesn't have the feel of a hotel bar at all. **Edit: I went here again and they don't have the raw tuna/avocado appetizer anymore...I didn't know this but they change their menu almost weekly...this time they were going on a 'world' tour of foods, so they had all kinds of stuff from different countries. Still love this place. And I figured out that you can see into the men's bathroom and vise versa....they're connected by a see-through blue window.
