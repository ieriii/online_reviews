We dined here during restaurant week and were pleasantly surprised. I am not a huge pickle fan, but found the house made bread and butter pickles fantastic! I started with the lemon shrimp and grits which were ok, but I preferred the bbq flight. The mustard sauce is delish. You get a lot of food. A lot. By the time our entrees (brisket and ribs) arrived we were too stuffed to take more than a few bites. Of course, there's always room for dessert though! We had the milk and cookies and key lime pie. The server said the key lime pie was the best dessert on the menu and he was not lying. It wasn't too tart, but just had enough citrus buried under the creamy texture. I've been on an obsessive recipe search since. Service was exceptional. Our water glasses never went empty and the entire waitstaff was very attentive. As busy as it was, the chef took time to give us a tour of the kitchen. Chef Whippen is super nice and made us feel at home. Not only does she make a killer key lime pie, she's got the southern hospitality down pat. Their brunch menu sounds awesome and I would definitely return to try it.
