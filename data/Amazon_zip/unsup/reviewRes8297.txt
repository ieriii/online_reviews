This place was packed when I went, but they served free champagne while we were waiting. The pizza was great -- it's a light thin-crust with delicate cheese, and not too oily. Service was good, but the night was spoiled at the end when the owner asked if he could "boot" us for another table while we were finishing up our coffee after dinner. We had barely been there an hour and were in and out before any other table that got there at the same time. UPDATE: The owner happened to read this review and sent a message to apologize -- hopefully nobody else will be rushed like that now. Also, FYI, this place is close to the Montrose Brown Line stop.
