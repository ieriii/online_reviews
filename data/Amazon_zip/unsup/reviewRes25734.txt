We had a mediocre experience at Mercat a la Planxa for lunch during Chicago Restaurant Week. Service is what really killed this experience. Our server was not knowledgeable about the food or wine, having to field all our questions to another although he wasn't new. He was not attentive, and our drinks went without refill for quite awhile. He never smiled. It did seem he had five tables to take care of, but with a prix fixe menu it shouldn't be that difficult. The atmosphere wasn't intimate, and unfortunately still felt like we were in a hotel (yes, I know it is a hotel restaurant, but the restaurant should feel like a separate dining experience when you enter in my opinion). The food was decent. The Serrano ham and fig salad was really good, but I thought the extra smoked bacon was unnecessary and overpowered the other flavors. The scallops were the best part of my meal with the roasted eggplant puree and wisp of basil sauce very delicious and melding together. I couldn't eat any of the dessert options so they were kind to substitute cheese instead, which were good. My husband, however, enjoyed the milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow to no end and suggested I take a bite and suffer through a few hours of pain (from my allergy) because it would be worth it for how amazing they are. I did not, but his final course did determine that this review was at least 3 stars. Recommendation? Just go for dessert.
