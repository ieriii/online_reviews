Too bad for the low review, as the food is actually very good. However, the service was pretty bad - all due to our waitress. I went early with a few friends (not crowded yet), and it was a special night as one had been ill. After the meal, I asked my friends if they found the server rude (perhaps it was my imagination?) and everyone else chimed in and agreed. We don't know if it's because we didn't all get wine/appetizers, or what it was. One of my friends said it's as though she didn't like us (!). I very casually mentioned this to the Manager on the way out, and while he did apologize, it did not feel sincere at all. I was very calm & complimented him on the food quality, so definitely wasn't maintenance about it.. We did not get the feeling that he was going to do anything about it. So, since we are fortunate enough to live in a city where there are outstanding restaurants - Italian or other - why go to a place where the service is poor?
