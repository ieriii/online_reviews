This restaurant is one that I continually come back to. I've found that the quality of the food and service is always great, and even though prices are a little steep, Brazzaz is perfect for those occasions where you want to indulge. The salad bar is quite good, and has a fairly good variety of items. I feel, though, that sometimes stuff isn't replenished as quickly as it could be. Also, there's no type of soup, unlike some in some of the other competitors' salad bars. But, for what it is, it's really good.  Now to the main event. As soon as you flip the little token over, an avalanche of meaty goodness comes your way. I don't think I've ever tried anything that I didn't like. The meats are cooked to perfection, and it's really difficult to refuse stuff, because your mind tends to say, "Just one more piece can't hurt, right?" That said, the thing that I keep waiting for at the table is the guy with the rack of lamb. The lamb is so succulent, and it practically falls into your mouth as you bite into it.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who has the occasional meat tooth, as it will certainly be satiated here!
