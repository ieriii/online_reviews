I made a reservation for June 11th on hotwire. Had to wait in line with 15 other guests and only one poor receptionist. I asked if she could get her manager so we could expedite the line. Was told the manager was in her office!. Guests should be your main concern if you are the manager. So, facing a 45 min wait to check in I thought I would use the self check in computer. Oh silly me!. Of course that was not working either!. A concierge named Chris finnally checked me in. He was very polite. I gave him my credit card for incedentals and my hotwire reservation #. He swiped my card and said my card was over it's limit. It was not. I had to call the credit card company and have then explain to him that he was incorrect. Then 10 min later he was finnally able to find my hotwire reservation. I had called the hotel in advance and had been offered a queen non smoking room. Since I have severe asthma. When we got to put room it was two small beds in a smoking room!. I will try and never stay in this hotel again!. They need to train their front desk staff including their managers.
