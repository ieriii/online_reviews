The decision to eat here was random, we were starving and getting quite bitchy in the car looking for places to eat, so thank you Yelp. Enjoyed the atmosphere very much. Our waiter gave us an option to eat in the front area or in a room towards the back and I loved having that option. I also noticed they offered it to other customers as well. The real surprise were the portions as I couldn't have expected that much to come out! As time went on, I enjoyed Sapori Trattoria more and more. The service was wonderful and I felt at ease ordering, drinks were constantly refilled, and not to mentioned, everything was done quickly. Even the bread and oil was great. I look forward to stopping in again next time I am in the area.
