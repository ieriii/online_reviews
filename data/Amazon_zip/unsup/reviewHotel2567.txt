Yes, it really is a beautiful place and after spending the weekend at the Hotel Victor in South Beach, I think my expectations were not set correctly.  I highly suggest getting a bottle and reserving the area in the center of the main room, that's the best location to see all the action and of course be the center of attention. The music on the nights which I have been has been spotty, sometimes hip and funky, other times latin influenced and there were a couple people breaking down the salsa on the dancefloor. For a good time with a big group and a late night agenda, Victor hotel is a fun place to hang out. For an intimate night with a special someone, not really the place to be. Cover charge, what's that? you're not that cool.....  Get a bottle, jump the line and live in style.. have a limo to transport you... and then you'll really be a rockstar.... xoxo
