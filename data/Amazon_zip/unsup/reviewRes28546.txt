On June 5, we arrived at 5 PM and were lucky enought to get a 6 PM reservation. We hung out at the bar and had a few margaritas (very good). At the appointed time we were shown to our table, a nice table for 2. Our waiter, Juan S., then immediately proceeded to rush our dinner choices. After some chips and guac, my date and I ordered a quesadilla and the swordfish special. Juan then came back 2 minutes later and announced that the swordfish ahd been replaced by the halibut. After I expressed surprise since he had just described the swordfish, he said, "This is a restaurant and that's the way things go." So, then the water torture began. "Your entrees should be right out," we were told numerous times. Well, they certainly should. After 45 minutes my date left the the restaurant. I called for the check and Juan said the manager would be right over. The last thing I saw was the buffoon-like manager marching into the kitchen. Not sure this place isn't just a huge joke they're playing on the huddled masses.
