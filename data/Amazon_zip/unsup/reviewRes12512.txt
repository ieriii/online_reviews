Unfortunately, this is another one of those places that everyone is supposed to like. "Let's all hype it up amongst ourselves, and tell everyone else how great it is, so they like it too!!!" Nope, not for me. I think my first visit was 2 or so years ago, and I remember the mojitos being a-OK. The food was nothing great. On my second visit a couple of weeks ago, the mojitos got worse (do they serve virgin mojitos for $9...?), and the food was a disaster. We got the appetizer sampler thing-y, and that was the best thing of the night. Very fairly priced, and it also tasted good.  Our entrees were horrible though. The BF got the beef, and I got pork. My pork was uber dry, even though there was all this weird sauce all over it. It came with a side of rice and beans (mixed together), and the rice wasn't cooked at all! It was like eating little pebbles. I notified our server, and he came back with a "it is what it is, so I brought you white rice with a side of beans". So the chefs knew it was undercooked, and decided to serve it to me anyway...??? Oh ok, weird. I least I got my carb fix - I just had to mix the beans and rice together myself. I guess another redeeming factor was the sweet potatoes. If I had to go back, and I'm assuming I won't, I'd get the appetizer platter and sweet potatoes.  I definitely wouldn't put Cafe 28 in the "delicious" category.
