Let me be clear, I'm not so fancy that I won't eat at a restaurant where the ambiance is "blah". Most Chinese restaurants are this way, but it's not why I go. They have great noodle soup with duck and pork. Beer's $2.50 a bottle. I'm full and slightly buzzed at WELL under $15 (most of my meal being the cost of the beer). Drink lots of water though - the MSG will most likely bother you.
