I'm just going to echo what 900 other reviews have already said. Hot Doug's actually lives up to all the hype. 1) Got there right when they opened on Saturday AM and I didn't expect a 40 min wait, mostly outside in the rain and cold. I kept asking myself, "Who [else] eats hot dogs at 10:30AM?!" And then I realized that these were my kind of people, in my kind of town. God I love hot dogs.  2) Hot Doug's excels at both the bread and butter dog and the gourmet. Best Chicago Dog ever! Had mine deep-fried (!!!) and it had perfect snap with fresh, high-quality toppings. The wild boar sausage was fantastically tender and well-paired with the smoked gouda 3) If possible, avoid sitting at the counter facing cold, starving patrons waiting in line. It made me feel truly gluttonous to be inhaling my duck fries and multiple hot dogs with people literally going hungry right before my eyes.
