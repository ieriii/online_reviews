Now that I think about it, I think I've been here more than any other restaurant in this city- a combination of ALWAYS having great sushi, good service, never a wait TOO long, and the fact that it's BYOB and parking is do-able make this place 5 stars in my opinion. Decor inside is nice, candles on the tables and dimmed lighting make it a great date spot, and prices are very reasonable for quality sushi. There's always it seems some spicy jalepeno roll on special that is sooo good and i always get it, though I can't remember the name. I've loved Coast from my first mouthful of sushi and I'mma continue loving it for years to come.
