RevBrew, it's time for your updated review. I'm granting that all-important 4th star because y'all growed up now!  They've finally matured their service - the front desk is attentive, patient and accommodating. And our server (Ann) was super friendly and very knowledgeable on the RevBrew offerings. She wasn't pushy, and as busy as she was (when is RB NOT busy?), she was incredibly attentive.  The food was very good -- need I remind you? BACON. POPCORN. Read: POPCORN WITH BACON. Always a crowd favorite. The sausage/pork platter/sampler was good, not great. Curry sausage?  I'm confused, and so were my taste buds. The mussels in white ale were fantastic, but the broth was far superior to the mussels themselves (which is fine, as I brought the serving dish to my lips and drank the delicious liquor....my date was mortified...mortified that I didn't offer the bowl to her FIRST).  I need to go back a few more times before I can grant the elusive 5th star. YOU still need to go....I'll buy you a beer, maybe even two.
