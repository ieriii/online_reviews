I had to update this for consistency. I've been here 5 or 6 times now and every single time has been amazing. Some restaurants I feel like are outstanding one time you go and the next not so much. The Pig always delivers. There are different things on the menu when you go (which is annoying but understandable since they use what is fresh) but every time has been absolutely amazing.
