I used to love Glenn's. Went there a couple of times and loved it. Too bad that service is really starting to falter. It all started when I made the reservation for our party of 4 and I was told by the person on the other end that they would not seat us unless all 4 people in the party arrived at the same time. I found that warning unnecessary. When we got there we entered a room of empty tables. Our reservation was for 6:30 and even though we only arrived 5 minutes early at 6:25 we were told "you're early, you'll have to wait" and they motioned us to wait against a wall right where people come into the restaurant and bump into you (the place is small and there really is no formal waiting area). My parents who are visiting from out of town could not understand what was going on. It all appeared as if we were being made to wait just for the sake of it. After a while they seated us at a table that had been empty and ready all along since we first came in. The food is good, but they messed up my mother's order and the waitress avoided directly addressing her after my mom inquired about the order mistake and instead she would talk to the other parties in our table as if giving us the message to give to my mother who was right there and could hear everything. At the end of dinner we tried to do split checks and were told that they don't do split checks and only equal splits. When the waitress saw our face of confusion she said "OK, I'll do split checks"...so, which is it? I mean, yes, the food is good, but with the terrible service and with so many wonderful alternatives nearby and all over town, who'd want to come back? I won't.
