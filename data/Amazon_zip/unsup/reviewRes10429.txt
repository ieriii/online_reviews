This is such a unique, fun pizza place. I have only been here on Friday and Saturday nights. I have waited anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes for a table. I love the Worryin Ale & Golden Arm beers. My friends and I love to get the mixed green salad so we can be "healthy" before we load up on pizza. I usually get the white pizza with artichokes and basil. It is fabulous. I love artichokes on anything especially pizza. I think of Piece as a complete night out since there is usually a wait, and we have a few beers before our pizza. Then we have a few more with dinner. I have never had room for dessert, so sadly I can't comment on that. I do always think the desserts look amazing though!
