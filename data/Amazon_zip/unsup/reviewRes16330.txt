GOOD FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE! I went to dinner at Calo on December 13th. It was not extremely busy when I arrived with three other people in my party. After waiting an hour, the waitress finally took my order. We ordered a bottle of wine which came out relatively fast. After waiting another 20 minutes for appetizers to come out, the waitress had still not returned to refill water or wine (at most restaurants of this caliber, the waitress usually tops off the wine). The entrees finally came over an hour after we sat down. After finishing up dinner, we received the check and gave them the credit card. After they returned the receipt, the busboys started bussing the table BEFORE WE COULD LEAVE THE TABLE!!! I spoke to the manager later that night. He told me that he was going to send me a gift certificate to make up for the problems. After calling me twice to verify my address, he still never sent it. This place is a joke.
