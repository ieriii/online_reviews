I'm not one for regularly dining at buffets but when I do it just happens to be when the food is pretty good. No exception with India House especially when I'm still branching out and trying different things. I couldn't believe how packed this place gets during the week but I figured it out once I was done eating here. The food was great and the lunch buffet isn't a bad deal in these parts. I loved the samosas, vegetable rice, Chicken Tikka and even the lamb with mint. I'm just glad I paced myself enough to have gulab jamun and a bit of mango lassi too! I'm glad I finally got to try this place and I'm sure to come back but only in moderation!
