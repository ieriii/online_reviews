I've never been here for brunch, but I am looking forward to going at some point. Went here for dinner and it was DELICIOUS. I had the pot roast with a mixed greens salad to start. I ate all of it and wished the plate was never ending. I had a Bellini which was made with fresh crushed cranberries and it was fantastic. The atmosphere is really great, too. I love the live music area, it's so cozy and nice. I'm knocking it down a star because last time I was there, I was supposed to meet friends to see some live music. I got there and they would not sit my bf and I by our friends b/c the room was "full," so we ended up eating at the bar and having to wait until the music was over to go into the room. I thought that was pretty lame. The staff is kind of pretentious, but overall I love it here.
