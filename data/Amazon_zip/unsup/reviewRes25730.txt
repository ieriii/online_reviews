Geja's is not romantic they need to invest in a ventilation system so that you don't leave smelling of the oil...you'll need to wash everything you are wearing and take a shower before bed. The food is way over priced and nothing special. I used to love this place and it was about the experience not so much the food but the last time I went we had a horrible experience and ended up walking out because the manager was so rude to us. I'll NEVER go back!!!!
