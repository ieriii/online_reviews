07/25/2010: Hmmm. Reading my earlier review made me miss the Alliance of yore. The couple trips I've made over the past year have all been disappointing. The baked goods seem to have gone downhill, and I think the coffee is following suit. & the place has a weird, unpleasant odor more often than not... more befitting of a beer-soaked dive bar than a bakery. Not good. Sadly Alliance, I've lost that loving feeling. & now it's gone...gone...gone...woooooe ohhhh ohh. I LOVE Alliance! Bakeries, even good ones, can be so hit-or-miss, and while I have plenty of favorites (the red velvet cupcake, most of their cookies) I've yet to try anything that bombed/wasn't finished in 5 minutes. The window displays are so cool they'll make a happily single girl consider cake-induced lifetime commitment. The coffee drinks are tasty, & unlike the crowd (which can have a few too many too-cool-for-school hipsters) the staff is nice & helpful. Which is saying a lot since there's been more than one weekend where I've made a morning appearance hungover & still in my clothes from the night before. YES, even after a few too many tequila shots Alliance will get you out of bed. Which is more than I can say for my alarm clock.
