Welcome to the three ring meat circus and you have front row seats! A few tips: Brazzaz is always sending out buy one get one free coupons. Find these coupons in your junk mail and save them. Makes this place a much better deal. Ignore the salad/sides bar. Eating anything from there versus the meat is pure foolishness. It's OK for you to cry into your meat because of how uncomfortably full you are. Dear Brazzaz manager - playing Top 40 at an upscale Brazilian steakhouse is not classy. That is my only complaint. Capt. Meatranger out.
