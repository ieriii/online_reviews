We found this place almost by accident right after they'd opened, and we've been loyal customers ever since! They used to serve a bowl of boiled peanuts right when you sat down--totally weird, but not entirely unpleasant. This last time they gave us a tasty cornbread instead, which was a delightful change. We started with fried green tomatoes, which I thought were excellent, and I loved the flavor of the shrimp that accompanied them. I had the tea-infused pork chop, which was good, though a little saltier than I needed. But it went perfectly with the sweet potato hash and vegetables, so yum! I also tried their house ginger beer, which is outstanding with a lime wedge squeezed into it. No room for dessert that night, though in the past we've had a really good red velvet cake (I know, not very exotic, but so good!) We've also had brunch here once or twice, and it has been excellent! I will agree with other reviewers that the service is always a little hit or miss--really attentive but then you never get the check, or they take forever to take your order but your water has been refilled six times, that kind of thing. And they are getting a little bit pricey for my budget, but I do appreciate that everything is locally sourced and that the menu optimizes whatever is currently in season.
