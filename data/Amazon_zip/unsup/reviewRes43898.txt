Best Risotto! I know it's a steak house, but the Risotto that was paired with my steak was what sold me on this place. The steak was juicy and flavorful. Friends and I dined during their wine and food pairing event. Generous wine pouring which complemented each course.  A must try when in the neighborhood. Brown line (merchandise mart) stop is right across the street!
