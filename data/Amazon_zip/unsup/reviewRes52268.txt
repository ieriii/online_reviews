I've been hearing about legendary, deep dish Chicago pizza for a while and I finally decided to slay the beast as I visited Chicago for the first time. We ended up at Gino's off of Michigan Ave and I'm glad we did.The pizza was slamming, the service was great, the vibe was chill and relaxed, and the pizza was slamming..wait, I said that already. As a New Yorker, its hard to come by good pizza, but you'll definitely find some great pizza at Gino's. The pizza was definitely worth the 45 mins it takes to prepare..just do it! The pics and the grafitti on the wall were cool too..even saw a few people tagging up as we grubbed. "I'll be back."
