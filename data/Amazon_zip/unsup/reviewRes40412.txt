I've been here drunk - YUCK. I've been here sober - DOUBLE YUCK.  I haven't tried it both high and drunk. Maybe that's the secret to all these 5 star reviews.  These places (I'm referring to all three) are just disgusting. All three locations are filthy with bad service. They stuff tortillas with only dry meat and a ton of cilantro and onions. It is very reminicent of what I think Alpo would taste like without the sauce. I got a plate lunch once and it was basically a slab of underseasoned, stringy, overcooked Grade D meat oozing grease all over the plate.  Yuck again. I lost my appetite just writing this review.
