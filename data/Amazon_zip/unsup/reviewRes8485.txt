Spacca Napoli is one of those places that you will instantly like the moment you walk through their front door. You will be greeted by a friendly face and quickly seated. The food is absolutely amazing. I recommend trying the Caprese con Bufala, Funghi pizza, and if you leave room, finish things of with their Tiramisu. The food is reasonably priced, and the service is pretty quick. Also, there is plenty of street parking available.
