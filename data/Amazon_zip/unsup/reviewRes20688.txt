I've had better. Went on a tuesday night, place was packed at 7:15. We grabbed a seat at the sushi bar, as opposed to waiting an hour for a table. The rolls were nothing to write home about, though the apple halibut roll was pretty darn good...should have been for $15. Overall, good date place, bring a bottle of wine (or 2), but there are better sushi places out there.
