Simply It is one of those places I could go everyday, possibly for the rest of my life. And my life would be extended by the steady diet of healthy foods, and I wouldn't stress about the prices because they have deals galore (also good for the heart). Well, except for brown rice - it's extra (into each life a little rain must fall, I guess).  I've been there several times for lunch and I definitely recommend it. The service is attentive and quick, so they can gitt'er done with time to spare. You also won't have to go down to Cookie Bar for dessert, because they give you fruit to finish your meal! Again with the awesomeness!  Usually I get a vegetable and rice dish, but I did try a bite of a banh mi once. Usually banh mi is not my bag, but theirs is good. The one I tried was a lemongrass chicken, so allow me to pause here and suggest that lemongrass rise up and claim its place in chicken dishes everywhere. Such a good combination.  Simply It, you're simply quacktastic.
