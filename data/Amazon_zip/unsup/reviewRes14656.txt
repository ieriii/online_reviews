I like anything that could be an "oldie". I used a typewriter to compose my response to a friend's internet posting about the closing of the last typewriter factory. I am not joking. I never kid abut the classics. I'm like the more attractive, less awkward version of Seymour from Ghost World (I guess that makes me Enid?). Anyway a place like Sabatino's would most obviously fit the bill. Aside from the vintage factor though, wow.  First of all the menu is very, very extensive. Lots of veg. options and they are very sensitive to the gluten free customer. I'm usually pretty decisive, but this one threw me for a loop. I went with a grouper special that was the perfect choice. I'm dying to eat the rest of it, tonight because there definitely were leftovers. Did I mention it came with a side of pasta?  Everything also comes with soup AND salad, there's the bread, then there's the pizza bread... You will not go home hungry, unless your tapeworm is a champion professional eater. He could be, but I'm guessing no.  Service was speedy, the strolling musicians fun, and the cocktails decent. I gotta come back for lobster night.
