Tank Noodle is definitely one of my favorite places in Argyle to get some quality Pho. Don't let the hardcore Pho enthusiasts fool you, its not Americanized. If the servers are strolling around wearing camouflage tshirts with an 8 bit image of a Tank screenprinted on it, then you know they're not messing around! The Restaurant itself can get very packed, but i've never had to wait too long. Plenty of seating, and plenty of options to choose from as far as the menu goes. However, when it comes down to it I judge the quality of the Pho by three things. How fresh the condiments are (bean sprouts, mint leaves, etc), how fresh the beef is, and how the broth and noodle tastes. Ok thats four things, please sue me. Oh yeah, and how hot the broth is as well. Make that five. Ok so I judge Pho by five things...Whatever :0 All in all, I love this place. I always make special trips to come here when i'm just craving the good stuff.
