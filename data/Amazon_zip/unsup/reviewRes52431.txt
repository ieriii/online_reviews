I have been at this location many of times, but it does feel like every time I come here that service goes down. The last I was there I nearly waited 10min for another cut of meat after the first sausage that was placed on my plate. Normally you would get an endless line of Gauchos coming to your table but it feels like every time we've come especially the last 2 times the meat is on the verge of running out. They come out and its like the last of the meat, its cold. I could honestly say I may not be back here. And its not like its only 2 of us, every occasion Ive gone its been with friends and we've drop easily 4 or 5 stacks ( $500 ) so I would hope for better service. If management reads this; I would ask that you think back to your home ( Brasil ) and remember the dedication the Gauchos have for their food. Making the restaurant classy is great and we appreciate it, but when it comes down to it I want that feeling I had when I was in Brasil eating and I think Brazzaz's is loosing that feeling. If you return to your roots, in the end its not about the glasses or table cloth's its about the quality of steak and service. Muito obrigado.
