This is one of the best restaurants with chill decor in Chicago in my limited opinion. The high ceiling, the light fixtures, the music, the color. I love global chill ambience and I love this restaurant. We love the food, too, but I don't have detailed notes on that for this review. More on the next visit. It is great, too, that it is so close to the Loop. Being so close to the Loop is also a bad thing - parking nearby is troublesome and the neighborhood is quite run down. Summary: Carnivale is one of those places that makes Chicago feel like a world-class city. Go there before you die.
