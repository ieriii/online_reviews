Starts off bad, ends up fair. That is what I have experienced with life and dining in restaurants are no exception to this rule.The wait was long and we were offered a pager and free coffee at another establishment down the block. Huh? it is 20 degrees outside and I am leaving your restaurant to have coffee elsewhere?After being seated in the middle of the restaurant and effectively feeling the doors open and close like being seated at an outdoor cafe in February, we were promptly served coffee and water.The menu is vast. The service was pretty good, however, the food was fair. This place had so many great reviews that I had high expectations. The toast was burnt and coffee only filled once. If I could get past the baby (and I have kids so please) stuck coughing all over the diners, I would have not needed a fur coat to eat breakfast and some Purell from all the people on top of me.
