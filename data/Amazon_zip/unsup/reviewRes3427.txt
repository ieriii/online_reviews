My good friend recommended this place to me and I have been meaning to go for works. Today I finally got my chance - and I have to say it lived up to the hype. I'm not a fan of buffalo chicken wings so when I saw that they had wings on their menu it kind of grossed me out. Since I had time to kill waiting for friend to meet me I started being that creepy person who starts at other peoples food to figure out what they want to eat. The more I looked around the servings of wings the more delicious they looked. They have three preparations to choose from - no sauce, seoul sassy (soy sauce based) and a spicy BBQ sauce. We opted for the spicy BBQ and wow. They. Were. Fabulous. Nice crunch to the skin, the meat inside was juicy and delicious. The sauce was the perfect amount of spice where you taste the initial sweetness of the sauce and then it rounds out to a nice, but NOT overwhelming spicy end note. Again, as a non-wing eater I was really really impressed. To go with the wings we also went with the Baby Buddha Bowl. The vegetables were crisp and delicious. If you're a vegetarian or just looking for light, refreshing meal this bowl is perfect. Portion is perfect. I was extremely happy with Crisp. Only bad part is that it's right around for the corner from my apartment so I hope can control myself from going to get those wings once a week.
