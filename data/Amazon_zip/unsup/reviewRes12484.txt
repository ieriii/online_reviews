Even though we had to wait for two weeks to get a Saturday night reservation, it was well worth the wait! The place was hopping, food was amazing, and the service was prompt! We shared the Special Ceviche, Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops (with sweet potatoes which were to DIE for), along with the Pear Champagne Salad and Butternut Squash Soup.  All in all, that was enough food for two people and we left with happy bellies!
