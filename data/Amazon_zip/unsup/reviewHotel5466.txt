Love the location, love the rooms, and the penthouse suite is spectacular. The regular rooms are very comfortable. The decor is modern and hip. The staff is very discreet and accommodating. The prices are reasonable. I have had some good times here. Went to a wedding here once and the ballroom was awesome. Ceiling to floor glass one floor above Rush street. You can look right down and see everything and everyone on the busy Rush Street and they can look right back at you. Being right across from Tavern and Gibson's with the Whiskey Bar in the lobby (sort of) you don't have to go far for anything. Hot hotel, Hot location, Hot views, this is a great place to put friends, Family, or yourself!
