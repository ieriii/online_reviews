This place is amazing. I've been going here as often as I can, ever since it opened 1 block down the street from my work. The pizza is fresh, chewy, delightful. I've tried dozens of pies here and never been disappointed.  The Insalata Mista is HUGE and delightful - wonderful greens, delicious imported olives, and balsamic so tasty I wanted to drink it. The soups are good too, but also gigantic, and you need to save room for pizza. Wonderful place to go for lunch, or dress it up a bit for a classy date night. The one thing that would help out though is larger tables. The tables are rather small, and once you load it up with a couple pizzas (each one can be tackled by a single person, so we generally get a selection) it is VERY crowded up there. Finish up the meal with a luscious, generous slice of tiramisu and an espresso or cappuchino, and then moan because you have to go back to work instead of taking a nap!
