MOjitos =) MOJItos =) MOJITOS =)  Good and potent! I love them here- spring, summer, winter or fall- I can drink them anytime or all!  They are fantastic!! I have been a few times for dinner, but, the mojitos got to me. Some sort of sumptuous chicken comes to mind. Brunch here is worth the wait. They have great CRAB CAKES! I love their crab cakes benedict! Here, they have only slight breading- not easy to find in Chicago- and were absolutely huge! The mojitos always go great with them, and the coffee is nice and strong too! Helpful walking hint- If you are freezing- stop in here for drink and make sure to hit the ladies room. It is not fancy, however, it sits between the kitchen and the furnace room (I believe) and is about as warm as a steam sauna. Extremely toasty and comforting when you are trying to make your way down windy, busy Irving Park!
