The food at Hopleaf is simply outstanding. I had their brisket sandwich and my friend had braised rabbit (I think). I still want to go back for the brisket and to try other selections. I had a bite of the rabbit and it was fantastic. I did also try their steamed mussels, which were plentiful but only OK. And the downside this place is crowded and does not take reservations. So if you want dinner without a huge wait, I suggest you arrive early. Also I would have to agree with those who said their wait staff is a little slow. Not terrible...think Europe. YOU MUST HAVE AN ID AND BE DRINKING AGE. No exceptions made. We found this out the hard way when one of our friends left her ID at home. - Andrew
