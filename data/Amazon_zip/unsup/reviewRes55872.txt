If you wanna take a girl to a sweet romantic restaurant and not worry what she orders, take her to Calos. The food is good... the pastas rock... even the steaks... but the atmosphere looks like.... well... they designed it to look like it's an intimate five-star place. So the food is good, the ambiance is great, and you're going to get in and out and still have cash in your wallet.
