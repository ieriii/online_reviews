We just got back from here. The food is pretty good, nothing that overwhelmed me. The patio area was nice and sunny, there are shaded seats for those who want to get out of the sun. We started with the 3 empanada appetizer: ropa vieja, goat cheese and veggie. I liked that they weren't too doughy, just a thin crust. Yum!! I ordered the chicken dinner plate with lots of sauteed onions. The chicken was tender and not at all dried out. Again, nothing was overwhelming, but pretty good overall. As our meal arrived I overheard the waiter at the table next to us mention the specials. Why didn't our waiter tell us about the specials? I'm sure we will return. They have a front patio and a back patio, next time we'll sit in the back.
