Been eating here for a number of years. The quality of the food is excellent and has been very consistent over the years. Most of my experience has been with pretty standard kabab fare. As most of my orders are to-go, I have not yet tried the more exotic choices but would expect that they are similarly well prepared. You get a lot of food at noon o kabab! The kebabs are served on an enormous bed of rice and come with feta, onion, parsley, lemon and radish as a garnish. Oh, and sumac too. Things that would have made this a 5 star review: They could be a little more generous with the pita bread. Regardless of whether you get 1 or 2 kababs, you get one piece of pita bread. I find that the pita runs out pretty early in the second kabab leaving you breadless. Also, it can be a touch dry without some sort of sauce. We order the cucumber and yogurt salad and use it with the kababs with excellent results. This also solves the pita bread shortage as you get another piece of pita with the yogurt. But you do end up spending a bit more to get where you had hoped to be getting in the first place. Still - great place - 4 stars!
