My beloved Pequod's, how I miss thee. I still fantasize about your delicious, cheesy, caramelized crust and your crispy, spicy pepperonis. Oh, and your amazing, flavorful sauce. When my husband asks me what I want for dinner, I still answer Pequod's, even though that is a long lost dream.  I miss being able to order your deliciousness until the wee hours of the night when the craving would hit. I miss the excitement I would feel when the buzzer in my apartment would go off and how my husband and I would get the Pequod's shrieks when we knew you were coming up the steps. I miss how I would open the box and say every single time, "Ohhhhhh, this is a good one! Check out that caramelization!" I miss drafting pizza slices based on the amount of crust carmelization with my husband.  Pequod's, you have ruined all pizza for me. I can't eat other pizza without thinking of you. Nothing will ever come close to comparing with your greatness and nothing will ever replace you in my heart.  I can only hope that we will meet again soon.  Fondly yours, Kristy
