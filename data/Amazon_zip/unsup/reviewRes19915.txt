In a word, YUM. In many more words: pretty setting, friendly service, delicious food, and it's a BYOB baby! I live closer to South Coast, which I still adore, but I was looking to mix it up a little. Grabbed a bottle of bubbly and my friend and we high-tailed it on over for a 7:00 dinner. The hostess and server were very helpful and very kind. We were enjoying a beverage and some hamachi carpaccio (yellowtail in ponzu sauce--delish!) in the blink of an eye. It was crazy busy within moments of our arrival but service never faltered. The hamachi, goma-ae, gyoza, and maki were fresh and delicious. And I think we spent less than $50 for both of us. A bargain, indeed for such a lovely evening.
