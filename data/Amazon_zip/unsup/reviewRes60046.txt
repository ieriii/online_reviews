I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day, and we both loved it. They had a fixed price menu that night, or one could just order from the regular menu, which we did. The cheese and herb croquettes are to die for. An absolute must! I had the catfish pecan, which was excellent, although too many pecans for me. No worries, it was still delish! My girlfriend had the mushroom pasta dish and loved it, too. We were too full for dessert, but got a piece of the red velvet cake to go. As everyone seems to note here, it was wonderful. The service was excellent, even on this very busy night. The atmosphere is casually classy, although nothing really special.When it comes to Southern cooking, I'm more of a New Orleans guy. I didn't have anything here that could compete with the sort of food you can (or used to be able to) get just about anywhere in New Orleans. But that's a pretty tall order. Big Jones was a great experience and I'll certainly try them again. Yummy!
