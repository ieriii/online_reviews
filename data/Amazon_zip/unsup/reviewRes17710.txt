Priced for NY (martinis being $12 per pop) though worth the trip. Geared for parties in even numbers (so 2, 4 and perhaps 6) rather than the odd numbers. Went with in a group of 3 people, and it seems that there was a struggle to get seating while all the those coming in pairs or quads had no such difficulties. Wait was for 30 minutes on a Friday evening though that is not bad for a spot with vibes. House rules are a refreshing change (note: no cell phones ringing is a good thing!) and the ambiance surrounding a well crafted beverage is indeed conducive to conversation. Though seating is somewhat dense, the arrangement and positioning is done well enough to allow for intimacy and to ensure that one can hear others without much difficulty.  For those coming in for a quick drink to start the night, ask to be seated at the bar, and hopefully that would cut short on the wait.
