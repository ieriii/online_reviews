Things you need to know: 0. be prepared to wait a bit, but it's not because you're not pretty enough, or there aren't enough girls; they're just waiting for seats to open up. You are not being judged, just counted. 1. bring friends (or a date) -- there is assigned seating, and the layout means that this is not a place to meet new people at the bar or a neighbouring table. It is pretty much a restaurant. 2. don't bring too many friends. You will wait a long time for the five person table to open up. If you are a pair, you can get seated pretty quickly, as far as I could tell watching the bouncer filter people in. 3. don't be a fool -- you are here for some pretty intense cocktails. The atmosphere is nice, but that's not the point. The cocktails are well-made, with excellent ingredients, and they are surprising, new, and not Jolly-Rancher flavored X-tinis. I sat at the bar, so don't know about the whole needing to buy a pitcher thing at tables. 4. on a weekend night's "prime time", this place becomes so crowded that it is not worth it. Lines (now including annoying suburbanites) stretch well outside the door and the bouncers won't give you a good estimate of wait time. In my opinion, nothing is worth spending 45 minutes on a Saturday night waiting outside in the cold for -- not even here; go have fun.
