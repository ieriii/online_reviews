I was pretty wow-ed when i saw our pizza come to the table on a big old cookie tray. That was the most excellent sight. You can get a lot of different types of pizza here and not one of them is bad. I think I've had all of the by now... On the beer list, it's pretty awesome. They have some stuff I've never heard of, which made it an enjoyable experience that is certainly going to be repeated. I've also been in here for a birthday party before and the service was awesome.
