I come back here consistantly for so many reasons. 1. BYOB and FULL BAR, which is an excellent offering.2. No reservations, but you can enjoy a drink at Wang' while you wait.3. Sushi rolls are very flavorful, and are a good size/price: Godzilla, Red Dragon, Kani Chung are some of my favorites.4. Hot towel when you are seated adds some class to this sushi place.Overall, great sushi at a moderate price, BYOB, friendly staff...Only downsize, not good for groups over about 6 people.
