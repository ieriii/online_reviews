Last visit: 1/30/2010 # of total visits: 4 Excellent food, excellent service. I've been here several times, and it is one of the best, if not the best, churrascarias in Chicago. The salad bar has a decent variety of fresh or freshly made items. I did not visit the salad bar on this past visit but I had in the past, and everything that I had was tasty. All of their meats were delicious. There were mainly beef dishes served to us, but you can find lamb, pork, and chicken as well. They were all juicy and most of the time were fresh from the kitchen. I wish I could take home a few of their skewers loaded with whatever meat they happen to have on it at the time. The service was amazing. Once you flipped the card over from red to green (which signified that you were ready to start your animal extravaganza), a waiter would rush over and give you an empty plate and the servers would run over to try to fill that plate with as many different types and cuts of meat as possible. They treated us especially well on this last visit with a manager that was very eager to please (he remembered and honored our special requests all throughout dinner). I love this place. Would definitely go again. A couple of tips: if you go during off times, like for an early dinner or a late lunch, the restaurant is usually less crowded and you're more likely to get really great service (not that service isn't great when it's busy, but they are much more relaxed and fun when they do not have to take care of everything for everyone). The price is fairly steep, so if you're looking to save a little bit of money, you can try Fogo during lunchtime on a weekday. Make sure you make reservations, and if you do make reservations, make sure you get there a little early so they can start setting up your table.
