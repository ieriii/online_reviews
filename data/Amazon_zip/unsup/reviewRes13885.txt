We're latecomers to Glenn's Diner, but it fast became a favourite. Let me just say this: their clam chowder is like crack to me. It's so, so flavourful, slightly sweet, and the vegetables still have a little crunch. Plus they're not too stingy with the clams. Difference between a cup and a bowl is $1, and huge, so go with the bowl and share with a friend. Or, eat it all. Or, take it home. Just get it. The Husband is a big fan of the potato pancakes, and they're super tasty and quite unique. Someday I will figure out how to make them, too, but for now, there's Glenn's. We haven't really tried much off the board, but all of their fish/seafood selections sound amazing - they really do seem to specialize in seafaring creatures made delicious. Their simple scrambled egg, chive and parmesan breakfast is pretty good, and their Reuben sandwich quite excellent. Coffee here sucks - a little below diner coffee standard - but we don't come here for the coffee (Julius Meinl is just up the street!). Staff are friendly, and there's often a line so be prepared to wait. We're heading there for brunch on New Year's Day with some mates, so I'm hooking myself up intravenously for more clam chowder, and perhaps a few crab cakes and a bloody Mary...yum!
