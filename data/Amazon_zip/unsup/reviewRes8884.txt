The first time, a friend brought me here. The second time, I brought friends. Now those friends are already clamoring to go back. The atmosphere, food, and service are all top-notch. The extensive menu satisfies carnivores and vegetarians alike, and the fact that it's Persian means some nice changes from the typical Middle Eastern fare that's usually served up, although you will find the familiar hummus and baba ganouj (both delicious).The Adass Pollo was heaven, and you have to try the spicy mango gelato if it's available. The most difficult thing is choosing, but the appetizers make it easy for you to try a number of delicious flavors in addition to your main meal, and the entree portions are large enough for sharing. They have a dine-in special through Dec 31 where you can get a free appetizer or bottle of wine with your meal (check their website for the coupon).
