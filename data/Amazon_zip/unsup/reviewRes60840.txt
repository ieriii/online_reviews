went there for a quick bite on way out for the evening. Sat 3 of us in the pub at a table that was not steady. we ordered appetizers and burgers/tacos. The appetizer were fine (would be better if the table was steady) Then the sad part- burgers came without cheese and without bacon as ordered/promised. Had to send back. When the plates came back-the fries were cold. Asked for ketchup-- a normal request with burgers and fries. Took about 10 minutes- The burger and fries were gone by the time the ketchup arrived. Would not go back there- Should have planned better.
