Nutella crepe with caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream - wow, amazing, heaven on a plate. Do I really need to say more? Well, I will anyways. Our server was helpful and friendly, and gave us an only slightly odd look when we pulled out a half empty bottle of wine to drink with our crepe. She also didn't raise an eyebrow as we sat devouring the crepe, moaning "this is sooo good" and then practically licked the plate. I imagine this is a common occurance. Go, enjoy.
