How can a place with 300 reviews be nearly empty on a Saturday at 11am? Doesn't everyone in the city go out for brunch on the weekends, and isn't the competition for a table cutthroat? Hmm, perhaps it only seems that way. Well, I certainly enjoyed the peace and quiet and prime window-side table. A day after my breakfast at Southport Grocery blew my socks off, somehow Cafe 28 matched them with their honey jalapeno pork chop.  When they set down the plate, I could see that I was in for a treat. The pork chop was very large and cooked perfectly with a delicious glaze that noticeably lacked spice. Unfortunately, I did not notice any jalapeno tinge to the honey jalapeno pork chop. A little heat would have elevated the dish to perfection; as it was, a solid A. Alongside was a big pile of fluffy eggs soaking up the wonderful pork chop juice. Their breakfast potatoes were delicious too. I'm so glad to see a place actually DO something with potatoes--in this case, green pepper and some savory seasonings. And I even liked the wheat toast! All in all, a near-perfect breakfast.
