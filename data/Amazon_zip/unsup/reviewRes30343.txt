I have been here several times and have enjoyed myself each visit. The decor is amazing and it's definitely a place to be seen.  I have been for their Sunda Social, every weeknight they have specials on certain cocktails and half off apps. The drink we has was a strawberry something (it was over the summer and my brain is a little fuzzy) and it was fabulous. The apps were tasty as well. This is perfect for an after work wind down. However I made the mistake of coming here before a night out - by 11pm we were starving! Probably our own fault for not ordering enough food. Some of the food highlights from my several visits: -Beef Lollopops-amazing and this is coming from a girl that is not a huge beefeater -Rock Shrimp Tempura - excellent - the walnuts and aioli are a great addition -Baked Seafood Dynamite-it was good, but it tasted like a dynamite roll I've had elsewhere. -Firecracker roll - with a name like that I want some heat - it had spice but I could have used more (not sure if the other people would have though) - "Tail of 2 Tunas" - very good roll I've had other food items but I can't recall them right now. Overall a great spot, yep a little pricey but I think the food/drinks are well worth it and it's equivalent for the area. I will def be back - been wanting to try the brunch!
