Definitely make reservations about a week ahead of time so you don't have to eat at 5:30 pm or 10:30 pm. The food was great, we shared several plates and the beer was great, even if I couldn't pronounce several of them. We fortunately didn't have to sit in communal seating and had a barn-door shut booth which made it more intimate. Highly recommend those. It's a little loud in there and the waiters seem to talk in a very soft voice, but overall, it was a great experience and a great time. Definitely order beer, frites with fried egg and a dessert. Everything was really great.
