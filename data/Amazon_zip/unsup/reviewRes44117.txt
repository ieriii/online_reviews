I. LOVE. this BAKERY! their macaroons are delicious and so are their other baked goods. I got my roommate's birthday cake here (red velvet) and the girls behind the counter were nice enough to write "Happy Birthday" on the cake. The workers are friendly, the desserts are yummy, and their adjacent "lounge" area is great. It has a very cozy neighborhood feel to it. they also have dog treats and any local business that has a consideration for dogs is A-okay in my book :)
