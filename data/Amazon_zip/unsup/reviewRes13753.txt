Fun atmosphere, good food.  I can't put my finger on it, but something about this little restaurant just makes me happy every time I'm there. Maybe it's the music, maybe it's the wait staff, maybe it's the really good food? Either way, this is one of my favorites! (Especially mid-week when there's not a crowd.) If you're looking to eat something healthy/low-fat/vegetarian, they have a wonderful open-faced grilled veggie sandwhich that's very fresh, good and quite addicting!
