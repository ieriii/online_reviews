I tried Little Bucharest last weekend with two Romanians. We had a little bit of everything for the full Romanian gastronomical experience. I normally don't like eggplant, but the Salata de Vinete was excellent as was the Salata Taraneasca - fresh tomatoes, olives, onions, green and red peppers topped with feta cheese. We shared a plate of the "Mititei" Charbroiled Sausages with salad greens and polenta - also very good. I had a bowl of the "Ciorbe de Vacuta" - beef vegetable soup while my companions had the "Ciorbe de Burta" - tripe soup. I tried a bit of tripe soup, not wanting to miss out. The broth was flavorful and good. The tripe itself wasn't bad, but having not grown up eating organ meats the texture was a little odd. I would eat it again, though. For entrees we shared the "Sarmale" Stuffed Cabbages and Short Rib Goulash. Both were cooked perfectly and were generous portions. Don't miss out on the Romanian coffee and the "Clatite" Warm Crepes - a perfect end to a great meal. The service was excellent and I look forward to eating again at Little Bucharest next time I'm in the Chicago area.
