If you are looking for a special and memorable place to stay in the Windy City, I don't suggest the Intercontinental. If you are simply looking for a place to rest your head on a business trip, then I do suggest the Intercontinental. That pretty much says it all. There is nothing really wrong with the hotel, its just very corporate and very boring. Nothing amazing, high class, or extraordinary about it. The rooms were just fine, a tad small even for our upgraded room. The bathrooms were nice and big with a separate tub and shower. The service was great, everyone was very friendly. There was just nothing noteworthy or memorable. We got the room for 99 a night on Hot Wire and in retrospect, wish we would have booked something a little grander for our anniversary. There is always next time!
