Best breakfast/brunch place in the city! I love coming to Wishbone for two reasons: consistency and deliciousness. I've tried many dishes and have never been really disappointed. Their specials have always been tasty as well. My favorite must be crab benedict with cheese grits. Make sure you try the crunchy french toast, it's addictive!!!
