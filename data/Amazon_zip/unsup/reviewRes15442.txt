ATTENTION: If you want to impress your date then take her here gentlemen!! This place is nice! The ambience is romantic and classy without it being pretentious. Anyhoo, the food is delicious and reasonably priced, being that the portions are big. The stuffed gnocchi asiago is to die for! Oh and the drinks are well made! Yum.
