The food was great. But I had my purse stolen while sitting ar the bar eating. These strange really getto people were hovering behind us while we were eating and were trying to talk to us and distract us . Which of course worked and they got the bag. My problem with this is that these people even made it in the front door with out being questioned as to why they were there. The restaurant covered our bill but I felt so violated not to mention the loss of everything. Pay attention if your eating at the bar.Such a bummer
