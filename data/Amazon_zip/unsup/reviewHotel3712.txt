Gorgeous hotel. I work for a wedding planning company and have the same exact review as Neha K. We have worked a handful of weddings at ritzy hotels, and we had great expectations for the drake. However, all the vendors were given a room (the one room without any camera) that we were told would be safe. Towards the end of the night, an iphone goes missing as well as a good chunk of money. We find that our wallets had been opened and were on top of our bags. TALK about feeling violated. This has never ever happened to us before. Guests had no access to the room and we had seen a man in the drake uniform walk in and quickly walk out of the room. It was obviously one of the drake employees, I'm sure they are pretty aware of the fact that they had no cameras in that particular room. Also, the worst part is that when we complained all they did was "file a report" and when asked if this has ever happened before the security officer replied "not really"....what do you mean not really? How disgusting! To make things even worse, he removed himself from taking responsibility of the situation by saying they hire a lot of their staff to work larger events, just sort of freelanced..he made it seem like they hired people off the streets /// do they even do background checks on who they hire? Guests pay A LOT of money for these rooms and I wonder if anything has ever been stolen from the rooms. It is appalling that nothing was done, we weren't reimbursed. They didn't even take the initiative to look into the cameras in the hallway at least to see if anyone had walked in and out of the rooms. I have lost any and ALL respect for this hotel, and we will never recommend clients to this hotel ever again.
