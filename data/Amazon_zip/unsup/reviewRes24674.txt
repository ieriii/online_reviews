Some of the best sangria I have had in the US. Made me miss Spain. If you are a Foursquare person, when you check in, you can nab a sangria for 1.99. Totally worth it!! Wonderful tapas style menu,,,each taste I had with a large group was well presented and flavorful. It was easy for me to dine here with my gluten allergy, although it took a little navigation.  Usually, I am not a huge fan of hotel restaurants, but this place was absolutely fantastic. You should definitely dine here if you stay at the Blackstone, or stop by after a long walk through Millennium and Grant Park. It will be worth your time. Eat outside and enjoy the view!
