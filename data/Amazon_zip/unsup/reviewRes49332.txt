My favorite coffee shop in the city! I'm an actuary, so I'm always on the lookout for a quiet place with wi-fi and yummy coffee to study all day. Not only does Alliance have those necessities, but their onion bagels are to die for - and they don't skimp on the cream cheese either. The pastries are so gorgeous, I have to pinch myself to avoid saying "one of everything please!" and ruin my diet. I've tried a few and have zero complaints. Staff is courteous. They have Intelligentsia coffee (my favorite!), free wi fi, and a room filled with quiet people that help motivate me to study. #70 bus picks me up three blocks from my apartment and drops me off half a block from my study haven.
