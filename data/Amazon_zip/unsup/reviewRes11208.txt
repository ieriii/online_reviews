Really good pizza! We went for a graduation party so there was about 10 of us and they served us well. I would have been so irritated if I was waiting on us and our waitress was nothing but polite and courteous. Beer is delicious too. Parking is the mother of a dog, so take public transport if you can, or wait until valet is availabe after 5 PM.
