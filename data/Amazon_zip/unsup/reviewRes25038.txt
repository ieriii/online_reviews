Geja's is excessively over-rated. The place is dark beyond "ambiance", the fondue is so-so, the serving staff is allocated to too many tables, and there's no creativity in the menu. Truth be told, although it's perhaps a bit more "low brow", Melting Pot is much better across all aforementioned aspects.  And the cheese fondue is kinda gross. Too much peppercorn and cheap/bad wine. It's no wonder they don't serve it with a plain french bread -- rather have to mask it with pumpernickel and something onion-y. Also, ignore the "dressy" attire.  Most disappointing. I wouldn't go back there again. P.S. Best fondue in the area & worth the drive: The Bread Company down in Urbana, IL.
