After a dinner out, my family and I headed over to Publican to get a drink. This is not the place to grab a drink. Their bar area is more like a waiting area for your dinner table. No chairs (maybe a few at a counter) -- you stand at these taller tables.  Beer selection is great (though really expensive). Some beers on the menu were $50. We couldn't believe it! And it is incredibly LOUD. We were screaming to each other in here. The interior is cool, but really needs some sort of noise deafening equipment on the ceiling or something. What's the point of going out with friends/family if you can't hear anything they are saying.  Not sure I will come back for dinner. I wasn't sure that the atmosphere was something I'd be excited to come back for.
