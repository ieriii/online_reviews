Sad to say, I have never had the chance to try out this popular steak joint :( Yesterday, 2 colleagues decided that we should go over and grab some appetizers and the whole time I was thinking, "Im going for the steak" Our waiter was very nice in accomodating us and going over what was really good on the menu. I was already buzzed from a celebration @ Primebar so I wanted to continue drinking. I got the Peach Tea which is not as sweet as it sounds. It includes the following: Bulleit Kentucky Straight Bourbon, Monin Peach Puree, Freshly Brewed Iced Tea, Freshly Squeezed Lemon Juice, Mint Leaves I had two of them which thouroughly enhanced my buzz! My meal was immaculate as I decided to go with their $40.95 classic meal package which in my case included chicken torrilla soup, Ribeye steak, side of broccoli and chocolate sin cake for dessert. The Ribeye was delicious and huge! Seasoned to perfection and melted in my mouth on every bite. Definitely worth a return visit just for the meat! The soup was some of the best ever and I am usually not a fan of chicken tortilla soup. Great dining experience in a great restaurant...loved it!
