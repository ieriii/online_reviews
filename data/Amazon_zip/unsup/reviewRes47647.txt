Seriously gorgeous rooftop bar... at least in the 2 warm months of Summer in Chicago. And uber cozy and warm indoor bar with dimmed lighting and delicious cocktails I've been to Zed451 twice so far, once in the heart of the summer on the rooftop, and once in heart of the winter to cozy up by the firelight of the bar. With that being said, I've never had the food- only seen it, specifically the deluxe seafood platter served at the rooftop bar which is HUGE and looks like something King Henry would have for dinner. Yummo... if I had that kind of money to spend, that is. What I come here for are the drinks. I LOVE the sangria and mojito offerings. Sitting by the fireplace here and ordering up a few of those bad boys makes it easy to pretend it's always Summer in Chicago.
