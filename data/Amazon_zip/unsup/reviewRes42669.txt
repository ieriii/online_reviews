Apparently their delivery sucks, (per the rest of Yelp), so I did the novel thing and walked in myself. It was fantastic. By far my favorite pizza in Chicago (though I admittedly don't care for deep dish). Super fresh ingredients, imagine actually being able to recognize mozzarella cheese by the taste and not the menu label. The crust is solid for thin crust. I'd perhaps like it a bit more crispy, and can see how it'd get soggy in a delivery. But for eating in, it was perfectly fine relative to the amount of sauce on the pizza. I'd heard the pizza tended to be heavy on the cheese so I ordered one without an extra cheese ingredient (despite my absolute love for throwing goat cheese on everything). It was still pretty cheesy, but with quality cheese, I'm fine with that. Our pizza had sausage on it, which was also pretty tasty. The best part of the whole experience really was every ingredient having a fresh, solid taste, but not overpowering any of the others. I didn't find it to be that expensive for the quality either. I mean, sure, I can get Dominoes for cheaper, but a deep dish would run about the same and leave me half as happy. I think I'd actually be willing to pay more for it, it was that damn good. And it was less than $20 for two people with leftover pizza for lunch the next day. So maybe me and the SO don't eat as much as most people (doubtful), but I don't see what the price fuss is about. Mmmmm, BYOB. I think my only complaint is the seating area gets a rush of cold air every time the door opened (winter). But nothing like pizza to warm one up.
