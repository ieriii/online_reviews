My wife and I love this place, so much so that we eat here almost once a week. The food is consistently good, the ambiance comfortable, and the staff remarkably efficient. If meat is your thing, try the Tiger Cry or Opart Beef for starters. This stuff melts in your mouth! For an entree, my wife likes to get the Woon Sen Pad Thai, the noodles of which consist of bean curd rather than rice. I'm a big fan of the Pork Larb with a side of rice. Regardless of what we end up ordering, we share our food family style, which is the way to go when eating Thai. It's totally possible for a couple to split an appetizer and order two entrees for under $25 excluding tip. Oh, and it's BYOB. Taken altogether, this place is an excellent value. That's why we keep keep coming back for more!
