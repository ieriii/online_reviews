Let me start with this: If you are looking for an italian meal that is "cheap" or "great value," you have come to the wrong place. Get ready to drop around $100 for a fantastic meal for two with a bottle of wine. It's worth it. We came here on Friday. 8:00 reservation, seated around 8:15 (this place was crowded!). First, the bread basket: typically italian bread can be bland and flavorloess. Their bread had a little extra flavor and fluff to it, making the standard oil/parmesan/bread pre-appetizer situation extra delicious. We started with the grilled calamari appetizer, which was fantastic. Full calamari, grilled and half-sliced, served in something of an alternative balsamic reduction. Atypical but awesome. I would absolutely get this again. For the main course, I had a spaghetti with veal meatballs and mild italian sausage, served with a fantastic bolognese. A fairly simple dish; but they killed it. Just an awesome plate of food. My date's pesto gnocchi was even better. Big fluffy potato pillows of gnocchi were dressed in an absolutely divine pesto sauce. Sapori found the perfect balance between basil, oil, pine nuts, and parmesan cheese. This was one of the best pestos I have ever had. Anyway, there are a million delicious italian places on the north side of chicago. But this one is as good as any of them.
