Because this strip of Western is in need of fun places to go, I really wanted to like this place. It wasn't terrible at all; rather, terribly average. The portions of food were ridiculous, and had it been delicious, I would have probably ate myself sick. However, it was totally meh. I didn't even finish half my sandwich. I had the eggplant sandwich with fries. Fries were decent, but the sandwich was on the yuck side. Good ciabatta bread was ruined with the breading and sauce on the eggplant. It tasted like a soggy ragu carb concoction, the kind you would make at 3 in the morning because it's all you have in the fridge. Plain eggplant with maybe a light sauce or a slice of cheese would greatly improve this as the bread was good. My boyfriend got a burger. He said it was also average...maybe with a little tweaking it may be closer to another pretzel bun music place sans three hour wait times. We both had some of the mac, again, just ok. it could have used some seasoning. As for the whole rock club, live metal concert thing, I thought the colored lights and diamond plate on the bar was sooooo cheesy and terrible. However, my boyfriend likes metal, so he was fine with it. We'll call the decor a wash then, it depends on your personal preference. As for the loud music noted in other reviews, it was louder than most restaurants, but by no means so loud I felt like I had to leave. However, perhaps that's why we got average service. Though she was really nice (and cute for you boys), she wasn't the best waitress, perhaps she just couldn't hear us....
