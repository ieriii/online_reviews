Frontera lives up to its name! Before walking in, I was a little hesitant about the food and snobby atmosphere given the hype of the restaurant. However Frontera fared well on both fronts. It offers a relaxed, casual atmosphere in a fine dining setting. Seating - outdoor seating is little difficult to get during summer. Without reservation, be prepared to wait anywhere between 1 to 2hrs on a weekend. Food - Food was perfection in every aspect... texture, taste, temperature, presentation. Rick Bayless changes his menu every month so its always good to ask the server about their recommendations and specials. Portions are not huge but they are filling. Don't skip on the appetizers and dessert! Service - Server was very helpful and well-informed. I had ordered an off-the-menu seasonal special and my server went on great detail to describe the dish and its relevance with the season. As expected, its a bit pricey but not overpriced. Definitely worth a second visit.
