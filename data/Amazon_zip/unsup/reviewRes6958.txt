Well, at the end of the day it's all about the food, isn't it? This is such a good looking restaurant; it's a whole townhouse done out in pretty whites with great use of original features. It's a lovely space and attractive bar. Super friendly staff. However the bbq... Kobe Brisket was simply chewy. I would prefer it if it had been slow cooked in a sauce, like a traditional brisket, for hours so it was fork tender. Instead it was dry and chewy. The sauces are served on the side and are OK. Spicy was nice, Carolina OK, one was gravy-like and there wasn't enough to make a difference. The St Louis Ribs were not very flavourful. Again chewy. Now compare with an ugly place like Carsons where the bbq is great. I would much rather go there. Coleslaw was OK, beans were good. Wine was well chosen and priced. I just have a feeling that the bbq isn't good enough and this space will morph into maybe a 'New American restaurant,' which would be just fine as I would like the excuse to go back to the building, but this isn't it. 2 stars reflect the food, nothing else.
