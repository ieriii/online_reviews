Had my first experience at Superdawg as a result of commuting to the suburbs for a month long project and I was really impressed. First off I have never been to a drive in before so I had no clue how the whole process worked so that was as intimidating as something like that could be.... I ordered a Superdawg and a strawberry malt (my first "Malt" as well). And in about 5-10 minutes the food came out via a person who carried a tray out to my car and hung it on my window. The Superdawg comes in a box with fries and I had to basically eat all the fries to get to the dog at long last all while trying to to spill any Superdawg on my business attire. Both the fries and the dog were great! Their dog is slightly larger than a standard Chicago style dog and they use their own hot dog blend so tastes different too (but still great). The strawberry malt was amazing! Despite the difficulties of eating off a tray from your car window this place was pretty awesome and I'll stop by again when around the NW neighborhoods of Chicago.
