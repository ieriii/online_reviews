Sultan's advertisements don't lie when they proclaim that they have "the best falafel in Chicago". It was one of the first places I tried when I moved to Wicker Park and in the first visit I was hooked. The food is outstanding and the prices are amazing. I recommend the spicy falafel sandwich. The falafel is fresh, green, and super delicious- in combination with creamy hummus and refreshing jerusalem it is a combination made in heaven. If you feel like something lighter, I recommend getting an order of rice with tabouli and a cup of lentil soup. I prefer to mix them together, but they are also just as delectable as separates. My housemate and I would go at least once a week. I liked it so much I also brought some falafel to my office in the burbs and subsequently was forced to make weekly runs for my coworkers. You'll be hooked.
