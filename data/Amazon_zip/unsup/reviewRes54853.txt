Love it! The beer selection is fabulous, as are the mussels and frites! The garlic aioli is amazing as well..... along with almost everything else I have tried.... I wish we lived closer (although then I might be overweight and have drinking problem)... My only criticism would be their popularity.... (and the wait and noise that often goes along with that)....
