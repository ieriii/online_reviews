You gotta get in here and try the burgers!!! Meat eaters, turkey eaters, or your kinder vegans all have something to holla about after consuming any of Lockdown's unique and well prepared specialty burgers. If not eating, just come for the chilled out sidewalk scene or the comfortable back patio under an umbrella. Check the daily specials, and you'll be able to walk away fully satisfied without typical custom burger joint damage. The full bar is amazing, and multiple flat screens in the bar area make watching your favorite concert or sports event or whatever a fully enjoyable experience.
