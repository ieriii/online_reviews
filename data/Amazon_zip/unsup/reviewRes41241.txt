First of all, I love Ruth Chris Steak House! I have been to many different Ruth Chris locations all over the country and the quality of food, service, and atmosphere is always consistently superior to all the other high end establishments some would consider competition. This time was different, I was with a girlfriend of mine and we just wanted to grab a drink/appetizer at the bar real quick...nothing special. Well, Joe was our bartender and he turned a drink and a bite to eat into one of the best restaurant experiences in my life! We stayed for hours! Joe (I think his last name was Fours) was professional, courteous, funny, and overall just really good at his job! It was delightful to see a guy like Joe really enjoy his work, and we could tell he wanted to be there entertaining us! My Dad always told me 'If you enjoy what you do...you will never work another day in your life' Joe is one of the lucky ones out there that will never work another day in his life! I wish we all could be so lucky...
