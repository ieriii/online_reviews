I came here for brunch with a girlfriend... the atmosphere was definitely lively, they actually had a guitar player while we were there. There were a lot of families, so a couple toddlers hurled toys our way, but otherwise the ambiance was nice. My brunch was pretty ordinary. I had a spinach and mushroom fritatta, which wasn't amazing (but totally good still), but it did give me good feelings about coming here for dinner some time.
