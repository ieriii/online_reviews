Hopleaf ranks #2 in my list of Bars to go to. Given that my list of bars I have been to would number @least 50, thats saying something! I have traveled 10 miles from work, jus to satisfy my craving for the Ham sandwich on their tiny menu. Oh oh, the fries with garlic mayo is nothing short of genius!!! I don't even have to say a word about their 250+ beer selection - but drink my favorite when you go there - Delirium Tremens (think pink elephant)
