I love Sushi X. I don't know what I would do without this place because I love it so much. I have been addicted to Dragon Roll after trying it for the first time there. They have very friendly staffs and nice atmosphere and music. I wish the space is little larger but food makes up for it. I strongly recommend this place to any sushi lovers.
