I'm not a local, so I don't use the market as attractively upscale as it is. I just go to the cafe on the side of the building past the refrigerated section. It's a nice, bustling spot where you order up cafeteria-style. If you're looking to hang for a bit away from the winter cold, especially if you are attempting the arduous trek to Navy Pier, this provides shelter as well as any place else around the neighborhood. I had the $10 Grilled Black Angus Steak Burger, which they cooked up medium-rare on a brioche bun. It thankfully came with fries, but they do nickel-and-dime you with the toppings as they add a dollar if you want cheese or bacon or grilled mushrooms. Oh what the hell, there is a warm, casual vibe here, and it's worth a few extra shekels to keep your body temperature up for a while. Besides, I think I need to try the Truffled Eggs Benedict or the Pecan French Toast the next time I'm in the area. FOOD - 4 stars...good comfort food on a wintry day AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...warm, casual considering the foot traffic going through the market SERVICE - 4 stars...fast and responsive TOTAL - 4 stars...a nice alternative to the mall food on Michigan
