Glenn's has some of the best seafood in town. You'd never know by looking at it, but they do. The seafood specials are always on the chalkboards, and you can't go wrong with any of them. I've never had something I didn't like here - and I'm an east coast transplant who usually bemoans living in a state with no ocean nearby, and hence no good fish. The owner always greets us with a smile, which is something I appreciate.  The breakfast specials here are pretty good as well. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is that I think the breakfast is just a bit overpriced for the neighborhood. Other than that, this place is great.
