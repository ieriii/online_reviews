While visiting in Chicago last weekend we came across Big Jones in Andersonville. I had heard they had really good breakfasts. They did!! I LOVED the bloody marys, so spicy with horseradish and a slice of pickle. I wish could remember the exact names of each dish, but I can't. I ordered an eggs benedict with blue crab, delightful! My husband had the usual eggs benedict. He enjoyed his dish also. My son ordered corn cakes which I tasted, very good. He is a bit of a picky eater and he enjoyed it also. He especially enjoyed the cheesy grits. It was very busy and a bit noisy, but we didn't wait for a table. The servers were also very pleasant. I will be back when on our next visit!!!
