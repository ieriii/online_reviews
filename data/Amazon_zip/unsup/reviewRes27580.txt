This was by far my most disappointing dining experience ever. I would give it another star for the excellent service, but a $600 bill without a single memorable wine or dish is just ridiculous. We made reservations here for our anniversary and had the "collection" tasting menu with the wine pairings. I saved the menu and I can honestly say that is the only way I could remember what we had - not a single dish on the menu was memorable. I did order a foie gras lollipop with the pop rocks and although not great, it was memorable. French Laundry prices without French Laundry food. Save your money - there are many other restaurants here that have so much better food for so much less.
