I wish I lived closer to this place as I would probably eat here almost everyday of the week at least once a day. The soup base is delicious and aromatic and the portions are monstrous. The garnishes always make me sweat like a hog as I usually feel like one after a bowl of simple beef pho is finished. I love it because every time I go, its never crowded and the beef pho is at my table before I take my jacket off. The beef is thin and tender, noodles are tender and all of the junk I add to it just makes it that much better.  My only one complaint is the credit card machine that looks like a calculator from 1943 and how you're kind of called out to tip on the credit card even if you leave cash on the table. Anybody else feel this way?
