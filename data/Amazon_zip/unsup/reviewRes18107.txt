WHERE'S THE BEEF? And the sausage for that matter? Went to Caro Mio with very high expectations, but left a little underwhelmed. The meal started well with an excellent bruschetta topped with a generous slice of fresh mozzarella. From there, however, things started to go down hill. Our next dish was a pumpkin risotto with chicken which tasted more like mac n' cheese than risotto. Any pumpkin flavor was eclipsed by the cheese and the dish was very 'one note'. Another miss was the Italian giambotta. This dish was supposed to consist of meatballs and sausage cooked with peppers, onions, and potatoes in a marinara sauce. What we got was a giant plate of potatoes, onions, 1 tiny sausage, and 2 meatballs. After we ordered a side of meatballs, which they comped, they admitted that they had just run out of sausage. All in all it was a sub-par meal and I left without an understanding what so many people love about this place aside from the fact it's BYOB.
