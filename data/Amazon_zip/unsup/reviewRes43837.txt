A very average experience overall. To start off on a good note, the wine list is fairly extensive and pretty informative as to what flavors and tones to expect. We started off with the herb-baked goat cheese salad. Pretty average in terms of taste and texture. I could probably find a similar salad at a Panera. The sides weren't anything special either. The creamed spinach was a little different in that I'm used to the spinach being more diced up and incorporated into the sauce. Instead, the spinach was whole leaf in the parmesan sauce. The hash browned potatoes weren't too bad, but I'm surprised they didn't have any kind of mashed potatoes on the menu. But at a steakhouse, the sides and salads should take a backseat to the main attraction: the steak. My friend and I shared the 48 oz porterhouse. I was very underwhelmed with the flavor and texture. The outside was a little too charred for my liking. If there was some kind of rub on the outside, I wouldn't mind the extra flavor, but it was pretty plain. And it wasn't too juicy at all. I had to rely on the "au jus" sauce to provide the extra juice and flavor. Overall, again a pretty average experience. The service also wasn't anything to write home about. There are so many other steakhouses in Chicago, that I would try those first before coming back here.
