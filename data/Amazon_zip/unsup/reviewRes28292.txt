I'm a fan of Pequod's -- this location as well as the one in Morton Grove -- but last time I ate pizza from here I was a teeny bit disappointed. The carmelized crust can be amazing but sometimes (depending on how it's prepared? it just tastes burnt. I like their deep dish and thin crust and I've had it a few times where it's been truly amazing. Last time, though, the cheese pizza I had totally tasted like cardboard. So, I still recommend it but I'm a little less excited about it than I used to be.
