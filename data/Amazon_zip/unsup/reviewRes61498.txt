I came for dinner on a Monday night, and it was excellent. Free soup, chips, pickled vegetables, delicious chicken taquito-ish thing to start. The shredded beef (just referred to as "shredded" on the menu) hurache was excellent (and enough for a whole meal at only $4.00): moist and tasty. Topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, with refried beans at the base. While I had a huarache, the tortas, sopes, gorditas, tostadas, etc, all have the same choice of meats and toppings. I deduct a star for the lack of variety, but they do have a separate entrees section of the menu (and an extensive vegetarian selection) to mix things up a bit. They have Mexican Coke by the bottle. Street parking was really easy, and free.
