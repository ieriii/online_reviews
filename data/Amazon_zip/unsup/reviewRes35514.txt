Overall Service: Meh. We had a reservation and were seated 25 minutes afterward. So, strike one, although not a huge deal. Once we were seated, we found the tables to be fairly cramped (the waiter serving the table next to us was bumping my husband with his but when we would lean over), and it took quite a bit of time to get water and a server to take our drink order.  Watier: Once our server did come, he was very attentive. The other folks who would come to the table with soup, etc. were sloppy. One of them sloshed soup - not a ton but for what we paid for the meal, a "sorry" or "oops" would have been nice. I won't be going back. Over-rated, over-priced. Better seafood & service @ Joes.
