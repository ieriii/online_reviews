Heard a lot about the place. Checked all the usual sites for reviews. Almost decided not to go after coming across some not so complimentary reviews, until the Groupon deal came along. Went to a Saturday Underground Tasting Dinner with an open mind and a critical palate.  The place was tiny. Noise level was amplified with sounds bouncing around all the hard surfaces. The music was a bit loud and didn't create the ambiance to go with the food and service. The space was uncomfortable. Almost every table felt like it was too close to the front door.  We were served six different courses. A lot of food/flavor acrobatics going on and the overall concept got muddled along the way. Quite a few dishes were over seasoned. None were memorable. Overall, the chefs used every opportunity to show off but came across as culinary amateurs.
