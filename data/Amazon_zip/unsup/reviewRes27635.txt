maybe a 3.5 star rating after reading the reviews and getting recommendations from locals, we decided to give Graham Elliot a try. we opted for the middle tasting menu "Collection" (10 courses, no wine pairing). for $125, i felt it was an affordable way to enjoy a nice meal with a lot of variety. the meal included courses with lobster, wagyu, crab, scallop, etc. but my favorite was their interpretation on a Caesar salad. they take the deconstructed approach and i felt it was really well thought out. overall, i don't think the meal as a whole didn't really live up to my expectations.
