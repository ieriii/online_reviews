Delicious as always! My sister and brother-in-law were in town, and I love exposing my family to food they've never had before, so Ethiopian always comes to mind. I have a big heart for Demera, so we stopped in. It was really quiet, but it was a Monday, so that's not that weird. We were seated right away, which was great since I've come on Fridays before and there were *no* tables. Our waitress was nice and took our order quickly--we decided to leave everything up to fate this time and ordered the Sambussa sampler and the Family Style (chef's choice) dinner. The Sambussas were fantastic! These little guys are just so freaking great! When the food came out, we had more than we could imagine--we had about 8 dishes spread out in front of us, a whole bunch of injira, and it was time to go to town. The waitress gave us a quick overview of what everything was, but it was really easy to forget--though ultimately it was all wonderful. I especially loved the beef and the carrot dishes. I'm not the biggest lentil fan, so these weren't my favorite, but it was all delicious. We ate way too much! I felt so stuffed! It was really a wonderful meal. We also had some honey wine and a few beers with dinner--honey wine is such an odd beverage--on one hand it is amazing, but at the same time it is just so strange tasting. I had told my family to try it out, and they hated it, but I helped them drink it. It's definitely worth trying, but not something everyone will love, I guess. As always, a good experience, and I will be back the next time I want to stuff my face full of delicious, delicious food.
