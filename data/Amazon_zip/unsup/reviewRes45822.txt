This place is like Cheesecake Factory on steroids! I think they were owned/started by the same people. It has become an iconic place to send out-of-towners to for any meal. It is sure to dazzle and mesmerize anyone who is not used to restaurants being that big, and laid out like a mall (multiple floors, elevators, separate dining areas and many spacious hallways). All that aside, you have a plethora of options to choose from, because although it is American cuisine, to Americans that means anything so it can be hard to choose your meal. I personally get tempted by the elaborate dessert case you pass before being seated, and some desserts require a full 30 minuets to prepare, so be prepared to know if you want to please your sweet tooth. The portions are pretty gargantuan, but the aim is to impress. If you are on a diet, BEWARE! This place is full of things that make you want to cheat, but if you do so, cheat wisely. Skip the sugary drink and get a dessert. Also, for the college student splurging, the meals are usually big enough to eat half and take the other half home for a second meal so you feel like you're budgeting after all. Valet parking available, and street parking, but its downtown Chicago so...Enjoy! Grade: A
