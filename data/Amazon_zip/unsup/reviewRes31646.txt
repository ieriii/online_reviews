Oh my Chicago Diner how I miss you! I especially miss the Country Fried "steak" (a staple for me and one of my best friends), and I miss the yummy shakes and smoothies! So vegan yummy. I wish the restaurant could expand! I do also like that you can buy several of their products from the Whole Foods nearby. If you see a line out the door, just stay put and think of the animals that you're saving. Your taste buds are about to have the ride of their life!
