Imagine Harold's Chicken. Now. Imagine Harold's Chicken times Infinity. Imagine Harold's Chicken if the chickens were super plump and fresh and cooked in clean oil. And all due respect to the mild sauce I was born & raised on, but imagine Harold's Chicken if someone's Korean mom was in the back concocting sweet and savory sauces to accompany the chicken. Welcome to Crisp! This is yardbird like you've never had before, friends. I'm a wing girl and I could barely finish the five enormous wings I got -- the "Seoul Sassy" and the "Crisp BBQ". Both are spectacularly good. My mother used to suck chicken bones until they turned white when they were really good and I was SO tempted start sucking chicken bones at Crisp--they were THAT good! Seating is like at Urbanbelly--first come-first serve and cafeteria-style. Make friends with your neighbors and keep the napkins and water going around the table. Crisp is also BYOB, a nice little bonus. I've yet to try the bowls, the Korean burritos or the sandwiches but I hear they're good. The chicken, however, is the clear star of this show. I'm glad I live too far away for them to deliver -- this is a delectable, once-in-a-while treat. Not sure my arteries or my arse could handle much more!
