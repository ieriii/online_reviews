I took my best friend here for her bachelorette party. OMG we had so much fun. The atmosphere was so bright, colorful, and alive! The service was attentive and polite, the drinks were strong and tasty (mmmm...mojitos...), and the food was suburb. Oh, and the desserts were to die for. I'd go into to greater detail but why? This place already has over 500 reviews. Just go and have FUN!
