Really 4.5 (psst yelp!, maybe it's time to change the rating system to be out of 10 stars, since it seems like every review starts out like that... just a thought). I went here with a partner at my firm to celebrate my new job. I ordered the special- three medallions of filet and two tempura jumbo shrimp, served with wilted garlic spinach and chipotle and chorizo mashed potatoes. Steak was medium rare and cooked perfectly. The shrimp was a nice touch. The mashed potatoes were amazing. Spinach was ok, if a little salty. We were seated right at 12:15, which was when our reservations were. The server was attentive but not officious. Overall one of the better steak experiences I've had in a town full of great steakhouses.
