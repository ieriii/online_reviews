When I was getting into the pizza-fetish business, this was the first restaurant I tried after being recommended from a friend. And their pizza is great. Their thin crust tastes pretty good. I had the Funghi pizza (fresh mozzarella and sauted mushrooms of course). I'd say Calos is one of the best places to grab a pizza in A-ville.
