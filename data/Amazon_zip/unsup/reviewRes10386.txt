everything was just -ok- easy to grab a stool at the bar...seated promptly (on a tues nite)...somewhat friendly employees...quick service...not a fan of the tables bein super crowded together tried swingin single and was disappointed...very little flavor; bell something or other was alright guac is tasty...pizza was just -ok- :( tried 2 pies...both red (decent marinara) one w meat and one veggie and for the price of toppings i would have expected a bit more...crust was soggy towards the middle and the second u went to grab a slice everything fell off the pizza...not cool friends tried the cheesecake...again it must not have been that great cause out of the 5ppl noshin on it...there was still a good chunk left over id stop in again but im way over the hype
