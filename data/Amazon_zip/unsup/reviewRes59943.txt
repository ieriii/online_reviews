I was promised that the coffee would be the best I ever had. I'm pretty sure that's true. It's real good. Taste like an angel spit in it, which is a good thing, as I see it. That tuna sandwich on the croissant is real damn good, too... like them walnuts in there. That croissant will make a mess, though. Don't be eatin' it over your mama's good couch.I really like that red pepper hummus, too. Put that shit on a bagel, you gonna have a real good time in your own mouth!I ain't too big on no sweet things as my teeth is all janky and the sugar hurt me a good one. I do like them ladies behind the counter. They real nice, 'specially that one with the glasses and the square jaw that always be reading the New York Times. I don't like New York, but I do like that bataristo. I bet she do real good outside that counter... what with the boogie and the stroll. Her hair smell good, too. I snuck me a sniff.They'll make you some "kill whitey" cookies, too... I know, I seen 'em for my son, Taco's, birthday at Double Door. This review is true.
