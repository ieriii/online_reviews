Funky and fun, this restaurant is delightful. We ordered drinks (hubs had the Bolero and I had the Merengue. Loved both. Didn't care for the sangria (sorry, too sweet). Ambiance is great; felt Mediterranean with funk (browns, oranges, reds, deep purples and loud music (which got old and loud after it became quite crowded). We ordered the Chef's tasting. Our server, right off the bat asked for food allergies or preferences. Hubs is wheat/gluten intolerant (not celiac) so the server garnered points from us right there. Our meal had zero gluten options and if so, it was on the side. Plus the Hawks were playing at 7, so he honored our time constraints for that as well. *they lost* Each course was better than the last. Most memorable were the shrimp and the giant prawns. The beef was tasty but a bit too rare. The sliced cured meat portion for the appetizer was large, possibly 12 slices, and melt in mouth yummy and the cheese w the caramel sauce was splendid. We'd go back if for a few of this, that and the other and for the fig gelato. It'd be fun with another couple.
