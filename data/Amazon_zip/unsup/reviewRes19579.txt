We flew here from Toronto to visit a buddy who lives in Chicago and he suggested this place for dinner. We wanted to kill two birds with one stone by driving into the city and finding a quick place for dinner. Luckily there wasn't a line up. However, the moment we sat down with our food and drinks a long line started to form. People didn't complain about the wait which goes to show its worth waiting for OR Chicago peeps are chill and patient. Our food was cooked to perfection. Don't leave without ordering the churros.
