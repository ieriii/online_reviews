After years and years of hearing how amazing Le Colonial is, I just wasn't that impressed. We loved the mango martinis and the Chilean sea bass, but everything else was just kind of okay. We couldn't quite figure out what to order since the menu looked kind of like a cheap Chinese restaurant, so we ordered by number, which didn't turn out so well. The service was pretty regular, not what I would expect from a restaurant of that caliber in this neighborhood, and the atmosphere didn't quite do the trick. I'll probably give it another try and aim for a few more things on the menu (with perhaps more careful ordering), but for now...not impressed.
