Visited Doug today. It's been over 3-4 years since the last time I had a hot dog from here. Due to all the yelp craziness over this place, I decided to give it a go since I couldn't remember what I thought of it the first time. We made sure we got there when they opened so we could avoid the crowds. It took about 15 minutes :) We tried the regular brat, foie gras duck sausage and the selma hayk which is the andouille sausage with fries. I was so excited to try the foie gras duck and sadly i was very disappointed. First i couldnt believe I was dropping $9 for a "hot dog". Second, it didnt even taste that great. If I had to wait over 15 minutes and since the food wasn't that great, I would have been pretty upset. I honestly do not think this was worth all the calories... sorry hot dougs.
