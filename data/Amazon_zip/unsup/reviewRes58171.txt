Place is pretty good so far... but it should rock a little harder for it's opening week. Possibly just opening week jitters.Love the way it looks.. large windows.. really high ceilings.. almost too high. If this place wasn't as busy as it was, I would have felt like I was dining at the McCormick. food is decent.. nothing really to speak out of. Oh- The diver scallops were great.The downside: everything is so overpriced. That's what is to be expected on Michigan Ave. I guess.It is a nice place to be taken.
