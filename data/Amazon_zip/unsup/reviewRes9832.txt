Nice place. It's pricey for vietnamese food, but for the area I would say prices are fair. The pho was tasty. Keep in mind portion size is also smaller here. I don't remember the names of all the dishes we had, but all of them were good. I liked the chocolate mousse cake and the mango ice cream really tasted like mangoes!
