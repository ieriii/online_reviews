Let me just say that I've typically not been a fan of Korean food. The few times I had tried it before San Soo Gab San, I hated it. The only reason I even stepped foot in this place was because a close friend was having her birthday dinner there. Thank you, San Soo Gab San, for teaching me that Korean food doesn't all taste like rotten spicy butt. The service leaves something to be desired, but the food you get is totally worth it. My favorite part is probably walking out smelling like delicious grilled meat with a full belly of lean meat & veggies.
