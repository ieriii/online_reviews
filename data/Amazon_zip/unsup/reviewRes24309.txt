Came back here on a Friday night third wheeling with one of my friends and his gf and glad I did. Usually don't try many restaurants twice but I'll be frequenting Mercat going forward for sure. Literally every course was insanely good. What we ate: the halibut, diver scallops, patatas bravas (the best), catalan sausage, rabbit agnolotti, bacon wrapped dates, ham and chorizo croquettes, Cadi urgelia, MIXTO, COSTILLAS DE TERNERA and Cepes y butifarra flatbreads that were both amazing and the milk chocolate croquettes and chocolate bon bons to round us out. Such a ridiculous meal. The service is always really good, servers a lot of fun and the atmosphere lively. My friends were already regulars but this meal pretty much convinced me to do the same. New regular date spot for sure. I suggest you try for yourself.
