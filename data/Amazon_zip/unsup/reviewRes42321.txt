Service was okay, noise level very high, but none of that matters because the food was unbelievable! We were a group of 7 people so I got to taste a lot of dishes. Every single person in our party was like "you've got to taste this." The pasta was the standout for me. Homemade with a wonderful, toothy texture and the truffle sauce was rich, creamy and earthy. Marrow bones are a real indulgence for me and these did not disappoint. Salty, oily, as my friend said "delicious beef butter." Paired with thick, crispy bread and a sweet and vinegary onion compote that cut the grease, they were worth every calorie. Other standouts include the pork belly, which was melt in your mouth tender in a yummy, syrupy glaze and the meatballs, which were topped with lemony breadcrumbs that complemented their texture perfectly. It's a meal I'm still talking about a week later.
