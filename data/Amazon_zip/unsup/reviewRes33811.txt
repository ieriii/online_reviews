Great pancakes, french toast, and fresh squeezed juices. Was my first time and everything I ordered was piping hot and pretty good. The wait staff was right on the mark also, but I was by myself... so could be different.  On the other hand, its a very large space which holds a lot of people, so the place is very loud. The wait to get a seat was outrageous, I was solo and it took 40 minutes just to cop a seat at the counter - this is why I'm giving Yolk 3 stars (3.5, if possible) I would have left, but I had already paid for parking, so I was gonna wait it out.  Has the vibe of a tourist hang out or something founded on idol worship... hmmm. Since the food was pretty good, I'll definitely head to the other location to sample their omelets. One thing that did bother me: I was sitting at the counter, so I could see the cooks pretty clearly. It must have been pretty hot back there as one guy was sweating and he had a towel to wipe the sweat... my question: where did the sweat he didn't manage to wipe go??? ewwww don't even wanna no.
