Went for dinner and really enjoyed the overall experience; good food, service and live music. They start you off with some complimentary cornbread muffins and sweet rolls, but after that our party of 4 (plus toddler) got crazy with ordering. For appetizers we started with the hushpuppies, which were so tasty and crispy we ordered them twice. The crabcakes looked good and were packed with crab, but tasted so terribly fishy I couldn't stand them. The overall dinner menu seemed pretty blah to me. The place was described as southern comfort food, yet I was greatly disappointed that there was not a bit of fried chicken in sight. I don't usually want sandwiches or salads at dinner, but their main dish selection didn't thrill me at all. Predominantly seafood, and mostly in cake form--no thanks. My boyfriend and I settled on the multi-course Valentine Weekend special--$18.95 per person for an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert and champagne cocktail. Everything we picked was delicious. His blackened mahi mahi was so juicy, tender and lacked any fishy taste whatsoever; I asked for multiple bites despite my usual avoidance of fish. My stuffed poblano was OK, but probably would have been better had they remembered the cream sauce and pomegranate seeds the menu said it came with. Compared to the huge piece of fish my bf had, my single little poblano was pretty sad looking. The chicken gravy is good enough to drink as far as I'm concerned, though. Picked red velvet cake for my dessert and, oh, was that a wise choice. A nice big slab of moist cake--I was glad everyone else was too stuffed to share much of it and went home with a nice sized piece of it all for myself. I don't think I'd go out of my way to go back, but depending on the specials of the day I might be inclined to.
