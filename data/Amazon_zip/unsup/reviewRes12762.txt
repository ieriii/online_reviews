Amazing place, great ambiance, outstanding service. The food is just outstanding. They serve you several different kinds of tasty and tender meat. They bring you so much that you will end up eating until you are about to pass out. They also have a huge salad bar, with great selections of fresh vegetables, sea food, cheese ... Try to be seated at "wine view". They have all their wine selection behind a glass wall and whenever someone asks for wine, a girl hanging from some kind of cable contraption would go up with some acrobatic moves to get the corresponding bottle. That was mesmerizing.
