This shop is waaay roomier than the one in Lincoln Park, and for that reason, I prefer this Wicker Park location. Like everyone else has already mentioned, this place provides a lot of good food for an inexpensive price. Service is fast and friendly. The hummus, curry basmati rice, the lentils and rice, the tabbouleh... everything is really good. The kefta kabobs at the Lincoln Park store were dry once, but the tandoori chicken I had at the Wicker Park store was pretty delicious.
