This is the best Indian food I've found in the city. Most Indian restaurants are within a pretty narrow range of quality. Within that range, their food doesn't seem to correlate with the price (dive indian restaurants usually taste the same as the fancy ones). Not so with India House - it's significantly more expensive, but you can taste the difference as well. The spices are much more complex and distinct. Very well balanced flavors and the meats are perfectly cooked. That said, I do think it's more expensive than it ought to be. The dishes don't include rice or naan and, at a whopping $5 for plain basmati, the price of an entree comes out to about $25. I think that's somewhat unreasonable. Also, they have a creepy host who looks at everyone with contempt - perhaps they could hide him behind a screen or something :)
