Wowza. After their remodel this place looks amazing. I love the blast from the past glamour: there are black and white photos of Hollywood icons who have performed here in the Empire Room on the walls of the guest floors. The lobby is amazing - more like a European museum than a hotel lobby. The peacock touches are right up my alley, and manage to stay somewhat subtle. The peacock door near the main entrance; the peacock carpets, some more subtle than others - love.  My sleeping room is not the norm (I magically ended up in a suite, which is huge and I can easily entertain a group of at least 5 others so please feel free to stop by), but it is spectacular. I love that they kept some old pieces (I'm looking at you doorknobs) to mix in with the new. The food has been very, very good. The service even better (people say hello to you when it would even be reasonable for them not to - but they stop and greet you anyway. AND it's not even like some canned comment that they clearly "have to" say to guests.). Best chocolate chip cookies in the world. Love the trivia in the elevator (did you know this 1600 room hotel was a WEDDING GIFT for Bertha Palmer from her husband?! I mean, it's no Taj, but still!). This hotel is full of history and I am completely smitten. My only little complaint - why oh why can't I just have wireless in my room? Why do I have to go fill out a form for a thing? I'm in my jammies already and I just want to watch Glee in bed instead of sitting at the desk; is that too much to ask? I have absolutely had a five star experience here, but because I know that not all rooms are created equal and some are quite small and oddly shaped, and because as a planner all of the union regulations are redonk, I'm incredibly tempted to dock a star. I can't bring myself to do it, but just buyer beware, okay?
