WHAT ARE PEOPLE THINKING? The Good thing about this place is if you like lines you have it! The line seems purposefully created to create the illusion that the place is busy so that when people walk by the windows they see lots of people inside. However the service is MESSED UP..and the seating is terrible and you may be cramped and forced to sit facing a close wall. THe food is really nothing great...it is alot of sauces and bread ..however the meat...the good part of the meal is either fired and very scant...the portions of meat are small and the food is so rich and like eating dessert even for an entree... It was so difficult to park ...that after driving around for 30 minutes i had to vallet..so count on your meal costing an extra 20$ for parking. also the place is so uncomfortable that you will want to eat the food and leave ...however the food is not pleasing to me...i left hungry and then went home and ate another meal just to fill up....
