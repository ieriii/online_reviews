They have grits. They have grits! THEY HAVE GRITS!!! You can choose regular or cheese grits. And they are good grits. Real grits. The kind of grits I grew up eating for breakfast as a child. Sigh. Now that I have that out of the way, the food at Wishbone is quite good. So far, I have only visited Wishbone for breakfast or brunch. The omelets are tasty and filling. I also like the corn cakes (pancakes made from corn meal, fresh corn and scallions served with sweet red pepper sauce), and the crab cakes are surprisingly good because they don't skimp on the crab meat like so many other restaurants seem to do. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but so far the items I have tried have been delicious, especially the cheese grits that are a side option.  The service is consistently courteous, though it can sometimes be a bit slow when they get busy. And did I mention that they serve grits?
