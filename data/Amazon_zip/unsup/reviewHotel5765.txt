Very funky indeed, but it will do if all you're looking for is a clean place to sleep at reasonable cost. The door to our room looked as though it had been on the receiving end of a steel-toed boot recently, which we found a little disconcerting. There was a small TV mounted on the wall with only a few channels, no towel bars at all in the bathroom, and absolutely no amenities. For aficionados of 60s touches like fleshtone bath fixtures, the originals are still in place here. Worst of all was NO internet connection, and people at the front desk seemed clueless as to what a router was, or how to get online. This was a major inconvenience, as I had work to get done. The part-time elderly guy at the counter shrugged and referred me to the 24 hour Kinkos nearby. The "breakfast" was your typical motel carb-fest and really bad coffee. We found the parade of quirky characters coming in and out entertaining, except for the woman running around yelling in the parking lot at 5 a.m. I will say that everything was very clean, and we'd probably stay here again solely because of the price, as long as we didn't need to get online for anything.
