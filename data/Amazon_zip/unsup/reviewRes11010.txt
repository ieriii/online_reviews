Met some peeps up here this past spring for dinner on a random Wednesday night... I must say, it was tasty! We had the Red pizza with red peppers and mushrooms. Yummy! I am a big fan of Allagash White, and it was flowing that night. It was a chill atmosphere, since it was a weekday I guess. We went back again for dinner on a Friday night and the wait was waay too long so we decided to eat elsewhere. But I will defnitely be going back, preferably during the week.
