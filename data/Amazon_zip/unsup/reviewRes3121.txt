Crisp has the BEST chicken wings ever! They're loaded with meat and the sauces are so tasty (although not really authentic Korean). Service is also great! I once showed up right before they were closing so the owner threw in a few "extras" so I could try some other menu items.  If only Crisp wasn't located in such a busy area, I'd swing by more often to pick up a quick dinner. Parking is tough and several times I've circled the neighborhood, only to leave frustrated when I couldn't find a parking spot within a few block radius.  Definitely check out Crisp for meaty, juicy and tasty wings!
