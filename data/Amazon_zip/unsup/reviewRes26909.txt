The boyfriend and I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed! Recently we went and got the combination plate with a bean tostada, beef taco, cheese enchilada and cheese tamale. Everything was great! The rice was also treat we got on the side. The chips were FREE which is always great and the guac and salsa tasty (I could have just eaten that for dinner!) Since we aren't too far away, we will definitely be back Watch out though on the weekends during lunch/early dinner: it can get pretty crowded and the wait long especially if they don't open up the other side of the restaurant. But worth the wait!
