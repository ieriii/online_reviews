I just ordered a medium, THIN crust pizza with green pepper and sausage toppings and I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM LA VILLA RESTAURANT AGAIN!I'll admit that I've ordered pizza from here before. It was decent, not great but I decided to give them another shot. I have no clue what happened this time. The dough wasn't cooked all the way through and was way too thick for a THIN crust. I ate a piece and called the restaurant right afterward. All they could say is "sorry." I can't even think about taking another bite. What a waste of money. For the first time in my life (20 of which have been in Chicago), I had to throw out a whole pizza. TAKE MY EXPERIENCE AS A WARNING. DO NOT ORDER FROM LA VILLA. There are too many pizza joints in the city to waste your money on them.
