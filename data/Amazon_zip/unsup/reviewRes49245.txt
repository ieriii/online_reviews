For sugarhounds, a nice selection of cookies, cupcakes (so good!), brownies, and other pastries awaits at alliance. They also offer fresh breads, coffee drinks, and sandwiches. The next door seating area has free wireless internet, so you can enjoy some goodies while being productive. I have also had the pleasure of enjoying an Alliance prepared birthday cake (red velvet with fresh rasberry filling) and it was fantastic!
