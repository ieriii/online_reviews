Looking at some of the reviews, I thought Garcia's was the best thing around. I thought the salsa was decent and guacamole pretty good. I also enjoyed a quesadilla appetizer. Only giving it 2 stars is due to the chicken fajitas being dry, rice (ok) beans (flavorless). My friend ordered tortas with pork which also needed a heaping tablespoon of salsa to doctor it up. I believe I went in with an open mind and reasonable expectations, but there are too many mexican joints left to try.
