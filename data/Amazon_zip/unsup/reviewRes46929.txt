Meh. Food was edible but based on the reviews I expected a lot more. Had the gnocchi, for $18, it should have been ROCK STAR! It's pasta! I've made better at home. It wasn't bad but it wasn't worth $18 not even for handmade pasta made with organics. The portion was tiny and I don't eat a lot. My companions had the mac n cheese, buffalo steak, and meat loaf. Mac n cheese was small too. Meal loaf was def the winner.  Buffalo steak was slices and grilled a little salty but good. The corncake was a little strange. But the ENORMOUS cheese stick we were not even sure what to do with. It was like a huge crispy phallus laying on the plate. Drinks were strong. I have no issue spending money on food but felt that the food was way over priced for the quality and quantity. Might stop in for a drink if in the hood but otherwise won't be back.
