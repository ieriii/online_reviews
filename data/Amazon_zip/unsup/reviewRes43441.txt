This just so happens to be one of those reviews that can be short and sweet due to its Yelp popularity. I'm sure you could find all my thoughts somewhere within those other 250+ reviews... But if not, I'll leave my Yelp footprint anyway: -Their ordering/seating process is "supposed" to be and look organized but just isn't. -On a weekend day for brunch, get there early, early, early, even before the crowd who left the bars before 12 am. -The silverware, napkins, water, iced tea, sugar and honey are all self-serve. I do give compliments to the two flavored ice teas. -Their Orange Brioche French Toast with Toasted Almonds sounds better than it actually is. I found it to have no orange hint and a bit dry requiring me to drench it in syrup. Quantity is not always equal to quality in this instance. -Prices are very reasonable. -The interior is pretty blah other than having different colored walls. Although the extra set of doors that every customer who arrives stares at for a millisecond to see if it's the entrance, are probably nice during the summertime. And said.
