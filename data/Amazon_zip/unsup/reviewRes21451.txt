Ohhh mayan palace - how much I love you ! Despite the fact that I called thursday night and booked a reservation for 15 on a friday night, you were so kind to me ! Not like some of the other places I called, which laughed in my face and told me "friday is too busy for us to do that". Seriously, mayan palace is a lifesaver. First off, great margaritas. Strong, but good. I'm not sure - nor do I really want to know - how many pitchers we ended up ordering that night among the 4 people I was splitting them with, but it was a lot. I ordered the chicken taco dinner here - and again it was delicious. My friend who was sitting next to me but had come in late ordered the same thing once she saw mine come out from the kitchen. Great tacos, hands down. The service was impeccable. Seriously - our waiters were so attentive, and SO accommodating. My silly friends forgot to RSVP and decided to show up after I had told them I needed a head count by thursday in order for them to come - but no worries, mayan palace was more than happy to squeeze them in. (BTW there is a back room, and this is where they generally seat larger parties.) Our waiter continually checked to see if we were in need of more margarita pitchers, or water, etc. and I really felt welcome there. Basically, this place is amazing. I was very impressed, and if you are looking for great mexican food in a smaller setting, GO HERE. I know I will !
