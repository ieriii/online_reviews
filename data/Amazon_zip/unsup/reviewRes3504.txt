Saturday night, I called the restaurant at 4PM to check what time they are open until. They say 9PM. We drive an hour to get there downtown, and pay to park and get to their door at 7:50PM to see a sign that reads: "Kitchen Closed". I walk inside and ask why when I called to check on what time they are open until they tell me they they ran out of food. They were rude about it. If you want to be the best new reviewed chicken restaurant in Chicago, getting write ups all over the place, have plenty of food because the family behind us said they drove in from the west burbs because they read this place was the best. So, we all read the great reviews, drive an hour to eat, and they don't have enough food and they are rude when telling us about it! I called in advance to see when they were open until - I would have never gone into the city from the north burbs tonight if they didn't tell me they were open until 9PM. Then they are rude have have a rude sign in their front door "kitchen closed" You have to prepare if you are going to be advertised as the best because people spend their hard earned money to travel to you and when you can't feed them you waste their time and money!
