Glenn's awning claims to have the best food in the world. That might be a tall self-proclamation but I think he's close. I've eaten lunch here a few times and the sandwiches are delish! The potato latkes are fantastic. I had some of the brunch items at a party for the opening of the Montrose Station (across the street). Everything was great! I have been here a couple times for the all-you-can-eat crab legs. Mmmmmm! I really need to get back there for some of those!
