We came here for lunch because we were staying at the Blackstone hotel, and since it is owned by an Iron Chef, we thought that it should be a good choice for our short stay. However, we are disappointed at what we got. First of all, our waiter didn't seem to listen to us. We asked for iced tea with a little bit of ice (actually I said "two" ice cubes because I know it might be difficult for people to judge what is "little") but apparently he was not listening and still gave me a lot of ice in my iced tea. Then, at the end of the meal, we asked for a small glass of warm water to take my medicine with (something needs to dissolve in water), and I got a glass of room temperature water. I returned the water, then when he brought us new hotter water, it was in one big mug. My husband decided that we would just pour water out of a glass and measure the right amount of water that I needed instead of asking him to do it. If the food was great, perhaps we could still be happy with the overall experience, but they were just OK. We both ordered the "Catalan Express" ($18), which is a glass of iced tea or soda, then two courses. Both my husband's serrano ham salad and my chicken and shrimp soup could have been good, but they were both over salted which killed a lot of flavors. Then our entrees came. His was a very small portion of fish fillet (I wanted to say maybe the size of my palm, pretty thin) and mine was two scallop skewers (4 scallops total, but you could tell the scallops were sliced in half to create the skewers). The flavors were fine, but neither of us were satisfied. I would not recommend coming to this restaurant.
