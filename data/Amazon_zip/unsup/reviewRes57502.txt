This still has to be my favorite fondue place. It beats other fondue-me2-restaurants. This was the first place in fact that I tried fondue and fell in love with it. Yes, you definitely come here for the nice wine selection and the yummy food! my favorite is still the cheese and crackers at the bar. I don't know if they still do this - have not been back for a few weeks. I was a sucker for this (while waiting for our table). I recommend the chicken or the chicken and seafood combo. My girlfriend loves the seafood option. In either case, its really good!
