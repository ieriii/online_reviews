Rick Bayless is a freaking genius, and I LOVE that he has a restaurant I can go to in a T-shirt and shorts. You usually don't get that kind of stuff from such a top-notch chef. I ordered the Milanese de Puerco on the recommendation of our waiter because there were honestly too many divine-sounding options from which to choose on the menu. Excellent choice. The pork loin was tender and juicy, and the tomato-based sauce was just enough to give a little flavor kick -- not overwhelming at all. And the salad? I had to ask to confirm what it was, because I NEVER eat raw watercress. This stuff was seasoned so delicately but was amazingly tasty. Yum. We'll definitely be back!
