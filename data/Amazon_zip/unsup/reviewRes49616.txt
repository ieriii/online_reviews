Awesome place to have a night full of drinkin' the vino! Bin 36 has a very relax but classy environment. If you haven't been into wine drinkin' in the past, this is a good place to start the hobby. Bin 36 is also a great place to catch up with friends with some cocktails. It doesn't get too loud like other restaurants and lounges do. FYI the House of Blues is right across the street, so it is real easy to make a fun date by making reservations here and then going to see a show at the H.O.B.
