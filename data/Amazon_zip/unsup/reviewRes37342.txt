Of all the bars in Chicago, this has the best food, the best beers, and a fantastic location. 5 stars. Oh wait, it's the size of a doghouse, gets 900,000 patrons per night, and you can't hear yourself think. Completely pointless unless you like screaming, standing, and strangers rubbing their junk against you. Perhaps they should offer a beer & breakfast menu since they can't possibly hold the number of people who want to be there on any given night. -3 stars. You're way better off at Konak.
