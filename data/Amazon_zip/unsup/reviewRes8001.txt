PROs - super friendly hosts and servers. - beautiful and delicious neopolitan pizzas* that come out impossibly fast. - the nutella dessert:: a battilocchio-style focaccia with hazelnut cream and confectionery sugar. - the fact that i "lebroned" the nutella dessert's confectionery sugar during my first bite and my friend actually had me thinking he was laughing with me, not at me for a few moments. CONs - i made a quick tip about this but a repeat can't hurt. they serve wine in a stumpy (read:: NOT wine) glass. yes, full to the brim, but aesthetically unappealing. especially if you're a member of the finer things club. - they want you to make yourself useful. so go ahead. let's see just how straight you can cut your own pizza(s). - while the crust is chewy and fresh-out-of-the-oven tasting, the moment you pick up your slice, the tip sadly dips down. soggy, limp middles. tsk tsk. - no napkins or utensils for dessert? i mean, it's definitely delectable enough that i'd dare to go back to the ways of our primal ancestors and rip it apart, but doing so isn't very cute. worthy of another shot, but not at the top of the list. --- *diavola:: mozzarella di bufala, spicy salami, red pepper flakes, basil. prosciutto e rucola:: provola, prosciutto di parma, arugula, parmesan.
