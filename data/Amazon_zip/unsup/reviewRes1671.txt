I visited Chicago for the first time and this place was a requirement for me to check out. The first thing I did when I woke up in the morning was hop on the L and head straight to Hot Doug's. I arrived 30min before opening and there were at least 30 people in front of me already. The wait didn't seem long since I was playing "Angry Birds" on my phone. Got to the line and I ordered the foie gras dog, Chicago-style dog, the "Salma Hayek" (A spicy andouille sausage) with grilled onions, and the duck fat fries. First off the chicago-style. I got it fully loaded and was good. Everything I asked for. Second, the Salma Hayek. I eyed that thing like it was her and I was a horny adolescent ready to bust for the first time. It was good. Third, the duck fat fries. nom nom nom nom nom. And last the coveted foie gras dog. Words can't describe the sensation that I felt when I bit into that combination of chewy bun, succulent duck sausage, three fat pieces of creamy velvet called foie gras, and some creamy sauce that had a slight bite to it. My heart rate jumped a few beats, my pupils dilated and glazed over, and the perspiration started to dot all over my nose and drip down my forehead. Hallelujer!! I ate all of that and didn't eat till dinner. Luckily the hostel was pretty empty when my bowels ruptured. They were saved. I can't forget Doug. This man is paragon. He made my trip from great to unforgettable. It's people like these and the little things they do for you that make you believe there is a God. Thank you for your wonderful establishment, your generosity and kindness, and giving me the opportunity to taste Salma Hayek. Thanks Doug.
