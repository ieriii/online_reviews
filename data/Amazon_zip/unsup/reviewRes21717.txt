after having lived in chicago for nearly 2 years, ive been on the quest for good mexican food. ive found my amazing drunken late night mexican food (los tres panchos...see review) ...but not a decent sit down restaurant. i think that mayan palace may just fit the bill. the bf and i went here and left incredibly stuffed and happy. we both got margaritas...and munched on perfectly crispy chips while we waited for our food. he got the cheese quesadilla and i got the chimichanga...and both were delicious! mayan palace...you rock!
