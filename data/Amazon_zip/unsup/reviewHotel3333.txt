PS hotel takes great pains to stay on top of responding to online critiques, the problem is they don't really act on them. I submitted a similar e-mail to management when I had the same type of disappointment with my last stay(November 2010). Nothing changed as a result despite the online response from management Just FYI to the Yelp community. .
