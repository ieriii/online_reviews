I wasn't a fan of the neighborhood, but I heard great thing's about this place. Yep, they were right! I WILL BE BACK :)Everyone who worked there were very nice & welcoming!Food was good. I had thai & sushi. Both were good. They even made something for me that wasn't on the menu. Which is ALWAYS a huge plus.The decor was very cute too.
