Over rated! the certain cuts of steak were bland and cold for me, seems like they were tryin to dump all the older cooked stuff on my table and of course i'm not going to deny the offers being the carnivore that i is, but i was thoroughly dissapointed! i got some wine split a dessert and the bill came out to around $350! not worth it for me
