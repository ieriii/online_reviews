This was the first Brazilian steakhouse I've been to and it is quite a unique experience. Guys walking around with tons of meat that they cut onto your plate. Definitely a place to try if you've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse. Seems that several other places are all about the same price for lunch or dinner. The second time I went to Brazzaz, we had a coupon which made the meal definitely more affordable. The service was good and it is a fun place to go to eat good cuts of meat. Filets, sirloin, porterhouse all pretty good. Different types of meat like sausage, chicken, lamb, and pork are available. My favorite is the grilled pineapple, which is a refreshing alternative to all of the pieces of beef.
