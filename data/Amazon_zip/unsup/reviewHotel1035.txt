This is a pleasant change from your big chain hotel groups. Very European and very comfortable. You can find some good deals at this great location. The rooms are basic and clean. The hotel location is excellent so you can walk to shops and restaurants. You have at least three good restaurants on the same block as the hotel. Very good price/value relationship.
