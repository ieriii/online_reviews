Yes, I've been told that Gino's and Giordano's are a must when you visit Chicago (by different people because apparently liking them is mutually exclusive in this town). Yes, I've even heard that Gino's was featured on some Food Network show. And when Gino's happened to be visible from my hotel room with a constant line that went around the corner ... yes, I had to try it. Was waiting in that line worth it? First, I have to say we only waited about 5 minutes because we were a party of two and every other party was sensible enough to come in a pack so they could consume the pizzas and still walk out. If I had to wait longer than that, I'd have been really upset. The key piece of information you need to know before deciding to go there is that it's a cornbread based crust, NOT normal pizza dough. I would have given them 2 stars because I didn't care for the crust at all, but I can't really fault them for making pizza differently than everyone would expect. On the positive side, their sauce is more flavorful than Giordano's. Everything else is about the same; you go to one, you don't need to visit the other. So, I guess conventional wisdom turned out to be right. Pick Gino's or Giordano's for a slice of Chicago style, and then figure out some better places to eat (because Chicago is filled with them).
