Yolk is a solid breakfast restaurant. If you love a good omelet, you will like Yolk. I ordered the Butcher Shop and my girlfriend ordered the Hey Ricky. When the food came back to us, we were shocked at the size of our omelets. We are talking football sized omelets with plenty of ingredients mixed in. The price is just about right, too. Our waitress was friendly and did not skimp on the coffee refills. My only complaints about Yolk was the wait, which was 30 minutes, but I suppose that comes with the territory of being a breakfast place in a busy area. Also, the seating arrangement is a bit cramped, if you sit at one of the tables in the back against the wall if feels like you are eating with the people next to you.
