Went to Lao Sze Chuan on 12/27/2011 with the family. As one of the other reviewers wrote - CONSISTENCY IS KING! We've eaten here many times and loved the food, but this time we were seated upstairs. My family (with two young daughters under 5 years old) were seated at a large table by the staff when the Host started yelling! Everyone stopped talking, looked at us and wondered what was happening. The Host told us the table was for a large group AND KICKED US OUT - very, very rude! I told him we were seated by the staff upstairs and he yelled at them. I have NEVER been treated so badly at a restaurant and so embarassed.The food is great here, but service has killed my appetite for this restaurant. Do not recommend.
