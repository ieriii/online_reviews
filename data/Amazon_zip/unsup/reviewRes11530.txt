The food was pretty decent, but the service was really poor. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night the wait for a table is excruciatingly long and the staff could care less about how long you have to wait. In fact they got annoyed when we asked (after an hour) where we were on the list. I will say that when we ordered, the pizza came out pretty fast so that was a plus. However, once we sat the server wasn't really friendly and seemed to want to get us out of there, even though by this time the restaurant had died down significantly. He probably had a long night, I get that. But with so many other restaurants in Chicago that shows you stellar service + great food, this one really stuck out to me as being poor so next time we'll think twice about going.
