Oh yeah, that's the stuff. My girlfriend called me up this morning and told me that she wanted to find an Indian buffet for lunch and would I like to join her. Um, YES. I love Indian so naturally I was game. She said she found India House online and I was so excited because I've been wanting to try it for a long time but just never got around to it. I know that the food here is a bit "Americanized" but I have to be honest and say that I don't mind that. I mean, I don't do well with scary meats in authentic dishes, so sue me, whatever, I like the dumbed down versions. The buffet was amazing, well kept and had a nice variety. Hot, sizzling plates of tandoori chicken and baskets of naan were plentiful. I should have worn stretchy pants..thats all I'm saying. I just wish this joint were closer, on the other hand, it is probably good that it is not, otherwise stretchy pants would have to be the norm.
