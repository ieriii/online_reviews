Great seafood, but a little overpriced.  I'm a big fan of just hanging out at the bar, chatting with Carlos (my vote for best bartender in the city) and having some oysters and a martini during happy hour (1/2 price oysters from 4pm - 6pm).  So for the oyster bar experience it's a 5 star place, but for dinner it goes down a little bit. Certainly not bad, and definitely worth checking out, but just not the level of quality I would expect for the price.
