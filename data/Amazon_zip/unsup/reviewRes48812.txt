This place was kinda whack. Nice decor, I like the set up of the tables. After we sat down the entrees came at all different times. I waited an hour for my food after ordering on a pouring rain night. Meaning not a lot of diners there. Not sure what took so long. Next time I'm in Chicago I won't be going back. I will say however that the pork rinds were good. I'm not a pork rind girl but they were GOOD.
