I truly am a huge fan and how can you not be fresh juice bar, a large variety of organic items. The decor is refreshing and makes you feel like your in a tropical destination. The pancakes were light, fluffy and didn't even need syrup to them, perfectly sweet. I had the Chevre omelet which had sun-dried tomatoes, shallots, portobello mushroom, pancetta (pork) and goat cheese. It was pretty big so you can definitely share it between two people. The only problem I had with Meli's was the service. When you walk in you see two beautiful greek women but man oh man they must've been having a bad day because they had a nasty look on their face. And when your going to a restaurant wanting to be fed and not bothered by any of the headache of cooking and cleaning after yourself - the last thing you want to see is a bad attitude and unfortunately that's what I got. I didn't mind waiting at all and it took about 45 minutes but as I watched them both talk to others as they walked in, it wasn't just me. I understand how overwhelming it can get and I can't attest since I've worked in restaurants for over 6 years, I get it but you should never forget about customer service and friendliness. I could always go to Walk Bros, which has been my favorite place before Meli's. I just hope they pay attention to the way they speak to people and learn from their mistakes because the food is really great but without great service there's no coming back.
