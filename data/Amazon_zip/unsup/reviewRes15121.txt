CHICAGO.... Yes this is Chicago. The place hasn't changed since the 60's in anyway. By in anyway, I mean the dcor, the food and the staff. A lot of these places that don't change tend to slide by on nostalgia. They are one off type dining experiences that entertain us, but leave our taste buds asking for more. Sabatino's is not that place. The food lives up to expectations. Pounded veal is served with 5 preparations. Yes all the preparations taste the same, but that's ok because it tastes goods. Entre's come with soup and salad... They bring free fruit for dessert if the waitress thinks your cute (or a good tipper). The flaming baked Alaska is a joy for children, a fire hazard for the elderly and tasty for people who like sweets. Anyway.... Worth a journey.
