I typically love this place but I recently went and it was ok at best. I had the special and was not impressed at all. The server didn't tell me the price and was so surprised when the bill came. I think I had some sort of pork on the grill and it was not worth $22. The rice and beans it came with were dry. I'll go back but was a bit sad.
