Wow what a treat! Went to Big Jones on Friday night with a date, and like it so much we had to go back for Sunday Brunch!Friday we had a fixed-price menu that was very inexpensive but included morel mushrooms and tallgrass steak for the entree! It was a perfect dinner for spring and early summer. We had watercress salad, the steak with mushrooms (OMG the BEST steak I've ever had!) and some rhubarb for dessert with a cute little home made toffee. Everything was very fresh and seasonal and the service was excellent.Sunday brunch today was a whole new story. Great mimosas with good champahne were only $6.00 and the coffee was amazing (Intelligentsia.) I had Eggs New Orleans and my date had Eggs Benedict. Perfectly poached eggs, silky hollandaise sauce, and crazy yummy potatoes with onion and peppers. It was a tiny bit more expensive than some of the other brunches in the area, but totally worth it and if anything cheap considering the quality. Once again, great service!
