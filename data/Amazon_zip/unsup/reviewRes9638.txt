Le Colonial has a romantic ambiance. It seemed like a good place to take a dinner or date or go with a small group of friends. The atmosphere was pretty romantic and intimate though the restaurant was pretty crowded on the Saturday night that my boyfriend and I went. I actually liked the food that I ordered. I had the Banh Uot (sesame beef rolls) appetizer, Tom Xao Sate (sauted jumbo shrimp entre), and the sorbet (for dessert).  The sesame beef rolls taste so good and were wrapped in flat noodles. I became and immediate fan. The sauted jumbo shrimp was a little spicy (but I like it like that) and the asparagus in the dish contributed well to the robust flavor of the dish. I was glad that they served Jasmine white rice with the entrees as it was perfect to top everything off. The rice helped to balance off the spice and sauce of the sauted jumbo shrimp dish. I was VERY pleased with my meal.  My handsome dinner date on the other hand thought otherwise. He ordered the Tom Cuon Ram (beignets) appetizer, Vit Quay (ginger marinated roast duck with tamarind dipping sauce), and vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. Hot oil exploded out of the beignets which made the first bites unpleasant. But after that, the beignets did taste good, but nothing too special about them. He thought the roast duck (Vit Quay entre) was also pretty mediocre.  I was disappointed that nothing more creative was served for dessert as part of the Restaurant Week pre-fixed menu. Though the ice cream and sorbet tasted good, it would have been nice to have fancier options for dessert.  Service was average though. Our waiter seemed aloof and insincere - just doing his job and nothing more. The bussers and food runners even seemed a bit more personable.
