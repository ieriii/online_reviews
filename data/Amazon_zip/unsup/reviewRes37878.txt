This place was cool, definitely cool. As you walk in, you wouldn't think this would be that amazing of a place. The ambience is alright (picture a semi sports bar), a crowded area, barely any place to sit. My friend and I happened to walk in at the right time, as two people were leaving from the bar- after we sat down, we learned that the wait to actually sit in the dining area was 1.5 hours. Hopleaf is known for its beers. Lots of beers- but more specifically, Belgian beers. As I am one of the few females out of my large group of friends who actually like beer, I told my friend that I wanted to go somewhere unique, somewhere that can only be found in Chicago. He recommended Hopleaf. First, I started out with the Oud Beersel. It wasn't too heavy and was pretty sweet- had more of a berry taste, and I just liked it overall. My friend started out with the famous Delirious Tremens (every other person seemed to be getting this), and that was a lighter beer, but that was good as well. Later on, I got the Leffe Blond- which wasn't as fruity, but definitely light and refreshing- reminded me of nature, for some reason. My friend got the Chimay beer- something made by a monk- but it was dark, sweet, and man, I liked it. Additionally, we got the mussels- where the flavor was REALLY good. We also got some frites- which was just the right amount of potato-ness with a great dipping sauce (kind of a zesty mayo)? The wait staff... was slow. We kept trying to get their attention, but they kept ignoring us sitting at the bar- maybe because we were small? but still, ignoring us, or kept trying to take away our plate. Not rude, just.. the wait staff could have been better. Definitely crowded. Not super loud though- my friend and I were still able to hold a conversation. People were asking for us for our seats though... Nonetheless, I wish I could have tried the food, but definitely a cool place to eat and chill. Good drinks, good food, good friends= my kind of place to be.
