Enough said. This place has the best damn hot dogs/sausages. I chowed down on three sausages in 5 minutes, it was so good that I couldn't let it sit out in the cold like that, just can't, that would be sinful. We were in line for 30 minutes and yes, it's worth every minutes in the cold. The item that stood out the most for me? the duck sausage with the foie gras, it's orgasmic, no lie. The fries fried in duck fat was so so, I couldn't tell a difference from the regular fries.
