This was my second visit to Big Jones. I was here right after it opened and now I remember why I waited so many years to return.  I'm by no means an expert when it comes to southern or Cajun food, but I do know good food when I taste it. Everything was mediocre -- and much more bland than I had expected. I had the crab cake appetizer and the shrimp and grits -- both were just okay.  Meh. I'm sure there's better out there.
