Noisy and bustling like an Italian family restaurant should be. The menu options were awesome. They had a menu just for gluten-free dishes! The menu was long too! I enjoyed that perk very much! The sauces and pastas were so delectable and tasty. They were not drenched yet they were flavorful. I thought this place did a good job!
