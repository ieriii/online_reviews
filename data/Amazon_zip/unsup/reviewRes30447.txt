Why haven't I visited this place sooner? Thankfully I had a good group of individuals who recommended some great menu items for me to try! Below lists what we ordered--and every single one of these were absolutely delicious and well worth the money spent: - Oxtail Potstickers - Crispy Pata (confit pork shank) - Lobster and wagyu roll - The "Ridiculous" Dessert - tempura fried vanilla ice-cream & carrot cake dipped in caramel and topped with toasted walnuts. YES, it was ridiculously AWESOME! Cocktail of choice? The Divine Lychee: Belvedere black raspberry, Grand marnier, lychee, guava puree. I mean, helloo!? Enough said here. :)
