wow! Fantastic! Came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and another friend and had a great time. This place is busy! Expect a little bit of a wait if you come on a weekend evening, but it is well worth the wait. While waiting we went to the bar and had some of their fantastic beers. I'm not a huge beer drinker but the beer here is some of the best I have tasted and a great selection. The pizza is phenomenal! I was not disappointed. We ordered a large pizza with a red sauce and goat cheese. I think next time I would love to try adding some basil to it as well. I will definitely be coming back here.
