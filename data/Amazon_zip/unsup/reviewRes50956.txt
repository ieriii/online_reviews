I've gone ot Big Jones two or three times since it opened. My husband is a born and bred southerner and it got his down-home seal of approval. We loved the decor of the restaurant and as former Aville residents, we think it's a great addition to the neighborhood. The one thing that I had that stood out the most actually wasn't even food. It was my drink. I had iced tea that came with this glass of peach flavored (I think that's what the flavor was) syrup. It was wonderfully amazing. It's been a while since I've been, so I can't remember what I had to eat, but all I remember is that it was good!
