Say something bad about Indie Thai and Sushi---i dare you! This place is a gem. Can you say BYOB?! I love it! The sushi is fresh, the Thai dishes are perfectly seasoned. Large portions, great prices. I just love this place. And its true what you've read about the crab rangoon....its freaking out-of-this-world! Really, Ive never had better. Ever. The best. I want it. Now.
