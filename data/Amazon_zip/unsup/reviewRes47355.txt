Just had to write about the Lockdown Warden burger...perfectly medium with bacon, fried leeks, and truffle oil...super rich and a tad pricy but worth it! Unfortunately the bacon mac n cheese was just "meh"...probably should've just stuck with the fries. My friends all got the wing special (on Monday nights) with different sauces, all really good. Nice beer selection, friendly servers and they got the food out super fast, so we were all happy! Good place to chill after work, with better than average bar food.
