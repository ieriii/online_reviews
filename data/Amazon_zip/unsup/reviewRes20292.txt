The first word that comes to mind is "Fun." I had a very fun lunch at the Gage because of great atmosephere, impressive food, and the perfect server. This is a hybrid of bar and fancy food. Its very busy at lunch time, I recommend reservations. Once seated, ask questions about the menu. The food can be very different and is supposed to pair up well with specific drinks, hence the term, "gastropub." I ate the fish n chips, which might be my favorite in the city, now. The crispy outside was like a "tasty bark" that covered huge portions of fish, more than I could eat. The tarter sauce was unique and a must-eat with both fish and the fries. I really enjoyed this meal! The service was attentive and our waiter was very well-informed of the menu and recomendations. He was passionate about the food and really seemed to care if we enjoyed everything on the table. Go to the Gage for an interesting menu and great service.
