We went to Piccolo Sogno last night and had a terrific meal. I don't know that there's much to add to the other 227 reviews, but here's what we had: Caprese - Amazing; uses oven dried tomatoes which are very smooth and lend a richness to the dish. The Buffalo motz was perfection. Calamari - Tasty but nothing too special. They served a great red sauce with it though. Then, appetizer portions of the following pastas: Spaghetti Nero - Just ok. The pasta was great but the seafood was average Ravioli - Easily some of the best ravioli I've ever had. Rich and flavorful but not too heavy. I would sample this every time I come here. Tagliatelli - Delicious pasta with a fantastic spiced wild boar ragu. I wasn't sure about the boar but my server recommended it and I went for it. Extremely tasty but nothing funky about it. For dessert my wife picked a hazelnut molten chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream. It was every bit as good as it sounds. The location is good, there is street parking, the restaurant has a nice ambiance, the service is impeccable, and the price is right. With food like this what more can you ask for?
