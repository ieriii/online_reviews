I have considered Bongo Room one of my favorite breakfast restaurants in the Chicago area. In spite of the noise and the fact that it is always packed (esp. the Milwaukee St location), the food is almost always top-notch. But I recently did have a bad experience here. The food took over an hour to arrive, even though we were seated about 15 minutes after they opened. In spite of the wait we remained optimistic. Then we got our breakfast: undercooked doughy pancakes, and a (decent) omelet with burned black homefries. Really. Burned black hunk of crust. Totally unacceptable. The cook actually hid them under a thin layer of mushy uncrisp potatoes and I did not see them at first. I was so hungry by this time that I just ate the mushy potatoes along with the omelet. When my waitress FINALLY returned to check on us (not really her fault, she was just slammed), upon seeing the black potatoes, she did apologize and offered me new potatoes, but by then I had eaten the edible portions on my plate (We also barely touched the half-cooked pancakes). I said no thanks to more potatoes, but asked politely for compensation.They gave me $2.50 off of this disaster. whoopie. I think they should have comped the whole bordering-on-terrible meal. I don't take going out to eat lightly, I am very selective about who gets my money, and this just really put me off. I won't be going back again. Two stars for having a good waitress and past experiences being better than this one.
