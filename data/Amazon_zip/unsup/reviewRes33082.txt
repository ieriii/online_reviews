Sultan Market is great for take-out or a quick bite for up to 4 as they have a couple tables. It is one my and many other Lincoln Park-ers' favorite places to grab dinner on the way home from work during the week, or on the weekends a quick lunch or late night bite. Salad bar - my fav - they have great ethnic ingredients- including stuffed grape leaves, cubed feta, kimchi, tahini & yogurt sauces, etc. They keep it clean too. The falafel sandwich is a standy favorite, good shwarma, generous dinner platters.  Always friendly and quick service - a pleasant experience every time I have gone.
