I LOVE the Omni! Why would anyone choose to stay anywhere else? Every room is a suite, great location at Michigan and Huron and over the top service. Join their Select Guest Program (check out the website) and get coupons for 50% off and free upgrades. This is truly one of the most accomodating hotels in the city and once you become a Select Guest and begin visiting there, you get all kinds of nice perks! I stayed there for a wedding a few weeks ago and for $159 per night had a beautiful Executive suite, received a $25 food and beverage coupon, parking was free as was the complimentary coffee, juice and newspaper delivered to my door! It just does not get any better than Omni.
