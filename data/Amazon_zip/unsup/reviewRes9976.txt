I adore this place! Their patio is absolutely lovely. I don't use the word "lovely" that often, but that's exactly what it is. Beautiful decor, busy yet intimate...wonderful place for a date. When you sit, you just kind of take a deep breath and take it all in. Sigh.... The food was excellent as was the wine list. The quatro formaggi pizza was a stand out (we shared as an appetizer). Also, they have super tasty olive oi and vinegar on the table. The olive oil was a bit pungent and at first I was a little overwhelmed with the smell as I walked in, but it was delicious. Overall, I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian meal. We will be back for sure.
