Yolk was one of the few places I'd gotten to check out while in Chicago for a conference and I truly enjoyed what I had both visits. Nothing fancy we're talking pancakes, scrambled eggs with American cheese sausage links and bacon. However each item was cooked right, not too greasy, just the right amount of cheese bacon actually cooked all the way through:) Service was pretty good as well and my food arrived fast. Plus the place is really cute design wise. I'll be back when I'm in Chicago again next year.
