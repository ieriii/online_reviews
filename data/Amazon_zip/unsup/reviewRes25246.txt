I came into this place with a friend for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't that busy when we first got there (11:30) so service was really good until it got busy around 12:30. It took us forever to get refills and our check.  ..but other than that..the food is amazing. I love this place. The decor is very nice, and simply because the food was so enjoyable, I did not deduct a star due to service.  We got the Catalan Express lunch special, which comes with a drink and 2 courses. Price is fairly cheap for what you're getting ($18). For the first course, I got the Arroz a la Cazuela (soup). It's very rich in flavor..I highly recommend it.  I also really enjoyed the Yellowfin Tuna, although it wasn't what I expected. It's two small cuts of seared yellowfin (so if you don't like you're fish raw, this is definitely not for you) with celery root and basil emulsion.  The Black Angus Hanger steak was also really good..It has a potato croquette laid out on the bottom, and then is topped with braised short ribs.  The thing about the food here is that everything is bursting with flavor. They put unique sauces on the plate that don't overwhelm the food, but enhance it.  We also ended up getting dessert. Croquetas De Xocolata~ YUM. I uploaded pictures, so you can get a visual of what you're getting.
