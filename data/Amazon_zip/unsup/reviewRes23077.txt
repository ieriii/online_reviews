I LOVE SUPERDAWG!!!! My favorite thing to eat there is the superdawg with *GASPS* KETCHUP and Mustard lol...Their food is soooooo good and their shakes are great. The ambiance is SAWEET and me and my family and friends have been coming here for over 15 years if not longer. The only thing that sucks is that it is CASH only but that hasn't stopped us from eating their yummy jumbo size hot dogs for a bazillion years. Their crinkle cut fries are really good as well!
