I went here last night for a belated birthday dinner. Reservations were extremely easy to make and they were very accommodating with our party of 10. The wait staff was attentive, even bringing out yogurt sauce to help with the spice when my brother in law mentioned the Lamb Vindaloo was pretty spicy. They were out of a dish that my cousin ordered and when he just told the waiter to bring out something else he recommended, the dish ended up being pretty good. Refills on the naan were frequent, and they were pretty quick to serve the food. Dishes we had that were good: Lamb Vindaloo Paneer Tikka Tandoori Chicken I can't remember all the rest Garlic Naan (and creamy tomato dipping sauce). The decor is nice and the drink selection is great too. A good place to get some food! Just be aware, most dishes are $16 and up.
