This is the best Thai restaurant in all of Chicago. I have been here multiple times and it does not disappoint. A liquor store is near, so the BYO option is perfect. You can choose the level of spicy for any dish you order. It is only down one star, because the wait staff is not very attentive and when it gets busy, you have to flag someone down. Otherwise I would highly recommend this place to anyone who asked
