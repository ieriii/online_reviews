Ten years ago, I received the Chicago Diner Cookbook as a gift. I've been cooking amazing (and amazingly easy) recipes from it ever since! This year, I was lucky enough to finally get to the Chicago Diner. And it did not disappoint! I ordered a bacon cheeseburger then got a country-fried setian dish to go (for dinner). This food was tasty, well-priced, and the servers were super friendly. The best part was seeing my family of steak and potato eaters get jealous of my dinner after they'd tried some of my oh-so-scrumptious seitan!
