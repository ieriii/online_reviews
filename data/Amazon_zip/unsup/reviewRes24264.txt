Was there on a business meeting along with 20 others. We ordered a couple of everything on the appetizer menu and all of it was fabulous, especially the fried cheese platter. My dinner was very delicious and the service was the best. I will go back to Chicago just for some more of the best Greek Food I've ever had.
