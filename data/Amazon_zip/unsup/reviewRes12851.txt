Came here for brunch and loved my egg/salmon/spinach/dill plate. Very tasty, not too salty, and great portion for the price. My mimosa was a good pick too. This place was huge. Much more room than I thought. Parking was easy on Ravenswood and Irving Park. Close to the brownline too (steps away). I will have to try this place out for dinner sometime.
