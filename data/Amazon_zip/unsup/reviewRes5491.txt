Great selection of Italian and German beers on tap, a huge selection of wines by the glass, and 1/3 bottle, and tasty small plate selections. We started with the salt roasted beets with goat cheese, moved on to the tangy and spicy fried mussels, and finished off with the perfectly grilled octopus and a nice selection of Jamon and cheese. Lively casual atmosphere with friendly and helpful service.
