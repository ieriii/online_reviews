My boyfriend and I found out about this place from a friend when we were looking for an inexpensive but filling meal. She recommended Lockdown on Tuesday when they had 1/2 price burgers. We fell in love! I recommend NOT eating anything for lunch if you plan on coming here for dinner, because the burger alone will fill you up! My favorite: The Fat Elvis, it sounds gross but it is sooooooooooo good!! Their burger combinations are fucktastic!!! (and definitely for the curious eaters that want to try something different) Their fries are amazing, the mac and cheese is all my boyfriend will ever order with his burger and the beer deals are good too. We also enjoy running into one of the owners, PJ. He doesn't forget faces and will always say hi to his regulars. You also will see him helping out the waitstaff on busy nights, something you rarely see anymore. The only downside I have is now that they have gotten all the media attention, the wait for burgers on 1/2 price tuesdays can range anywhere from 1-2 hours, which can be annoying for someone that doesn't like to wait forever and a day (especially on an empty stomach)....and then you take a bite of the burger and realize it was well worth it!! :) Also, check out Phil's Last Stand....which is run by the owner's father. Great stuff!!
