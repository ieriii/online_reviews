Best Chinese food ever.And it's not just me, plenty of my friend and family agree with that bold statement. I've been to other really famous Chinese restaurants in other cities that are must go to type of places and nothing can compare to Lao Sze. Salt & Pepper anything is good, eggplant, chili chicken, mayo shrimp, green beans, you can't go wrong.
