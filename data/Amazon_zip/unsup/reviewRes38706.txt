I ordered a medium deep dish with sausage, peppori, and mushrooms. The wait to get seated at lunch was about two hours while the take-away window was only about an hour. It was already late in the lunch hour so I chose to go with the latter. We took the pizza to the bar where they didn't seem to mind as long as we were ordering drinks. Long story short, I am preferential to NY style but Giardanos was a nice treat.
