Ok...hmm...alright, I'm giving this place 4 stars on potential alone because although my experience wasn't bad, it wasn't 4 stars either. The decor is much better than Feed the Beast and the setup with the cool benches in the bar area are perfect. The bar itself has a sorta, well, peninsula that juts out in the middle. Not odd, but rather different. It has two tv's (flat screens). I also noticed the jukebox in the short hallway that connects the bar area to the back room (fun room). Now onto the service/food. This is where the kinks need to be worked out. Upon seating we were given menus and a friendly smile. There are, as everyone else stated, many beers on tap to accompany a nice long list. The beer prices are seriously, unbelievably cheap. Most average around $4.00-$4.50. I would just go here and drink for the beer alone, however I was hungry. I ordered a burger my friend ordered one too. I ordered the something spicy burger with jalapeno. Here is what's funny...the burger wasn't spicy at all and it was 2/3 the size of the bun. I actually laughed. The burger was good, don't get me wrong, it is just rare to get a burger that is seriously 2/3 the size of the bun. The bun was dry and just stale and boring and well, big..HA! I just ate the burger minus the bun. The fries were VERY, VERY good. Please have some. Our bartender/server guy was great though, but a tad slow. I'm sure with explaining all the beers, the new place to, blah blah, etc to everyone, that he just was a bit overwhelmed. However, he did notice that my friend did not like his beer and didn't charge us for it, albeit a tad slow but attentive in that respect. Like I stated, this place has a LOT of potential. Games in the back, a jukebox (I'll have to check that out - love controlling music) and a nice laid back feel with a very nice beer list with prices to match - this place will win over many. I only hope some of the kinks are worked out rather than looked over.
