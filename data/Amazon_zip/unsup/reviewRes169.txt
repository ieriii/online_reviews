I went in expecting that I would want to get a taco after leaving. I was thankfully wrong.  The food was amazing - even things that I normally would turn my nose up at (truffles I'm looking at you) tasked shockingly good. The wine pairings were well matched and delicious. I am currently working on forgetting what good wine tastes like. The service was good, but neutral - which I think is the point because the meal is supposed to be about the food not the service or decor. Would I go again? Yes. Would I go again soon? Probably not. Since so much of the experience is trying the strange concoctions I feel like it would be a waste to try the same menu again. I'll wait a few years, and then return.
