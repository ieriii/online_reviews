I have been going to Sunda since it opened and it is definitely in my top 3. I recently had a business lunch here and I am so glad I chose Sunda as the location. The staff was amazing, the food was incredible, and the service was fantastic. I guess they sensed that this was an important lunch, because the manager Kevin sent over crispy rice with kobe beef and mochi for dessert, on the house. It doesn't get better than that.
