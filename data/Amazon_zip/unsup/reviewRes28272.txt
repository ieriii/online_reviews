I dined at Graham Elliot's place last night and was blown away on 3 counts: an inviting-relaxed atmosphere, professional-knowledgeable service, and flavors & tastes that will have me returning. We ordered the 5 course tasting menu and followed up with the beverage pairing for each course. There was not 1 miss-step in the food courses or the beverage pairing! Another big plus in this age of celebrity chef's it was nice to see Chef Graham Elliot in his place. Good job.
