Disappointed! On a hunt for a good breakfast, my boyfriend, Jim and I had passed by a cute little place called, Milk and Honey. the place was packed, which I took to be a good sign. My mistake. Once inside, we were greeted by a spacey hostess, who barely made eye contact. The rest of the staff seemed to be having a bad day as well. I sat at the tiny table while Jim ordered the waffle I had been craving. Another mistake! It was tasteless, and, frankly, mooshy! Jim's eggs were OK, but surely overpriced. i will say that the coffee was quite good, yet not good enough to redeem the cafe. So Honey, I wont be comin' back!!
