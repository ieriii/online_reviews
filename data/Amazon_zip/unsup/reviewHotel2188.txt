My sweetie and I spent a night here to celebrate our anniversary after scoring a deal on Hotwire for $99. Great hotel: wonderfully helpful staff, prompt room service for that toothpaste I forgot, beautiful decor, a room on the 32nd floor in the famous historic tower that had a great view of a city and overlooked the Magnificent Mile. The bath products are great (gotta love creamy, lightly-scented body lotions that are made in France) as was the bathroom itself, with a spacious glass shower and a separate bathtub to boot. The location is hard to beat: we really appreciated being able to wander Michigan Avenue, stop in at the Apple store to play with the new iPad and buy some stuff at Watertower. I would say that Hotwire/Groupon are the way to go for this place. I think single rooms with a King-sized bed usually go for around $300, and that simply is too much for what you get. The room was rather small, and as a result the furniture was awkwardly placed, with the TV oriented perpendicularly to the bed and difficult to watch from the bed. But for $99, with access to a gym and a pool (neither of which we used--it was a laaaazy weekend)? Definitely a deal.
