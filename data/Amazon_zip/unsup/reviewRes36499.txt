they get the one star because the delivery service is so good. but if you go here to eat, BYOW. Bring your own waiter. I went there for lunch today with a friend and was waited on by a dude with a princess attitude. He "greeted" us at the door, pointed his nose up in the air, and pointed at a table where we could sit. He came by late to take our order and did so with the same asshole attitude. Much later, he brought the tea out and carelessly half slammed it down on the table. I'm a waitress myself so I know what it's like having a bad day. I let it slide. But, not being rude or demanding, we wanted to get the soy sauce dishes changed because they were crusty with something or the other. He blatantly ignored me, so my friend tried to get his attention "Excuse me, when you have time can we please get new dishes? These are pretty dirty." He rolled his eyes and snapped at my friend and word for word said, "Ya ya ya. New dishes." When he brought them back he tossed them on the table and made it seem like we were one of those high maintenance tables, always asking for something. "Here. Here are new dishes." He also didn't come back to the table after he brought the food out. Which came out late. If I'm going to pay money for a bag of Mighty Tea, at least refill the hot water. We waited forever for the check. I usually tip about 20-25% regardless of service. Still left something but honestly two bucks was about as much this Jack Ass deserved. I'll still order from this place solely for delivery, but will never bring people here again for food. The service is not worth it. The attitude was uncalled for. I'd rather go to Oysy and barely get served. At least the girls are nice about it.
