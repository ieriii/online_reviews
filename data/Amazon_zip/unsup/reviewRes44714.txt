I came here because of the great reviews on Chowhound, but I wish someone had told me the following: At Giordano's you will pay $25+ for a small pizza that tastes like cardboard. Literally, the pizza is cooked on cardboard. This is a huge no-no for flavor and texture. Both my husband and I got sick after eating the pizza, but that might just be our inability to digest cardboard, cheese, and grease. Perhaps due to the food, or perhaps due to the 45+ minute wait for service (we had to get on a list for a table, and then waited again at the table), everyone in this place looked utterly miserable. I can't even count the dirty looks I personally got from fellow diners, which is unusual to say the least. This happen to anyone else? There has to be good deep dish pizza in Chicago, I just don't know where it is. Certainly not here! I'm serious. I'm your gardian angel. This is a tourist trap. Recommendation: Avoid.
