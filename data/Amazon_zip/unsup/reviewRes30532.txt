I love this place, been here twice, once for dinner and once for drinks. Thanks Casey and Carrie for turning me onto it! First the drinks with the dry ice are cool to look at, great presentation. Brussel Sprouts, lobster mash, ribeye all amazing, service was awesome! The bar is the real winner. Huge, plenty of room to get comfortable, the band is awesome, really got the crowd going! The bartenders are real mixologists making great cocktails.
