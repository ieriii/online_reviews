A great Chicago find. It a really small place, so it gets busy fast. I suggest going early. I had a shrimp po boy and it was very flavorable. Also, I had their lobster roll. Honestly, one of the best in Chicago and fairly priced. Glenn's is a seafood house, but it has may other options. With a variety of different choices I will be sure to back to try something new. Cool trendy Chicago/east coast atmosphere. Check it out :)
