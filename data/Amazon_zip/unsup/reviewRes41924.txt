I've been going to the one in Northbrook for quite a while. Last Saturday night was my first time at the Dearborn location. Being a little worried about parking, I was thankful for the valet service. Inside the hostess was sweet. I was meeting some old friends for dinner and was first to arrive. I sat at the bar and found the bartender attentive and pleasant. We were quickly seated once everyone arrived. Our server was great, he met every need. We had several appetizers that were pretty good. I especially liked the crab cakes. My main meal was a New York Strip that was soooo goooood. I like the butter bath. The vegetable sides were also very good -- asparagus, au gratin potatoes, mushrooms. Just like the Northbrook location, I found Dearborn to be extremely satisfying. Total bill for five guys was around 500 bucks. I can't afford Ruth Chris on a nightly basis but it is worth an occasional splurge.
