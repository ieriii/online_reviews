OMG. Go here. As soon as possible. Crisp probably has helped me gain 10 pounds in the past year. But those are 10 pounds of love. Pure love. I love both the Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy, dig the buddha bowls, and if I'm feeling gluttonous, definitely go for the Seoul steak bowl. Their brown rice is FANTASTIC- the real thing- not just white rice fried with soy sauce in order to look brown. I love you Crisp!
