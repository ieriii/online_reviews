Oh, Crisp, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways... *Baby Buddha Bowl with Beef (if you like Bi Bim Bop, you'll LOVE this!) *Seoul Steak Bowl (so good it may make vegetarians think twice about their food choices) *Seoul Sensation Korean Burrito ("Koreans make burritos?" Oh YES they do!) *The Funke Chicken (Crisp BBQ and Seoul Sassy are my boo's faves) The location is small but what they lack in size, they make up for in flavor sensation... Their bulgogi is AHH-mazing -- tender, juicy, melt-in-your mouth good! Alison's Atomic Sauce has highly addictive qualities and if they sold it, I'd buy pallets of the stuff! Fun Fact: A variety of Korean and Asian specialty drinks in addition to an array of carbonated bevvies are offered.
