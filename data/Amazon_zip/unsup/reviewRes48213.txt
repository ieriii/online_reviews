Yum! We tried it all! The trout was amazing, the brussel sprouts, the beets, the ribs, the potee, the sweetbreads...all of it was just soo good! We had a reservation and were seated at a private table that was closed like a corral. Different, but nice to be at our own table. There were four of us and we all picked things to order and shared everything. Our waiter did an excellent job of pairing the dishes and bringing them out at just the right times. The cider we tried was excellent and I had a very nice beer as well. For dessert we split the waffle. This was just amazing! Light and crispy and soo good! Yum. It is pricey, but I think worth it. I can't wait to go back for brunch!
