Defintely my and my lady's favorite place in the city! Why go downtown and spend double, when you can have an awesome evening and a 5 course meal here?!?! The atmosphere is sweet...old school italian...dim lighting... Wednesday night is the BIG night as they have a Lobster special that is out of this world! For $25 you get a 5 course meal that concludes with the more savory Lobster tail you have ever had!!! I have since moved on to the Surf n Turf for $6 more which includes a nice center cut filet that is really good as well. Parking is simple on the street, or of course they have valet. Defitnely call ahead for reservations though, as the wait can be long if you just walk in.  I must admit....totally love the place and will be a fan forever! Great place in Old Irving that not a ton of people know about...
