The pizza comes in three-well four different styles. White-which has garlic and mozzarella, Red-which is the traditional tomato sauce and mozzarella; barbecue sauce can be substituted for the tomato sauce, and traditional-they claim they're primarily a Connecticut style pizza which has extra tomato sauce, garlic, parmesan and olive oil. I've had the white-which is terrific when I'm in the mood for a non-tomato-ey pizza and is very flavorful, and the red which is a good thin crust pie. Their home brews are pretty good and while it's a bit pricey-especially since their pizzas are all a la carte and they don't have set types-no meat lovers or veggie you order a type of pizza, size, and then add what toppings you want. The lunch pizzas are a pretty good value-and they serve it until five, the beer selection is pretty good with many brewed there. It's a good place to eat and grab a brew, if you're in the mood for a different type of pizza and pay a price for it. Oh, also they just started delivery service.
