5 people, peking duck plus 4 other dishes, the bill was $18 each with tip. No better dining deal than this in the area.  The peking duck is very good, even though at this point it is almost mechanical in the way it's served. Pretty much every table had the duck. The main draw, which is the steamed white buns with sliced duck meat and skin is just heavenly. The fried rice with duck is very good. The soup with the duck carcass is forgettable. Overall though, this is the best peking duck in Chicago. Even better than Chinatown. There are also a lot of off-the-menu dishes and specials. The specials are written on the glass walls surrounding the take out counter in the front. So unless you walk up there again after you are seated, it is easy to forget that there are specials. They also have a number of Filipino style dishes that are purely word of mouth. The lechon (roast pork) had the perfect combination of crispy crunchy skin, nice chewy fat, and meat. There is also pancit canton. Service is no frills. Which is to be expected at such an establishment.  Why 3 stars? For the quality and amount of food you get, at that kind of price point, it can't be beat. As i've mentioned, best peking duck in the area.
