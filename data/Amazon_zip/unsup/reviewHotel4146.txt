Visited Chicago Independence Day/Taste of Chicago weekend. Stay at the Hyatt for 3 ladies. Pros- Great rates are always available on Hotwire, Room are fairly large, queen size beds, modern decor, lobby is gorgeous! The staff was friendly, they don't go out of the way to speak to you, but when you ask them a question they are nice/helpful. Concierge gave us good recommendations. We were out in the city pretty much all day, so we didnt ask for much at the hotel, just towels, towels, and more towels. They were quick to bring up more. The 3rd day they brought us a ton of towels so we didnt need to call for more... lol. Quick check-out, clean rooms/bathroom. CONVENIENCE is the #1 reason to choose the hotel. Walking distance to Mag Mile, Grant/Millenium Parks, navy pier, Giordano's, CVS, connected to the downtown tunnel for quick meals. It was a block over from Michigan so we were close enough to get to everything yet away from the large crowds on the main strip. Cons - There was a pair of dirty socks left in the closet in plain sight, that the cleaning crew obviously missed... however the rest of the room was clean. There are NO refrigerators in the room. Only the mini-bar fridge and you're charged $$ for putting any items in it. I asked the front desk if they could bring a mini-fridge up to the room and she said "Yes, but there is a $25 fee to do so"...
