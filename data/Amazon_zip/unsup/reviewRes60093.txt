This is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a while!!!! The southern cuisine and ambiance brought a little Creole/French Quater to Chicago!  All the ingredients were fresh and all flavors complimented one another.  This effect is becoming scarcer in restaurants these days with failed attempts at "fusion" recipes. Sometimes we have to stick with staples and get back to the basics and stop reinventing the wheel. I definitely recommend my meal - Sorghum-Glazed Chicken. The meat was juicy - full of flavor, skin was crispy, grits were rich and creamy and the greens brought a light comfortable - smooth balance. I'll definitely be going back. Great job guys - keep up the good work!
