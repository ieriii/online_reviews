I read the reviews on yelp and decided to see if what was said about the wings was accurate. Wow, I have tried the plain wings; which by the way there is nothing plain about them. Things are the perfect texture, crispy outside without loads of breading and very well seasoned. If you order five wings it is more than enough b/c the wings are very large! Yummy! The best wings in Chicago at a great price. The best part is they deliver.
