This was a great find in downtown Chicago. Very good ambiance, welcoming service and very very tasty food. They served little pieces of freshly baked Nan (Indian Bread) in the basket with very delicious tomato soup (as a dip) in the beginning...Think like Chips and Salsa starter. This is not normal for an Indian place but I loved it very much. Good change and it tasted really good. Menu was little pricey, especially when I have to order rice separately ( generally all Indian recipes come with rice on the side) but the food quality was just great. I got Paneer Makhani as the main entree' - Paneer was fresh, soft and lightly seared on the pan, which really tells me it was done well. All in all good place. You should check out if you are in the downtown area. One advice for non-Indians - I smelled the dhoop (kind of fragrance stick) as I entered the restaurant, which is a common practice in India. I am used to it (the smell etc) but it could be little annoying for some - just a quick tip, but I dont think that should stop you from visiting and it could very well be just one time deal....worthy of my 4 stars!
