With some great food and beer I can see why this place has so much hype around it. I went on a Monday night with some friends, there was a large group of us but we didn't have to wait too long. Any wait wasn't a big deal to me since I was more then happy to hang out at the bar enjoying a fine craft beer. When we finally sat down I saw on the menu that they had bone marrow... something I had never tried before so I had to order it. I was glad to see some of the friends I was with wanted to try it too so we ordered a few orders of that. It was excellent, I have nothing to compare it to so it's hard to say how good it was. I just know I'll be ordering bone marrow again if I see it on the menu. Even better then the bone marrow was the wild boar sloppy joe with crispy sage, onion, and pickled jalapeo. For $11 I'd have to say its perfect! The one thing I did try that I wasn't a fan of was the veal sweatbread. I've had sweatbreads a number of times and this one just wasn't my favorite. With an outdoor patio and a great beer list I can see this being a happening spot for me in the summer.
