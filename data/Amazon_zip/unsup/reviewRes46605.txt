There is a small obsession with salad bars. Walking in, I was reminded of Eugene, Oregon, or the seventies, or my grandma's basement, or a bunch of hippies, or all of the above. The design and decor is stained wood, cramped spaces, and black and white photos of previous servers on the walls. While the salad bar was not crazy with all these options and flavors and exotic things, it was a super satisfying experience. You do get to try an assortment of items. From pasta and potato salads, to multiple veggies for your big salad, to soups and fruit, and my favorite, the chocolate chip cream cheese. It sounds weird, and it looks like a globby mess. But it tastes exactly like a rich rich piece of cheesecake that has gotten soft. The raspberries were the freshest I've tasted all season, and the watermelon was juicy and ripe.
