I came here for a private party which was a plus since we were able to get a table and they had free drinks. It's a little odd that the free drink was Hypnotiq but hey, it tastes like Kool-Aid, so I couldn't complain about that. The decor was cool, but I just know this is the kind of place I would never come on my own. This is more the kind of place where I'd lurk around making snotty comments under my breath Ghost World style.
