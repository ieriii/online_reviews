This place is stunning! I love the detail inside from the dining area to the bathrooms and to the flying wine lady. If you are a carnivore, this is the spot for you. In addition, they have a huge salad bar with so many exotic salads, soups, cheeses and seafood. The drinks are good too! I love the lobster bisque it was so delish! You should definitely starve yourself for a week before you come here because I got full after my second plate or be sure to flip your card red side down!
