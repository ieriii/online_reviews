THE CAST OF CHARACTERS: One father, one mother, one 3-year-old, one newbornTHE VENUE: Very classy marblemania Vegas style. Beats out the Tropicana Atlantic City buffet hands down. Parents take head--the place has enough ambient noise to drown out your kids, ensuring enough of a buffer for other diners. There's outdoor seating too, with heat lamps. A plus.THE WAIT SERVICE: Friendly, efficient and not overly solicitous. I give our waiter -1 for not presenting the option of a kids menu unsolicited.THE FOOD: I'm a pig so most food tastes good to me, but I give this joint a solid B+ for taste. We ordered:-Edamame for appetizer: perfectly cooked and not soggy like at most places; seasoned with some kind of soy sauce mix that gave it an interesting and yummy twist; pretty addictive, and even the 3-year-old was digging it-Pasta Carbonara for entree: soooo good and bad for you at the same time; not too creamy and quite buttery; perfectly seasoned; worth shaving off a couple of years off your life-Chili for entree: hearty with lots of meat, including luscious ribs; just a tad too salty, but it did come with a crumbly and sweet corn muffin that balanced it out a bit-Chicken fingers off kids menu: well-prepared if a bit bland, but it's for kids so the low-sodium is appreciated; the 3-year-old liked it well enough; but the star of the show are the shoestring fries, which we enjoyed on behalf of the 3-year old--wowsers!!THE PRICE: I think most of the entrees are in the teens so this place is a great great value for the calibre of food and nice-ness of the placeTHE VERDICT: We're gonna be regulars!
