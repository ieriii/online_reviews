We have been to Wildfire a number of times in the suburbs and love it. This one is also awesome. We had reservations for 8 and arrived at 7:30. The bartender was awesome; made my husband's martini exactly the way he likes it. I couldnt decide which wine to get so he let me sample both. We were seated for dinner promptly. Our waitress was attentive but not overly so. She let us take our time ordering our dinner. My husband always goes off the menu a bit. He ordered the prime rib, but wanted it seared with one of their signature crusts on it. She took his order without pause and said no problem. The spinach salad and calamari was great. Our steaks were great. Suggested wine was also great.
