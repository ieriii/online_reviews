It's not as much about the food as the atmosphere here, and your tastes in this area are likely based on whether you're a parent or not... I fall into the former category, so the best thing for me about WIshbone is that it's one of the few restaurants in the city where I know people won't give me the stink eye for bringing our one year old in for a bite. She enjoys scoping out the other kids, flirts with the waitstaff, and my husband and I get to order some semi-sophisticated comfort food and split the pancake special for desert. I love trying their specials- they're inventive, and somehow seem more healthy than some places (heh-hem, IHOP.)  Service is pretty good, decor is entertaining, food is always good and not stuff you'll find readily available.  Just don't go expecting a very sedate, quiet experience- and ask for ketchup for the home fries ahead of time.
