My mom and I used to be on a hunt for the best caesar salad and Wilde has it...grilled lettuce stalks that you have to actually used a knife and fork to cut. Nothing like I've ever seen or tasted in a salad... I highly recommend getting it with steak or salmon. Not to mention that music... Just tell Brian J to put his ipod on!
