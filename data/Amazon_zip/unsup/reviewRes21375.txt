We hit xoco for breakfast a few weeks ago and were very pleased. The hot chocoloate is superb and the food was delicious, no doubt. The service was fast but it felt pretty non-special: you wait in line order your food, then they will walk it to your table. But you need to get your own water and drinks. The place is small, however, and seating is limited. I liked it a lot and want to try Mr. Bayless' other places, but I had the strange feeling that we had kind of lost sight of something while we were there: we were paying moderately high prices to sort of "simulate" authentic Mexican food... we realized we could walk over to a ton of wonderful Chicago restaurants that were really authentic for only a fraction of the price! But it is really nice and the quality is excellent, so that is of course a big part of what you are paying for. I'd go back and was very happy overall.
