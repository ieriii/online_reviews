Stopped for recent take out while in town for a conf. First, was impressed by the quality take out options which definitely were a step up on the usual fare (I had work to do at my hotel). I got the chicken and pozole soup, which was fairly flavorful. I wish it had been a bit spicier, but it came with all the side items needed to put it together. It was not a huge meal, but I was not hungry afterwards. I also had a churro for a dessert and it was the best churro I have ever had. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was just really really good. I even debated going back another night or day just for the churros. Definitely a recommended take out spot if in the area.
