My parents found this by watching some Food Network show and wanted to come when they were in town. When they suggested a diner I thought I was going to have a heart attack - really, you come to Chicago and you want to go to a diner?! We've gone twice now. First of all, my family and I LOVE fish. I love the uniqueness that whatever they have, they may run out by the end of the night. We usually still come for 8:30 or 9pm dinners anyway and find good food. They have so many kinds of fish and usually do prepare them uniquely. I have enjoyed cat fish, scallops and a few other kinds of fish when coming here. I think it's usually made with almost a southern or comfort food style which is always good for my family. I don't think you should come here if you are on a diet. The BYOB policy is a huge hit with my mom and I. The portions are great, the price is very reasonable. The ambiance is fun with the chalkboards and cereal boxes everywhere. I have seen kids in here and enjoying the food. There are only a few tables so we usually try to have reservations. The tables are almost on top of each other and we've usually ended up talking to the other people dining due to that. Usually, people coming here are just trying to unwind and get some good food. I love that it's not pretentious in any way. The staff is fun, laid back and super nice.
