Food is always very fresh. They say everything is organic here. I am very impressed by this brunch place especially when I don't like a lot of other brunch places in Chicago like Yolk, Bongo Room, etc.  However, Nana is a very unique brunch place. Nothing in the menu has disappointed me yet. I am giving it 1 less star because prices are higher than other brunch places.
