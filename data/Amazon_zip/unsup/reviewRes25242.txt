Pequods is for people who want excessive amounts of BREAD and very little flavor. We ordered a $28 deep dish pizza and received barely ANY toppings on top of 2 INCH thick bread. literally 98% bread and the rest sauce and toppings. TINY bit of cheese, TINY bit of sauce, and almost no toppings. How nasty. If you want a $30 PIZZA BREAD order pequods. Completely disgusting. Waste of money.
