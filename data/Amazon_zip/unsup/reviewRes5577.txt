Fantastic food, if you can get in. We had quite a few items on the menu.. the smears were great. Also the beet/goat cheese dish is fantastic. I rarely order beets, but this dish might have changed that for me. The wine list is extensive and our waitress was extremely knowledgeable. The only downside is it fills up quick. We went at 3pm on a sat and already the wait for dinner was 1.5 hrs. The good thing is they will take your cell phone number and you can shop or get drinks somewhere else until you are ready.
