I've been a regular here and like the butcher shop & the guys that work there and the prepared foods. However the cafe has gone downhill.  On a recent visit well after the lunch hour the garbage bins were overflowing, there were no condiments and they also did not have plastic forks.  Watched a staffer just keep pressing down the garbage in the overflowing bin instead of throwing it all out.  No excuse given the time, it was very slow.
