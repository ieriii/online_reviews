I like Hot Doug's a lot, but the only reason I can't give them five stars is because some of their sausages I've tried aren't quite the freshest. I have a very sensistive sense of taste, and when meat is not quite fresh, I have a hard time eating it where others might notice nothing.  I don't remember which sausages aren't the freshest exactly, but it seems to me it's the specialty items, the ones that are probably frozen a long time.  I always order the bratwurst because it seemed to be fresh to me.  The brats are delicious, and the toppings are terrific as well. I can't rave about the duck fries however. They come out too dark and overcooked for my taste.
