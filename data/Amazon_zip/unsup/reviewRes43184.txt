This is one of those eco-friendly, staffed by uber-hipsters, safe-for-vegetarian options. This sentence along makes me sound like a member of the crunchy unwashed, but this neighborhood has gone upmarket, so it's actually full of moms with $1000 strollers talking about cruises. Whatever. The food was delicious. You order and pay for your food at the counter, take a number, and it's brought to your table. I had a crab cake sandwich on a soft baguette, with some house-made potato chips and a pickle on the side. It was very good, and there were a dozen other things on the menu I'd have eaten.
