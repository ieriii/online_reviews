This place makes you feel like you walked into your family's house for Sunday dinner. I am Vietnamese and moved here two years ago so the first time I went here I was looking for a friendly neighborhood joint with good Viet food. Mission accomplished. Uncle Tuan, the owner, immediately bonded with my parents (in town visiting) and treated us like part of his family. The service was fantastic, BYOB is always a plus, and the food... the food is GOOD. There's something for everyone and each dish is different. Some very authentic Viet dishes. I'll say this... when my parents loved this place SO MUCH that when they came for a visit a year later they insisted on coming back to Simply It for another meal. Uncle Tuan remembered them and gave me a hard time about why I hadn't been back more often!! That's what this place is all about. So go! Enjoy the food! Cute atmosphere! Become a regular!
