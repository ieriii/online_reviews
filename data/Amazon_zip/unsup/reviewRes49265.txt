I stopped in here after an across the street visit to Angels and Mariachis. Their cupcake frosting is good, but the rest of the cupcake wasn't too great. Their pecan bars were soft and chewy, mmmm. They have some interesting croissants with different fillings which was neat. Not the best bakery I've visited or come across, but not bad either. Just average. I just checked out the bakery and nothing else, so I can't rate on it more than that.
