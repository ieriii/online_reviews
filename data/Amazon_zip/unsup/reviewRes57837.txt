Nana is terrific! Local, organic, intelligent, delicious fare--far better and more imaginative than the similarly themed Nightwood a few blocks north in Pilsen. As a guide, Nana rivals Lula Cafe in terms of creativity and organic/local. I've had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner there (I live in Bridgeport) and can vouch for the quality and innovation-factor of each meal. Lately they've also been concocting some terrific seasonal cocktails. We love going and chatting with Nana herself. This place was created by two of her sons--both smart, savvy chefs-- and you can generally find the rest of the family there as well. This is a Bridgeport family who saw the opportunity to improve the culinary offerings of the neighborhood and have done so with taste and style, while maintaining an atmosphere of welcome and warmth. I should also mention that Nana is not only kid-friendly, but kid-nutricious. They have a fantastic kids menu that is yummy, healthy and simply delicious. Often I'll avoid taking the family out because my home cooking is far healthier than the standard fare of chicken strips, mac and cheese, etc. But I am confident when I take the family to Nana that my kids will get a smart, good meal and my kids LOVE Nana's food!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's just a wee bit pricey. Not over-priced like, for example, Nightwood--but spendy enough to make it tricky to go regularly as a family. Nonetheless, if you live nearby GO. If not, make the trip!
