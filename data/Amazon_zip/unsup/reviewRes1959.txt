This place is dangerous because I work right across the street. My coworkers and I will periodically check the line outside, and when the line isn't out the door and around the corner (most of the time it will be, rain, shine, snow, frigid temperatures, whatever) we quickly dash over to grab some delicious gourmet hot dogs, and (if it's a Friday) duck fat fries! They have the usual fare as well (corn dogs, Chicago Hot Dog) but what you REALLY want to try are the specials, which are rotated around every few weeks or so. I have yet to try everything on the menu (I tend to stay away from the spicy), but usually I'll go for some sort of meat sausage with fruit and cheese. DELICIOUS. Oh and the foie gras dog (made famous by Bourdain's TV show) is great as well. I've been coming here for three years. Doug himself will greet you to take your order every single time and he's a great, charismatic guy! Make sure you check the site before you go, both to decide what you want to order, and to make sure he's not on vacation. They'll take random vacations around the year and the restaurant will be closed during that time.
