I stayed at this W with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed it. The location was perfect for us. There was a lot within walking distance, and almost everything was within a short cab ride. The hotel itself was really nice. We went to the hotel bar a few times, which has a nice, quite atmosphere. We used their free Acura car service on multiple occasions. Our room was small, and we were right above a train, but the room was very clean and modern. I would definitely stay here again.
