Things you may or may not be overwhelmed by while dining at Ruth's Chris: - the smell of butter wafting everywhere when your meaty entrees arrive - the number and amount of waitstaff walking back and forth, to and fro, here and there in the dining area. It's kind of distracting. - the mood lighting. Expect it to be dim. - the temperature of the plate your hunk o' meat is served on. 500 degrees! Yowza! The restaurant week menu was a fantastic deal. My tummy left happy after a feast of seafood gumbo, an 8oz filet, and chocolate mousse dessert. Add a refreshing orange citrus mojito on top of that. Let it be said that I left more than just full. I was stuffed and satiated. Impeccable service and stellar food!
