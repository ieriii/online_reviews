Still one of my favorite bars! I am getting into beer lately and I love the variety. I also love that you can see what alcohol percent each beer has. So, I was only 19% drunk on Friday... It really is fun looking at the the beer menu and making random decisions. You could go there every day and still not have tried every beer! I have always been obsessed with their mussels. This time I was a bit disappointed. The mussels were tiny and it didn't seem that they were drenched enough in the broth. But the broth was still good, especially good to drench the bread in. Also tried a couple of other apps/entrees and, as usually it was tasty food. I need to make it a monthly outing to go to Hopleaf.
