I'm sure nothing I'm going to say is a shock--but to sum it up, for the prices they charge, this place could do a lot better. I am a meat eater. I previously was vegetarian. I do not need to eat meat more than a couple of times a week, so I don't need to eat mediocre meat analogues. I guess what I'm trying to say is would it kill this place to make a truly adventurous curry or stir fry dish? One with spices and vegetables that really pop? It seems like they could do better. My black bean burger was almost inedibly spicy--and I'm not a spice wuss, I just would have wished for the black bean flavor to comingle and not be overruled by the spice. Add some limp, cold sweet potato fries and you have...something less than delicious. Just saying. The side of steamed broccoli I ate was way better than the bean burger. Maybe I could order a broccoli burger. The chocolate orange bread pudding was delicious, though.  Service was fine.  This place is just ok.  Not horrible. Not particularly somewhere I'm dying to go. I don't have it in me to spend $7 on a shake, so the purportedly divine choco peanut butter shake will have to wait until I stop pinching pennies.  I guess
