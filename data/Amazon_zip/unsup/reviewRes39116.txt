My friends took me here on a Friday night - and we had such a great dinner. 5 of us at, like 7 or 8pm, and didn't have to wait for a table - which was awesome. All the food was yummy - the little sides are so fun to try. For meat, we got the Wang Kal Bi marinated short beef ribs), the Dai Ji Kal bi (marinated pork rib), and the Bul Ko Ki (korean style seasoned beef). All de-lish!  And the best? The seafood pancake - Hae Moul Pajun - so good! And that's all Yelp, because honestly, I would never have ordered it on my own, but so many people had Yelp-ed about it, that I had to... And we LOVED it. Soooooo good. Great great dinner.  (i'm seeing lots of rude service comments from other people on here... we experienced that with our server at first, but she quickly gave someone else our table, so it was fine - and in hindsight, we think it was just that she didn't speak enough english to wait on us. Our second lady was great!) Oh, warning: since there are mini-grills at EACH table, there's a lot of cooking smoke/oil throughout the place - you and your clothes will smell like food when you leave. We proactively left our coats in the car, and I was glad for it.
