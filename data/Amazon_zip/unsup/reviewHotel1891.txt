I came here for a wedding show and while I was waiting in the lobby for my boyfriend to pick me up I noticed that they don't have any plugs for people to use their laptops or to charge up their cell phones in their lounge area. I also have a problem with the fact that their bathrooms were nasty and smelled like a million unwashed &^%$#es and could be better maintained in terms of cleanliness. I am a huge stickler when it comes to nasty stinky bathrooms. It's a nice hotel just needs to be on top of keeping their bathrooms cleaner. I've gone to hotels where the bathrooms are so clean you can walk around barefoot in them. If they just have an area for those who want to charge their cell phones and use their laptops in the lounge area put some plugs in. Overall it's a nice hotel to attend a show or just staying there if you're on vacation or coming for buisness.
