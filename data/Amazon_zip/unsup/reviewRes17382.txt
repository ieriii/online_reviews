I brought my husband here for a surprise birthday party a couple years back and liked it so much that we brought my parents out for a special event later on. The service here is great, especially when I compare it to the terrible time we had at Gaylord's nearby. The food is delicious, and the menu is chocked full of loads of different dishes to try out. While the cost does add up (I swear there are no good, cheap, non-buffet Indian places to be had - please prove me wrong!), I feel like this is the kind of place where it's best to come with a bit of a group so that you can share dishes around, family style, and try out many different things.
