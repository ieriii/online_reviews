I came in with a party of around 20 people. Almost all got the duck three ways. This means duck sandwiches, duck bone soup and duck rice or noodles. Everyone seemed to love it. I tried a bao with just the veggies and sauce and it was actually pretty good even minus the duck. That sauce is wonderful. Three of us ordered vegetarian entrees. I got the veggie fried rice, which was fine. Rick got the tofu and mushrooms. This was much better, although the tofu was a little too moist. It watered when you bit into it. I really like how loud and bustling this place is, full of families and servers running around like mad. Recommended for duck lovers and for those who like to watch dead things get cut up tableside.
