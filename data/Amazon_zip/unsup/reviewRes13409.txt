First of all, i'm a sucker for milk stouts. And their Very Mad Cow milk stout that's aged in Woodford Reserve bourbon barrels hits the spot.   Other than the beer, when i first heard about the bacon-fat popcorn, i was all up for trying this place out. The popcorn wasn't as good as i expected (maybe too much expectation) but wasn't bad. The Flemish Beef Stew was pretty awesome and looking at the other dishes that were being served, i'll be back to try some more. Just gotta somehow make room with all the good beer.
