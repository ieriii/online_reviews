I live around the corner and have always gone to Wilde for just drinks. But, my mom was in town this past week and we went there on Friday night for dinner. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but it was worth it. My mom had the chicken curry and I had the roasted chicken. The portions were large and the food was great. I'll definitely go back...
