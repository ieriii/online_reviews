Pasta Bowl is by far my favorite Italian place in the area. I live not too far away which makes it even more to my liking but honestly....the food is delicious always hot, fresh and made to order. the restaurant itself is a little small but it has great atmosphere and you never find yourself waiting too long for a table. overall i say head over to this place and check it out...i bet you wont be dissapointed!
