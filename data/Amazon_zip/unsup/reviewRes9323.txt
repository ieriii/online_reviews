I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. The owner was gracious and friendly, and welcomed us and seated our party by the decoration pieces in the back. The paneer slices as well as the fresh lettuce and radishes were brought out with their hot baked pita bread to start off (you can always ask for more!) - the paneer cheese slices are quite strong, and the Persian's version of feta cheese - a little amount goes the long way, they say, but I prefer just chomping it all down. To start off with, we ordered the Moosir and the Caspian Eggplant. The Moosir is a tangy yogurt that could be eaten with the pita bread as a dip. The Caspian Eggplant was a bland version of a baba ghanouj - there is supposed to be a hint of shallot, but I couldn't taste it, and it was kind of boring. For the entree, I had the Chenjeh and the Koubideh plate that came with half of the white Persian rice, and half of the Dill rice (I preferred the white Persian rice), grilled tomato slices, as well as two types of beef - one skewer of Choice Rib Eye and a skewer of ground sirloin. The Rib Eye was interesting, but a weird soft texture - I wasn't sure if I was digging that - the ground sirloin was butter, since it just tasted like a meatball. One good friend had a Joujeh dish, which was like a chicken kabab dish without the skewers, and that was grilled and seasoned perfectly - I would have gotten this dish, without the rice, and I would have been a happy camper. Dessert was the Boumieh as well as the Baklava - the boumieh was overly sweet, and tasted like an overly fried donut that had no ounce of bread in it. The baklava was also overly sweet, and I chose to eat only the outermost top layer of it. While the service was great and the owner was an awesome man, the food was just alright. If I was forced to come back, I would get the Joujeh. Parking is a tight squeeze by the side of the restaurant, but hey, it's free! There's also a carry-out location right next door.
