AVOID. AVOID. Good god. My boyfriend and I had a terrible experience here. His review really covers it (John M) but I was so disappointed in the sandwich when it finally showed up, approximately 132 hours after we ordered it, that I felt compelled to throw in my two cents. I was so looking forward to the yellow of the egg bursting under my first bite, but no-- it was WAY overcooked. And the pork belly might have been could had I been able to taste it under all that bread. The pickled onions were good. But when pickled onions are the highlight of your overpriced sandwich, you know you're in trouble. And the service was so, so bad-- the waitress was nice, but she had clearly f'd up and then never owned up to it. I would have been fine with the wait had she simply said, "I'm so sorry, I promise it's coming soon," but nope. She acted as if it was normal to wait over an hour for a cheeseburger and BLT and never checked on us. I can deal with mediocre food if the service is good, and vice versa, but the only thing going for this place is that the ceiling was cool-- it was planked wood. So if you enjoy pickled onions and musing over things like "I wonder if I could install that kind of ceiling in my living room" by all means try this place. Otherwise, steer clear.
