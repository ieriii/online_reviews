To say that the service was horrible the last 3 times we have been to Calo would be an understatement. The wait staff is incredibly unattentive. Our waitress (Daisy) greeted us after about 5 minutes and took our drink orders. I was optimistic that we wouldnt have a repeat of our last experience where we waited so long for the waitress to come by with refills, that I finally went and retrieved them myself from the bar. That was several months prior and we had hoped the service had improved. Unfortunately that was not the case. Once she had taken our entree order, we didnt see or hear from her until we asked (one of the other wait staff mind you) for our bill. Only then did she ask how everything was. If your looking for good Italian AND a responsive wait staff, I would skip Calo and take a gamble on any other place in the area.
