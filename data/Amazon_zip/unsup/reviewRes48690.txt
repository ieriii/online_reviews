AMAZING! Simply superb. A friend and I split the taste of three ham platter, frites, spicy pork rinds and the beef sirloin. It was plenty for the both of us. The pork rinds were meh, I could take them or leave them. The fries came with truffle butter sauce which is never a bad thing. The meats were what really sang though, they were out of this world delicious. I've never had ham or beef that tasted so purely wonderful and decadent. A bit of a splurge but so worth it. The communal dining was okay for the two of us but with more, I think it would be awkward. Service was meh but it was busy and once the food started coming, I didn't care. Make no doubt about it--go here. It's fantastic.
