Awesome! I've been about five times and it has definitely become a favorite restaurant of mine. My frequent visits have afforded me the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and they are all delicious! My favorites are the steak tartar, bone marrow, fries with aioli, pot roast, brussel sprouts, mushroom and truffle pasta, lemon meringue pie, chocolate cream pie, and the coconut mocha cream pie which is probably the most delicious dessert I've ever had!
