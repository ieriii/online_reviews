I love Piece! I have been eating here for years but have been too busy tweeting about them to give them a proper review. The pizza and hand crafted beer is always a treat and a party in your tummy!! Also on Sundays you can get a large pizza and a growler of beer for $25...A-MAZE. If you get a chance to meet the owner, he is pretty rockin too!
