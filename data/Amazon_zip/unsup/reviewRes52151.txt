5:15 pm. 5 minute wait standing in line outside, 5 minute wait sitting down inside. Signs proclaiming "Anti-graffiti zone" are hung outside the front entrance and the restrooms, yet the walls everywhere are festooned with words scrawled in white paint stick and black sharpie. Makes you wonder why so many patrons would bring white paint sticks to dinner, and then to seriously doubt that the words were written by actual customers. Gino's East seems to be teeming with waitstaff and hosts, but the service was still a little on the slow side. Three of us shared a medium deep dish Cheese & Spinach pizza, and ordered a pitcher of Pilsner Urquell to enjoy during the 45-minute wait. Let me just say right off the bat - the beer selection here is terrible. Bud Light, Miller Light, Budweiser, some other boring stuff, Pilsner Urquell. Our server told us this short list of beers when we asked for a drinks menu, and the Pilsner was the only thing halfway decent to order. The price? $17. For one pitcher. Unfortunately we ordered two by the end of dinner. And it wasn't even that good! (Bad batch?) The pizza was also expensive - over $20 for the medium deep dish - and it was a bit of a letdown. The cheese was a bit "chalky", in the words of my friend, and the sauce, spinach, and crust weren't particularly flavorful. It was substandard, especially considering the price. The three of us were definitely full by the end of it, though. In the end, after tip, the three of us each paid $25. That buys you two slices of deep dish and about 3 beers. Next time I'll know better, and go somewhere else.
