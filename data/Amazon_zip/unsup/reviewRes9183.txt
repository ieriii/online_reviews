For starters, Le Colonial is visually beautiful.... the exotic decor immediately transports you out of Chicago and away to somewhere fabulous. Huge palm trees, bamboo wood, orchids... it feels like a vacation directly to the French-Vietnamese land they're trying to channel - take a look at the pics online and you'll see what I mean. The upstairs bar is dark, elegant and perfect for romantic cocktails pre or post dinner. They are open for lunch and dinner - both being equally delicious!! You can't go wrong with any of the dishes... but my personal favs are: the Goi Cuon (shrimp and vermicelli rolls w/ plum peanut sauce), the Banh Cuon (chicken and mushroom ravioli w/ lime garlic sauce), the Goi Bo (spicy beef salad) and Ga Xao Cari (sauteed diced chicken with eggplant, mango, string beans and cashew nuts in a yellow curry sauce). YUM and YUM!!! But really, everything on the menu is this delectable. Le Colonial is one of my fav spots in Chicago and clearly for good reason... it also doesn't hurt for us night owls that it's jointly owned with Le Passage right next door...
