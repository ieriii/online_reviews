My son wanted to eat deep dish pizza when we visited Chicago. Our hotel recommended Gino's East. We ordered their large cheese deep dish pizza to go and our whole family agreed - it was disgusting. The cheese was partially melted, still in layers. The crust tasted like desiccated white bread with yellow food coloring. Even Pizzaria Uno is better. My son usually eats four slices and even though he was very hungry at the time he couldn't bring himself to finish his second slice of Gino's East. Bottom line: Gino's East is a localized version of TGI Fridays. If you like TGI Fridays, you might like Gino's East but you would probably like a real TGI Fridays better. And if you don't like TGI Fridays, you aren't going to like Gino's East unless you're drunk.
