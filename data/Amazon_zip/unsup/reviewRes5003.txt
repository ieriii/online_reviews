Yay! I love the Purple Pig! I hate pork, for the most part, so I was a little skeptical about coming here at first. But I have to say, absolutely everything I ate was amazing!! It was perfect for a nice lunch with a friend where we were able to share 4 different items. We ordered fried brussel sprouts which were not at all what I expected, tangy, crunchy, and overall amazing. I also highly recommend the Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta smear. I'm not sure what's in it but my mouth is watering right now thinking about it. And don't leave the Purple Pig without trying the Sicilian Iris, their amazing donut-filled dessert, it was like a piece of heaven in my mouth. If I could go back and change anything I would not have shared the Sicilian Iris but rather would have gotten a whole one for myself.
