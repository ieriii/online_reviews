Food, Service, Atmosphere = AMAZING My family and I went here for my sister's 25th birthday and we could not have picked a better place. The food was delicious and came out at a perfect pace. My family ordered and shared the hot appetizer of Octopus (brilliant), tzatzkiki, tirokefteri, saganaki, and feta. For dinner I tasted the Calamari which was cooked (or fried) to the most perfect point. I could chew it and enjoy it and just be really happy at the same time. It came with my favorite... rice! I would recommend trying the Mediterranean Chicken as well. You guys, I left Greek Islands with a huge smile, reasonable bill, and very full tummy. I want to do a dance every time I think about how great the experience was. Yipppeee
