Our room was lovely and the view was fantastic. Hotel concierge was suave and the staff was very nice, although at times a bit over-accommodating (they checked on us about three times in our room following check in). The bar has a great view as well but the restaurant Italiasia is not good at all, blah-don't go. (It was a reminder that there are far too many great places to eat in Chicago than to settle for the hotel restaurant). Friendly staff, clean room, great view, great location, good price.
