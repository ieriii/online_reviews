The marrow with sea salt on toast was good (but that's a gimme... seriously, how do you mess up roasting bone marrow?). A friend sings the praises of their meatballs, which were average at best. They had a home made pasta dish with wild mushrooms, cream and drizzled with truffle oil. This dish was a 5 for me, but again, yum, cream, butter, and truffle oil will save a bowl of rocks. Roasted brussels sprouts were weak. Mushy and overcooked, which is the achilles heel of brussels sprouts. In fairness, its not easy to keep sprouts around in a busy kitchen, be able to quickly fire them to temp and get them to a table without having them constantly cooking. But then again, if you can't manage it, it probably doesn't belong on your menu. Basically everything that was good had little to do with the kitchen. Execution points were pretty low, but hey, butter and truffle scent will save a lot of dishes, so 4 stars for taste!
