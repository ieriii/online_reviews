Lunch Specials are very nicely priced. My wife and I love coming here on Friday nights. The clay pot chicken, avocado chicken, and plum tea are our favorite dishes! The service is attentive and pleasant. The owners are friendly and always looking to please. I recommend this spot, especially if you work @ Children's Memorial.
