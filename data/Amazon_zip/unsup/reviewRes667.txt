What else can be said about Alinea? The whole experience was gorgeous, theatrical, exciting, surprising, etc, and on and on. Service was formal without being overly stuffy (for the most part), and the food was as delicious as I've heard it is. My only complaint: for the second to last course, every table around us got Grant Achatz paining on their table cloth with chocolate and coconut, but we were only given a normal presentation of mousse on plates and no Achatz. Why? Maybe because one of my dining companions was asking a lot of questions during the meal and the didn't want him distracting the chef? Who knows. Still, it was a fabulous experience. The Earl Grey dessert course kind of blew my mind.
