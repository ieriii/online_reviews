Took my lady here for her birthday after reading these reviews and seeing a bit on WGN TV about this place. Must say, this place has the best gnocchi I have ever had. My girlfriend ordered the gnocchi special and asked to have it fixed with oil and garlic only, no sauce. The staff was more than accomodating with her request. I ordered the penne with meatballs and sausage and it was excellent. Like mentioned in other reviews, we brought home plenty of left overs for another meal.  You also can never go wrong with a BYO place that doesn't charge for a corking fee. I am bringing out of towners, family, and friends back to this place with me!
