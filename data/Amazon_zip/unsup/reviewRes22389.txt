The oatmeal shake alone is worth the visit. It's just that tasty. And that you can swap the dairy for soy is appreciated by this lactose-intolerant patron. Went here for an early dinner with my folks. I saw early dinner, I am talking barely 5p. They are seniors. There was no wait, the service was swift and the food came out quickly. Perhaps as there were only a small handful of us in the restaurant that early. My father, being a fan of Puerto Rican food, kept pointing out the very stark similarity of this menu to his favourite haunts. I couldn't tell you what makes a place distinctly Puerto Rican or Cost Rican, having such little exposure to the latter, but I must admit I had a difficult time differentiating. Whether that makes this place any less distinct or authentic is no matter, the food is delicious either way. The meat is perfectly marinated and grilled, the plaintains fried to perfection, the beans and rice as tasty. The meal for three, including dessert, came in under $60. Total bargain! Will definitely be dining with them again, especially as I learned they offer takeaway. Perfect in the winter months, when you cannot appreciate their outdoor dining.
