This place is lucky to get 3 stars from me...seriously. PROS: good coffee, and good espresso drinks. really fun looking cakes. and they give away free dog bones---which is great if you're a dog. finally, the raspberry scone I had was really good. CONS: This place annoys the crap out of me. I can't figure out if I have bad luck when I go in there, or if my annoyance meter is weekening, because everyone else seems to love it. I go here when I have to because I refuse to walk into Starbucks...but EVERY time I do, some kid is behind the counter who seems to have half his/her brain cells in tact. I know that's harsh, but when the music is so loud they have to keep asking customers what they want there's just one option left to fix the problem (since they're already shouting): TURN DOWN THE ABSTRACT NOISE ROCK! note to barista: if a customer asks you: "What's a soy (something-or-other)?" Don't tell her: "I don't drink soy." That's not what she's asking. lastly, if they're going to charge $1++ for a small cookie, they better make damn well sure it's fresh.
