Definitely have had better. The food was rather mediocre. My noodle dish was really rather one dimensional: the beef was rather scant and the vegetables were raw (not al dente, RAW). The flavor was also pretty bad. I can't put my finger on it - it just seems like it was lacking something. The pot stickers were deep fried and kind of doughy. And our curry dish was rather small and consisted of only chicken and potatoes - nothing else. There are so many better Thai places than this...
