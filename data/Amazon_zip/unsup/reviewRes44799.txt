I'm an East Coast girl, so I stick true to my roots -- Brooklyn-style pizza will always be #1 in my heart. But for now, I'm loving deep dish, especially from Giordano's. The sauce, the crust, the variety of toppings...it all comes together in one delicious, mozzarella-stringing piece. I always take my out-of-town friends to taste what REAL deep dish is like (Uno's is the biggest disappointment in your life, kind of like not getting the dog you wished you had). Food's great, so are the prices. I know this is a touristy location -- but I'm okay with paying whoever much for a deep dish since more ingredients are thrown in...so it's pretty reasonable altogether. Biggest gripe? The service! I was here last Thursday with some friends, and we barely saw our waiter. We saw more of the busboy giving us our drinks, pizza, and cleaning up after us. And, when we tried to pick up the check, our waiter said, word by word, "Just wait a second" and gave us the hand in the rudest manner ever. Seriously? Come here for the food, but definitely not the service.
