Holy hot oil batman, this place is fun! Well fun if you enjoy stabbing things with skewers and submerging them in a boiling bath of cheese, oil or chocolate. If you're one of those that prefer to have a hands off approach to dining, the novelty of all of that may be lost on you.  Did the 3 course cheese, meat / veggies (chicken) and chocolate meal and it was very tasty. Fun to dip into the variety of sauces too. For those trying to decide between just the cheese / chocolate and the meat menu, I say go for the full thing. It's worth the extra money you would spend from the difference anyway. We skipped the wine but they had an extensive list. Service was very nice. In fact perhaps a little too nice as our server and her 'partner' checked in with our table once every 3 minutes or so. Perhaps that was due to my overly voracious approach in stabbing and torching my dinner? (Let's not rule that out)... Cheese was very good, chocolate was pretty good. They seemed to add some agent that kept the flaming chocolate from thickening, which gave the texture an oily like sheen and film. Didn't really change the taste but made me wonder what exactly I was eating...(as thinning agents are rarely associated with edible compounds) Overall a good time. But look out for those prices! A wee bit steep.
