Went here for brunch last Sunday during the time I was on antibiotics. So throughout my meal, I felt like throwing up. But the food was pretty tasty. For a small appetizer, they give you these pastry dough things with powdered sugar on top and they were amazing. I could've eaten that as my meal and I would have been happy, but I didn't. Instead, I ordered their shrimp and biscuits covered with jambalaya sauce and it was pretty good, although I've got to admit that A Taste of Heaven's Jambalaya dish was so much better. My mom ordered a dish that consisted of eggs, hashbrowns, and crawfish cakes, which were excellent. My aunt ordered some kind of intimidating sandwich....but i didn't taste hers. The restaurant has great ambience, the waiters were friendly, but the music brought back bad memories of a hick roommate I once had...she constantly listened to those same songs. Although things are a bit on the pricey side, Big Jones makes a wonderful new addition to Andersonville....I will probably be returning to experience their dinner menu.
