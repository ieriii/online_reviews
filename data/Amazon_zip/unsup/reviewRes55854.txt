Although I've only had Indian food a handful of times, the food was delicious. I do not really know what I ate, but I would highly recommend sampling small portions of food. Luckily, I went with a friend so I was able to be guided through their different selections. The buffet is not the cheapest, but I thought the quality was more than fair so I had no objection to it. The service was more than decent. One highlight was the guy who refilled my water. I made a mess with their mango ice cream (?) because at the time I served myself, it was already melting and overfilled my cup. I got it all over my hands and it made my hands orange. He was really nice and brought me more napkins. I would definitely go again.
