I believe that Food and Service are two key ingredients (no pun intended) for a great restaurant experience. Peace lacks in both areas especially the service part. I have been there twice now. The first time we were seated we asked if could order a large pizza w/ 1/2 covered whatever my friend wanted and the other what I wanted. They said not a problem. I asked if we would be charged for half the topping price...and the waiter snapped at me and said he didnt' make the rules. I said ok and we proceeded to order. When we got our pizza it was quite soggy and the toppings were falling off the pizza. I asked if I could have ranch dressing or blue cheese w/ my pizza. Again the waiter snapped and said that they don't have those condiments because the owner doesn't want anyone eating his pizza with any dressingWell - Technically if I'm paying for it therefore it's MY pizza. 2nd. Look I know to pizza connoisseurs that may be a huge faux pas, but hey even at the most expensive steak houses you can get ketchup w/ your steak if you choose to do so. I'm the customer and they seemed to forget that. I HAVE THE MONEY!The 2nd time we went there...again very rude service people. They wouldn't give me a table for 4 because my party haden't arrived yet even though I told them they would be there in 10 minutes. Finally when my party did arrive we were seated. But it seems all the servers there are snappy and rude. The pizza was still soggy and and falling off. Suffice it say, I will not be going there ever again. Who do these people think they are??? Maybe the servers learned their lesson when I tipped them $2.In fairness - I will say they have some good micro brew beers there but not worth for me to go there. I deal w/ stress and shity people all day I don't need to pay someone to give it to me.
