I've been to piece many times over the past year, but I won't be going back anytime soon. Last night (an average Wednesday), it took an hour and a half for the two of us to get a table and another hour and a half to get our pizza and pay the bill. We were told our wait would be 30 minutes and when we asked why we hadn't been seated after sitting at the bar for over an hour, they got us a table. We accepted the inexplicably long wait, but what was unacceptable was the way we were treated after we sat. The story is too long to tell here, so I'll spare the details. We eventually talked to the manager, who was nice, but didn't actually accomplish anything to my knowledge. Really made me feel like I was just a number to them and not a loyal customer. Edit 10/15/07: I'm bumping them back up to 3 stars because I picked up a pizza for takeout the other day and it was pretty good. I'm still not ready to sit down and be "waited on" again there. Time heals all wounds though, right? Edit #2 12/11/07: Piece goes back down to one star for their ridiculous policies. We ordered a pizza at noon on Sunday (No Bears game this week) for pickup. After our walk in the cold took much longer than expected due to the unshoveled sidewalk, we asked if we could eat our pizza there. They told us no, since it somehow messes up tips for the server. Of course the girl working there didn't seem to be able to expound when asked how or why, especially since the place was far from full. We told her we'd happily order beers and tip for the pizza. No dice. Policy. We tip better than most people and the place wasn't full. Thier "policy" just screwed a waiter/waitress out of a tip. Nice one guys.
