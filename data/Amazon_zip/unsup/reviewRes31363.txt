To be honest - I would normally stay away from anything *fusion*. In my book, it means: fusion-confusion. It's like ... in the middle of nowhere. YET - I decided to give Sunda a try - because of reviews and raves of this restaurant. I really like the ambiance. Perfect for either after office hour drinks or a 'semi-romantic 3rd date' type of thing. I was here with the bf - we ordered an appetizer: oxtail potstickers. It was YUM! It came with some sort of a raddish-mayo-ish sauce that I really like.  For the entree, I had the lobster roll. It was good - but to be honest, I was expecting something more of a 'wow'. I have definitely had non-lobster rolls that tasted just as good (even better) - priced a lot less. The bf had the NY Strip Steak - cooked medium (and came out medium - just perfect). They were tender and juicy (not bloody). For the drink, I had the Lychee Petals - it was a bit too strong to my liking (maybe because I'm a lightweight) - but it was really good, regardless. The bf ordered the Italian soda and he was really psyched with the idea of mixing your own soda and syrup flavoring (a sweet memory of chemistry class for him - for me, on the contrary - it was a flashback of nightmares). Service was great - though the guy (I'm assuming the host) - could use a little more smile and be friendlier to the patrons. I got a free dessert of a fried-ice cream drenched in caramel sauce and crushed pecans named Ridiculous Cake ("ice cream, covered with carrot cake then dipped in tempura batter then deep fried" our waitress explained) - and it was ridiculously good.  Overall -- it was a very good dining experience on a special occasion, and I was just relieved the waitresses didn't come out and sing happy birthday. :)
