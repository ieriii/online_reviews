hello scenesters and glitterati. this is where all the beautiful people in chicago go to eat sushi and asian food. i've been here a couple times since they opened and i have always had a great time. the scene and decor are both gorgeous. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION THOUGH, especially if you are going on a fri or sat, or you will NOT get in. even week nights are pretty crowded. if you dont have a reservation, you MIGHT get a seat at the sushi bar or in the lounge. anyway... the food is amazing. yes, it is a bit expensive, but you're really paying for the service, scene, and personal attention. everytime i've been there, either the manager, chef, or a guy named uncle paul comes over to our table and asks how our meal is or brings us something special like sake or a free dessert. i've never experienced treatment like this anywhere else. and i noticed, they do it for a bunch of tables, not just ours : ) they have a HUGE menu with lots of different cuisines. my favorites are the beef lollipops, the crispy rice topped with spicy tuna, the brussel sprout salad, and the crispy pata which is REALLY BIG, so be prepared to share. also, they have MOCHI, my favorite asian dessert. when you order it, you get a bunch of flavors not just one! all the servers are good looking and you might get a glimpse of a (local) celeb. ive seen jeremy piven and david schwimmer dining there before. overall, this place is great. ask your server to order for you. they know a lot (almost too much) about all the dishes on the menu. all the stuff they've reccommended has been out of this world. i like to sit in the lounge. it's more casual and usually less noisy than the restaurant.
