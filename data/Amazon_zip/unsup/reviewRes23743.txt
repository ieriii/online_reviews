I've been here a couple of times and recently celebrated my birthday with friends at Greek Islands. The food is always outstanding. The restaurant is always packed, even on weeknights. Some waiters are better than others, but they're really great overall. If you haven't had Mediterranean food, you have to check it out. I can't wait to go back, yummy!
