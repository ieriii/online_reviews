I've been to Cafe 28 for brunch and dinner. The restaurant is very comfortable and large. I always get the chicken quesadillas for an appetizer for either meal. They are not the normal chicken and cheese quesadillas... Cafe 28 stuffs them with mushrooms and garlic and tops them with some type of salsa that is gives it a nice smoky taste. The pistachio crusted chicken is also a favorite, but it often sells out! The service is usually good, but if there is a large group also dining at the restaurant they don't know how to keep food coming out of the kitchen for their regular diners as well. My fiance and I waited for 45 minutes for our appetizer and another 45 minutes for our brunch the last time we were there. I'll forgive them for the super slow service (hey, we were STARVING) but I wish our waitress would have told us why we were waiting so long instead of us having to ask where our food was... plus she didn't come by our table a lot to get us more drinks, so we were waiting there hungry and thirsty. When my Southwest Eggs Benedict finally came to my table, I quickly forgot that I was upset because it was so delicious with a nice amount of spiciness!
