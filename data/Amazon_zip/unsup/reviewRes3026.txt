I've been to some amazing restaurants from world-renowned chefs, and was excited to add Tru to my list. I was expecting a lot more, considering the hundreds of dollars dropped on this dinner. I will say that the service was impeccable and the dining experience deserves more than 5 stars. However, the food itself deserves a 2 at best. My husband and I each had the Chefs Collection because we wanted to try everything. Not much seasoning, not very flavorful. Suffice it to say that when you are served rabbit, wagyu beef, halibut and veal and your favorite thing of the night are the the two sauteed mushrooms on your final plate, the food was a disappointment for the price.
