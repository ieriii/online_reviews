I wanted to like Piece, really I did. It was even my idea to go there. I will say that the beer is good (albeit expensive) and I know this because we waited approximately three hours for a table. Arriving at 5:30 pm to ensure we could get a table (we had a group of eight or so) we waited, and drank, and waited and waited some more. I understand that it's a Friday night and we had a lot of people in our group but waiting three hours for a table is ridiculous. We asked multiple times what was going on and even saw big groups like ourselves get split up and seated. We asked if we could be split up and seated and finally sat down about 3 and a half hours after we arrived. At two different tables. Across the restaurant. I am pretty sure a wait for a table of four like we ended up with was not three+ hours. The pizza was good but I was so annoyed at that point I was already over Piece. Heading to Flash Taco across the street next time.
