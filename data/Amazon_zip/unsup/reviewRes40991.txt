I'm gonna do something unusual. I'm gonna give this place 5 stars even though they're BYOB (corkage fees usually fill me with murderous rage) and regardless of the fact that I don't like the food that much. I'm NOT saying it was bad, it's just that I generally don't get down with this kind of fare. The wife, however, loves this stuff and found every morsel to be outtasight. the reason I am giving it 5 stars is the waitstaff. Holy crap are they on their game. I don't think I've ever run across staff who more went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience.  French cuisine is not my kinda thing, but if it's yours then you WILL have a good dining experience here.
