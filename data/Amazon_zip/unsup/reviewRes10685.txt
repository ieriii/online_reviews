This is without a doubt the best breakfast I've ever had, multiple times. It's so hard to pick what to eat, so we always eat about half of each other's meal. We've split a chorizo omelette, a standard breakfast burrito, a beef tenderloin breakfast burrito, and my favorite, the decadent white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes. I don't think a normal human can finish them on their own - too rich - but to split, great idea. The coffee is super duper strong and fresh, and the side potatoes are chunky and delicious for sure. The only complaint is the wait, although they do overestimate. The first time we went it was supposed to be about an hour and a half, and ended up being about an hour, and the last time, it was supposed to be a half hour and we were seated at the counter at about 15 minutes. It's not too pricey either for what you get, and for the area.
