I called about six times in early November trying to get a NYE reservation. Finally got through to the voicemail and left a message. I made a backup reservation just in case. 5 weeks later they called me back and said they had a spot open on the 30th. So we took it. If the food weren't worth the effort, this place would be out of business. But it was worth the effort. No question about it. There were no misses over the course of 3 hours. The dishes varied textures and flavors and presentation like few other restaurants can even hope. Sure the service is curt and Michael Carlson is a stress case roaming around the dining room like a drugged up hippie. But who cares. His food is simply awesome. quail egg ravioli, tagliatelle with huckleberries and pickled veal hearts, the eucalyptus cranberry soup for dessert, he just has an uncanny knack for coming up with awesome and unique dishes. Add to it all that it's BYO and when we ran out they served us beer from their own stash. This is a one-of-a-kind restaurant and I won't hesitate to go back, even if I have to call 50 times.
