So just ate at Shaws as part of their 25 cent Oysters on Mondays. It is a great idea but the execution could be a lot better.Have you ever eaten at a restaurant that is under so much pressure that it reminds you of a scene from Apocalypse Now. The scene where there is this kid in a bunker trying to find out who his COO is. He doesn't know whats going on, and he is going to find out any time soon. Shaws was that kid in the bunker this afternoon.So I got to Shaws at 3:20 pm and the 25 cent oyster deal had only been offered for 20 minutes. the grill room was packed and it was obvious that the staff was under pressure. After a 15 minute wait I got a stool by the bar (really nice host got me a seat and I was able to get enough elbow room for myself). And then the waiting started..........I eventually got my order put in after being seated 25 minutes earlier. The bar tender was under real pressure but was trying his best. I didn't care that there was a wait, I was getting Oysters for 25 cent so I just read my book that I brought with me. The idiot next to me was complaining about the wait but of course never had the courage to ask to speak to the manager or even just politely ask the bartender how much longer the oysters would take to get served. When I put through my order I noticed that people were putting through huge orders. A guy behind me ordered 4 dozen oysters and he was eating on his own, crazy.I really enjoyed the oysters when they came out, they were as good as any I have had in Chicago and I couldn't fault them. I asked for the check and made a point of telling the bartender that he had done a great job when he was clearly short staffed.I'm sure Shaws is better than a 3 star review but going by the confusion and wait time today, I can't give it more than a 3.
