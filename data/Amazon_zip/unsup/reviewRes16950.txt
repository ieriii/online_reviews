This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Chicago, and I've been to at least about 20 or so in the area. Yeah, I eat a lot of Indian food. This place really has no weaknesses that I've found, so it's not one where I'd recommend anything in particular, you can't really go wrong. Let's put it this way, I loaded up on their version of creamed corn the last time I went there, because their version was just that good, hence it was not regulated to a side dish..no,no, it got right up on the main stage.  It's a little pricey, but it goes along with the quality of the food. And BTW, anybody who is new to Indian food or not really digging the Indian cuisine in general, quit giving this place mediocre reviews because of that personal fact.. You're bringing a top restaurant of its kind down a notch because you're personally just not an Indian food fan...that's really not too cool.
