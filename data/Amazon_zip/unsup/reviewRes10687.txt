Benjamin tea served here! Even during the week, TBR will be busy, but we didn't need to wait for a table on a Friday (it was snowing, so perhaps the locals were hibernating?). We split a huge veggie egg white omelet, and the breakfast potatoes that come with may be my favorite in the city. Omelet was cooked perfectly and had a ton of veggies sauteed inside. I had to follow the lead of Kathleen M. and go for the Red Velvet pancakes. I also make the husband promise to split them with me as I was supposed to start my diet that day (yeah, didn't happen). Huge, thick and fluffy, sweet cream cheese sauce covered with nuts, pure happiness on a plate. No way can anyone finish these. Even splitting it, I could only just get 1/4 down, but the sugar high lasted the whole day. Would I get it again, hells yes! Nothing wrong with dessert for breakfast folks.
