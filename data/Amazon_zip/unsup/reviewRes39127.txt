Wow! Korean BBQ comes fast and furious. Sit down, order and before you know it, there are small "tasting" samples that cover the entire table. My Korean sister in law said the service in these restaurants is not typically good, and that was true, but the food made up for it. Hot sake, Bi Bim Bop and some terrific BBQ. Think of a fondue restaurant on steroids. No hot oil, just some hot coals and great food.
