Yes, I know - what can I possibly add to the already glowing reviews? YOU MUST GO! I absolutely love this place! From the food, to the decor, to the servers, everything is fabulous. We went yesterday with a group of 6 ladies for my daughter's high school graduation/18th birthday celebration and ordered a ton of food and nothing disappointed. All the Vasi are delicious and decadent. The focaccia is a must try (and not like any traditional focaccia). The giant raviolo - amazing. The risotto, also amazing. I also beg of you, even if you feel you can't eat another bite, order the mascarpone polenta with the ragu of the day (my one aunt called it evil - evil goodness on a wood slab)! I can't wait to go back. Now if they could only open a little boutique hotel above the restaurant...hmmm.
