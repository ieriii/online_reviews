Went here for the big 2-4 and had a pleasant time. Overall the atmosphere was pretty neat. The reason why this place didn't get a 5 star rating was based soley on the fact I picked this restaurant for the Cheddar Risotto and Root beer BBQ sauce everyone has been telling me about. Seeing that my birthday falls on 4/22 I missed the winter menu by about 2 weeks and was unable to try those delish sounding items. That being said, I tried a spring pea bisque that was simple delightful. A bowl full of flavor, absolutely loved the mint marshmellow! Also tried the Halibut which was nice and earthy and accompanied with the perfect balance of flavor. Of note, the portions were on the smaller side, about 3-4oz. so if you're starving make sure you order an app.  OH! how could I forget the popcorn... addicting. Truffle parm, popcorn. If only they served GE's popcorn in movie theaters around the world...
