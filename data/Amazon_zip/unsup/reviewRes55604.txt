Pistachio Crusted Chicken. Enough said.Lunch, brunch, dinner, and drinks are all excellent at Cafe 28, with reasonable prices and an friendly staff. It rarely takes time to get a table, and sitting at the bar for a few minutes with a mohito is not a bother. You may have trouble parking around the area, but its proximity to the Brown Line (Irving Park Stop) is unbeatable.
