I will preface by saying this review is long overdue. Not because of my lack of enthusiasm but due to my lack of time to review!  I have been here on multiple occasions with a variety of people and have always enjoyed the food, drinks, and company. I have tried too many things to review one dish (my friends and I love to share plates!) but I will however say that I have not tried anything I did not like and that goes for the drinks as well. I have had anything from asparagus to macaroni and cheese to jameson and coffee. So now that you know I am a fan of the food, you are probably saying "What else, Marcy?" Well, I will tell you what else. The atmosphere is absolutely indulgent. Dark, cozy, large venue yet intimate seating, and bustling. There are always people waiting for tables (usually a good sign to me) and the wait has never been too long (20 minutes max for my experiences). Why not five stars? The service can be lacking, not in quality but in quantity of servers on the floor. The guys and gals that have served my tables in the past seemed rushed, flustered, and overworked. I know these things come with the job, to a certain degree, but my suggestion would be to add a server or two on the busier nights.
