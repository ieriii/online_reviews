I loved the atmosphere there on a Sunday morning(ish) for brunch. A man sat playing the guitar towards the back of the entry room which we could still hear as we sat in the middle section of the restaurant. Cool paintings and photographs decorate the exposed brick walls. It was bustling but why not with their huge brunch menu? Huge compared to the limited selection that other places offer. We sipped yummy bloody mary's loaded with all kinds of goodies. I had the chilaquiles. Nothing super special but totally satisfying and delicious. I also had a generously portioned fruit plate with my meal.
