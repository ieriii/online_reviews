If you love thick crust pizza, this place is it. The crust is thick, and buttery, but never burnt or too crispy. I have tried many pizza places in Chicago, and this one is by far my favorite. The pizza is delicious, and one of my favorites to order in the fall/winter. Delivery is reliable and punctual. Not sure if I would recommend dining in, but regardless, the pizza is 100% worth it.
