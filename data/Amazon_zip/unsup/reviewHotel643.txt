Service - Superb. They even allowed us to check in at noon and gave us amazing chocolate chip cookies! Kudos to the front desk, cleaning crew and bell boys. Everyone was really friendly and had a great attitude. Location - Unbeatable location and price! A block from the heart of Magnificient Mile for a low promotional price. Ambiance - Swanky and busy. Fireplace at the bar although I never saw it open for business. Rooms - Pros - Spacious, great view, Crabtree and Evelyn products, safe, trash can has a recyclable container, looks just like photos. Cons - Lump beds, super soft pillows, no one answered the front desk for twenty minutes when I called at 1 am.
