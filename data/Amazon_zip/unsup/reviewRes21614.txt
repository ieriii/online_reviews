This place is hyped up to be MUCH MORE than it really is. The setting is cool and all (who doesn't like not getting out of their car to get a meal)? But the food is over-priced and doesn't taste all that good. I spent almost $7 for a hot dog, fries and a pop. The hot dog was gross (I am big fan of Vienna Beef hot dogs). The dog reminded me of Ball Park dogs. Yuck. For those who appreciate a cheaper dog and Vienna Beef, let me suggest to you Gene & Judes Red Hots in River Grove. Each hot dog and fries is $1.90. For what I spent at Superdawg, I could have gotten 2 delicious dogs at Gene and Judes.
