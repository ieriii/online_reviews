SOOOOO glad I finally came here!!!! Delicious vegan food...with vegetarian options for the dairy lovers. FYI: We totally fooled my friends meat eating boyfriend here- he was convinced the ground "meat" in the enchiladas, nachos and taco salad was real!! Did NOT believe us when we told him after it was all veg!!! The service is super fast and a server is always checking up on you- God I love that! Meaning every time I want a little more of this- and a side of that, or another milkshake, Chicago Diner is on it!!! Everyone who works here is very friendly, accomodating and helpful with great energy! Most of the food is delicious too. A good place to go in casual clothes for a (mostly) healthy casual meal. LOVED IT!! Pros: Peanut butter cookie dough milkshakes (HEAVEN) Live green salad with avocado dressing (even took a big container home with me) Gyros(WOW) Nachos Oaxaca Ravioli Pesto polenta Enchiladas Cons: Taco salad (Karyns is better) Sweet potato quesadillas(must have been an off day cuz other reviewers loved it) Service outside- not as good as inside but not horrible CAREFUL with the milkshakes....hard to stop once you start!!! Can't wait to come back!!!
