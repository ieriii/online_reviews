Service was ok, food was great! Im happy. I was in a hurry, so couldnt spend much time here, but the blue crab spring rolls were to die for. It took a little long for my server to bring my check, but it was my fault for not telling him that I was in a hurry. I will be back. I would like to bring my grandma here for dinner next week.
