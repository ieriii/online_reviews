I stayed here on St. Patrick's day, so I paid a little more than usual on Priceline, but it was expected because the city was a madhouse. We parked in the underground parking garage, and that went smoothly despite the huge crowds. We got downtown at about 12:00 p.m., and the nice front desk woman told me a room wasn't ready yet (understandably, because we were early), but someone would call me when it was. Now the problems start. There was an area where we could leave our bags while we were waiting for our room. We brought the bags over to the guy, who was very busy because the hotel was nuts, got a tag for them, and started to walk away. The guy muttered "seriously" as we walked away, so my friend said "sorry" and ran back and gave him a $5 tip. I was thinking that we would tip them at the end, but if he wanted it now, fine. We went out to the parade, had some fun, and came back a few hours later for our bags. There was a different guy running the bag check area. We got our bags from him, meaning we pointed at them, and he moved them about 5 feet to where we were standing. He didn't bring them to our room or anything, he just moved them 5 feet. We started to walk away, and this guy yelled after us "no tip!"  Ok, I've worked in the service industry. I realize that people want tips, and often depend on them. We gave bag check guy number one $5 for putting a tag on our bags. I do not think it was necessary to give bag check guy number two another $5. Further, when is it ever appropriate to yell about tips at your customers? There were about 1000000000 people getting their bags from these guys. How much money is enough for them? That whole incident kind of ruined the hotel for me. The room was fine, but someone needs to do something about that horribly rude behavior.
