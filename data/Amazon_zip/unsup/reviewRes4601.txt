I visited Chicago for the first time and Purple Pig was the first restaurant I ate at for dinner. Couple things to know- there is a pretty decent wait time (we waited nearly 2 hours). I can't imagine having to wait that long during the winter time but in August, it was bearable (minus the stomach pains in my stomach). The waiting area is large with a good number of seating available. In addition, you can order drinks while you are waiting outside. Ambiance is very cute- there was outdoor patio seating. Very cute date place. Okay, now to the food. We ordered: 1) Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes,Asiago & Salami Toscana This was a so-so dish. It was good but not incredible. Probably the least favorite thing I ordered. Had a nice lemon, vinegary taste to it but nothing special. 2) Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs This was WONDERFUL! Never had anything like this before. If you like bone marrow, this is definitely the dish for you. The only con to this dish is that I wish the bread that accompanied it was less oily/less buttered because it distracts from the bone marrow flavor. 3) Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes This was a very delicious dish. The mashed potatoes are creamy and are to die for. The pork shoulder was flavorful and tender. 4) Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki Probably the best chicken kebabs I have had in a long time. The chicken was cooked very well- moist and tender. The Tzatziki sauce complemented the dish very well and was refreshing. Overall, a great way to start off my foodie experience in Chicago!
