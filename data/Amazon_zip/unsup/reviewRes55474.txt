We dined here on Saturday night. Made the reservation on OpenTable and when I called to confirm, I requested to have a table out on the patio. This is a MUST do. Everything was fantastic. The service was impeccable!!! The food was amazing!!We had the antipasti platter for appetizer. SO good. Insanely good. The proscuitto melted in our mouths. I could have eaten just that and been extremely content.I had the cheese ravioli which was great. But almost a touch too rich. Don't get me wrong, being from WI, I love LOVE cheese but it was a bit much. My BF had the special - mushroom fettucini. It was awesome. The pasta was deliciously home made and the mushrooms were outstanding. The pasta had a great rustic, earthy flavor.For dessert we had gelato which was perfect.I think though the service was the best. Very attentive. Love that they had Italian accents. We will definitely be back. Heck - I didn't want to leave!!!
