I was sick this weekend. So sick that mom had to take me to the ER at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to make sure that my cold wasn't something else (no, I'm not a wuss, my throat was closing up). After I was cleared mom and I stopped here to grab some soup. I wish I had been feeling better. I could tell that I would have LOVED this place, the way I LOVE the Berkeley Bowl and the Pasta Shop back home in Cali. Nevertheless, I was very happy with the split pea soup I got from the refrigerator section. Everything else looked good - but wasn't really an interest that day. Prices seemed the usual gourmet grocery expensive - but not overly so. No wonder mom is here regularly...I would be too
