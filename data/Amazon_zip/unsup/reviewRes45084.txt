UNREAL. The absolute BEST ... and I do mean BEST octopus I have ever had. We've been preparing octopus at home for many, many years and do a fine job, but it's an incredibly difficult dish to make well and above all, to get TENDER (even when using baby octopus). Our own efforts cannot even come close to Anteprima's - the octopus was so tender it melted in your mouth and the preparation was absolutely phenomenal - so flavorful but not overpowering.  We are not impressed easily, especially when it comes to seafood, and yet, were surely were! Such a memorable dish. Bravo! Now that we were off to a great start, we followed up with their special pasta of the evening, Spaghetti Botarga. A very light, and enjoyable primo piatto ...  On our next trip I would like to try their orecchiette with house made lamb sausage and bitter greens. For our secondi we ordered the venison loin and the night's special rabbit. Both were absolute perfection. The venison melted like butter and the rabbit as well - juicy, tender, cooked JUST RIGHT - and full of flavor. I have had these two game meats at several other restaurants and there is just no comparison - Anteprima reigns supreme. We finished our meal with the Vin Santo and biscotti - something I've not had since my time in Italy.  The service was wonderful, the atmosphere warm and inviting, the food: Italian as it should be - absolutely authentic and delicious.  Anteprima is a superb place that I couldn't recommend more highly.
