This place has a great personality. It's classy, has great food for dinner if that's what you are looking for. I've only visited there as a bar stop. Our waitress what receptive to the fact that my friend was pregnant and seeked de-caffinated hot tea, and did not scoff. She wanted to go out to bar/restaurants because she sees that she may not have time in the near future to experience such situations!
