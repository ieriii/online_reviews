A group of 10 of us braved the snow storm on Friday to celebrate a good friends 49th birthday. Wine, raspberry martinis and Great Lakes Beer were flowing from the start! We went with 2 salads and 2 apps to get things going. The chopped chicken salad and BLT salad (special salad) were large and enjoyed by all. On a previous visit the special salad was a honeycrisp & blue cheese salad with pecans and pomagranate. Best salad ever! Put in on the menu. Sorry to digress!! We also ordered calamari and a goat cheese app, both were good. I had the porterhouse with creamed spinach, my wife and another friend had the prime rib, a couple others had the NY strip (steak special) and the rest just did an app for their dinner. The birthday girl's steak was not cooked properly so they made her another one. To make up for it, they brought out "3" free brownie desserts! Nice touch. Overall, another very good meal. Wildfire never seems to disappoint!!
