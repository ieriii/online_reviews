Nice Italian spot in the $30-60 price range. We were seated in the dining room with a good view of the open kitchen. I was definitely impressed to see the cooks shaving the prosciutto for my pizza appetizer to order. Nice touch! Everyone at the table agreed that the entree's were as authentic Italian as I had just returned from a trip to Italy earlier in the year. Good Ambiance and Overall Experience!
