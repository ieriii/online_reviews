I have been wanting to try this place since it opened, but was warned of the insane waiting time since it was so popular. The hubs and I finally bit the bullet and went, we were told the wait would be 40 min. We found a spot at the bar, ordered a drink, then were seated immediately! I mean it was a great surprise but why were we told 40 min? What if we decided to leave? Anyway, we were happy to get a table so fast, and our waiter was really helpful and nice. The place is kind of hipster/trendy, but our waiter didn't have the slightest bit of pretentiousness. I ordered the farm burger, but without beets and added cheese. Maybe I compromised the integrity of the recipe, but I thought it was great. It was huge though and I only ate half. Their fries were really good, thin and crispy. As for beer I had the Bottom Up Wit, which was a light mild wheat beer. Then I tried the Eugene which was a delicious chocolaty malt porter. All in all it was a good time and I'll definitely be back.
