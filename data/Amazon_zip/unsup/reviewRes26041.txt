Our first visit was last night, after the Joffrey's Don Quixote. We're subscribers and Mercat a la Planxa is one of the rewards participants. It's truly a great idea to get patrons in the door. Anyway, I love tapas and had somehow never heard of this restaurant. Trust me when I say we will be back. The dining area was contemporary and festive. The drinks, food and service were truly exemplary. It was all delicious but the stand-outs for me were the scallop and shrimp "meatballs," the patatas bravas which may resemble Tater Tots, but were absolutely above and beyond. And the white sangria, which has pear in it. Yum! Add to all of that an extensive Spanish wine list and you've got a real winner. The crowd was diverse and happy and it's a bit like a speakeasy because it's deep in the recesses of the Blackstone. Fair warning though: the bathroom is DARK. As in, even the toilets are black and you can't see a thing. Everything is lit by candlelight. I don't necessarily dislike it but it could be tricky if you're not prepared for that. We were too full for dessert but will definitely be back! Thank you, Joffrey, for partnering with this gem!
