Hands down the best meal I've had in Chicago. I can't think of one negative. The chefs kept the wine flowing, timing of the food was perfect. For such a small, intimate place the energy is fantastic. What impressed me most was their willingness to break the menu and accommodate me (a vegetarian who's willing to eat a little seafood)! Can't wait until I get the opportunity to go back!
