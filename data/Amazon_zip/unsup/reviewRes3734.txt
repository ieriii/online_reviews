This place is Okay. We walked by and decided to go in. I am not big on Fried Chicken. My friend got the Fried Chicken with the Seoul sauce. He liked it. I got the Beef and Rice bowl. It was pretty good. Definitely something different. I would recommend it if you aren't big on Fried chicken or are looking for something healthier. The price is $8-9 but the portion is huge.
