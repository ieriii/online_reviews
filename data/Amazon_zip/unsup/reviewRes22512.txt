Irazu was amazing! It was pretty packed for a Tuesday night but they were swift to clear a table for us. Our waiter was awesome (I'm pretty sure he was the guy from Diner's Drive Ins and Dives.) He suggested everything we got. I personally got the Pepito and Oatmeal Shake. Extremely delicious. Going back tonight...
