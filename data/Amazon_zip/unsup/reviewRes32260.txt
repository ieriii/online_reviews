Don't believe the whiners! They listen to too much Morrissey and just need something to cry about. Chicago Diner is heaven on earth, and I can't even think of a single negative. One time I rode my bike here in the searing sun on Halsted from the village, thought I'd sweat to death or get hit by a car, just because I really, really wanted a Dagwood. And it was totally worth it. I'd do it again.
