Went here for lunch on a Monday. The decor is great (lively outside, cozy inside). The service is amazing for what is a pretty small establishment (there are probably only a dozen or so seats inside, with more seating outside in the summer). The sandwiches tasted great (and had fresh ingredients). I'm impressed!
