Wow... this place reminds me of a college party in the dean's study! Amazing decor; walls and walls of books, complete with fireplace and leather armchairs. Pair that with the amazing dance music and some killer sandwiches (mmm pretzel bun) and you got yourself a very enjoyable eating experience. I have always had good service at this establishment and the food comes out super fast. If you are looking to step out of the norm, try their grilled cesear salad. Mmmmm... sticky toffee pudding.
