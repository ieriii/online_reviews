I would give this place 5 stars if I was a beer lover...but I'm not. Service is bad, bartenders are nasty and always act like you are annoying them with your orders (even when they are not busy). food is not that great either and it's always so crowded and loud in there! avoid weekends and busy nights, you will have to wait for at least 45 min to be seated
