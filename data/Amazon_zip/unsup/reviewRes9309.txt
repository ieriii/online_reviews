Had dinner there Sat. night. My husband was meeting there bc I was working during the day. Long story short....I kept my husband waiting for 40 minutes bc I got busy at work. The staff was so so nice and didn't make me feel like a jerk for being so late. They held our table.. and my husband was seated when I came in.  The food was great!!! We had the tuna tartar app and I had the soft salad rolls. My entree was lemon grass chicken and my husband ordered the seabass. The flavors were phenomenal.  We will definitely go back.
