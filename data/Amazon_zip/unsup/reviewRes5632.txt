Hello loud restaurant. Yes, it was a Thursday and there were a ton of people. But, it wasnt the people that were so loud, it was the music. Turn it down please! I was with two people sitting at the end of one of the high top communal tables and we were having to yell at each other. Thank goodness the people watching was good, because we certainly did a lot of that.  Now on to the food- not too shabby. We were obsessed with the pork shoulder. Ordered it twice because it was so tender and perfectly cooked. I even ordered another to bring home to the boy. Also had the fried manchego which was alright. Just didnt live up to the hype from other reviews. We did enjoy a few of the smears, which are not what one would expect. They were more bruschetta like- bread or similar carrier loaded with toppings. We ordered a few of those and enjoyed them very much.  Overall, the food was good and I might be back, but it will probably be on a Monday night when there are less people and we might be able to convince someone to turn the music down.
