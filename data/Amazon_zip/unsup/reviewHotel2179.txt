Ehhh.. I was expecting more out of a four star hotel. The room was nice.. but the shower water varied as I took a shower in the morning. I also wasn't impressed with their lobby or bar area. The entire lobby also lacks one trash can. I would have also liked to have some bubble bath since there was a separate tub. Oh.. and breakfast would be nice. It's a decent location though and the staff is terrific. Very friendly and helpful.. not snobby at all. I think I would say it's a great 3 star.. or a poor 4 star.
