I have been to Yolk many times and have enjoyed coming to this restaurant repeatedly for the past year or so. if you plan on trying it out on a Saturday or Sunday arm yourself with patience, as the wait is long, sometimes up t 40+ minutes. That said, I think it is worth it. Portions are large, the variety of food offered would satisfy some of the pickiest eaters, and the waitstaff is nice. The only downside to it...looks a bit like a cafeteria, impersonal, and they don't serve mimosas (a must for many Lakeviewers). Don't mind the distance, or the wait, but have a mimosa ready for me when I get there!
