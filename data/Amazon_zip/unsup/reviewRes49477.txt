We ordered a cheese flight and a sparkling wine flight.  the cheese flight was all creamy cheeses with a very high butterfat content. All of them were delicious, especially the one with raisins in it. It was somewhat like cream cheese. The Bleu was nice. The fixins were nice too. apples with little cubes of cabernet "jello" and this fig jam that was to die for.  The wine flight had a nice selection of sparklies. There was one that i did not care for much (too dry) but the rest were pretty great.  The place was kind of loud and the service was a little slow, therefore docking it a point.  Did not try any entrees, as we were waiting for a table at frontera, but would consider trying if i went back, although it really seems like kind of a get in and get out and get on with your evening type of place.
