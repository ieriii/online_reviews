Amazing. I feared I was falling out of love with food after a disappointing experience at Quartino, but Purple Pig reminded me how it feels to have an out-of-body experience with each bite. Located smack dab in the middle of Michigan Ave., this wine bar boasts a gorgeous patio and a unique menu of small dishes. We ordered: Potato and speck croquettes: Good, but nothing special. My friend raved about these, but I've had better, more authentic croquettes. Charred cauliflower: Really lovely. The sourness of the cornichons was surprising but worked well with the cauliflower. Pork neck bone gravy with ricotta: Amazing, amazing, amazing. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. The spread is almost like meat sauce, and it tastes delicious on the bread. The melted ricotta on top was a nice touch. Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes: Probably the least interesting of the dishes we ordered, but by far my favourite. The pork was unbelievably tender -- I've never tasted anything like it. Chicken thigh kabobs: Again, nothing remarkable about this dish, but it was another one of my favourites. The fried potatoes were almost like pancakes. The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I could've eaten three more plates of this. Scallop spiedini with chickpea aioli: The priciest and my least favourite of the dishes. I guess I'm just not really a fan of scallops. Didn't like the flavours on this one. Service was great throughout the night. The bill came out to about $25pp without alcohol for the three of us. Not cheap, but definitely worth it.
