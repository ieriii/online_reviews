I've been to Sunda several times and my favorite is to just sit at the bar on a week night before 7 pm and order HALF-PRICED appetizers/sushi and the drink special. This is such a steal! You can order quite a few plates and split amongst a few others and feel full enough not to have to sit down for dinner! My favorites are: - Toast and Jam - a wonderful version of shrimp toast...I can never seem to get enough! - Rock Shrimp Tempura - two orders for the table please...so tasty! - Chicken and Mushroom Siu Mai Seriously... if you're planning to go to Sunda, skip the reservation and find a nice spot at the bar/lounge area. You'll save yourself a lot of money!
