There are few things not to like about Hotel71. Fairly unassuming from the outside, the interior is chic but not so much that it loses its warmth. Its prime location makes it a short walk to Magnificent mile and other places you may want to go. Within 5 blocks you have access to your own personalized pizza tour as Uno, Due, Giordano's and Gino's East are all easily in reach. Rooms: spacious fantastic view INdividual K-Cup coffee brewer the closet being in the bathroom was a bit weird but it did make for a larger space. Free Wifi. The bar/restaurant at the hotel, Hoyt's is also really good. They have a very creative menu that is modern American. Staff are all friendly and professional. Of course, parking is standard Chicago rates $49 per night. The only minor drawback was that I did not notice any gift/sundries store, but at least 7-11 is right across the street.
