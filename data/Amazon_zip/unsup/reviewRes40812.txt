The food at La Pasadita was excellent! I had the quesadillas with their "mild" sauce. It's a good thing I like spicy foods, because this sauce was NOT mild. My sinuses were going crazy, my eyes were watering and I had to keep blowing my nose. It was tasty though. It was my first visit at La Pasadita, and I was pretty disapointed with the service. First of all, our waitress never came back to see if we wanted more drinks or to ask if everything was ok. And second, we never got our bill. Everyone else was getting a bill, but we had to go up and pay without one. It was weird, because at the register they knew our total.
