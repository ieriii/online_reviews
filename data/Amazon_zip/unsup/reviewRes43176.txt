Went last night, Saturday. My one complaint is the time it took to get our food. The pacing was awful and we had to wait long for our main dishes. Sashimi plate came quickly but everything else was a long wait. With that said, the food was excellent and our server was very nice. Bread with balsamic and garlic - amazing, rib-eye - great, pasta with truffle- excellent, salads - great, fries - incredible!  If you go on Saturday, be prepared to wait for your food. Once you get the food, deelish.
