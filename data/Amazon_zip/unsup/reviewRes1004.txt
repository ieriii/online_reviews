There is nothing I can really say here that has not already been said.... This place is well worth the wait in line. We waited four about 25 minutes to place our order inside, and after ordering the service was speedy and the dog's were pleasing. The only recommendation I can make is don't think of the hot dogs as your backyard bbq type. The are a meal. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 dogs each with a side of cheesy fries and even though our appetites were large... Hot Doug's won. Soooo GOOD. Check it out.
