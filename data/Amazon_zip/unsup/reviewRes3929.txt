where i'm from, korean fried chicken is waaaay better than crisp. i have to admit, crisp is pretty decent and their wings are HUGE, but the seoul sassy sauce is too sweet for what it should be. and who doesn't serve moo (korean pickled radish) with korean fried chicken?!?! and since when does putting 37484983 different toppings on bibimbap make it good? but since this is probably the best spot in chicago for this kind of fried chicken, it will have to suffice until i go back to los angeles where kyochon and bonchon know how to make korean fried chicken right!
