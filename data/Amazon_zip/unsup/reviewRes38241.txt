I almost gave this 4 stars because of the crowds but the crowds are there for a reason - amazing beer selection and good food. We've had our best experiences biking there for some daytime beer and food. At night you might get lucky and find a table near the bar, otherwise you'll wait over an hour for one in the dining room. The beer though. Oh, the beer. And the mussels, and that ham and gruyere sandwich...
