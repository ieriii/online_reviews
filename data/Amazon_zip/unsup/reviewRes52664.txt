Oh my God This place is absolutely amazing. The service is great and friendly. The food is to die for as long as your a carnivore. It is all you can eat and the meat just keeps coming. Twelve different kinds of meat, everything from four or five different kinds of steak to chicken wrapped in bacon with cheese to about lamb chops and it just keeps going. Not to mention the extensive buffet that sits in the middle of the dinning room. Oh and if you see the pineapple, make sure to grab a bite it's great!
