My boyfriend had no problems making reservations for a Thursday by calling just a few days earlier. We were promptly seated even though we arrived early and decided on the Experience menu. Instead of getting wine pairings, we decided to order a few beers from their great beer list. The food was so delicious...I really have no comments other than we really want to go back someday. The popcorn was the best I've ever had haha. All the dishes were great, but if I had to choose only one, I think my favorite would be the first wagyu tartare dish. An amazing start to an amazing meal. I was pretty full by the end, so next time I may just get the smaller tasting menu and add dishes on. Here's what the menu was when we went: July 28th, 2011 Experience Menu: popcorn truffle butter + black pepper + parmesan fluff consomme compressed watermelon + mint leaf + jalapeno oil wagyu tartare asparagus salad + pommes frites + bearnaise yolk deconstructed caesar gem lettuce + brioche twinkie + white anchovy corn bisque spiny lobster + toasted coquito + vanilla marshmallow sweetbread schnitzel napa cabbage + pickled turnip + chanterelle ragout canape sauteed calamari + brussel kimchi + red curry king salmon blis roe + garlic scape + shaved fennel alaskan halibut leek brandade + house bacon + haricot vert jidori chicken dirty rice + country pate + fried okra bison loin baked bean + texas onion + pepper salsa intermezzo grape juice + purple essence + soda spritzer wild strawberry coriander arlette + fromage blanc + basil emulsion flourless chocolate root beer + port cherry + birch caramel
