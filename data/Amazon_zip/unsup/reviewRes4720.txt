Loved it and fabulous wine list! If you don't know about wine, don't just go for the Chardonnay. Ask the server, they will be able to help steer you in the right direction of something awesome. With the hot summer Chicago is having, definitely try the calamari appetizer dish. It is chilled calamari salad with (I think) couscous, radishes, cucumber, nuts.... I might be describing it a bit off, but it was cool, crisp, and so fresh tasting, I ordered a second one :) We also tried the roasted almonds, olives, broccoli, cobia wrapped in prosciutto, and eggplant schemer, all solid choices!  The only downside... people love this place so much that even early on a weeknight (6pm) it is packed and a wait is almost a given. But hey, you can't hate on success! Great job PP, can't wait to come back.
