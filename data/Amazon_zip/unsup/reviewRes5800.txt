Food was kinda hit-or-miss. Bruschette of the day was grape/almond which was tasty and different. Sea urchin/crab linguini was fantastic, just so flavorful and tasted like OCEAN. Sausage rigatoni was alright, and perfectly al dente. The breakfast calzone was really blah/kinda gross.. and exactly what it sounds, eggs and potato in pizza crust. Chicken was really salty and nothing special. Burger was tasty but also WHOA salty.. perhaps it's the bacon jam.. mmmm bacon jam :) Really wonderful service, doesn't take reservations but we were seated right away.
