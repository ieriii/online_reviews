mmm beer...mmm pizza...mmm beer Award winning beers, awesome pizza (fuck you pizza metro) and solid salads. Service is a little on the rude-boy side, but it's typical for the hood. I've come here with every intent of ONLY drinking some of the tastiest dark beer this side of the tracks and ALWAYS end up ordering pizza, I can't help myself. One of the bartenders - I would swear he's the bastard son of Jeff Tweedy.
