Oh man, I probably shouldn't be writing this before lunch, because just thinking about it is making me hungry! The pizza at this place is phenomenal! I love Italian-style pizzas, and this is easily one of the best I had. I usually keep it simple with a margherita or a pizza funghi, and I think that at a place like this, the simpler the better. Last time I was here, I sat facing the kitchen area, so I got to watch them assemble the pizzas and drool over the fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce while I was waiting for mine to arrive. For dessert, we split the tartufo, which was a fabulous way to end the meal!
