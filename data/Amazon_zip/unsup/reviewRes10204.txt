I love Piece pizza. Piece is one of the three best pizza joints in Chicago. But as good as the pizza is, sometimes the mishegas of going to Piece is just too much. Maybe you don't feel like dealing with the crazy parking on that terrible stretch of North/Milwaukee/Damen. Maybe there's too much noise from the live band karaoke. Maybe you don't want to deal with the wait. Maybe you don't feel like donning your vintage threads so you can blend in with the throngs of tattooed hipsters. For all those situations there's Piece Out. Just call ahead and in 30-45 minutes you'll have a delicious Piece pizza to take home with you. Here's a tip: when you get home put the pizza in the oven for 5 minutes or so and it will taste just like it does when you're at the restaurant. Piece Out is the perfect way to bring a little Piece to your house for dinner. The only thing missing is the tattoos.
