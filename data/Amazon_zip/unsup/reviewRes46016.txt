When a bunch of my friends wanted to go here for a weekday dinner, I was skeptical - the Michigan Ave location, the Cheesecake factory link, and limited vegetarian options. But I'm so glad I went! The place was teeming with people on a Monday night. The menu was pretty extensive, and I was able to find a few veggie dishes that both sounded and tasted good. The goat cheese salad was out of the world.. little fried balls of goat cheese nestled among baby greens and candied apples. Their roasted veggies pizza was surprisingly thin and good. The beignets that we had for dessert were truly fluffy, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of heaven. I've heard great things about their brunch offerings too, planning to try that out soon. Valet parking is available, and cost me $14 for 2 hours. Pretty reasonable for a Michigan Ave address :)
