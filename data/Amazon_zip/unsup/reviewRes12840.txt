i am quite partial to cafe 28, since my bf took me there for our first "real" date almost 2 years ago. i was impressed then and continue to be impressed each time i go back. review is of my 2 most recent trips - bday dinners for friends. we had reservations for both, one on a wednesday night, one on a friday night. both nights were busy, but friday was pretty packed. we had to wait almost 30 minutes after our reso time (mojitos from the bar helped pass the time) on friday, but the owner/manager apologized and gave us free appetizers to make up for it. i love the mojitos here - fresh flavor, served in a pint glass, crunch sugar crystals slurped up with every sip. a lot of people get the margaritas or sangria here, but i would skip them and go for the mojito for sure. i have never ordered anything but the pistachio encrusted chicken --- it is THAT good. it's rare that someone in our group doesn't order it - but some other favorites are the cuban chicken or the halibut. all in all, cafe 28 is a great place for a special occasion dinner, a night out with friends, or just a fabulous dinner.
