I have dos palabras para ustedes: HUEVOS RANCHEROS. Seriously dude, the huevos rancheros are to die for!! My one complaint about this place is that you have to order at the counter and then just stand there until a table becomes available. I personally prefer to be waited on, and found it a little stressful that we all ordered and then had to just chill there, lurking over this poor table while they were trying to enjoy their own huevos rancheros! Also, we were meeting a friend so it didn't really work right because we ordered, they were late, then we ended up getting our food before they even ordered. I think typically the staff tries to time everything out, so the fact that we were served so far in advance was a mistake they apologized for, but it was still annoying. They had really good coffee as well. I ordered a vanilla latte and enjoyed every ounce of it. They don't have a TON of selection, nor did it seem they had your typical bacon, eggs and toast variety. If you did want that, you would have had to order a bunch of sides. That = pure lameness. Luckily, the huevos rancheros had my name on it and I would come back here for brunch so long as I got here before the crowds started up, just to avoid the wait. Also, a long time ago I bought some cinnamon donuts here, which were also pretty bomb. Highly recommend those little sweet nuggets. Other than that...oh they had a nice outdoor seating area as well. Too bad we are about to enter the blistering cold months here in Chicago, but I'll have to put this on my to do list for when the weather starts to cheer up a bit.
