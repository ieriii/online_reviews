I was really excited about going to Crisp because it looked like such a cute place (I am the ideal consumer.. a sucker for any sort of advertising gimmick :P) and I'm a huge fan of bonchon (Korean fried chicken). The 4 of us shared two of their "dinner specials", which is a pretty good deal. I believe it's about $20 for a whole chicken and you can pick the flavors. You also get two sides and two drinks. We decided to try the BBQ, Seoul Sassy, and the Buffalo. The Seoul Sassy was definitely my favorite, with a nice hint of sweetness (and it tasted the most "Asian" which was what I was looking for). The flavors were all relatively tasty but some of the pieces of chicken were on the dry side. For our sides, we got fries, onion rings, and fried mushrooms. They were all pretty good, but then again what doesn't taste good after it's been battered and deep fried? Overall food = good enough but not amazing. This is definitely not bonchon in NYC Ktown. What I really DIDN'T like about Crisp was the fact that they have communal tables. The space is pretty small so I can see why they do it, but it's really inconvenient and cramped and compromised my experience significantly. I had nowhere to to put my bag/coat because we were sitting on a bench shared with many others! Also, the bathroom was filthy. The toilet was beyond clogged and in unacceptable condition.. gross! If I go back it will be for take-out, and to try their bibimbop bowls!
