Wow!! I drove by this place (yesterday) vowing to stop in sometime and try it, and I did, today! I was promptly greeted by the friendly staff and ordered a bistec (steak ) sandwich. I figured I'd eat half and take the other half to my mom to try. While I'm stuffing my face seated on one of the stools people were coming and going and the owner came by to ask if everything was ok. OK?? Are you kidding me? I simply said, crumbs on my mouth and all "It's like an explosion of yum in my mouth!!" I love this place, the price is right, the selection is vast, and most importantly the food and the attention is wonderful. I hear they haven't been open very long and it seems to be going very well, I wish them the best of luck because they offer quality and service that's hard to find. Oh, the owner also offered the patrons a taste of their Cuban coffee which was strong yet sweet, simply delish!! I can't wait to go back soon (tomorrow too soon?), I love this place and hope you will too! OH!! I ended up eating the sandwich myself and bought my mom her own!
