I recently arranged a group dinner while visiting Chicago and wanted good Italian away from the hotel/Loop. I came across Sapori Trattoria (thanks Yelp) and had a WONDERFUL experience from start to finish! GROUP ARRANGEMENTS -- Anthony, the chef and owner, was very accommodating in pulling together a dininig package that was affordable and flexible enough for diners to make individual selections. He even arranged to process individual checks, which a welcome surprise for a 20+ group. Thanks to list of nearby attractions and shopping that Anthony provided, diners were able to explore the neighborhood more for pre- and post-dinner activities.SERVICE -- Upon arrival, we were greeted with our tables ready and customized menus.  The server (I forgot the gentleman's name) was very pleasant, accommodating and fast considering there were 20+ in our party.FOOD - The appetizers were great (best Calamari, I've eaten my share). My entre Cappellacci di Zucca (pumpkin pasta) was outstanding, as were the Cappellacci all'Aragosta (lobster pasta) and Spaghetti and Meatballs that I sampled. You know you've eaten good Italian, when even a simple (spaghetti) tasted special.Anthony arranged a dessert platter, which was a great idea because all the desserts were so delicious it would have been hard to pick just one.  RECOMMENDATION -- I highly recommend this restaurant. It's just a short cab or subway ride from the Loop and downtown hotels and worth the visit. It would be a great space for groups, particularly their lovely outdoor seating when it gets warm. Locals and tourists alike should not miss Sapori Trattoria.
