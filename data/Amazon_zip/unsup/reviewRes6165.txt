Just went here last night to celebrate a friend's passing of a very important test. Loved it! We started with the chopped salad, which was excellent. I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself, it was so good. I had the filet medallions with horseradish, parmesan, and blue cheese crusts. All three medallions were cooked perfectly and extremely tender. I think the parmesan was my favorite crust, but I'll have to go back and try the others. The mashed potatoes were delicious as well. Our server was super sweet and gave us great service. Will definitely be back, and hopefully will have room to try some of the amazing-looking desserts!
