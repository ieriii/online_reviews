This place has everything! Great food, awesome atmosphere, helpful and friendly staff.My boyfriend and I had a Cuban and steak sandwiches, along with an empanada. The sandwiches were fantastic! And the empenada was fresh and delicious.The waiter as well as the manager made sure we were happy and also informed us of an upcoming event at the restaurant. You can tell they are all about service and quality.90 Miles is a must eat and I know I'll be back many more times very soon.
