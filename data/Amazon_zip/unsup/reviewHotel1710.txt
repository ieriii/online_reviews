One word: classy. The first thing that sounds out about this place is the decorations. It's decorated like a tripped out Ikea mixed with some urban castle madness. Michael approves. They charge $45/day for parking. In their defense, this seems to be about the going rate for the nearby garages. Still, Michael does not approve. I arrived way before check in time and they didn't even mention it and got me into a room right away. Michael approves. As others have mentioned - they have essentially a free happy hour every day. Michael approves. I had something mailed there ahead of when I arrived. They didn't think they had gotten it till I harassed them about it (being that tracking showed it delivered) and then they finally found it. Michael definitely does not approve. They catered to all my bizarre demands (even the one regarding pigs blood and goats), and even turned down a tip when offered. Michael approves. When you call them - there is no "dial 1 for this, dial 2 for that". A real person picks up. Michael approves so much. So very much. Free Internets. Approve Michael does. Comfy beds, comfy rooms. Michael approves. I expect to return.
