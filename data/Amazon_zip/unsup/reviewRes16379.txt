Well, someone has made me smile. *wink* *wink* Carnivale. I actually was surprised that I was as pleased as I was when I left last night. I had been here before, about a year or 2 ago and we did not have a good experience. (I wasn't Yelping then) So when my friend picked this place to celebrate the 3 birthday dinner, I was a little concerned. "Oh no, our drinks and food are going to suck" I thought. Props to the staff last night. We arrived at 8 and my friend told us reservations were for 830. They were actually for 930. Luckily, they hooked us up with a table quickly. The drinks were perfect. The red snapper I had was so tasty. I don't normally eat fish that looks like fish but I put all my reservations aside, went for it and guess what? It was so tasty that it made me smile. =)
