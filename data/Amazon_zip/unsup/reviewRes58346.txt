Friends who live in Andersonville suggested Hopleaf on one of my first trips to Chicago, and I must say, I was not disappointed -- except for the service. Being an east coaster, I'm lucky to be surrounded by the likes of Monk's and The Abbey (Philly), as well as Max's Taphouse (Baltimore), where 200-300 beers and dozens of good Belgians are the norm. I'm reasonably well-versed in beer styles and brewing methods, so when I go to a place with a great beer selection like Hopleaf and say to the bartender, Hi there. Do you have any good dubbels on tap that you would recommend?, I don't expect to be greeted by rolling eyes, a slight sigh, and a moribund Just look at the beer menu and tell me what you want. Sadly, such was the vortex of discourtesy that surrounded the middle-aged, blond-ish female bartender. When I gave a bit of a grimace (without saying a single word), I then got an authoritarian verbal lashing of watch it... be nice or be gone!. I placed my order and reverently placed my money on the counter, a la the Soup Nazi.Fortunately, once I actually got the beer (happily settled for a St. Bernardus Abt 12 brown ale), sat down with my friends, and had the great mussels and lamb stew, all was better... until I had to go to the bar again for another beer with a side of surliness.Were it not for the I-made-you-and-can-have-you-unmade attitude, this place would've rated 5 stars; the beer selection, the food, the atmosphere, and the patrons (even when packed to the gills) all seemed great.
