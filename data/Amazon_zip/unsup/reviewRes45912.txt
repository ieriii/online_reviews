Seems like my yelp review won't stop people from going here since it's always packed, but oh well.  I absolutely CANNOT understand why people love this place so much. It's like Cheesecake Factory but with no specialization to draw people (like the 200 varieties of cheesecake that CF offers). There is basically ALWAYS a wait to be seated, and the food is not anything to write home about. I've had the French Toast, Crispy Sesame Tofu, and Wild Mushroom burger. The french toast was too sweet for my taste, and a little soggy, and the tofu gave me serious heartburn. The mushroom burger was decent for a veg burger but not spectacular. It seems like Grand Lux Cafe is the kind of place where they throw so many random types of foods on the menu that they can't make any of them well. I would recommend looking for a place with more character and a smaller menu, so there is a higher chance of something on the menu being delicious.
