Caro Mio is in my 'hood and BYO so I desperately wanted to love it. Two stars for attentive, friendly service and a cozy atmosphere. We started with the bruschetta. The flavors were fine, but the tomatoes were so watery that it soaked the bread, making it impossible to pick-up. It was also a bit pricey at $11. I ordered one of the specials: tortellini with peas/shrimp in a spicy marinara. As soon as the plate was set down, there was an overwhelming citrus smell. Instead of the sweet tomatoe-y flavor I was hoping for, the sauce was actually sour. I later found slices of lemon cooked into the sauce. I wish the menu would have listed that. The pasta was delicious and the shrimp were fresh and cooked perfectly.  My bf had the lobster ravioli with cream sauce. Again, the pasta was awesome and the lobster filling was great - the sauce was the problem. It was so sweet it almost tasted as though it belonged on a dessert. We did our best to salvage the dishes by periodically taking bites off each other's plates to counteract the acidity/sweetness of our own dishes. Our bill with tip for an app and two pasta dishes was $72. Too much to not be "wowed".
