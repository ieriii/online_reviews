There are so many really good-looking places in Greek-town and I don't know if I would've been able to choose if I didn't see Greek Islands on the Food Network.  My girlfriend and I went there on a nice summer evening and got nice seats outside. There were SOOO many tasty-sounding things on the menu, so we both decided to get two-item combos. They have a nice option where you can get half portions of certain dishes to create your own combination plates, so you get some variety. Between the two of us, we had the Moussaka, the Pasticchio (a nice baked pasta dish), the Gyros, and the Leg of Lamb, which also came wih our choice of baked vegetables or rice & potatoes.   The first three things were all very tasty, but the leg of lamb was a bit underwhelming. The portions were huge and we had more than enough food to eat the next day too.  We also had a shrimp appetizer (with feta cheese and tomato sauce) that was good, but a little but not too special. Overall, I would give the food somewhere between 3 1/2 to 4 stars, but the restaurant gets extra points for 4 things: 1) Free Parking (which is available at a few other restaurants around there too) 2) Bottomless glasses of water (the guy seemed to be there whenever the glass got around 1/2 full, but it still didn't feel like he was hovering) 3) Large Portions!!!  4) No wait at all (and a nice outdoor section) I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars (if I could), but it just didn't quite reach 5-star level. Highly recommended though.
