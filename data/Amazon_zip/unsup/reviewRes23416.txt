1) Solid taverna fare (as usual the lamb dishes are the strongest....highly recommend the lamb rosamarina) 2) Efficient service 3) Free Valet 4) Reasonable prices That pretty much sums it up. If I'm looking for dinner in Greektown 9 times out of 10 this is where I end up, especially after losing Costa's.
