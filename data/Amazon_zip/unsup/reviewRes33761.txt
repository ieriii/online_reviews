I love love love Sultan's and stop by at least once a week for my falafel fix. Everything i've had here was delicious, but the spicy falafel is the way to go. I dont think I will ever find a falafel i enjoy as much as this! The only thing is that they serve is cold, and i like it hot, so I take it home and heat it up. The hummus is especially delicious too! The staff is very friendly and fast, and the food prices are comparable to fast food chains (cheap!).  Deliciousness wrapped in a pita!
