I went here with a Korean friend and a few other friends. The food was pretty good, but I didn't think the quality of the meat was very good. All the little sides were interesting, but again, nothing amazing. Maybe Korean BBQ just isn't my thing, but I don't know... I had an "expert" at my table doing the cooking, so I feel like it should've been better. Considering how much I paid, I think I should've gotten more food and better quality, especially since we were doing the work of actually cooking it. It was definitely an interesting experience, but I would never go out of my way to eat there... and if I was invited to go again, I would only go for the company and not the food.
