Lockdown's theme seems to suggest it's criminally good. What about the crime of being simply average!? I find you guilty on multiple charges! Hoisted on your own petard. I wasn't expecting versimilitude and I'm not a prison expert but what does heavy metal have to do with being in the slammer? And the volume, great...we always wondered what it's be like to dine at a dinner theater production of "This is Spinal Tap!" The decor left a lot to be desired as well. What's with the weird lights and post modern fixtures juxtaposted with jailhouse decor? Felt like we were in a Skinamax remake of "Caged Heat." We ordered: Mac and Cheese with bacon and green onion Good The Jailhouse Rock burger Whoever thought bananas go good with a burger should sit in the time out chair. But I suppose we deserve a spanking for ordering it. But we are still just accessories to this crime. Punk Bitch Nothing to write home about but I wouldn't trade my bitch for a pack of cigarettes (apparently that's what they do in prison, I saw an episode of "Oz"). The service was great and beer list decent. The Mac and Cheese was the bad azz of our meal. Lockdown's not sinfully good, not villianously bad, I'd go again for a conjugal visit.
