The Air and Water Show is TODAY! What better way to celebrate than a rooftop pool party? So what if it isn't my rooftop... or my pool... I'm bringing delicious, delectable Crisp chicken to share and wearing a cute bikini- this city is MINE! Bill Murray is going to have to skydive into it... Move over Daley, there will be some chicken for you too... but don't hurt my self esteem by paying more attention to the chicken. I know... I know... the challenge!
