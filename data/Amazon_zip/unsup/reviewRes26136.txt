We tried the baked Salmon special, which was really good. Tamarind soup with shrimp was very flavorful, in a good way. I tried my friend's Shrimp Satay which was delicious, with crisp vegetables and a delicious sauce - she opted out of the fried and breaded shrimp, which I would recommend. The mango smoothie with coconut milk was awesome, large rich enough to pass as dessert.  Loved the watermelon for dessert. Quick, prompt service. I'll be back!
