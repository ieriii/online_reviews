I have been ruined for life by Sultan's Market, but in the best way possible. No other falafel sandwich comes close, believe me. I pretty much abstain, knowing I will just be disappointed, until the day my beloved falafel sandwich (don't forget spinach pie!) and I are reunited. It's cheap, the delivery boys are hawt, and it is by far the BEST Middle Eastern food you will ever have. I'm serious. The only downfall is that you will never be able to eat a similar meal from anywhere else, AGAIN. Order the spinach pie and falafel sandwich. That's it. Okay, you can choose a beverage too, and maybe a vegan cookie. The portions are big, so you could potentially eat half of your meal and save the rest for later. That, however, is not my style. I like to eat everything in front of me, NOTHING LEFT BEHIND. I do not believe in the rule of thumb about eating slowly as to feel full faster. No, I like to get in there and finish everything before my stomach catches on. And then feel uncomfortable for hours. Oh, I love waking up every morning to myself! Sultan's Market, I miss you. Dearly and completely. Especially those boys behind the counter! Swoon.
