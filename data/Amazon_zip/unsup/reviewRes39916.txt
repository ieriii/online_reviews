My boyfriend and I go here a lot, and it's especially convenient since it's in our neighborhood. I've been to restaurants where the servers frequently stop by the table to see if everything is okay. This is great but not when we have our mouths stashed with food. At San Soo Gab San, we always grill our meats since it comes with 23+ side dishes... and you can ask for refills with a charge. It's just as pricey as other korean bbq restaurants but our excitement peaks because of the side dishes ;) Their rice is a PLUS!! Best place to go but it can be very packed at night.
