In a sketchy area if you venture south. Dark and shadows lurking around. Then you turn the corner onto Fulton market and voila....wall to wall Gastro fans! Highlights were: the Lost Abbey's Red Poppy ale, spicy pork rinds (like huge cheetos), best grilled octopus outside of Barcelona Glad we did not get the half chicken. The portions are huge. The larger portions are at the bottom of each menu section. The steak tartar with raw organic egg was like how I remembered the dish from Paris. And the complementary bread was warm and homemade! BUT YOU HAVE TO SHOUT TO BE HEARD! Or sit on top of each other like the diners at the communal table. It was a fun atmosphere even though you couldnt hear the music or your spouse.
