This place was delicious. Really really delicious. Had to wait a LONG time, but the margaritas were good enough to hold us over. If you make a reservation, do so well in advance! When we arrived, the bar was already full and we had a 2+ hour wait, so we ended up standing in the corner for most of it. If I recall properly (this was last summer), the wait was actually shorter than they told us. Either way, the food was amazing and I will definitely be going back (after making reservations, of course!).
