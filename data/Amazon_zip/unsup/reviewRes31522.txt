I absolutely love the Chicago Diner. I have been going there pretty faithfully for the past four years. Of course, I dig any place from which I can order ANYTHING, but my love for this place goes deeper than that. I've ordered the gyro and the chicken sandwich to my enjoyment, but by far may favorite thing to order is the rueben. It is luscious, savory, scrumptious. I fantasize about its glory often. I recently found a version of their recipe online and made myself at home to stellar results. Their desserts are perfection. I once devoured a German chocolate cupcake better than any cupcake I had ever had before. Mmmmm. Service too is exemplary. The people that work there are very friendly, offer suggestions, and often (pretend to?) think I'm funny. Lovely! The only thing I dislike about the place is their bathrooms, which are down a narrow hallway to the kitchen. No matter how much I try not to be, I am ALWAYS in the way.
