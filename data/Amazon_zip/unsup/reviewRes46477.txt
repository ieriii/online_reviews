This place is too damn busy, and the hype is too damn high for what this place really is...an over-priced burger joint. Ya, the atmosphere is cool; however, it's totally cut-off. Is it a bar? Is it a family restaurant? Is it a tourist trap? I have no clue. I just don't like it here. The salad bar is amazing...so I've heard (I have not seen anyone order a salad here). the burger was not CRAZY awesome like all the poster/bus ads may lead you to believe. The seats are cramped, the waitresses/hosts are dippy/ridiculously under-trained, and the menu is not THAT impressive. I really expected more from this place. I suppose its one of those places where all the little tidbits add up: Poor service, dumb staff, mediocre food, small spaces, no elbow room, slow service, no parking....ugh...it just gets to you. It IS close to the zoo, though....so if you're starving and need a beer before you go home to shut the kids up, then I imagine it's an ideal location. the only reason I am providing 2 stars is because the service was not horrendous, and the soup was pretty good.
