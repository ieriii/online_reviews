Over rated. its prices you would expect for location and ambiance but would i pay the $ to eat the quality of food served?? NO for the type of rest. in the city i really expected a much better quality of sushi/rolls. At best i would rate it a 3/10. I have had sushi buffets serve better rolls than this place. The other "meat" dishes were also very mediocre and very forgettable. I believed i tried the braised beef long rib. Looked delicious but unfortunately i felt like i was just eating a plain piece of meat i cooked up myself from jewel osco. I could go on and on about how disappointing this rest. was but its almost not even worth the review itself. Save yourself the money and go else where. For those that did enjoy the place... your palate is very easy to please or you just might not have one. :p
