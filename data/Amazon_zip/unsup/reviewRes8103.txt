Spacca Napoli proves it's not only the Jewish delis with their black & white cookies that care about racial harmony, because they're reaching out to bring together humanity with their black truffle & white truffle oil pizza. Here in every bite my palate rung out, "I have a dream, I have a dream." Th Spacca staff handled our dozen-large party really well. Staying attentive to the multiple germ-o-phobes at the table (that's me) by replacing silverware instead of letting them rest on the patio table. The self-slicing route they take here breeds community, so if you like your tablemates it'll enrich the experience, or if you're with strangers it'll enliven it all a bit. Serving a whole pie doesn't disenfranchise certain toppings sticking together & puts that titanium slicer in our own hands to control our own destiny of being triangle or square or circle? slices. The curly haired Italian gent introduced me to "Chinotto," the finest mid-day non-alcoholic bevvie I've had -- a soft, slightly bitter, carbonated citrus caramel-y soda. This seems to be a campaign to promote tourism to Naples or Ravenswood...'tis working!
