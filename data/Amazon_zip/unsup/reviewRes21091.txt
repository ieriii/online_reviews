Knowing there is usually a wait, we arrived at 3:00pm on a Saturday thinking we would be in between lunch & dinner & skip the lines. well not quite, we still waited 43 minutes. Congrats Rick Bayless for crowds all day long. The lines did give me plenty of time to study the menu inside & out before I ordered. It is sort of a goofy system for ordering & sitting but what do I know. After our wait, we were given a number & then we ordered. At that point we were directed to a table & waited for our food. It seems like the turn around could be quicker as there was a good deal of down time between our meal, dessert & hot chocolate. On to the important part, the food. We ordered The Saturday special sandwich of Goat Meat, the Veggie sandwich, a bowl of soup, 3 Churros, a cup of Hot Chocolate & 12oz. local Chicago beer for a total of $48. The soup was very rich & tasty with chunks of avocado, zucchini & potatao-maso dumpling. But the broth got a bit overpowering with what seemed like a salty beef bouillon taste about 1/2 way through. The sandwiches were very good as were the Churros. They have a corn tortilla taste to them but it works. I look forward to trying more of their food in the near future.
