I've been to Hopleaf a few times now and I've yet to have anything but an awesome meal. I dined here last night and was impressed yet again. They have, hands down, the best mussels in the city. Which I recommend you enjoy with a Goose Island Matilda. We also enjoyed the app of the day, Octopus Two Ways. It blew me away. It was absolutely fantastic. My dining parter enjoyed the lamb stew and I had the rack of wild boar. I'm not really into mushrooms. At all. But the chef's use of the morels was very, very well done. In fact, it changed my feelings on the fungi. I highly suggest you enjoy a meal here. But, by all means, DO NOT SKIP THE MUSSELS!
