This hotel is hugeeeeee. Stayed here for my anniversary trip with my bf. Got a good deal thanks to travelzoo, $99/night? Hell Yes! Had an awesome view of downtown, room was spacious and clean. Had a working safe (a must for when I go on trips). The hotel was in close walking distance to Michigan Ave. and the River. We used the gym, it was quite a walk but I guess that's because the hotel is enormous. Overall, great hotel!
