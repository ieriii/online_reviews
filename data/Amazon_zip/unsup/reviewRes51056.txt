Let me start by saying I've been to Big Jones numerous times before, and have always experienced outstanding service, and the food is consistently fantastic. Unfortunately, today when I went in by myself, not so much. I told the host I was eating by myself, and he looked at me like I had the plague, and then treated me as such. I was sat in the back of the restaurant by the bathrooms. The waitress came up very politely and took my order. But from then on I was SOL. My coffee and water were filled on an afterthought-basically she'd come back to serve everyone else, then would remember that I was back there as well and top my beverages off. My favorite part of the meal is the pillows of love or the beignets. Usually light and airy topped with powered sugar and piping hot-turned out to be doughy lukewarm powered messes. After a long wait for my food(andouille sausage with greens, sweet potato biscuits, all topped with a sauce), I dove in. Another disappointment. The andouille was overcooked and rubbery, the greens were over-salted; the only thing to save this mess were the biscuits and the yummy sauce. I love Big Jones, don't get me wrong, but I doubt that I will make a trip back-well at least not by myself.
