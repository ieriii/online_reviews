We did not have a reservation, but were quickly seated at two seats at the bar. We enjoyed an Effen cucumber martini and a few ginger margaritas! They were perfect! Our meal consisted of the following appetizers: ribs, black mussels, beignets with shrimp, and raviolis with chicken and vegetables. The service was excellent. The atmosphere was comfortable and cozy - and we saw casual and black-tie attire in the restaurant. For larger parties, reservations would be a good idea! A definite destination restaurant! The only thing keeping me from rating this 5 stars were the tough ribs!
