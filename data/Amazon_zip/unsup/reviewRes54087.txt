Rick bayless: Enough said - the man is a genius and there isnt one bad item on the menu. Rick has a passion for local, quality and often organic ingredients. He never loses that in any of his resurants, including the two in Ohare which share many menu items with XOCO. That top chef torta, well you can tatste one and see why rick is the master! FACT: you havent lived til youve had bean to cup hot cocoa -it will give you muliple g spot orgasms. I miss this place greatly in NYC
