The place was dirty, the service was bad, food quality and presentation went done the toilet. I knew the owner who came from Chengdu China. But he is so involved in other business deals, he has no time to take care of the restaurant business. What a shame!! Only place for people who have no clue what is real Szechuan (or Sichuan) food!
