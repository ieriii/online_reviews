Organic food makes me warm and fuzzy. I never would have thought that Southern cooking and organic go together! Most southern foods are loaded with heavy ingredients but Big Jones' fare doesn't fit that bill.  Ingredients melded together light and perfectly.  We came on a weekday hoping for their brunch menu. Unfortunately they don't serve the full brunch menu on weekdays but they do provide some options of brunch items on the menu.  Starters: Fried green tomatoes and an organic beet salad. Delish! The fried green tomatoes weren't heavily breaded and the remoulade with pickled shrimp was a perfect complement. The beet salad made me a believer in beets! I didn't realize that mustard dressing w/cheese and beets make a great salad.  Drinks: pomegranate sweet tea, ginger sweet tea and a hot tea. The sweet tea came in a cute carafe and had the syrups in little cute cups that fit on top of the carafe! The hot tea was also in a cute setting, so much attention to detail.  Main entrees: Eggs New Orleans, Eggs Alexander, and the 2 egg breakfast. We also asked for sides of red beans and cornbread stuffing (no cornbread stuffing so they brought us tasty cornbread which was a welcoming substitution). HOLY food-gasm!! Everything was superb; hash browns were crispy, pop overs light and not too doughy, eggs perfectly cooked, crab cakes had a good amount of crab, cheesy grits were nice and cheesy. Portions are big, we had so much food leftover!  Didn't have time for dessert, we were on a time constraint. The service is a bit on the slower side but it would have been a nice welcome if we didn't have to be somewhere right after. They pay close attention to detail and let you enjoy your food, no rushing here.
