Black Truffles...drooling still. I cannot even express or find enough words to decribe how delicous Alinea was. I would be happy to eat scraps that fell on the floor! I am not one for the upscale -sitdown for a long time- and can't wear my jeans- dining experiance. But if you bring me back here I will do whatever you tell me to do. anything.
