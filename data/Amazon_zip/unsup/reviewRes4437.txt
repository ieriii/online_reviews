This is pretty much what I was anticipating: cool jazz, cool crowd, champagne cocktails and going next door to grab a snack that we could bring in as we enjoyed the music. Great place to grab a drink on a chill but late evening. Just remember there's no talking while the musicians play or you'll get sushed pretty quick.
