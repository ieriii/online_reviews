The Good: The food & service are absolutely remarkable. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good place for a family outing or even a romantic date for two. You are constantly served new portions/items by various waiters. You really will try every piece of meat imaginable at this place. Also the salad bar alone could be a restaurant, it's beautiful. The Bad: The price, I think they're a little over priced, BUT they always email 25% and sometimes 50% off coupons.The Ugly: The ugly is that this place is not next door to me, so I could eat their everyday
