As a stay at home mom, I often watch Rick Bayless on PBS and drool over his creations. However, after my third visit to Frontera, I have to say, I won't be going back. The food is good, but maybe it's a little too pretentious and loses some of the fun of Mexican cuisine.  At my most recent visit, we waited 2+ hours for a table, which was somewhat expected, so I won't complain about that. When seated, we first ordered drinks and appetizers, probably the best part of the meal.  Our entres took a while to come to the table, but while we waited, we took the opportunity to people watch some of the most bizzare specimen Chicago has to offer. It seems that the stranger you are, the better the service you will receive at Frontera. Be sure to wear a fuzzy hoodie, red printed T-shirt, paisley pants, and silver shoes, order everything off the menu and send it all back. Speak with an accent if at all possible. While I jest, there is truth to the fact that the staff was much more attentive to regulars and/or friends of the restaurant. The tourists and regular folk weren't worth five-star service.  The entres were disappointing. Mine came with a side of plantains, which were cold...maybe because my plate had been sitting in the kitchen for too long. The steak was also a little rubbery, although the seasoning was great. My husbands dish was good but didn't wow us.  We opted to skip dessert. Nothing on the menu really grabbed me. The drinks and appetizers were well worth the wait, but the longer (and longer) we sat, the more annoyed we got with the crowd and the ass-kissing by the host/hostess staff.
