Wife and I went for Restaurant Week (reason # 62 why Chicago is a seriously cool city) . First off, the options for the prix fixe menu were very nice but the rest of the menu had so many tempting items we almost veered off course. There were 4 appetizer and 4 entree options available. Wife had the Pho and Tom Xao Sate (Sauted jumbo shrimp, asparagus, onions & scallions, in a light sauce of sate spice, chili, & garlic) and I had Vietnamese 'ravioli' and Vit Quay (Ginger marinated roast duck with tamarind dipping sauce). The food was excellent all around. Very flavorful with good portion sizes. I also had some kind of iced tea with orange that was quite refreshing. The service was very good and it really is a romantic, if somewhat crowded, dining experience. restaurant week has been extended and they have different menu. If you haven't checked it out yet, do it now! If you do go to Le Colonial, make sure you try the mango sorbet!
