We were surprised that our room was available at 10 AM. That's always a plus. We did end up getting a wheel-chair accessible room and didn't realize this until I was taking a shower and water was everywhere. I tend to be pretty clutzy and if it weren't for my boyfriend coming in to hand me a razor I was more then likely going to fall on my ass. We went downstairs and spoke to the manager immediately and she ended up upgrading us to a suite with 2 bathrooms. Woohoo! If you're a girl needing your time to doll yourself up for luxe dinners and nights out - you would be ecstatic too! We also complained about the pool and the gym being an extra fee so she ended up giving us a 3 day pass to L.A. Fitness. The doorman and bellhop were really chatty and seemed to really care about providing great service. Minus the room mix-up I'd definitely stay at another Intercontinental hotel again.
