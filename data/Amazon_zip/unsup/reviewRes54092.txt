I've been in love with Rick Bayless since I saw him on Top Chef Masters. I've never had a chance to visit the famous Frontera, so when I found out about this little restaurant he opened, I was very excited to try it! Let me tell you, it lived up to all of my expectations :)First of all, it's adorable, inside and out. I love the facade with its white and blue awnings and the lettering on the windows--it's playful, colorful, and inviting. I wish I lived closer by, because I would swing by every day for a cup of the Aztec Hot Chocolate, which has chile and allspice in it for a fantastic kick! And the churros, which are perfectly done, airy and light and crispy, are only $1.50 each! On second thought, maybe it's better I don't live too close!I went on a Wednesday, and their daily special torta was pork belly with arugula and bacon. I have a weakness for pork belly, so of course I tried it, and it was hard to keep from drooling, the pork belly was so perfectly done. It was a little to rich for a lunch break, so I didn't try anything else, but I am definitely going to go back. I have my eye on the shortrib red chile soup!
