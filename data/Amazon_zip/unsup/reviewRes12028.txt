love this place...in my neighborhood and food is great. Start with the bacon wrapped dates as you can never go wrong with bacon. As for main course i always get Carne a la Parilla. Not a big drinker but Mojitos seem to be the big thing here. Also they have brunch on weekends and a outdoor patio. Almost forgot...they get crowded after 6
