Molecular Gastronomy.  Overall, don't expect hearty meals. Instead, expect art, presentation, and contrasting flavors that blends. Whether it's the way the food was cooked in front of you, how things bubble, or the contrasting temperature between hot and cold that plays with the taste buds, the whole Alinea experience is definitely AN EXPERIENCE. Three hours of fantastic dining, 18 experimental courses later, and over $700+ for the two taster menu and one wine pairing, I would have to recommend Alinea to any foodie out there.  Is it worth the price tag? Debatable. But hey, you will ONLY EAT HERE ONCE, right? Or at least we will. It in no way can be compared to the hearty big portions at some of the other fine dining establishments, but just for the experience, it's worth a try. We won't come back, but you should go!
