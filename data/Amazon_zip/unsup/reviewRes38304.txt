There are certain things that most every Chicagoan is passionate about. We like our baseball, our hot dogs and our pizza. Everyone thinks that the pizza place they choose is the best. I am no exception and I choose Giordano's. I love the thick flaky crust, the oozing cheese and the thin blanket of sauce on top. The pizza is deceptively filling, so before you eat that next slice ask yourself...do I want to feel like I'm on the verge of slipping into a food coma for the rest of the day? If the answer is no, then drop the slice and take it home for later. If the answer is yes, then pick up the fork and proceed with caution. Either way, enjoy!
