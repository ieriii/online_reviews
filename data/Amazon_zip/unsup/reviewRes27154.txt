Great food tons of flavors. It's like an explosion in your mouth! We went on a Friday during lunch time and our party of five literally waited only 5 minutes for our table. Guess we were lucky! Guacamole is excellent. Venomous beans is a must have. Quesadillas are nothing special and should not be ordered. Spend your money on something else such as the mole dishes. Michelada is spicy and good.
