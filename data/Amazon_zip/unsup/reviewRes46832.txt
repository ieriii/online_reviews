While I have been to Uncommon Ground a number of times, my exposure to the food menu has been limited to a family-style brunch event I attended with Yelp, and ordering bites at the bar, while sampling local craft beers. This is one of my favorite places to enjoy an intimate bar setting, which is comfortable with area seating and a fireplace, as well as at the bar. The clientele tends toward some friendly locals, and the bartender, Andrew is a fun, friendly and efficient mixologist, who knows his brewskies and is always happy to recommend something. In fact, the service team there just appears to be a happy bunch. That always makes a restaurant a better place. The brunch food I sampled at our Yelp event was very good, but I will need to return and order a full meal from the menu before reaching any conclusions there. On a recent Saturday afternoon, there was a good crowd, and nowhere to park in the lot (easy street parking available), so it's a happening place for brunch here in Edgewater/Rogers Park, They also have a big entertainment line-up which includes live music, and once per month comedy show, and a weekly Tuesday night open mike. Unlike the other Common Ground, there is a cover charge here for shows. So at the very least, a great place for sampling local craft beers (most around $6) and bar food, have an intimate time with a good friend or bring a group for brunch. And probably more.
