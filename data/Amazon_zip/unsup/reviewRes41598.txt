Could it be because I was starving and in need of food to coat my stomach after a night of drinking that I find this restaurant really good?? I woke up at 8ish and immediately regretted drinking the night before and not eating after (usually helps me to prevent this hideous hangover). I know the other restaurant that I always go to opens really late which doesn't help when you need food ASAP! Tank Noodle opens at 8:30am!!!! WHOOO HOOO!!! Thank you thank you for opening that early! One thing I remember every time I walk by this restaurant is it is always packed!!! Always have a long ass line!! I used to wonder why *duh selle! * cuz maybe their Pho is good!
