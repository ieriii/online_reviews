THE best pizza in the entire world. I used to live close to Giordano's and it was a sad day when I moved to San Francisco (although I love it here as well, there's just NO Giordano's). Every trip back to the city included at least one visit. Now I see that there IS a way to have the Giordano's experience via mail. Thanks, Larry, for publishing the URL - I'm planning on taking advantage of ordering it soon!
