My family and I spent time in Naples a couple of years ago and went to one of the "legendary" Neapolitan pizza parlors there. I can't say that the pizza here is as good, but its a reasonable copy. The pizza can be a bit too soupy. The service has been good and the decor is welcoming. I believe that the prices are too high for what you get. I think it's OK and wish I could find a more authentic Neapolitan pizza parlor in Chicago. I'm open to suggestions.
