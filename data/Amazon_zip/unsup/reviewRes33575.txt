LOVE this place. I've been here several times.  I go for the roasted chicken with potatoes. I've been bitter in the past when ordering this on a Sunday - and the Senior Citizens have wiped them out at lunch time, when it was the special. I'd suggest making reservations. Great for dates, a little loud, but then you have to sit closer. Vegetarian friendly - vegan gets a little tough. The parking situation can be tough, if you are cheap like me and don't want to valet or take the train. But the place is clean, and has great dim lighting. I've never had a bad seat, but I don't like sitting by the front door or kitchen of ANY restaurant. I'd totally suggest this place. Its not that pricey, and its classy to boot.
