My friend and I ordered a medium special stuffed pizza and that sucker fed us for 2 meals! We got it to go, so we didn't have to deal with the service that people here complained about. However, even though we ordered it to go, we still had to wait 50 minutes for our pizza to be done! Onto the pizza! As a Californian, a real stuffed pizza was a new experience. There's just so much with a thick layer of cheese and a layer of sauce that's just enough and not overpowering. It's a solid pizza.
