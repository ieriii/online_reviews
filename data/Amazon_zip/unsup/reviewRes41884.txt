I just returned to the office from lunch at Ruth's Chris and felt the need to review. I love steak but even I can't eat too much in one sitting so I ordered their Mixed Grill which includes a 4 oz. fillet, stuffed chicken breast, and crab cake for $25. I thought it was a great deal since the petite fillet (8 oz.) alone is $31. This way I'd get to try a little of everything. One of my coworkers also ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer and when it arrived it was still sizzling on the plate! I could not resist and had some. SO WARM N GOOD! When my steak and chicken arrived it was equally delicious. The steak was extremely tender, soaked in flavor, and the 4 oz. turned out to be perfect for me since I usually finish half my fillets anyway. I could see the garlic herb cheese ooze out as I sliced the chicken and it was quite amazing as well. We also ordered a few sides to share: mash potatoes, creamy spinach, and mushrooms. I liked the mash potatoes and mushrooms. The spinach was a bit bland. The service was wonderful too. Our waiter had a great sense of humor which made our visit even more enjoyable.
