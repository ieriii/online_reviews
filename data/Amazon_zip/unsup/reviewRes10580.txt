Beware if you're not a VIP or well-known customer trying out Piccolo Sogno...I went out to dinner on a Saturday night with two childhood friends to celebrate a birthday. Our chances to get out together are few and far between these days, and we look forward to that time. We were rushed by the waiter, Alberto, from start to finish. He might as well have been standing with a stopwatch while we had our dinner. It was unacceptable service from a restaurant with a fine reputation. After our dessert arrived, he laid our bill down and then made a big show of setting the table next to us, and one of us asked if people were waiting for our table. "YES" he said, as if we finally got the hint. Well, upon checking with the manager, there was no one waiting. We were very disappointed by the experience and cannot recommend the place.
