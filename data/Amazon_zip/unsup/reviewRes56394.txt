What makes Simply It among the best is Tuan Nguyen and his attention to detail. I've been to Vietnam a number of times and I am impressed with this restaurant's many vegetarian, tofu, seafood and meat dishes. My favorites - curry mussels or chem chep ca ry, banh hoi tom nuong (grilled shrimp with pasta) and ca kho to or catfish in a claypot. BUT mostly I have curry duck (extra hot). Always fresh ingredients as well as niice touches before and after a meal. BYOB.
