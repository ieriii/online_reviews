Geja's can be a romantic place, especially when they have the man on the awkwardly placed little chair strumming away on his guitar. It is also romantic if you equate darkness with a romantic mood. (This place is dark, believe me. I had to strain to see my family during dinner, and this was actually in the early afternoon.) A bit on the pricey side, I feel like Geja's offers more in the way of ambiance than phenomenal fondue. (For much less, you'd probably have an equally tasty meal at The Melting Pot.) There are some deals to be had though, which might make this place worthwhile. Due to all the hype, I think this is the type of place that you have to experience for yourself to decide whether you like it or not.  As for me, I am on the fence.
