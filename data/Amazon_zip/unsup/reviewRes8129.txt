I love this place, not only because of the meat. The salad bar is amazing. I think I could eat it only for dinner! It has no iceberg lettuce, but is filled with seafood, pasta salads, fruit, vegetables... Everything is fresh and presented really nicely - it's not at all like the Sunday lunch buffet you used to go to after church. All really really good. The meat is also good! We never once had a meat-sword-man (what do you call them?) who brought us cold food. The trick is to catch them with full swords - it hasn't been reheated as many times and it so juicy! I especially liked the sword-man with the grilled pineapple. I got really good at flipping my coaster over as he walked by! We had a bottle of wine, which like everything else, I thought was reasonably priced and very good. After that, I ordered some iced tea - I'm not sure what kind of tea they use but it had a hint of floral and was very good. I also would like to second the comments about the cheese bread - it's really good. This is one of the few places where being fat won't get you stared at.
