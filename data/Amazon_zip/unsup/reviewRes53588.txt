1st the good. The guys(service) were good they were friendly but it seemed to me that as the night went on they were rocked, did see the shots flowing in the kitchen.The ambiance if you really want to call it that could have been better, I feel for the prices they charge they could have a better appearance. The music could be better not a big of rap so that doesn't help, but the volume was very annoying at times we couldn't hear each other and its a SMALL place. The food was good for the most part, they were a couple of items I could have skipped and few I could have more of. The Dr. Pepper thing didn't get it, guess it the chefs favorite thing, rice krispies treats really didn't hit the mark, I mean that something to do at home with the kids. The wife enjoyed it so I will do this like a colonoscopy exam don't want it, but its necessary once a year or every other yr. Its okay went you want something different but personally I like a bit more flavor, juices, in my food.
