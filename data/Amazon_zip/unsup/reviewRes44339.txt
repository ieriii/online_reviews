i've gone here a couple times and i've had some good experiences. i liked the copious amts. of jalapenos in the miso soup, gave it a nice, spicy kick. i had the godzilla roll, eel, scallop, and some other specialty rolls that i don't remember the name, but i made sure to order the spicy rolls...good stuff. i love BYOB and the lack of a corkage fee, but the bartender told me they were getting their liquor license in a couple weeks, so go now if you like the BYOB aspect! they played tribe called quest all night and lots of other hip hop, which caught me off guard as i never before equated sushi eating with tribe, but i'll never complain about getting a chance to listen to them =)
