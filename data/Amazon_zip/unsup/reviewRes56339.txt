Thrilled that the owner of Pasteur decided to come into Lincoln Park with a smaller, affordable Vietnamese restaurant. Spring rolls, shrimp with fried yams appetizer is amazing. Chicken in claypot was alittle off, but we did like the seafood salad & my husband liked his. Our waiter didn't speak English very well, so if you need help with the menu, ask for Twuan, the super gracious owner, or someone else to steer you in the right direction. It's next to Victory Gardens so it's convenient for theatre goers. Service is good, and relatively quick. Love the BYOB!
