It wasn't crowded for a Saturday night, only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table. Its a nice looking place and the view of Michigan Ave was dope. Not much of a variety of food choices but overall it was a good experience. The waiter was friendly and attentive, and our section was classy and quiet. It's a great place for conversation with a loved one
