Holy burrito, batman! I stopped by Garcia's with a friend on Saturday night to pick up some pre-party grub. I ordered the veggie burrito with a side of chips and salsa. I was astonished as to the size of this burrito. Seriously, it could feed a family of four - no exaggeration. In fact, it ultimately took three grown adults to put away this beast. And boy was it good! Not a single ingredient overpowered another. It was a yummy blend of beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, avocado and sour cream. Everything was noticeably fresh and well assembled for maximum flavor. I will be back!
