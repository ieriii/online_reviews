Was thinking about giving it four stars, would never give it five stars (who am I, anyway), but settled on three stars. There are some things that bug me about Graham Elliot. Like that the restaurant seems to try too hard to look casual. Like the bathroom trashcan that is placed right by the wall so that when you step on it, the lid hits the wall so loudly that everyone in the bathroom jolts. Like the hourglass timer that comes with your french press when you order a coffee... We came on New Years Eve for a pretty spectacular tasting menu. I'm not sure if eating on New Years Eve is like going out to eat on Valentine's Day--but I felt like we were RUSHED out of there. We were starving but every time we finished a course, there'd be maybe a 1 minute overlap between them coming to pick up the plates, and bring us our next course. I think the 7 or so courses were plowed through in an hour. Was kinda crazy... Also, something that sorta bugged me was that there were no freebies. Is that just me? I thought all nice restaurants came with freebies. Instead, we had a dish or two that probably should've been a freebie (some grapefruit / earl grey icee on a spoon) count as a course. Kinda ridiculous. Don't get me wrong. The food was great and some of the techniques in some of the dishes were really cool. But at a whopping $125 a head, they should be. Leaving Graham Elliott, we all agreed that it was disappointing, especially considering we were halfway to paying for what could've been a truly memorable meal at Charlie Trotter's or Alinea.
