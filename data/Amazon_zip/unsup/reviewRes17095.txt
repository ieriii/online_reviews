Typical trendy Chicago restaurant. The food is great, but don't expect to have the time to actually eat it. Our waitress, Sarah, literally rushed us in and out. The eating area, is LOUD! Good luck having a conversation with anyone. If you're a single woman in Chicago looking for a meterosexual man, this is your place. And if I was one, I'd have given it 5 stars, but I'm not. If you're a businessman looking to entertain clients don't bring them here. I remember when this place was "The Drink," another cess-pool of meterosexuality that I'm glad is closed. I look forward to the day that Carnivale is no longer trendy and they can cater better to their clientele.
