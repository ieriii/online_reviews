UPDATE TO THE REVIEW BELOW: The owner saw this review and contacted me. Outstanding and honest customer service. He's sending a gift certificate, and will reserve us a table for whenever we want to come back and redeem it. Stellar. Hopefully the good food will really shine this time. Thanks guys ------- I was really excited to try Irazu, because I've heard so many great things. The food was good - really good actually, but not excellent - the service wrecked the experience, and unfortunately the meal. All but one of our meals were cold, as evidently they had been made at different times and brought them out together. That was approximately 45 minutes after we put in a simple order for 4 people. 2 people got the wrong order but were too exhausted and hungry to argue - not that we could get anyone's attention for service. We had to ask for water, ask for our both of our bottles of wine to be opened. Add to that, dirty cups and silverware. SO disappointing. I love casual dining, and the spirit of this place. But the service let things down big time, and I am so sad to say we won't be back.
