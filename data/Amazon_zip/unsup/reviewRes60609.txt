It went to Grand Lux for lunch with a friend about a week ago. The inside looked really nice and the place was really big. But there was nothing too special about it.We were seated right away and our waitress came by soon after. She was really nice, I have no complaints about the service. I ordered a lemon sauce salmon with rice and quite frankly, it wasn't very good. Maybe I just don't have a taste for lemon sauces but it tasted very sour.My friend ordered the waffles and chicken brunch item and she did not look very satisfied. Will I go back for lunch? Maybe. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my selection wasn't that great. However, I think I'll give other places a try before rushing back to Grand Lux.
