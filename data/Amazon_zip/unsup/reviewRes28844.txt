This is the best food I've had in years. I got pork strips with black bean soup, cabbage pickled with lime juice, tomato and avocado. The dish was simple, but all of the ingredients were so tasty and EXTREMELY fresh, this was truly a case of less being more. Not that I EVER wanted to stop eating it oh my god!  The service was good. The wait was long (2 hrs), but it was worth it.  Orgasmically (and organically) good.
