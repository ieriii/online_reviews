I went here for my birthday recently and this place was pretty crowded on a Tuesday night. For a really nice restaurant, I didn't like how the tables were so close together. It seems like this was a intimate restaurant, but then you look a foot away and there's your next door eating neighbor. It's super dark in there, our waitress had to take out her flash light to show us what we were eating. Enough about the ambiance though. The food was all in all, really great. We got the sampler seafood appetizer tower and it was amazing. We got the bone in filet and the recommended sea bass - both which were cooked to perfection. To top it off was an amazing finale of the house butter cake a la mode - OH WOW! ~ but let's just say that with high quality food and flavor comes a high quality bill. I'm glad I went, it was worth it.
