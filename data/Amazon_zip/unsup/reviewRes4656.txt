Man, we just ate so much here that I can't decide if I love this place for the food or hate this place for making my wallet feel the pain. My three friends, Wing L., Vicky L., a non-Yelper (what?!?!?), and I sat down here after a long touristy day in 102 degree heat, and we were absolutely starving. The place was packed, but we got our seats pretty quickly. There's a mix of booth styled seats and communal tables; we were led to one of these tables to showcase the gluttony and Kobayashi-chow down skills were were capable of. One minor niggle about this communal seating... we were a group of four and it would have been nice to sit in two pairs facing each other. However, one of us got seated at the head of the table, while one of us also had to face a complete stranger for the duration of the meal. That tiny detail aside, the food was glorious. We started off with the meat sampler, a wooden board of two types of prosciutto, various chorizo styled sausages, and other yummy meats. Paired with a sampler of three cheeses, and the pork neck bone gravy smear, we dug into this with the ferocity of Vikings at the table. Then we added the fried olives stuffed with chorizo (fried olives are always a delight), the milk braised pork shoulder, the Berkshire Porkchop, grilled octopus, grilled cauliflower, the ham panini, the pan seared scallops, and the wagyu tips. Each dish was well flavored and balanced, and came out of the kitchen in a steady progression. Our lovely communal table neighbors kept looking over with a sense of amazement and I'm sure a tinge of disgust at the amount of food taking up our allotted space. Needless to say, I waddled out of this place, and proud of it. If I visit Chicago again, I'll be sure to stop by again for another great meal. Maybe a little more restrained next time. ;)
