I went here for lunch with a friend during the work week, and it was a good experience. The staff was friendly, gave great suggestions and was quick to refill water, wrap up food and bring the check.  If it makes it seem like I was rushed, I wasn't. I just appreciate lunch places that are aware of the fact that you have to get back to "work" and are quick. It's great comfort food and worth the visit.
