Damn dees rooms are niiiiice. You pay a lot, but you get what you paAy for. I like dee room size and layout. I penned majority of my novel at a desk on dee sixth floor. Dee lavazza coffee store in dee lobby is just dee tops! I don't think I need to mention all that shopping on Michigan Avenue! Damn der are dee tons of stores! I'll be staying here again!
