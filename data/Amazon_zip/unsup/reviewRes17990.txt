Went on a Friday night for a birthday party, fortunately we had a reservation as the place was packed. FYI, they do not sit you until your entire party is there, not a big deal. First of all, BYOB!!! The food itself was really good. We started with bruschetta, calamari and green beans with mozzarella. The bruschetta was good, the calamari was OK and the green beans were awesome. I'm not typically a green beans fan, but I will definitely order them next time. I had the chicken parmesan dinner with homemade rigatoni and bolognese sauce. The portions are HUGE, but they have a $8 split fee, so it's better to just take leftovers. The chicken parm dinner was amazing! The bolognese was fantastic and the noodles were perfect. Definitely one of the best Italian meals I have had since living in the NYC area. The other dinners looked good, but I think mine was the winner. For dessert we had chocolate gelato and tiramisu. I was a big fan of the tiramisu as the ladyfingers dominated the custard in their version. I will definitely be back!
