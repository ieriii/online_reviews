Meat packing district, family style dining, loads of specialty brews on tap and in bottles, valet parking, and a little shelf under your chair for your handbag (nice touch). It could have been louder because of the set up, but it was managable to hear your table talking. Roast chicken atop roasted potatoes, baby beet salad with a creamy ricotta side, roasted corn that makes my mouth water just thinking about it (how does corn taste so good?!), and many other reasons to come back here again and again. (From the same folks who did avec and blackbird)
