The good and the bad.... Pros -Hotel is in a good location. Residential area. I felt safe walking alone outside the hotel. -The beachy/nautical decor is cute! Felt like i was at a beach house w/o the beach.. -Room was clean and the bed was VERY comfy! Couldnt get out of the bed in the a.m. LOVED my room on the 10th floor. -On the 10th floor, the shutters opened to a view of downtown -Most of the staff was really nice! -Lobby/Bar area is really cute -FREE Wi-fi  Cons -My friend didnt specify a preference and ended up on a smoking (4th) floor. The hotel was completely booked so she couldnt change. As soon as the elevator opened on her floor it reeked of smoke. Im not a smoker so it was completely suffocating for me when i visited her room for 5mins. She stayed 3nights and was completely miserable. (MAKE SURE YOU SPECIFY) -The lady w/ the long dark hair was rude. -Ordered room service (the croissant sandwich) for bfast and it was absolutely horrible. Bacon tasted like rubber..Couldnt finish it.. -Cabs rarely come in front of the hotel so you'll need to walk down the block to Division (not far.. just inconvenient) to catch one. -Several bars, a Starbucks, & Walgreens in the area but not many good food choices... we cabbed it to other areas.
