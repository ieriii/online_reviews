Best darn falafel around, just make sure they go easy on the Jerusalem salad. Awesome Lentil soup as well. They claim it is 100% vegetarian, but it sure tastes like it has chicken stock in it to me. We probably eat here nearly once it week we like it so much. Now if only their hummus was as good as Pita Inn, then they'd be unstoppable!
