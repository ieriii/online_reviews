One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I would eat here every week if I could. The roof deck patio is the icing on the cake. The food is so so so fresh and everything melts in your mouth. We order the same stuff every time we go: Burrata or the Ricotta cheese w/ bread Pizza DOC Squash salad (out of season in summer) Burger (its freakin' amazing and on Monday it's a burger & beer for $10!) They have Sophie on tap and so many delicious wines. I've always had the greatest service, with warm people greeting me, and all very knowledgeable. My only issue with the place is its location--I only go to Taylor St. for this restaurant, which is sort of in the middle of nowhere unless you go to UIC. Pay parking is avail on the streets nearby. Seriously, go now, bring a date, or your mom, and you will feel so good afterwards.
