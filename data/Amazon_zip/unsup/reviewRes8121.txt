I truly dislike this place. I had two terrible experiences here and I've had to write them off, perhaps for eternity. The first time, they were so busy that after we waited an hour, they took forever to get to our order. Then they accidentally marked our pizza as "to go" and it sat on the counter for a while which I observed. Our server finally noticed our order was nowhere to be found except boxed up, took it out of the damn box, served us soggy freaking thin crust pizza without mentioning what happened, like I wasn't going to notice. To top it off, since we were there forever (little over an hour), he was trying to turnover our table and dropped off the check while taking the last piece without asking if we were done. Why not just take my wine, too, while at it? Oh wait, the busser DID do that cos I decided to take my sweet ass time paying my check. Needless to say, when I left I was literally angry, but the topping was good and the crust probably would've been good had it not soaked in its own sweat so I decided to give it another go. Repeat experience one in the wait and incompetent and shitty service, resulting in just as crappy product. The couple I brought from the South Loop to try this place gave me the evil eye the rest of the night. Foodie cred, lost.
