This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Chicago. I recommend the Eggs New Orleans-- simply amazing. Also the service is EXCEPTIONAL. The last time we had Eric serve us and he was totally professional, friendly and hilarious! It was my bday and he totally treated us great. Last but not least, GET THE BLOODY MARIA!!!! Best I have ever had.
