God, I love you Piece. 3 Worry''n Ales later I was drunk with happiness and delighted with my perfect tomato and basil pizza. I was supposed to visit you with a boy but I decided to ditch him and go with a best friend instead. Now, I'm going to call said boy back and say that our date is back on because I'll take any excuse just to go back.I might even go with the homeless man I almost ran over swooping into the one parking spot I found because I was determined not to pay your $10 valet. Homeless man and I would have such a great time. Sigh...Your beer is so good that I would sit outside on the curb with him drinking your beer out of a brown paper bag if I had to. The service was great. The bartenders were quick and the people...well, I didn't really notice them because I was drunk. But they had to be pretty cool because they were there too. I can't wait to go back...let me call this guy...or find the homeless man. Hugs and Kisses, Mel
