Wowie. Wowie. Wow. The food is amazing. The chef really knows what he likes, and what works. I had a duck trio. Each different type of duck (pan seared, confit and a sausage) was paired with a very appropriate puree (green garlic, rhubarb and strawberry, respectively), and the flavor was exceptional. Even better than the food, however, was our server. She was knowledgeable and passionate about the cuisine and knew how to sell it and speak to each dish intelligently. But the really impressive part was how she could tell I didn't like my second cocktail. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't my particular taste. By ordering it, I gambled and lost. She saw I was sipping it slowly, unabashedly asked if I did not like it, and gave me a cocktail that she likes instead. Amazing intuition and serivice.
