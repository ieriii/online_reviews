I'm split on this place. I give their Bar 5 Stars! I love their beer selection and this is what keeps me coming back. The food can be really good if they cook it right, but in the 3 times I've been I've see differing results. Nothing is more off putting than a raw hamburger. But they are new and I'm willing to give them time to sort their kitchen issues out. That said, when they do make their dishes correctly they are AWESOME. I'm"m crossing my fingers that the owner get the kinks worked out and this place succeeds.
