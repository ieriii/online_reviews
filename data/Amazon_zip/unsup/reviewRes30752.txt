Ahhhhhhh, love. *sigh* Pure adoration.  As soon as you step into Sunda, you feel like you're transported to this whole other world - this hip, cool, swanky place that you want to be alllll the time.  Thanks to GDine.com*, my friends and I took them up on this fantastic lunch offer (4 courses for $15). At Sunda?! How amazing!  (Our waitress was also fab, friendly and didn't judge us on having purchased this 4-course meal. Love that!) The meal starts out with miso soup or mixed green salad (both fresh and fab) and then California or Spicy Tuna roll. It was a little surprising that you only get 3 pieces of the roll, but I liked the roll because it wasn't too overpowered by the rice.  Since it was still Lent, my Catholic-self could only choose from the salmon or the sea bass curry. I opted for the salmon (oxtail broth and napa cabbage) which was delicious. However, after sampling the sea bass curry from my friends, I decided that that dish was absolutely the winner. You just wanted to keep eating it.  The best deal/part of this meal was the dessert as they do not skimp out on the portion sizes. The bread pudding they have is AMAZING...and I don't even like bread pudding. Once the waitress mentioned that there was taro, sweet corn and some cream in it, I knew I had to order it. It was the best bread pudding I've EVER had...and I was in this major food coma after that.  Loveeeeeeee! *http://GDine.com is pretty cool. It allows you to pre-pay for your meal when making a reservation on the website. You can also pay using as many credit cards as you want. The "catch" is that you have to prepay for tax and 20% tip. (I didn't really mind that as we were scoring an amazing deal as is...and you don't have to worry about splitting the bill after the meal. You know, when all you want to think about is when/how you can take a nap.)
