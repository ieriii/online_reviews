Pequod's is stellar pizza, and an excellent deal. I mean you get a huge personal deep dish pizza with one topping and a draft beer, yes, a beer, during lunch hours for $5. That's absurd. The pizza is legit, the scene is legit, and I quickly became a regular here during lunch hours (and had to walk a mile and a half each way to get here). I miss you Pequod's.
