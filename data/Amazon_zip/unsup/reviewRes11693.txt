I don't ask for much, but when I ask for it, I really want it. I always want real cream with my coffee and a breakfast joint that can't offer that after repeated requests doesn't want my business. The service was totally indifferent, the food mediocre, and no vegetarian options available (not for me, but my wack job vegetarian friend who has a something like entitlement to meat free food in Wicker Park).
