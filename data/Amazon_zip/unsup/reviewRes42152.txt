I am by no means a person who is looking for, or impressed by trendy restaurants, but I found Gilt Bar to be quite enjoyable. It definitely has a cool atmosphere inside, very dark, beautiful chandelier in the middle of the dining room and a decent sized bar if you have to wait for a table. I had no problems making a reservation Tuesday for dinner on Wednesday. However I was slightly annoyed when someone called me Wednesday at noon to confirm my reservation and wanted me to call them back, but when I called no one answered and said they didn't open until 4:30 so I couldn't speak to anyone about confirming the reservation....did not affect my dining experience and is not a big deal, it just irked me. Food was fabulous, absolutely to die for, and a knowledgeable waitress to help explain some menu items was a big plus. I'll spare you the details of everything our table ordered just know that the appetizers were delicious, entrees even better and everyone in my group raved about their food and then we all shared so we could collectively revel in the awesomeness on our table. I will also add that downstairs seems to have an ultra cool lounge/cocktail hour that I would definitely consider coming back to. Plus their bathrooms are really nice and have nice smelling soap/lotion; it's the little things sometimes right? My only complaint was that it was quite loud, but it may have just been the cacophony of everyone saying "YUM" to their dining companions
