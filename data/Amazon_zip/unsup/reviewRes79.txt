ABSOLUTELY a meal to DIE for! On Feb 1st 2011, my husband called Alinea during the blizzard, I was in surgery and as soon as I came out - he called and made the reservation for my birthday, April 3rd. I had been wanting to go here for a while - and we kept missing the dates....so he made sure to get us in. We almost passed the restaurant on the street, because it is so well hidden - and it SHOULD be! Loved walking in and feeling as though we were part of some special secret that no one else knew about! The artworks are stunning and nothing is over the top - everything is gorgeous! It was cozy and fun - and just as much of a treat watching and hearing other people as they received new courses.  From the playfulness and whimsy to the absolute perfection in food - this was just one of my favorite meals of all time. They also realized I had not taken a picture of one of the courses - I was doing this to remember them - and they brought us both another of that course - just to be nice! Spectacular! My husband also recorded the desert process!!! I don't want to spoil any part of this meal by saying "we had this" - so just GO and LOVE IT!  We also celebrated and paired with the reserve wine pairing - costly - but a once in a lifetime treat. I am sure that when we go back - we will do the regular pairing just for the cost savings - but they did not EVER skimp on the wine - and we are talking some very rare vintages, etc. The glassware rocked! I felt special the entire time we were there - and do plan to make sure to go back for other special events.....h'mmmmm....there are some birthdays coming up! :0)
