My favorite deep dish pizza in Chicago! It's so delicious that I always keep a few slices in my freezer, to be prepared for any late night pizza craving emergencies! The caramelized crust is amazing; toppings are fresh and go all the way to the edge of the pan, so you're not left with a giant hunk of plain crust at the end of your slice (a la Giordano's). A medium will feed 3 hungry people, and it's very reasonably priced for deep dish in the city.
