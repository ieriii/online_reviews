I remember when sultans was a convienence store with a little falafel stand in the back and patio furniture inside the store for your to sit on and eat. Sultans is hands down the best mediterranean (quick) food youll find in chicago. i love coming here too, b/c i am vegan, and many of my friends are not, and its a great happy medium for everyone. the food is so inexpensive and you leave stuffed.
