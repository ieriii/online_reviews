I loved this place. Every dish we ordered was spicy. Many dishes push the boundaries of what westerners are comfortable with, but there are some options for picky eaters too. The flavors are bold and diverse, and although most dishes are spicy, they're all flavored in very different ways. Good for vegetarians. Reasonably priced. Service was slow, but the waiter was very courteous, and the slow service was understandable given that the place was absolutely packed when we were there. I definitely plan to come back here, although in general, my experiences in Chicago's Chinatown have all been top-notch. A lot like Cleveland's Chinatown, and in stark contrast, say, to Philadelphia's and New York's, which are hit-or-miss. Chalk it up to the hidden secret that the midwest is actually the cultural capital of ethnic cuisine in America.
