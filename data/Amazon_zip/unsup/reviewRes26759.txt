$6 imports. $4 domestics. Open til 2am. I think the waitress saw me drafting my review on my iPhone then proceeded to compliment my coat. Maybe that made the service better considering what I read about them on yelp already. A friend and I ordered a medium pan. spinach and sausage. it was amazing!! i think i would definitely go back here for the food. not so much for the service. it was meh. i have yet to try The Art of Pizza. i suggested it to my friend but she swore Pequods was way better. i guess ill be the judge of that when i finally go to The Art of Pizza. sounds like a good ol fashioned showdown. dun dun dun! http://www.youtube.com/w hahaha!
