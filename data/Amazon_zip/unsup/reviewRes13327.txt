Holy cow this place is good! I went there for the first time last weekend with a friend. It was a Saturday and sort of a late lunch (2pm or so) and the place was still hopping. We got the second to last table and the seating is pretty tight and center tables close together - but it's worth it. I had the corned beef hash and I think it is the best I've every had! My friend had the banana pancakes and he really enjoyed them as well. I liked the hash so much, I'm thinking about surprising a family member with a surprise takeout order. I'll definitely be back!
