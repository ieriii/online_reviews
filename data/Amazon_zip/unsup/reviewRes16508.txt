This place can kiss my hairy bean bag. My wife and friends went to a great dinner and wanted to have a nice cocktail after at 8:30. After a 45 minute wait we got in and sat at the bar where we ordered, Vodka but were told to that they don't carry vodka??? Are you fucking kidding me? The guy also told my wife that she may as well order rum because that was just a better tasting vodka? Whatever the cocktails were $15.00 a piece and tasted like shit my Grandma drank in the 1950s.. No thanks! Fuck you Violet hour. Nice Graffiti on the outside too? How does that go with your whole... We are a swanky bar that only lets one in one out? FUCK YOU!! never again! YOU SUCK!!! I wish I could give you no stars. Don't bother Chicago this place will ruin your night!
