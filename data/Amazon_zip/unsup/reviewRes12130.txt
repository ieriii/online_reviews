This is a great environment to bring a crowd to.  I came with a bunch of coworkers and had a great time.  The pizza is good, but not the best I ever had.  I heard the beer was great but wasn't able to drink with everyone else as I had to head out earlier to go and pick someone up at the airport. I'd love to go back with friends to see if we can come up with better combos. A coworker choose white pep for one and I don't think my tummy appreciated it. We had other combos of course, but I like to rate pizza places on consistency and will come back and update my ratings if need be.
