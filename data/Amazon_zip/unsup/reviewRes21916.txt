Alright, to round it all out after trying Frontera Grill and Frontera Fresco, I decided maybe the 3rd time would be the charm and tried XOCO. This was not the case. I got the gaucomole, which was fine, but nothing special. I also got the short rib red chile caldo. This was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. Maybe I'm spoiled by all the excellent Mexican food in California, but I just don't understand where all the hype comes from.
