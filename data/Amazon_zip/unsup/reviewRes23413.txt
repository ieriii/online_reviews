Delicious food. Kind of a "hole-in-the-wall" place, but not really. Keep in mind that Costa Rican food is not as spiced-up as Mexican food, especially noticeable in their guacamole, which was a bit too bland for me. Other than that, though, the food is terrific! I had the Casado (steak and onions), my hubby had the Milenesa. Both portions were HUGE, we had tons of leftovers. The Gallo Pinto (a unique blend of white rice, black beans, and spices) is really good, went perfectly with the steak and onions. The cabbage salad (cabbage, cilantro, lime juice, beets, cucumbers) that comes with the entree is surprisingly good, and the fried sweet plantains are cooked perfectly. Oh, and try the Oatmeal shake, you won't be disappointed!
