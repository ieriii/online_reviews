Loved it. Gilt Bar is swanky, sexy, and trendy. Great place for a date, happy hour, great place to take co-workers - very nice. The decor is dark and mysterious with an urban feel. The food and drinks are fantastic. I had a champagne cocktail with St. Germain, and it was very tasty. The cheese with the toast dish was divine - I wrote it down - It's called Triple cheese delice de Bourgogne. Creamy and delicious. I need to have someone hunt that cheese down for me because it WILL be served at my next party...I digress... The pasta dishes were outstanding. The Gnocchi was the best I've ever had - very flavorful. The fries were perfectly crispy on the outside with just enough softness on the inside, served with a wonderful garlic dipping sauce. The brussels sprouts were grilled and served with cheese. The beet salad had a bright citrus vinaigrette, which was really an exciting flavor profile. And the dessert. Can I say brown butter apple caramel cake with vanilla ice cream? It was everything I hoped it would be and more. I'm still stuffed right now as I write this review. Go.
