There are a few restaurants in Chicago that I've heard about for years but have never visited. Le Colonial was one of them, and I decided to finally try it out in mid-December. I have to say, while I've never been to Vietnam, I thought that the food was excellent. I can't say if it's "authentic" French Vietnamese food or not, but in regards to overall yumminess, I thought it was extremely delicious.  I went to Le Colonial with one vegetarian friend and I was initially concerned about the amount of options the menu would have for vegetarians. I was delighted to find that they had a whole vegetarian menu with plenty of options for her. We shared the vegetarian spring rolls which were delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  The only reason why I'm giving this a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars is because I thought the prices were a little on the high side. I would like to go back, but only when a celebration is warranted. It's not a restaurant that we can frequent often.
