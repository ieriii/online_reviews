so i was excited to support our local half acre brewery & try the daisy cutter pale ale. well at first sip it wasn't a hit but as the beer warmed up a little the flavors came out more and i became a fan. not my favorite, but worth ordering again. so now that i'm done reviewing a beer rather than a restaurant, i will get to the food! this was my first time eating at hopleaf and i must say i really enjoyed both the food & the service. the waitress was really helpful and the staff knew their ingredients (major bonus points in my book). awesome onion rings - like hackney's but not as wet/greasy, so better! i ordered the montreal style brisket sandwich and it was really good. the meat alone lacked some flavor but combined with the bread & mustard it hit the spot. my husband got the duck reuben and dug it as well (though ever the traditionalist, he enjoys a standard reuben more). we both loved the frites and though neither of us dip them nor the onion rings into the aioli, its flavor is excellent and would be a great substitute to plain ol' mayo. all in all a friendly bar with awesome beer selections and top notch bar food. we would be regulars if it was just a tad closer!
