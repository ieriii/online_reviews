Went here after another Indian restaurant was way over booked. Best choose ever, food was amazing, service was great. Had the garlic naan , roti, saffron rice, and chicken tikki. Portions are enough to share. Haven't found an Indian restaurant this good since I Chicago. PS The dipping sauce they give you with the naan is addicting.
