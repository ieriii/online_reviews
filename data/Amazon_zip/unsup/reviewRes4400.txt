"turn off your phone and be quiet....$12" .....ahhh back at the Green Mill at last. I LOVE this place. I would have to say that this is the best jazz venue that I have ever been in. Not only is the decor classic with its dim lights and dark colors and woods, but this place is Capone's old speak easy. Does it get much cooler. This place is a piece of Chicago history. Not only that, but they consistently pull in quality jazz. Over the past ten years my highschool buddys have been reconnecting over Saturday's 2:00am- 5:00 performances. Most every Sat night Sabertooth is gliding and sliding its be-bop through the beautiful atmosphere of the Green Mill. Even though I have never loved their name, its obvious that these guys know how to play. This place gets a little packed on weekend evenings, but it opens up after 1:30 or so. So I would suggest the late night for the best experience...and if you are drinking late then don't fear, there is a good mexican restaurant right next store that is open late! The Green Mill is another Chicago historical relic. And best of all, its still alive and well. I will see you again soon. I would suggest that you do the same!!!
