This place is really good. The consistency of the food and service is really what sets it apart from the rest of the Greek town joints. I have been to most of them. They have lot of the same menu items from one to the next and the style of service is similar. The difference here is that I have never had a bad experience at The Greek Islands. I always have a drink in front of me, I hate when I sit there with nothing to drink, my food is always really good and exactly how I order it, every single time. I would recommend this place to anyone. It is always crowded so call ahead and make a reservation.
