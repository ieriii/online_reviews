What is all the fuss about? Long lines, bland food, high prices - and for this people wait forever? Oh, and the "fresh" squeezed orange/strawberry juice that I see poured from a sealed jug ... I guess it was squeezed from the jug . . . I lived in this building for over 2 years and only ventured downstairs when a hangover or the weather dictated and they never failed to disappoint. Even with my 10% tenant discount, breakfast for 2 was always $30 worth of tastess crap. Oh, who said they had the best eggs benedict in the city? Clearly someone without functioning taste buds.
