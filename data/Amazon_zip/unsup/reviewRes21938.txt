I think I found my new favorite place for Thursday nights. 1/2 off margarita pitchers ?! I was in heaven. Not to mention how strong they were! So you're definitely getting your money's worth, and they were mighty tasty. I also tried some of their food, which was to say the least, average mexican food. I usually don't like eating mexican food at restaurants because I always feel like you could get tastier mexican food at cheap mexican places, so the food was just okay. I had chips, salsa, their steak tacos, which was just average, and rice and beans are usually always the same. can't mess that up. I have to say, the margaritas definitely made the food tastier, and my time their worthwhile. I also liked the set-up with the place. I thought it was particularly small until they lead you through this side-door that goes through this tiny walk-way into a completely different part of the restaurant. I would say definitely go with a group, it makes it more fun and adds to the fun, noisy atmosphere.
