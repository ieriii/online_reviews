I've only been to two Indian Buffets in the downtown area. However as far as the comparison between Indian Garden and India House goes, there is really no contest. India House has a buffet that simply dominates. My rough approximation estimates that India House has about three times as many offerings as Indian Garden, and better quality food too. The naan is fluffier, the rice is more flavorful, and oh, the samosas! Plenty of options with chicken and lamb abound as well, and don't forget the simple but pleasing vegetable array right at the beginning of the buffet line too. Extra credit cause they make a bad ass mango lassi. If you are anything like me, I guarantee you will not leave India House without a delicious bellyache of hedonistic gluttony.
