We went on a Friday night, and I expected about 45-60 min wait. When I checked in with the hostess, she told me 40 min and she would find me. An hour later I checked in, and a new host told me that the hostess lied to me, she should have told me it would have been closer to a 90 minute wait and apologized, which I appreciated. Went back 20 minutes later, first hostess was back, the same one who said she would find me at the bar, and she laughed at me in my face when I checked in again, said she tried to find me but couldn't, so she seated about 10 tables before us. If she had apologized, I would have been kinder b/c the food and beer was really good. But her laughing in my face was unnecessary and embarrassing. We got the red pizza and goat cheese app. They were out of the IPA beer when we went - kinda weak. We got some others that were pretty good regardless. Overall, won't be back - food/beer wasn't good enuf.
