The Chicago location of Grand Lux Cafe (http://www.grandluxcafe.) was the 2nd or 3rd location of this Cheesecake Factory spinoff to open. (There are currently 7 locations). However, it's a definite upgrade to it's big sister, with fancier decor - kind of Versailles-meets-Vegas upscale glam - and a huge, lucious menu. I'm absolutely addicted to their "potato spring rolls" - a lighter alternative to potato skins - and their huge Polynesian salad. No matter what you're in the mood for, you can find it here. Food presentation is outstanding. Of particular note are their desserts, which are huge and tasty. I'm not sure that they actually need that 30 minutes they always say they do for some of the desserts or that's just a marketing tactic; I've ordered some of those "last-minute" and had them come out more quickly than 30 minutes. But those desserts are so worth it, especially the beignets. (GLC beignets could not be mistaken for Cafe du Monde's, but they are incredibly delicious). Lunch specials are reasonably priced and hearty; dinner portions are huge and worth their cost (most dinner entrees are $9-17). Brunch here is good too; and for an extra treat, get their fresh lemonade. The only complaint I ever have here is having to wait - and there is almost always a wait - but sometimes I simply order up for takeout and solve that problem! I've probably been here at least 20 times and keep coming back for more - great food, good service, beautiful decor, and a good location - if you luck out, you'll get one of the booths along the windows that overluck Michigan Avenue.
