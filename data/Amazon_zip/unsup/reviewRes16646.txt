This is my very favorite place in the city to have a cocktail. I laugh now thinking back to my first visit: driving past it several times before I figured out that painted plywood facade was the entrance. It's a special moment walking through that velor curtain for the first time and being wowed by the French Victorian decor. Taking a date to hold hands beside the fire is really something. The drinks are amazing. They are strong and complex. There is the occasional amazing sustenance special: the beef cheek empanada has been my favorite. In any case you can't go wrong with the cheese plate. I can best describe this place as magical. Even the background music is awesome.
