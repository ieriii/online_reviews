This place is an awesomely good time. They have some very inspired rolls and everything is super fresh. We had fatty yellowtail and my chirashi was amazing. The pieces of fish were a good size. They have a large selection of dessert including specials. If they have the chocolate cake on special, I would definitely recommend that. The tofu appetizer was also very yummy.
