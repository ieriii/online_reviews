The "Meh, I've experienced better," rating sums up my experience for Mercat to a T. I went for the Sunday Brunch this morning, $25 gets you 4 items off of the tapas menu and bottomless cocktails, or 5 items and no booze. I'm not one for 11am alcohol so I went for the 5, although I tried a few of the cocktails others had at the table. I found the food to be overly oily, and greasy. The bread used on the sandwich entrees seemed to be bussed in or bought at costco, it wasn't anything to write home about. I've had shrimp and grits down in the gulf region and loved it. I know there's butter in grits, I know thats what you have to do to make them palatable. This place apparently felt the need to throw two or three sticks of the stuff in. The chorizo hash was heavily overdone. The garlic shrimp seemed to be a bit underdone. I tried to like this place, I really did. The cocktails I tried seemed to follow the old adage "how much sugar can I put int this before they notice there's not discernible taste?" I skipped the deserts, although for $4 for unlimited trips up there, it probably was the best value.  I bring this up for this reason, and this reason alone. I was charged $4 for about 8oz of weak iced coffee. $4. It didn't taste like anything special, for all I know it could've been folgers or store bought ground starbucks. I don't know why I was so blown away by this. As for the ambiance of the place, nice location, although it seemed that four or five different interior designers had fought over the space, and few things seemed to go hand in hand, in a non-ironic way. The service was incredibly slow and unorganized, I just wasn't impressed at all.
