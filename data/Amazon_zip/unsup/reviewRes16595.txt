Great place to go just in case the guy's (or girl's) number you got when you were hammered turns out to be a coyote ugly. You can sneak your ugly date away by sitting in the super high-backed chairs and maybe they'll even look good under the practically non-existent light. And I agree with Carol K. that it's like Alice in Wonderland.  Psychedelics? Maybe next time. Aside from that, it is a bit annoying that it takes 15 minutes to get a drink, but they are tasty. I love the huge chunks of ice. Yeah, it's expensive, so it's obviously not a place to go when you want to get good and tipsy. But it's still worth it for the rest of the ambiance.
