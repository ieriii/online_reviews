I enjoyed the ambiance until I paid closer attention to the exposed brick wall. I'm not saying that it needs to be so clean that it looks fake, but at least let me eat without wondering if some of it's diseased-appearing mortar could cake off and work its way into my food. That's not character, that's just gross. I was less and less enthralled with our seated position near that wall. Thankfully my cute date and a nice painting offset that a bit. Service was average, but the kitchen was doing its job noticeably well as food came out promptly.Overall I've had better food elsewhere (like ceviche at El Barco and ropa vieja at Cafe Laguardia). These were not as close, so the location for this type of food is convenient, but I won't be craving a return. It lacked flavor for the main proteins in the entrees (pistachio chicken and ropa vieja), and excelled in its random sides (like beans and mashed potatoes). Their drinks, however were 4.5/5 stars. Hard to find good caipirinhas, and they've great ones. My face was like :/ when the bill came. A bit higher for the quality we received overall, but the effort in the food is evident.
