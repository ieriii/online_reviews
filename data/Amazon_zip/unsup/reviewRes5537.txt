Went here for a late lunch on a summer Friday (read: boozy lunch). Ordered the roasted corn and beet and goat cheese salad - so good. Actually, we have stumbled upon a great combo of flavors - the corn with mushrooms salty and savoury, the beet and goat cheese salad with pistachios light and sweet. Mmm-mm. We followed these up with dishes my husband ordered - both unsuprisingly from the "fried" section of the menu - fried green olives stuffed with chorizo and proscuitto bread balls. Tasty. While we were nomming on these tapas-sized treats, a giant beignet passed by - apparently a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate chips and topped with powdered sugar. OMG. (I don't even use that type of internet term. LOL and whatnot.) Will definitely be back to try the smears and plates, but hopefully we'll have slightly better service.
