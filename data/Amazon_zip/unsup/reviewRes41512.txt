3.5 stars: Good pho and once you're seated, quick service. I heard so much about this place that I tried going twice before, but Tank is closed on Wednesdays and closes at night earlier than I expected (9 or 10pm). That's how I ended up trying pho at Pho888 and Pho Viet first. Honestly, if I tried Tank's pho first I probably would've thought it was the best as it gets in Chicago and not tried another place, but I rank Pho888's better (the broth is richer in flavor and not as watery). Perhaps Tank was a bit over-hyped for me. In any case, Tank does serve good pho and has an extensive menu. It's usually busy so sometimes the wait for a table can be long, but the servers are quick to get your orders and the food comes out fast.
