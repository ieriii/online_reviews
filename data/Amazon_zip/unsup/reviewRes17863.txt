You kinda have to look for the handle to find the door, we got there early at 6 and waited an hour and a half to be seated but it was well worth the wait. The hostess is humorous and nice to talk to while you're waiting. Once inside you begin to undertand why it's worth the wait. It's a vintage feel with beautiful white crown molding, pastel blue walls and giant wing back chairs creating a feel of intimacy. The gregorian style chandeliers and dim candle light add to the appeal with american folk style music playing in the background. The drinks are strong and meant to be that way so keep that in mind. And as previous posts say it's all about the ice. The chunk of ice in my drink was massive and it's all about sipping and taking your time. I have to admit I was apprehensive of egg whites in my drink, but that with the bitters and of course the rum was amazing! I have fallen in love with the "hour of hush" and cannot wait to go back. I definitely advise getting there early buddying up with the hostess and leaving your number to grab a bit to eat at one of the great restaurants in Wicker Park while you wait for a table. They'll take your number and call you when ready. Drinks run 11 to 12 dollars here and they can make virgin drinks for the non-drinkers in your party but the drinks are definitely worth it. Ask your server for suggestions based on the alcohol you love. Enjoy this step back in the 18th century England; sit back, sip and stay a while!
