The problem with Hot Doug's is its WAYYYYY to close to me so I am always tempted to go. And why not when you have maybe the nicest owner around running the register. That guy is always in a good mood , always polite, and ready to answer any question or tourist hesitation.To add insult to injury the prices are WAYYYY to reasonable. And the other kicker is everything is WAYYYY to delicious. I have not sampled the whole menu but everything I have had was excellent. If its up to me I go with the straight up Chicago dog with everything on it, cant go wrong with that anytime. The fries are perfect, I have never tried the Duck fat ones but I assume they are good. As for the location itself the place is clean colorful and always busy. I may have to go this weekend now that I am thinking about it again.
