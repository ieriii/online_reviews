I live in Chicago but am planning to move in the summer of next year. As the city is known for its exquisite food I compiled a list of great restaurants I needed to try before I left town. At the top of my list was The Purple Pig so for my 21st birthday on Monday I decided this was the perfect place to celebrate. Other reviewers have noted that you cannot make reservations, which is not something I took issue with. My two friends and I arrived around 7:30 and were told we would have a 60 minute wait for a table. Not an issue. We put our phone number down and waited in front of the restaurant for about 45 minutes. I went in to check on how much longer the wait would be and was greeted by an extremely rude hostess who not only rolled her eyes at me but also let out an audible sigh after I asked my question. She told me the wait would be AT LEAST 30 minutes and when I gently reminded her that she told us we would only have an hour wait she shoved the clipboard with the wait list in my face and said "I have to seat ALL of these people before I can seat you". I walked back outside to my friends and we decided that it would be best to try and eat somewhere else as it was clear we were not going to be seated at all in The Purple Pig. We didn't take our name off of the list and never received a phone call informing us that our table was ready. I really really want to love this restaurant but I'm blown away but how rude and unprofessional their service was--and I didn't even have a chance to take a seat and try the food. I'd like to go back and try again sometime but I'm feeling extremely discouraged after the events of my birthday.
