Foodie Alert! This is just the place to try when you're looking for a great meal, hip but comfortable new place without a "scene". Although prime reservation times are still hard to come by without a lot of notice, you can always be seated at one of the communal tables. Can't help but give a thumbs up to the garlic popcorn, like everyone else..but the little Chinese take out containers with caramel corn was a nice take away. I had the fabulous venison and that cheddar risotto. Can't say enough about the pork belly. And that drink list is a breath of fresh air. The dining environment has a really warm feel despite the sleek and cool interior. The best thing about this restaurant? Not only are the combinations unique and oddly perfect; it's that Graham is a talented chef who seems incredibly humbled by his success. What a treat!
