After getting the Seoul Sassy wings for the first time, I decided that I should try out the BBQ wings as well before I rated this place. Well, needless to say, despite the messyness of the bbq sauce, they were fantastic. But the Seoul Sassy is still where it's at. Do they sell this in bottles? Cause I'll buy it first thing if that's the case. Goddamn. I want some seoul sassy wings right now!
