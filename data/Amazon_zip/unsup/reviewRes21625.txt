Alright, so we found XOCO by accident, we were looking for Topolobampo (ridiculous name by the way) when we ran into it. When we found out that Topolobampo was a reservation only restaurant we decided to eat at XOCO.  Here's the setup: When you walk into XOCO there's a HUGE line, we waited about 35 minutes to get to the front of the line-it was packed. While we waited we did however get two of XOCO's Agua del dia's (water of the day) this day's flavor happened to be a Papaya, mint, and lime flavor which well a little sweet still good. There's also a self serve water area for you to get either sparkling or flat water. When you get to the front they give you a table number marker and you order your food. The thing I found pretty cool is that the line is for those waiting for a table only. Once you have a table you are able to go straight to the front of the line if you want to go back to order more food.  The Menu: The menu isn't very big, it's basically soup and sandwiches (caldos and tortas) and you're only able to get the soups after 3.  Food: We didn't get very much food because we were thinking of going back into the line to get the caldos after 3. So, we only ordered chips and salsa, and chips and guacamole, and the pibil. Personally, I really liked the food, but it was expensive. The pibil's bread was toasted and crunchy but not rock hard, and the suckling pig was very tender and delicious. Bill: -chips and guacamole -chips and salsa -2 agua del dia's -1 pibil ------------------------------- about $26.00
