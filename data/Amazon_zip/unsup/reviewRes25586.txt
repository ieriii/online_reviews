My friend who was born and raised in Chicago took me here to change my mind about New York pizza being better than Chicago pizza. However, when I tried the deep dish here, I was disappointed, not because it wasn't good, because it was delicious, but because it just doesn't compare to NYC pizza. I explained that if I need to eat pizza with a knife and fork, the concept of pizza was lost. Although I did get very full from just one slice. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. The beer cold and refreshing. The pizza fantastic. The price is right. I can understand why this place gets such good reviews and I did enjoy it, but it reinforced my preconceived notions.
