When I die, heaven better be The Chicago Diner. My non-vegan friend took me (vegan) for my birthday and the wait staff treated us so warmly. The food was amazing - the Reuben was out of this world! And the chocolate chip cookie/cream cake was to die for! The only problem is that the wait can be brutal - we couldn't get in on a Saturday night but went for brunch the next day with no problem (we got there early!) --- just love this place! Well done friends!
