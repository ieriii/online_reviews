We must've hit this place on the most random of random Fridays, as the wait today was only about 10 minutes. Awesome. Good start. Charming Doug at the counter, also as foretold. But maybe I just read too many reviews, and heard too much about this place. While it was good, I didn't feel like I was eating food blessed by an angel or anything. The duck fat fries were tasty, and bizarrely addictive. We couldn't figure it out, they didn't taste much different than any other fry, except they were less greasy, but still - we cleaned the bottom of the cardboard. I had to try a regular hot dog, pretty poor and it fell apart. We also had the spinach & feta - meh. Too many olives, not too much taste. The standout was the rattlesnake sausage. That was top notch. I'm sure we'll be back, it's a kitchy place to take out of towners, but I'm not rushing to get there. Unless I figure out there's a sausage I like better than the spinach/feta, and then this whole review will be up for review.
