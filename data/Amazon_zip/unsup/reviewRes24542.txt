This place is the BOMB! And the consistent wait on any given night proves that. I actually grew up with the family who opened this establishment...so I have been eating with them for a very loooong time. I was fortunate to grow up on Miriam's food BEFORE Irazu was born and I must say, they sure know what they are doing. Delicious. And oh those oatmeal shakes are to die for. I always crave them. Always. Since moving out of the neighborhood, I try to eat there as much as I can and was over the moon when they started delivering to the University Village area. But sooo much better to eat there when it's fresh, BYOB and with the friendliest owners and servers around. Ok, now I want a milkshake.
