This restaurant does not deserve the good reviews it is given in Zagat. The atmosphere is cold to the point of being almost sterile, the service is haughty and the food is only so-so. It does not compare with Nomi, Trotters, Les Nomades, Spring or even North Pond. Seriously, we have been there for dinner three times - only once by choice - and it is totally not worth its 28 food, 27 decor, or 28 service rating by Zagat. Do not waste your time or money.
