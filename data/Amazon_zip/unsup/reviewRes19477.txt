I went back and forth on my rating for The Gage between 3 and 4 stars because I wanted to be honest and admit that Gage isn't perfect, but, you know what? I really really like this place. Admittedly it is crazy-expensive, and, truthfully the food is nothing spectacular, but, all that aside, I love the atmosphere and vibe of The Gage. There's something cozy about it, and it's a great late night spot for drinks. It's great for drinks anytime, really, but late night was my favorite time to be there. The food isn't anything spectacular, but I did love the smoked salmon appetizer and the fish & chips, and the burgers. When they first opened they had the most delicious, decadent, savory side dish on the menu: goat cheese risotto with escargot..heaven!! I'm guessing they discontinued that dish because diners were immediately rushed to the ER for a bypass after consuming. I really went there for the drinking scene and the drinks themselves. One of their signature drinks, the Maestro, was my 2nd top favorite behind a greyhound with freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. The combination of mashed strawberries with maple syrup and (shock!) balsamic vinegar made for a delightful concoction. I haven't been there since our move from the area, but, it's the type of place that I think of fondly and will make a point of visiting when I'm in the area.
