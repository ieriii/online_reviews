My wife and I went to celebrate her birthday. We heard a lot of positives, but had no idea what Las Tablas was about. Simply, it was terrific. The service was great (never late with a beer) and the meals were delicious. Not Colombian we asked for the most popular native dishes. We were not let down. So many flavors and combinations to go with our steaks!!  We look forward to going back and bringing friends!
