Went last week to see what all the fuss was about and was I disappointed. It wasn't terrible but for those prices it should be the best in Chicago. The menu was probably the biggest let down as it looked like something from the 50s. Steakhouse have changed over the years but I guess Mastro's didn't get the message. The food was ok but soooo boring, nothing exciting to order.  The Martinis were also crazy expensive($19). The lounge was hopping and kind of fun if you are over 60. I guess there is market for that but I would rather go to a real Chicago Steakhouse like Gibsons if that's what I'm looking for.
