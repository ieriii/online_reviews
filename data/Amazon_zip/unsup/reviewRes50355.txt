So, I was really excited to check this place out. We went for a friend's birthday. I will start by saying that I didn't have any food because I ate before I came over. I really wanted to try the menu because a lot of it seemed right up my alley. It's a reason for me to come back though. So I was at the bar and didn't feel like spending a lot of money and opted for the 40 of the week. Not bad for $8.00, as long as you don't mind drinking a 40 out of a paper bag.... which is fine in my book. The crowd wasn't that great, but it was a Wednesday. I will have to come back on a weekend and eat. Then review it again. I must admit from my experience I was a little disappointed though.
