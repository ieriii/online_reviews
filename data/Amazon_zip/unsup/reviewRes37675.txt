5 stars for the amazing beer menu; 4 for the food menu (maybe it deserves more if you happen to like fish/seafood - I took my Dad there and he loved the mussels). Any place that has a beer menu that is SEVERAL pages longer than the food menu immediately attracts my attention. Some friends took me and the missus there last year, and I couldn't believe I'd not discovered it before. Needless to say I've been back countless times, and it is always a place to which I take visitors to Chicago. If you're going for the first time, get yourself a pint of Kwak - you won't be disappointed.
