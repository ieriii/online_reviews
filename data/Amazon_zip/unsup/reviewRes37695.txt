Yes, F&O is a pricey market, but it has some of the best gourmet products you'll find in a great atmosphere. Clerks are very helpful, and their puddings and pre-prepared foods are phenomenal. There is a fresh olive bar, olive oil and vinegar tasting stations, as well as a wide selection of cheeses and wines, chocolates and baked goods. Be sure to try their pudding [in the refrigerated, not frozen, area] as it has Valrhona chocolate in it and their butterscotch is pretty much heaven. Now with valet!
