Hit or miss! The wait for the food is usually a good 30 minutes. I usually get the special flank steak and always request medium rare for my meat. Sometimes, it was done just right, medium rare and it's sooo good. Couple times, it's usually overdone and hard to chew on! The flavor was delicious, but the overdone meat just kills it. The empanada and the dipping sauce a must try! (try the sampler with chicken, beef, and cheese) The homemade lime juice is really good, but it comes out when you are almost done with the food. The fig dessert was not pleasant.
