It's one of my favorite places in the city- I love the cheese and the wine and they have really cool events like a Movie and Dinner night and Wine Classes. I have learned more about wine from the staff at BIN 36 (and bin wine cafe) than at any of the other wine bars in the city that I have visited, they make it fun and easy and are always willing to share a taste of a wine that I'm interested in but don't want to commit to. I must say I usually sit in the casual dining area or at the bar and have never had dinner in the dining room. But, the food is always good and the wine is terrific!  Check out the dinner and a movie, I'm a regular at that one and its always a great time.  If you haven't been here you should try it- it's on my top ten places and I'm picky.
