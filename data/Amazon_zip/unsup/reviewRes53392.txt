The food is unbelievable. Everyone said it all already, but I will say one thing different than others...I've been here 4 times, and each time I saw people taking pictures of their food -- it was really weird when someone asked if they could take a picture of MY food. Get ready for a really different experience here. I don't remember art being on the walls (but maybe there is?) -- what I remember is thinking WOW - the art is on my plate!My perception of the place was different based upon who I brought -- 4 different people. Go with someone who appreciates fine dining and someone who doesn't mind eating unusual food.
