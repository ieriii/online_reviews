Sigh. I know somewhere out there there's someone looking for a place to take his/her beloved for a special night out. Please look no further than Geja's.  You'll be able to see from the photos, but the place is somewhat small (occupancy around 50) and dark enough to keep your private moments somewhat private (that means a stolen kiss now and then, NOT A FULL BLOWN MAKE-OUT SESSION. I don't care how hot you and your partner are, get a room). Also, there aren't kids allowed (though I've seen some brought in before) so you don't even have to worry about food flying at you. Prices are somewhat pricey for a person on a budget to go here regularly, but when you splurge... So the food is great, but don't be fooled; fondue isn't just cheese and chocolate. You'll be cooking your own meal in a pot of hot oil. The wait staff will let you know exactly how, but how well the food turns out is very much your responsibility. Don't worry if you, like I, didn't do so well; they have a large assortment of sauces to cover up your little foibles: Dill, barbecue, yellow curry, honey mustard, teriyaki, butter, horseradish, and one that I can't remember. I won't say that the sauces are special, because I don't know anything about sauces, but I was just thankful that they were there. They only accept reservations for 5-6 o'clock, and if you want a booth it's first come first serve. But I do recommend trying for a booth if it's a special night. Parking is difficult, but they do have valet ($9 as of August 24, 2007). That's all folks, enjoy your meal.
