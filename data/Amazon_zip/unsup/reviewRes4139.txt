I don't have a ton to add to all the other reviews. My only advice is go. Just go. Reservations actually weren't a pain in the ass - I called every 15 minutes or so on a Tuesday starting at noon - they answered the phone on the second try. Bring a variety of wine that goes with everything. They'll pair it for you. Embrace the music. You might find something you like. The menu last night was amazing. The chefs do a wonderful job of making traditionally "icky" food accessible. Octopus? Don't mind if I do. Chicken liver risotto? Didn't even know I liked chicken liver that much. Plate after plate was pretty much licked clean by everyone at the table. Highlight of the night was the baked potato soup - complete with bacon mousse and sour cream puffs. Don't forget to stop by the restroom to say hi to the chefs - and catch some of the action in the kitchen.
