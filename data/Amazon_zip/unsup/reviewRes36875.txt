I LOVE THIS BREAKFAST RESTAURANT!! (Sorry that had to be on caps Haha). I went to this cafe a few times last year and I always got the mango smoothie with my order. So delicious! All of the food we ordered was really good, customer service was excellent, the place was wonderfully lit and clean. It's definitely a bit pricey but I wouldn't mind visiting once in a while.
