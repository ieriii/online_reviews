Crisp gave us a great lunch in the middle of the day! Small order of Seoul-Sassy Chicken-- $9.00 Mini-Buddha Bowl-- $6.00 Two cokes-- $4.00 The chicken was by far the star of the meal. It was sweet, sticky, mildly spicy and very, very crispy. The Buddha bowl was nice, and the service very prompt. Plus if you're lucky there will be an interesting conversation happening next to you at the communal tables. If you're looking for a totally sweet, cheap and casual meal, crisp is totally worth your time.
