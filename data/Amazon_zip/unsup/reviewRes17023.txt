An acquaintance took me here and it was a beautiful surprise. It's like a hidden treasure that everyone knows about. The entrance was my favorite part. The one drink I had gave me a little buzz, and was sour at first, but still delicious (blackberry caipirissima) . The lighting is nice, old timey. I even like the bathrooms! I will be back here again. However, it is not intimate enough for me, the chairs are close but the way they are seated is different. Maybe I'm just used to facing the person.
