Lively atmosphere and great drinks. The empanadas were pretty good... they are $2.50 each or 6 for $7.50... so get the 6 that are cheese, chicken and beef. The combination platter was more than enough food for two with big appetites or 4 that want to sample. It came with different types of plantains, skirt steak, chicken, beef ribs, chorizo and a potato. The ribs were a little dry, but the chicken and skirt steak were phenomenal!  I found the prices to be very reasonable and enjoyed the friendly staff.  I heard it was BYOB but showed up on a Friday w/ wine in my hand but was told that it is only BYOB Mon-Thursday.  Enjoy!
