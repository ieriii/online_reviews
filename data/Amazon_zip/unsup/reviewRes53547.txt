Simple, reasonable priced, and exceptionally delicious. I've ordered a variety of items off their menu, and have only been delighted at what I've received.The chicken is incredibly crisp and moist, the bowls are reasonably healthy and full of flavor and the sides are up to par with the rest of the menu.A friendly staff and casual environment make this a great place to grab a bite in the Lakeview area.
