LOVE this place. I am a huge fan of Italian food and this is great, It's BYOB, which I love as well!. Definitely plan to come on an empty stomach. The portions are huge. I almost always get the Chicken parm special and it is AMAZING. It's homemade and full of those tasty but not so good for you ingredients. :)
