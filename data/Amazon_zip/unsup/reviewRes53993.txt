I visited this place recently due to really great reviews from my friends. The ambience can be described as a subdued elegance and I really enjoyed the intimate feel you get as soon as you walk inside. I had the plumb & sour cocktail which to my delight was absolutely perfect. The cheese plate I had left a little to be desired because it really didn't present anything extraordinary. Otherwise my experience was great and I would definitely come back again.
