Went here for the first time with a group of friends, some of whom were visiting. We had been partying all day so this maybe wasn't the best place to go, but we had fun. (Besides my friend falling asleep, and refusing to wake up). However, this place has me on both sides of the fence. Very Cool atmosphere, great place to bring some friends or a date, and the two cocktails I had were awesome. very crafty and delicious. However I understand why people find this place to be a bit arrogant, and pretentious. Although I think the main factor in my displeasure was the arrogance, and the super long wait to get a drink served to me. Either way this place is fricking cool, and I will be back.
