We went to XOCO on a weekday for lunch. After walking there from the South Loop we worked up an appetite. There was a line when we first arrives but overall didn't have to wait too long. I had the Pipito Torta -- basically short ribs with onions and pickled jalapenos. This with chips and salsa and churros for dessert were amazing. I could eat here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and never be disappointed. We need to go back and have the salads and soups which looked amazing! If you go you have the have the churros, amazing!
