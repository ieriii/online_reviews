Can't be wrong with South american food! The ambiance was descent and the service was good. The portions are big enough to fill the most hungry guy. The sangria was awesome, there are some days that it's half the price!... you can get one to go :). Try the "Entraa" medium rare, it was delicious!... the steaks melts in your mouth. The "pulpitos" (grilled baby octopus) are out of this world! Weekdays are no big deal, but weekends nights might be busy, so pick up your phone and make a reservation, otherwise you will find yourself watching people eat while you wait. Parking is so easy, please do not valet, unless you like to lose 8 bucks.
