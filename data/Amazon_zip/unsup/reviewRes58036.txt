Heavenly! I love Mia Francesca. Easily the best pasta I've ever had, and I'm not a big pasta eater. The fresh bread with the basil olive oil starts my dinner off right every time, and the food along with the atmosphere is always excellent. I agree with a previous reviewer who said it gets pretty crowded, but that's how you know it's good!
