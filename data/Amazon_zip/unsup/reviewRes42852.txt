porkbelly porbelly porkbelly!!!! Every restaurant should serve this, Gilt Bar def did its justice. The atomosphere was modern and romantic. The drinks were unique, very light, girly The mussels were also delicious, dip some bread in the sauce, soo heavenly! A good spot for informal dinner or just to lounge with friends for fancy pub food and drinks the portions are def meant for sharing
