Protip: Are you reading this review prior to making reservations here? Open a new tab, go to their site, and register for their e-mail club. I believe you get 25% off just for joining, then once a year or so you get a 50% off coupon. A bunch of us came with 7:30 reservations and half off coupon in tow. On a busy night, expect to still wait about half an hour even if you have reservations...blah... But hey, once you're in, game on. I recommend the rare steak, bacon wrapped filet, and thin-as-you-can-get leg of lamb (avoid a thick piece). It's not all top-notch quality cuts...I was disappointed at getting jaw ache a couple of times chewing some tough pieces. The solution is thankfully simple...flip that card to green and get a new piece of food! Our waiter was a fun guy (who asked if we needed a second stomach or a bed), and the meat servers tried their hardest to get our requested cuts to come by our table. Oh, and try to get a table by the two-story wine rack; we were surprised to see someone suddenly doing backflips and twirls in there. Without the coupon it gets pricey, and that extra wait time annoyed us (and probably the 20 or so people in the bar area who were in the same sitch). But for a fun, over-filling dinner, it's hard to beat this churrascaria.
