Yay! finally had my experience at popular XOCO! I waited in line and dined in. Seating wasn't an issue at the time of day I was there and bathrooms are in the center for easy access. Self served water a plus! I ordered Thursday's special carne asada torta, churro w/chocolate dipping sauce and aqua del dia to wash it all down. Everything was flavorful and cost me around $20! If I lived near XOCO I would be going there often for lunch! There's so many things to try. If you're near or visiting Chicago you must stop by here for lunch! Love it! Would love to come back if I'm ever in the city. - Miss yelp 2012
