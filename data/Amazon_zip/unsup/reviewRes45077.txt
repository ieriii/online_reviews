I have yet to eat here but we will start with 5 stars. Reason being, we (4 people)stopped in last night around 7:30 without a reservation. The place was busy and the host was being very accommodating. He said that it would be a 45min wait. He could tell there was some apprehension in the group as to the wait so he offered a few options. We could leave a contact number and he would call us when the table was ready, wait out side or sit at the bar and have drinks and appetizers. The place was busy and word of mouth and Yelp reviews seem to be attracting a crowd.  We will make reservations the next time so I can review the food but the host was very pleasant.
