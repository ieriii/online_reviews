I love Giordano's, but this is something different. Honestly, I think the rarity of Art's Pizza (it being so far away for me) makes it taste all that much more better.  But you know what - G's doesn't have the pan. Art's has deep, thin and pan - which makes it my favorite. I'll go there early and eat a slice of pan while I wait for my deep dish to go. That's sweet. They also have some other pretty good looking items on the menu, like chicken and ribs. I swear I'll try one of them these days, but the pizza is so good.  And they have daily specials! How can you not love a place that has a daily special...I mean, a daily special! One day, after a long training camp for a fight or something, just something to celebrate....I plan on ordering a LOT of stuff off Art's menu, including pizza. I'm talking ribs, chicken, fish, shrimp, burgers, subs, deep, pan, thin...all of it - dessert too. And I'm having a 5000 calorie party for me and my friends. I can't wait.
