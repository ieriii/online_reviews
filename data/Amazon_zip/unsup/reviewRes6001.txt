I am glad to say that I can now brag about having eaten at Davanti. There were several things I loved and a couple of things that I thought were...eh just ok. The Good/Great: OMG TTYL LOLLERSKATZ The ricotta and honey comb would make Yogi Bear sh*t his picnic basket! It was amazing! I also tried my buddies burger and it was like god was rubbing my tummy. The Bad: The chicken was like the diet coke of chicken. I was expecting a lot more flavor here. It seemed like the chicken just didn't take on the flavors that it was cooking it. The Ugly: The polenta with pork cheek ragu was butt fugly but I enjoyed it still. I still gave Davanti 4 stars because the things I loved, I would probably pay a strange man on the street to hand me a bag full of. Lucky for me I can just go back on a Monday and get a burger and a Peroni for $10. Who's coming with me?
