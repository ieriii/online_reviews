Good location and ambiance, ok food.  Went there for an early Valentine's and after hearing all the buzz we were very excited to try it out. The dining area is one large room w/long communal wooden tables and side booths that look like barn stalls- it was much nicer than it sounds. Great lighting and pig paintings. Our bussers were amazing- very attentive and polite- never had an empty water glass or a dirty fork. Our server was bad. He was nice enough, but never around- I ended up w/o a drink w/our main courses b/c we couldn't find him anywhere.  We ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees, way too much food for 2, btw (we asked the server and he said the plates were very small, so it wouldn't be too much). The mussels were good, but nothing spectacular or different. The ham plate (w/all 3) was very good- shaved thinly, lots of different flavors and nice bread. The 1/2 chicken was fine, but over seasoned- delicious fries and summer sausage. The ribs are tasty, but don't expect a typical plate of ribs- no bbq sauce here. They are 2 boneless seared fatty cuts of pork, that are delicious- but it's more fat than meat. We were both disappointed with the experience.
