It's rare that a place lives up to all the hype, and all my girlfriends had hyped this place up so much, that I really expected to be disappointed. But one bite into the toffee banana pancake smothered in creme anglaise, and all my wildest dreams had come true. This is a big deal, because I hardly ever like: A.) Sweet things for breakfast B.) Anything with toffee C.) Pancakes that weren't made by my mom. So you can imagine my delight and surprise when the bite of pancake in my mouth was the single most delicious bite of brunch food I've put in my mouth EVER. I was there on a Sunday with two of my girlfriends, and we did have to wait 45 minutes (which I expected, based on other Yelp reviews), so I brought along my Patience Cap and it was no biggie. We ordered a single toffee banana pancake and a single pear french toast for the table (brunch appetizers - unorthodox, but highly recommended), and then for my ACTUAL meal, I had the sweet potato and black bean breakfast wrap. WHOA MOMMA! It was a fiesta of flavor dancing the cha-cha on my tongue. Cilantro, sweet potato, egg, cheese, chipotle sour cream, all living in perfect harmony. Another thing I don't like, potatoes for breakfast (hashbrowns, or as you Yankees call them, homefries), are just not my bag, but the ones at Bongo Room were fantastic - not at all greasy, just full of fresh dill and LOVE. Believe me, this place is worth the wait, especially since you can browse the nearby shops - but be careful, don't spend all your brunch money on vintage shoes!
