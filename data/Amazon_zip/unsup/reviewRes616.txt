This is extremely expensive. I enjoy a good meal and wine more than lots of people, but this was a bit ridiculous to me. I had the 12 course with wine pairing and it was over $300 with tip for one person. I had some of the best bites of food I've ever had. Each course was very unique with presentation you only see on tv. Upon reservation they ask if there are food allergies and the staff confirms this with you when you arrive. The service left something to be desired. Our waiter said that we could try more of any wine that was paired with our food, but he was nowhere to be found. It was also hard to locate. I didn't see a sign outside, which maybe adds to the exclusive feel of it. I think if it didn't cost an arm and a leg, the service was better, and you felt more welcomed than it would have been a better experience.
