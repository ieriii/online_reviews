So I had really high hopes for The Publican. I mean who doesn't like pork and oysters and beer? And in terms of the beer selection this place was decent. I still think that Hopleaf in Andersonville is tops... but this place is no slouch. My real qualm was with the seating (a pseudo euro style nightmare) and the service which managed to be not only pretentious but also unhelpful and harried in an annoying way... what other way is there... I suppose but still. I think that perhaps The Publican is trying a little bit too hard. I mean I am all for a pork based menu and I will say that the pork rinds were fantastic, but was it worth it?? A resounding no is sadly the answer. This place tries and just doesn't make it. I suggest that if you want heavy germanic-american food centered on pork products and high in fat with a side of beer you should head to The Berghoff, or Chicago Brauhaus in Lincoln Square!
