When I lived in Bucktown, this was my go to place. At least once a week I was downing a tasty falafel sandwich. What I love about this place is that it is not only great for hipster watching, it turns out a quality product at a reasonable, nay , cheap price! $4 for a falafel sandwich?!?! My only complaint is that sometimes they can be skimpy with the servings, though usually the pita is brimming with deliciousness. Also, I've had a few of the guys ignore that I requested a mild sandwich and doused it in sriracha. My mouth was so on fire that I couldn't taste anything for an hour! Nonetheless, flaws and all, I still love you Sultan.
