One of my favorite places in the city. The fish and chips are delicious and served wrapped in newsprint (which is apparently how you get them in England). Their burger "the gage" probably the best hamburger I've ever had. An upscale pub that works as a great place for a lunch with coworkers, a drink after work, or a dinner with friends.
