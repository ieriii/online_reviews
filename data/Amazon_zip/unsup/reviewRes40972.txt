I've dined here twice so far and each time have been completely pleased with everything! Last night's chilled zucchini soup was delish, we loved the little (what i think were) peppercorns that gave the creamy broth a satisfying crunch.  The bottom line is the food is simply outstanding. Everything I have had has been amazing.  My only complaint is that they need to get rid of the paper napkins. If cloth are too expensive, I understand, but maybe get the heavier weight paper ones at least. Service is a little quirky, but that's part of the charm. Go for the food. It's so worth it.  And get a view of the kitchen cause the food's not the only thing that's hot in there!  Yowza! UPDATE: December 2007- Paper napkins are GONE and they have a server now so the darling chef doesn't have to do so many things at once. Hooray! I love to see this place flourish. It's fantastic. Bravo!
