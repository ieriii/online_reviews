I loved the atmosphere!! If you are looking to meet people, DO NOT go here...some strange birds...but, if you're just looking to hang out with some friends, very cozy. I really loved the decor. I don't remember the name of my drink, but it had egg whites in it!! I was more excited about the concoction and its ingredients rather than the taste. The only thing that brings me back to this place is introducing it to new people because I think it's really cool!
