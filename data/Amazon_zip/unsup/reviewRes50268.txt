Ate here a few weeks back with my wife. Overall really good brunch food. I mean, delicious stuff. The French/Louisiana/Creole vibe was great. It's like a high class Wishbone (can hear the owners squirming now).  What I didn't like was the service. We got this waiter kid who just didn't know food. Any waiter that can't pronounce the menu may have to be taken off the floor. He had no idea what most of the options tasted like. He also just made us feel uncomfortable a few times with these strange stares and looks. Eww. Just plain old weird.  I'd definitely go back for the food though. Not too pricey and scrumptious.
