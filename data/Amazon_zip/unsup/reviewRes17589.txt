I always enjoy bringing out of town guests to this place. Has a fun lively atmosphere, bright colors are nice in the winter. Everything I've tried has been pretty tasty. Also large round tables that are great for parties over four people so you can talk to everyone. I'd try to stay on the main level though unless you are looking for a spot away from the main area. We were sat upstairs on my last visit, and were eating out a bit earlier than I usually would due to evening plans. I felt like we were by ourselves and away from the fun for most of the meal until the overflow started to be seated upstairs.
