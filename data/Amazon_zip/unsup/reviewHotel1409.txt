Pros: -Reasonably priced nightly rates -Modern, clean furnishings -Spacious rooms (at least our's was!) Cons: -$53/day + tip to park!! (tip: Drake Parking Garage across the street is $35/day, or there's a self-park garage a block past the hotel at 200 E. Walton that's $29/day) -Internet isn't complimentary ($10/day!! In this day and age where all hotels offer free WiFi, this just seems absurd!) -Horrible rain head in shower made it impossible to get soap out of thick hair! -Unfriendly front desk staff seemed like we were inconveniencing them to check in or ask a question Bottom line: Hotel is nice enough, but the 'hidden fees,' coupled with moody service, make it way overpriced for what you get.
