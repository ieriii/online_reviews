For their third night open for business, this place was pretty impressive from both an efficiency and a service standpoint. The food was excellent - my friends and I tried out the bacon fat popcorn and the wings as appetizers and both were delicious - the bacon fat popcorn particularly was quite unexpected, particularly for a brewery. We also all ordered burgers (the farm burger, working man's burger, and smokehouse burger); the burgers were juicy and tender, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. The beer was also quite good; they had about five on tap to start with, and my favorite of the three that I tried was by far the Iron Fist Pale Ale. The IPA and the Mild English were both also very tasty. Our server was excellent - he was highly attentive, got everything right, and was extremely friendly (despite the fact that every table in the place was packed and there was a giant crowd of people at the front of the restaurant waiting to be seated). The ambiance and decor was also very interesting - the space is large and open, with big windows providing a view to the brewery and an open space where patrons can see into the kitchen. There is also a waiting area up front with some big barrels where folks waiting can stand and have a beer or two (without standing right behind someone at the bar or next to someone's dinner table). Overall, I'd say I'll definitely be back.
