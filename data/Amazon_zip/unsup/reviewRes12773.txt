Mouth? Meet meat! We decided to try Texas de Brazil because if you sign up for their mailing list, they send you a "buy 1 dinner get 1 free" coupon for during the month of your birthday. Why not? It's much quainter than Brazazz and not so bright inside, but more intimate. Of the cuts of meat they were serving that night, the perfectly cooked medium rare filet mignon and lamb chops were the winners. The parmasan encrusted chicken was great too. I really stuck with filet after filet after chop.  As do the other Brazillian steakhouses, you could eaily fil up on the salad bar and can order just that as your meal. But I wanted meat. And I had a ton of it.
