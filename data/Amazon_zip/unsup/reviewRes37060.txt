(Review for grocery only) I was so excited to use my Groupon here...had been meaning to check the place out for awhile, but never seemed to get around to it...thus why I was so excited to stop in this evening. Maybe all this excitement and anticipation led me to high hopes and then grand disappointment. As someone else mentioned, places like these are a dime a dozen in Metro Detroit (where I hail from) and they all do it much, MUCH better. The produce section was a joke...all of the cherry tomatoes were rotting, there were about 3 cucumbers to choose from and 2 bunches of green onions left. The grocery department looked to be mostly comprised of spices and jams/preserves. The cheese selection was nothing compared to most of my Metro Detroit haunts and the cheese man even gave me a big sigh when I asked where the feta was. Sorry dude. You'd think they might want to welcome Groupon customers, who could potentially become regulars, however I was treated as a pain since my order was a mere $7 shy of the $50 limit. It was the end of the world (or so it seemed to the man ringing me up) that he had to suspend my order so I could add on a few goodies. Believe me, this attitude would not fly in the aforementioned Detroit spots...I know because I worked in one while in school. Anyway, save your money and shop elsewhere...I'd take the crowded SoLo Whole Foods on a Sunday afternoon anyday over this junk!
