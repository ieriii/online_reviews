A delicious place to go on a summer evening. The retro decor and setup is very charming. It reminds you of older days when nobody gave gluttony a second though. Try everything! The milkshakes are delicious and the dogs and fries are exactly what dogs and fries should be. And the carside delivery makes me nostalgic for The Varsity down in ATL. It's a great Chicago approximation. Yeah there are places with fancier culinary tricks like Hot Doug's and such, but if you and your friends are cruising around on a warm summer night, this is the best place to park yourself for some goodness. Places like this are just so gosh-darn conducive to good times.
