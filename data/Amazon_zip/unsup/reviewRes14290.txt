Went back this weekend for dinner and it was even better. We expected a wait and was happy to have a waitress serve is popcorn and beers while we waited rather then trying to fit our way to the bar. The wait was not too long for a Saturday night. The beer is great and the food is even better. It is hard to make choices from the menu, they all look so good. The bacon fat popcorn is a must try. The pizza is always good. The cheese dip for the pretzels is divine. The burgers are amazing, the smokehouse is our favorite. They serve a mean pork product. Good stuff, wish we were closer to go more often. Our server was the best and helped steer our choices. The best part of the night was the bill, very reasonable for an evening out.
