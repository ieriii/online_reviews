Just when I thought Chicago had had its share of fancified brunch places that require ridiculous wait times for a seat, along comes Yolk. My friends and I got there at 10 AM and had to wait about 20 minutes. By the time we finished our meal and left at around 11:30 AM, there were seriously close to 60 people waiting for a seat. Ridiculous, I say! So is the place worth the wait? Depends on what kind of tolerance you have for waiting to eat overpriced eggs and pancakes. Now that is not to say Yolk's overpriced eggs and pancakes aren't good. My fiancee enjoyed her Countryside Skillet (bacon, ham, sausage and other goodies) and I was pleased with my Hey Ricky! Omelette (spanish omelette with avocado, chorizo and other goodies). Also, Yolk lets you "upgrade" your boring, normal pancakes to their super duper, specialty pancakes. My fiancee and I took the bait hook, line & sinker and upgraded to the Fruit & Nut Pancakes (a little on the dry side) and the Chocolate-Strawberry Pancakes (sinfully sweet). But all in all the food is nothing special, on par with what you could theoretically order at your local IHOP or Golden Nugget. Another thing to note: because the place is seemingly always jam packed for brunch, service can be very spotty. Our server was friendly and what not but we didn't like having to constantly remind him that we needed refills on our coffee. Since the place is like a zoo, I can't say I was surprised but it definitely didn't make for the best brunch experience. So I guess Yolk is worth a try if you have never been there before but definitely don't judge the place by how many people are waiting for a table.
