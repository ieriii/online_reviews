Great place to go with friends. Superdawg has an old fashion drive-in where you can order jumbo sized hot dogs with "pickled-tomatoes". The fries there are yummy too. Super dawg although is located at a very busy intersection, I would map quest it out before driving there, (if you are driving from out of town). Superdawg also has a very retro unique feel to it, with it's original hot dog statues still standing above the restaurant from all these years.
