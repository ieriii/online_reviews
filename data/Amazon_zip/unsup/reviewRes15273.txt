Still love this place. I suggest you go early if you want to grab a seat. As with other reviews I don't think this place is pretentious at all. There's a not standing rule, this isn't a place to go loiter and hang out but a place for cocktails and everyone must be seated which is why they limit entrance. If you're done drinking, go somewhere else and allow another to share the experience. The cocktails remain the best in the city. Better and more reasonably priced than Aviary. If you go try to sit at the bar for a better experience. My favorite bar in the city.
