There's not a whole lot left to be said that hasn't been already. Quite possibly the best thing you will ever eat on (or even off) a bun. Hot Doug's is the best of the best when it comes to both classic and incredibly creative encased meats. Be prepared to wait (outside, even if it's cold), but know that the payoff is absolutely worth it. Duck fat fries on the weekend are not to be missed. A true experience and the best culinary bang for your buck in Chicago.
