So it's actually a 3.5 but since we don't have the half star option. I want to try it for breakfast before bumping it up to a solid 4 stars though. Friday night a group of us were meeting at Wishbone. There were going to be anywhere from 5-10 of us so reservations weren't going to work. I happened to get there first and explained the situation to the hostess fully expecting that there would be a huge wait for a table and they would make us wait until everyone got there. Instead she pushed some tables together for us and said that if more people come they could always grab a chair or two. That was really nice of them. The food was ok but nothing really special. I had perch which was good, but I've had better. There was pretty much the same sentiment from everyone that the food was just average. We did enjoy their drinks though, those were quite tasty. I have to give kudos to the servers and staff. They were all really on top of things and they did a great job dealing with out party. I'd like to try breakfast here because I've heard it's good but I wouldn't make a special trip here otherwise. If I were in the area though I would stop in again.
