I've been wanting to try out Crisp for a long time, and finally made my way there today. It was a great more "modern" take on fast food Korean and these are not too common in Chicago so I'm glad I discovered it. A desire to be somewhat healthy kept me from the fried chicken but I will definitely be back to try it. I got the Original Bad Boy Buddha boy bowl which was a TON of food (though a lot of rice). The korean-style vegetables were all done well and the Bulgolgi was tasty and didn't have any stringy/fatty pieces that you tend to see in some other Korean places. I appreciated the ability to get brown rice (though it's a $1.50 upcharge). My fiancee got Seoul Sensation Burrito which was essentially my bowl put inside a large tortilla. The Atomic Sauce on the side provided just a hint of heat (not scary spicy as the title suggests!). The one gripe is there could've been more bulgolgi in the burrito and in the bowl, but overall food was tasty and it's a nice change from the million other Thai/sushi places in the neighborhood.
