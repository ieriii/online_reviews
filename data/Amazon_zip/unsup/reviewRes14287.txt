I liked this place. The bartender was great. Nice, attentive, and totally unobtrusive. I had the Bacon Popcorn...crispy sage & shaved Parmesan. They mixed in plenty of crumbled up bacon and it was piled high with shaved Parmesan. It was delicious. The oil and sage collected at the bottom of the bowl....yum:) The only thing that could make this app better is if they just popped the popcorn then and there. That is expecting a lot though. I also ordered the standard burger with a cream cheese mashed potato. It was pretty darn good! I would probably order it medium well next time and not medium. I would also probably get the fries and not the potato. The whipped cream cheese mashed potato sounds delicious until about the 3rd of 4th bite. Then it starts to get a little bit too heavy, and then your mind begins to put together what your actually eating. its good, just a tad bit excessive. bartender - thanks for being kind to me. I can tell that your a total pro.
