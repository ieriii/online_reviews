If you are from out of town, come here for the atmosphere and you will enjoy the food that much more. The hot dogs have a pleasant snappy skin and the neon green relish has the appropriate amount of tang. You really only need the ketchup for the fries. Fries are cafeteria quality and soggy from being stuffed under a steamed bun. Onion petals are over battered and not all that sweet. you basically get a mouth full of cornmeal batter, i would avoid ordering this again. Thick milk shakes are very good but not as thick as advertised.
