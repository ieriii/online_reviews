I love love love Piece. I first checked this place out when I was in college. This was long before every other block in Chicago had a craft brewery, so having their own beer was pretty impressive. The pizza is delicious, although I've only had the white pizza & plain cheese. I cant veer away to try anything else, I love these two so. All their beer is delicious and the prices for a pitcher are great. Hitting up piece early on a Friday or Saturday (it gets WAY crowded but rightfully so) makes a perfect night.
