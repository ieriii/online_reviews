Growing up on the northwest side, it's damn near impossible to avoid ending up at Superdawg at some point. This place has been a staple in my life for many many years and I have much love for this place. The hot dogs pretty much explode with flavor, the burgers are tasty and the atomic green relish really is the only way to roll. Plus, CAR HOPS! Awesome. Granted, the car hops have become significantly less surly over the years, I'm sure with the resurgence of roller derby, that'll change back eventually (because I genuinely miss fearing the car hops... seriously). Over the last two decades, they've made a lot of improvements to the place (including the covered walk up windows, which used to be exposed to the elements year round up until the mid 80's), covered car ports and a dine-in area. All of these things have helped improve the over all Superdawg experience greatly. The reason I give it four instead of five stars is that it's a little bit pricier than other places in the area, BUT, you get what you pay for. Fast service, good food and an over-all fun experience. Also, if you go on the weekends, be aware that a lot of hot rod enthusiasts frequent the place on those nights, so it can get sort of busy. BUT... you get to see some pretty sexy cars, so it's worth the wait.
