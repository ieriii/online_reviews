We were looking for a gastropub in Chicago and we were very happy from start to finish with the Gage. So many of the appetizers looked good we decided to order four appetizers instead of entrees and it was a good meal. The pate board was really good, beef tar-tar was really good. Beer list was good though not spectacular. The table next two ordered sandwiches that looked really good. Definitely would go back.
