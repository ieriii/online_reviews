YES YES YES YES YES YES YES. I have a lot of love for Rick Bayless (he inspired me one night after watching "Mexico One Plate at a Time" to buy tickets to mexico for that weekend) and have dined at both Frontera (in Macy's) and Topolobampo, and Frontera brand gifts are something that I bring my mother who moved to Georgia a few years ago. I work across the street from Xoco and let 3 months go by before I went in. I saw the lines, heard complaints about how there was no take out, cost a million dollars for a torta, and crabby cashiers. But one snowy Tuesday at 5pm, I went over there after work with my roommate and had the most delicious experience. We ordered two tortas and shared them, one grilled and one baked. The Chicken Milenasa and the Chorizo tortas were excellent. The Chicken was breaded but still juicy, in the most delicious sauce, crispy bread-- not too dry and perfectly seasoned. The Chorizo had a great smokey flavor and mixed in with the melty cheese-- almost like the best sloppy joe you could imagine. Both were served with a light cilantro oil and at each table there was some roasted red pepper sauce to compliment the warm -cooked to order- tortilla chips. Nothing says "cozy" like a hot mexican chocolate near a wood burning oven while big snow flakes fall on Illinois street. And, don't listen to the people who say "I don't wanna pay $12 for a sandwich!". The soups (the portions of which are huge) can reach $12, but most of the tortas are about $7-$11. The cost is directly related to the quality of the ingredients and the immense flavor and portion. I'd gladly pay $8 for Xoco torta than $4.50 for the potbellys across the street. Local distributers and LEED certification? Go Go go!
