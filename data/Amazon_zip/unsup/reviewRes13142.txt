This REALLY was NOT the place to go to. We made a reservation with a large group and still had to wait 45 minutes. Their cocktail list is borderline disgusting - there is not one specialty cocktail that does not contain juice or some sort of sweet liquor. The bartender was inefficient and had a bit of an attitude. The service was also disappointing. This was not my first rodeo so I know when you flip your card to green it means you need more food. I don't know if the staff was color blind, stupid, or didn't care. Without fail, every conversation was interrupted by someone ASKING if I wanted (poorly seasoned) food even though my card was red. When mine was green, when asking what the man what he was carving he simply said "beef". Maybe he is unaware that there are several cuts of beef? I had a dirty dish full of bones (ribs and rack of lamb) sitting next to me for almost my entire meal when I had to ASK the waitress to PLEASE take it. It was apparently an inconvenience for her because eyes were rolled. Call me crazy but I don't want to sit next to my own garbage while I am paying for a mildly expensive and average dinner. Our waitress charged us for an extra dinner and forgot to bring us our dessert.  When using the ladies room, there was only one stall that had toilet paper. At 10pm on a Saturday night, that is pretty negligent. To be honest, that was the icing on the gross cake that made me angry enough to write this Yelp Review. I think the only reason I gave two stars is because the company I was in was excellent so it cushioned all of the disappointments.
