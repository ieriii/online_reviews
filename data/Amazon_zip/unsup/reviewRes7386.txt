Went this past Friday and was really looking forward to getting some BBQ without having to drive anywhere. My fiancee and I split the Q3 (pick 3 of their meats) got beans and cornbread for sides. We decided on the brisket, pork, and baby back ribs and I have to say I was surprised by the result. Without a doubt despite all of the great food on our plate, the brisket baked beans were the best thing we ate. It seemed like we had more brisket in the beans than came with our meal which was a huge bonus because the brisket also happened to be our favorite. The 3 sauces (Carolina, Sweet, and Hot) were all good and Carolina was very true to that style but we both ended slathering on the sweet sauce as that's more to our taste. It wasn't their night with the ribs as we saw people sending theirs back but I didn't think they were that bad. Definitely our least favorite but they still had a very good flavor. For dessert, we had milk and cookies which was a simple and perfect way to complete our meal. All in all, we ended up having 3 courses for around 50 bucks which while I agree is kinda high for BBQ, given the quality of the meal, I didn't mind one bit. Would go back for sure. Very cool interior though that's never a selling point for me.
