Good food... But I don't like being a sardine. I could barely hear my companion and felt awkward eavesdropping on the people literally a foot to my right or left. In case you were wondering: To my left - a young professional couple, just starting out in their relationship - excited to go to a concert To my right - two single/divorced 30 somethings gossiping about other couples problems. Too bad I was actually interested in conversing with my date... weird... I know.
