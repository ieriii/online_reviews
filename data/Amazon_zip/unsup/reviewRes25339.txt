Perfect place for a first date, the fondue activity provides a good distraction from awkward gaps in the conversation. I didn't enjoy cooking my own food- it was very fresh and high-quality but throughout the meal I had in the back of my mind "Gee I hope I'm cooking this enough/that I'm not cross-contaminating all my little forks." So I ended up over-cooking things a little. I wish there was an option to have the food prepared for you. I'm a little surprised the whole place hasn't burnt down by now, there were 3 candles and 2 fondue flames on our table alone. The meal was a great experience but for the price ($50/person) I would really have to consider returning.
