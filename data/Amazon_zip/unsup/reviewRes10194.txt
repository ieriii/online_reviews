What makes me take a restaurant I loved so dearly from 5 stars down to 3? Maybe it was the fabulous food that I had the last time that sadly just wasn't there this time. Maybe it was the level of service. Too bad the gorgeous patio setting couldn't steal all the stars because it certainly is a magical city location, especially as the sun goes down. I enjoyed my appetizer of stuffed squash blossoms, and sampled the proscuitto and figs as well. I was practically drooling to have their homemade pasta and the verdict? It was OK. Really there was nothing special and my food was undersalted. Unforgivable. My brother had a few bites of his pasta. The waiter (very busy with 2 bachelorette parties and a slew of other tables) asked how his food was and he said "OK". If you're coming to clear a plate and the majority of the food is still there you know something is wrong. We were able to wrangle in our waiter to get the bill and luckily my brother's pasta dish had been removed. Will I go back to Piccolo Sogno? Its hard to say no because I know how great it can be. Did I have a subpar experience this time? Yes, but the gorgeous patio atmosphere more than made up for it.
