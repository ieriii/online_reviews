My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday, romantic atmosphere but very small. People are elbow to elbow. The bread and cheese appetizers were delicioius and dessert good....BUT the main course portions were extremely small. I couldn't believe, I asked the waitress, is this serving (1 platter) for both of us, she said "yes". Wow. If you plan to spend that much money...food better be more than a couple pieces of meat and when they say table for 2, tables should be at least 12 inches away from the next couple. TABLES WERE SO CLOSE TOGETHER, FELT LIKE I WAS DINING WITH THE COUPLE NEXT TO US. EXPECT TO SPEND BIG BUCKS and NOT BE CLOSE TO STUFFED. Love my honey for making the effort, he spent way too much. Food, wine, tip, valet and valet tip, easy $200.
