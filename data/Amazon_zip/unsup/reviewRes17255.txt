Been here before for the lunch buffet before I learned about Yelp. Recently went for dinner, had chicken 65 (spicy), goat biryani as an entree and a mango lassi. food was very tasty and very spicy. service was good. our waiter was willing to share his opinion about the food and help us with our appetizer selection. *we knew the dinner entree we wanted* Good experience parking slightly inconvienent but it's in the heart of downtown. I'd go again...
