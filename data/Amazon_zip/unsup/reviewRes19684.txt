Delicious, unexpectedly elegant and wonderful! May I suggest: Cubana: Smoked Maple Creek pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack cheese, chipotle mustard. Ahogada: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. Shortrib Red Chile Soup: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime. Guacamole & Chips: Frontera guacamole (so good!!!), tomatillo salsa 3-chile salsa, just-made chips. Churros: Made to order, crispy, cinnamon-licious and wonderful! Plus! You have your choice of still water or sparkling water with lime, gratis. As a devotee of club soda with lime, I was in heaven.
