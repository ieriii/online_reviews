while the food here is quite good, and the ambiance is nice too, you simply CANNOT fuse cuban cuisine with mexican cuisine, like so many non-hispanics think you can. it's just a no-no. the flavors and spices used in each cuisine are completely different, and have NOTHING similar to go off of - except for maybe rice, but even cuban rice vs mexican rice is completely different. this place does have a few traditional cuban dishes (which i didnt try beacuse i actually tried a fusion dish so i cant comment on their tastiness or true-to-cuban form), but any restaurant that claims what they serve is cuban-mexican fusion, i simply DO NOT agree with and i will now pass them over. while i can recommend this place for their good dishes (i only ate here once and what i had wasn't bad) and nice ambiance, i highly suggest you go elsewhere (shoot for the hole-in-the-wall, mom & pop places that aren't fancy and are very low-key like El Rinconcito Cubano in logan square) if you're looking for authentic cuban food in the city!
