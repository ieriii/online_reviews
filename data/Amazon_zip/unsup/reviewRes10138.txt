The best pizza place in chicago, bar none. My favorite, the red pizza with mashed potatoes, bacon, and onions. But to each his own. They are a brewery too, and they make good beer. I'm surprised they haven't figured out how to market it outside the restaurant yet. For those who don't know, this place has a slightly different seating scheme, since you kinda share tables with folks sometimes. Also, it's pretty fun to go on Karaoke nights, but be aware that they exist, just in case you aren't looking for that sort of thing.
