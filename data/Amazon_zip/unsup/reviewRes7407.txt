Alright I'm giving this place 3 stars not because it wasn't good, but because this "award winning" BBQ was double the price of other places that I've been to with outstanding BBQ. I had the pull chicken sandwich and my friends had the competition style ribs and both were very very delicious, but the price was just a bit too much. For me BBQ doesn't mean it gets more expensive just because someone won some awards for their rub and BBQ style. Overall a delicious meal, but if you're looking to spend too much for BBQ this is the place.
