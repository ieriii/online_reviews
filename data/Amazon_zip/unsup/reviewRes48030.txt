Came here on a Sunday night with a few buddies of mine and we got seated in one of the closed in booths along the wall, quite unique. There majority of the venue was bug long community seating tables. The atmosphere was quite noisy inside with all the community seating. There aren't many couple tables, so maybe not too great for a date. Our waiter was really accommodating and great. Service was pretty good. Between 4 guys we ordered quite a few dishes. Pork rinds- pretty good, no complaints Steak tartare- just okay, nothing too spectatular Jamon Serrano- i'm partial to jamon and I love it everywhere, can't go wrong with a little bread Duck & Foie gras terrine- big chunks of duck and foie gras, pretty good if your into foie gras Ramps- great flavor and sauce pairing with it Softshell crab- delish but was very salty Pork belly- by far my favorites dish, MUST GET this dish! Fatty richness and a camelized sugary glaze on it, to die for Fish Stew- very tender shrimp, octopus and a whole variety of seafood, a little salty as well though Finished it off with a cream pie dessert. Overall a great meal, I think it was like... 70 bucks a person in the end but I loved the meal. I can't wait to come again and try some of their other dishes!
