Our only requirements when looking for a new spot for Mexican were that they have strong margaritas, and something cheesy. We got that, and little more here. I was surprised at how crowded it was, and how undelicious (and pricey) our food was, even after downing a pitcher of margs at the bar while waiting for a table.
