Grand Lux cafe is a very pretty restaurant that is located on a valuable piece of real estate; they serve huge portions of good food at reasonable (for this area) prices that appeal to all types. As with any restaurant that offers this, they tend to go for safeness and likeability; and thus will never be a phenomenal 5 star restaurant that takes chances. That being said, it's a great place to go for lunch or dinner, especially if you are shopping in this area or doing the touristy chicago stuff. You can please all palates, the food is good, and it's a beautiful view of a beautiful street. The service was wonderful and efficient, and our server was very nice. My only real issue was this place is the wait; I don't mind waiting for a table, especially knowing that I'm there at a peak time; but I wish they were a little more efficient in their process. When your pager goes off, they instruct you to wait at the bottom of the escalator for a host to take you to your table. I was there for lunch today, a week that many people are off and shopping or hanging on Michigan avenue, yet they only had 2 hosts taking individual parties to their tables. It seems to me that if they brought several parties at once up the escalator and to their tables, things would run a little more efficiently.  Other than that, it's definitely not a restaurant to head to just for the purpose of going there, it is an little bit more upscale than their sister restaurant, the Cheesecake Factory. But if you are in the area, it's a wonderful option, especially if you are with a bigger party.
