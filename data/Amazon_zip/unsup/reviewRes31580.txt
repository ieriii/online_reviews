Having driven by a few times, we finally remembered to stop in for brunch on a Sunday. They have an awesome outdoor area, but, instead of waiting for the five minutes, we sat inside. Our waitress said she was new, but she seemed to know everything and answered our questions well. The coffee was pretty good and she brought cream and sugar with the cups. The space is nice and comfy, and wasn't too loud considering it's brick walls. We ordered the special strawberry and rhubarb scones with lemon icing, the special omelet and the "Nanodict." Everything was tasty and hot, although food could have been spicier. It was almost like they toned things down for the crowd. The scones were amazing. Not really scones but more like sweet biscuits, they served 6 of them with a dee-licious lemon sauce. They looked so great, the tables on either side of us ordered them as well. The omelet was average, but the ingredients weren't spread evenly and mixed well. Not sure what other waiter problems people have seemed to have here, but ours was attentive and sweet. Also, the prices are not out of line for the food they serve here. This is not a southside greasy diner, it's a restaurant. The prices are very much in line with other similar brunch places up north. Except for the orange juice which has either really gone up in price or else I haven't ordered it in a while. I'd certainly go back, and try to sit outside next time too. They have an application in for a liquor license too.
