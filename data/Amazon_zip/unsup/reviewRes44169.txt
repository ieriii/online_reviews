I have been to this place several times before. Once I felt like the people who work there were kinda rude, and because of that I stopped going there. But I am looking for bakeries right now for our wedding cake next year, so I decided to go there and give these guys a new chance. I was attended by a very caring girl, I ordered a chocolate cupcake filled with caramel cream and topped with chocolate paste ( i don't know the name of that, but it wasn't frosting). I told her I was interested about the wedding cakes and she gave me a card, a book with wedding pics, and info about their website. Everything I have tasted so far in this place was delicious. Never once I had to complain that something didn't taste good, or that it was too dry, or too sweet. My mom owns a small bakery in Brazil, so I do have some base of what is a good cake and what is not (he he)! The coffee is pretty good too, I would say I rather their coffee better than starbucks coffee. I love that they have the place next door for lounging, and I think i will be going there to study some time. After eating that cupcake I just ran across the street to my gym ( Wicker Park fitness) were I relieved the guilt of eating that many calories.
