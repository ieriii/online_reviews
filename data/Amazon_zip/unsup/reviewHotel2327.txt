I would like to first say that I am a huge Marriott fan. I've stayed at lots of Marriotts all over the country, and have rarely been dissapointed. I was this time. Our room smelled like a nasty old cigarette, even though supposedly it was a non-smoking room. The bathroom was so small you could barely close it to go to the bathroom. There were a couple of hairs in the shower, before we ever used it so they weren't ours!!!  The only real saving grace to this hotel is that the location is pretty much perfect. And there's a Starbucks in the lobby which is nice. Wouldn't stay here again.
