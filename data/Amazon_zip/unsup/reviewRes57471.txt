This food always makes me happy and they do it right here. The lamb in the red sauce with orzo is killer. The lamb just falls of the bone so nicely. The gyro is also solid and of quality, not the greasy ones at fast food joints. If your in the mood for authentic greek go here, you'll be happy. Prices are good as well.
