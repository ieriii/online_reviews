Went on a groupon deal on a random Thursday night. I would comment that it's rather pricey, but not considering that LBB is clearly going for more of a date atmostphere than a casual eatery. They do it well. Warm, cozy atmosphere, but not cramped like many romantic eateries in Chicago. On this particular occasion I went with my cousin, but will utilize the spot for a more intimate purpose going forward. There's a lot on this menu I would love to try, but we were quite pleased with the"Vinete" Eggplant Spread, Saganaki, and "Sarmale" Stuffed Cabbage. The owner is quite a character, and will pay a visit to your table. If you praise his restaurant, he may ordain you with holy water...
