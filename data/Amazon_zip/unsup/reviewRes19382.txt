This is a review of the chilaquiles only (in general, I give Xoco five stars, and it is one of my very favorite places to eat in Chicago). The chilaquiles are very nice. They are presented in a little cast iron dish and sprinkled with the traditional raw onions and cilantro. Could be crunchier... so four stars here.
