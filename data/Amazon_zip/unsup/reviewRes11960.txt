Went here for lunch on a Saturday. Started by ordering sampler sizes of the Piece-brewed beers. Waitress got a bit snotty when she asked what I'd like next and I asked for a second sampler (excuse me if I like trying different beers). Apparently patrons are limited to a certain number of the sample size beers (would have been nice to have this mentioned on the menu).  I liked about half of the beers I tried, but do not appreciate being felt to make like I'm asking for something inappropriate when it is on the menu. I also ordered a small pizza (reasonably priced, but mediocre). Another reviewer commented about Piece being dirty. i noticed two small flies as I was finishing eating my meal. I wouldn't eat here again.
