This place is the perfect take out place for everyone. I highly recommend ordering off of the specials menu. The regular menu is mostly sandwiches, which are great with classics Cubano sandwich, but he specials are the best. If you like the Cubano sandwich try the Media Noche, same sandwich but on sweet bread...my favorite way to eat it. They offer some really interesting vegetarian items like a portabello mushroom stuffed with soy meat, cheese and spices. The grouper soup is a must have as well, although they usually serve it on the weekends only.  It's getting cold now, but my favorite thing to do is order something to drink and sit on their patio. The smoothies are awesome! They have a lot of different fruits, I like mixing passion fruit and mango together. The best thing you can get for breakfast is a simple cafe col lecher and a guava pastry...yum. The pastries are flaky and gooey at the same time.
