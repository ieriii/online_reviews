This is Lakeview and it was a Saturday evening...yet, a parking spot within the restaurant's ten feet radius was waiting for me...and there were four vacant seats within the restaurant. Wow, it felt like hitting a mini jackpot. To move on, Crisp is a very small eatery with limited seats. There is nothing spectacular or peculiar about the setting and dcor (if there really was any). But who cares? This is the place to enjoy something dirty and zesty. (Don't take it the wrong way.) Our group had two orders of Seoul sassy wings, and one order of the Seoul steak bowl and Chi-town chicken bowl. The wings came in six pieces per order. They were indeed CRISP and golden brown! Yummy! In addition, I also had the Seoul steak bowl and it was enjoyable. To sum it up, it was a bowl of minced bulgogi atop seasoned white rice served with Alison's atomic sauce. Not quite a bibimbap, but nonetheless, you would still mix up the contents before digging in. The sauce is served on the side. I personally found it a very good compliment and "moisturizer". Overall, it was an enjoyable meal, but it wouldn't be enough to drag me out of Bridgeport and make a special trip. It may be a different story had I lived a few blocks from Crisp.
