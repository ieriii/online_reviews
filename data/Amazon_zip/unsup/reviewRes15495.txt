Violet Hour is one of Chicago's hidden gems. Totally inconspicuous.My friends and I waltzed in on a Friday evening before there was a line. This place definitely oozes that grown and sexy vibe. Although very dimly lit, the decor was that swanky vintage look with the white high back chairs and oldschool hollywood glamour vibe. I expected that hipster attitude from the staff but not so at all! This is coming from someone who cannot hold liquor well and rarely thinks it tastes particularly good. I'd rather drink kool aid and keep my wits about me. But....that punch, my friend, the punch. I don't remember what it was called, but it was all sweet and fruity and just right sitting in a punch bowl with a giant ice block in it. I'm definitely not one for shots and feeling the burn, but whatever our waitress graced us with (just for kicks), was yummy goodness. who knew?
