I'm not even going to attempt to write a review of this place. It was, quite simply, the best food experience of my life. Words don't really do it justice. It's a fantastic experience from start to finish: entrance, service, food, kitchen (25 chefs at once!), wine pairings, even the restrooms. One word of advice - don't be so stiff here. It seems like that kind of place at first, but the staff really loves what they do and we had a lot of fun with them. As fantastic as the food was, we wouldn't have enjoyed it nearly as much if the people creating it and bringing it to us weren't as fun, yet professional as they were. You'd expect the latter, but not always the former. After the fact, I didn't think twice about dropping this much money on a meal here. It was well worth it. Go. Just do it. You'll be amazed.
