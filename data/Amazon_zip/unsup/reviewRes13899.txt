I came here in late March... & was torn whether to go with two or three stars, but I like the concept, the space, the feel of the place... I want to love it, or at least like it, but Revolution makes it really difficult If you are going to call yourself a brewery, you have to bring it when it comes to the brews. Sadly, the beer was by FAR the biggest let down here. It may actually have been the only let down, come to think of it, as the food ranged from okay to pretty great, most leaning towards the latter. Unfortunately that really great food could have used some really great beer to go with it. And while we tried almost all the beers that were available (not a lot, but they'd only been open for 2 months so it was forgiveable) none were impressive. They all had a watered-down quality to them and lacked any flavor/charisma that would make you want another round (probably part of the reason we tried almost all). That lack of flavor, creativity, invention, excitement.... didn't leave me too hopeful about the future of the brews. I really wanted to like it, so would I come back? Probably. But only if someone else suggested it.
