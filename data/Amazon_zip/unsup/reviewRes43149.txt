There have been only two times in my life that a dish has been so amazing that I have had to hold back tears. One of those dishes was here. That dish was: "hand roasted Iroquois white cornbread with charred spence farms green garlic & goat butter." You must partake. You must. Also, the service was great, the cocktails lived up to the hype, and the downstairs lounge oozed a cozy, laid back vibe.
