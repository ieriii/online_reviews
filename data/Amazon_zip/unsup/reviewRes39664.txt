This place is fine but a word of warning, vegetarian friends: not all desserts are suitable for us. I specifically asked if the dessert I ordered was free of gelatin and of course, when I started eating it, I realized there was gelatin in it. Bad communication between waiters and the kitchen. This very unpleasant experience would have been avoided by adding a little v next to veg-friendly options. They apologized a million times and I felt bad for them but honestly I expect a bit more effort from a restaurant with stellar reviews.
