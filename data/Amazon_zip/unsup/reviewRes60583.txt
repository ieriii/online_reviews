We love this place for a Friday night dinner with the kids. Usually I like to try new things when we go out to eat, but here I always get the salad bar, hot wings, and a banana milkshake. The kids meals are wonderful - they come with these bendy stick things that keep my kids occupied during the entire visit. The atmosphere is fun and friendly. Be sure to make a reservation because the wait can be long!
