The duck fat fries and heavenly selection of encased meats makes the wait outside (around the corner and good length down the block) all worth it. They move pretty quickly thanks to a highly efficient (but mildly terrifying) seating system - don't pick your own seat, they will give it to you, and ONLY after you've ordered! Don't fuck this up. When I went I had their game of the week - a chipotle buffalo sausage with mustardy cheese (not the official name) and split an order of duck fat fries with my friend. Trust me, this is the way to go. The fries are delicious, but lets try not to move up the national obesity list Chicago. The sausage itself was perfect, the cheese was perfect, the mustard was perfect - you really can't miss out on Hot Doug's. The selection ranges from your typical Chicago dog to quite a few unique and "gourmet" specialty dogs. All fantastic. One more thing, they are CASH ONLY, so if you limit yourself to your debit card because otherwise you'll go on a paper money fueled spending spree (why plastic keeps me in line, I'll never know) don't forget to stop at the ATM before heading over.
