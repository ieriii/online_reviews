This is just a review of the bar. I really like the design of the downstairs bar at the W. It's really stylish and it's right on the water, which is pretty cool. I'd like to go back there sometime around sunset for dinner.  I was suprized how few people were in the bar when we were there. Usually when I go to W's in other cities, they're really packed. The crowd there was quite touristy, too. But we had fun! I had the red sangria, which was delicious!
