Food= good :) Service=bad :( I have mixed feelings about this place. Firstly, the food. We had the Cloud 9 Crepe and some sorta skillet. They were both pretty good and the portions were huge; albiet the prices were a little higher for a breakfast place. However the crepe had way too much strawberry marscapone. Their mango blast smoothie was really good though! Now on to the service. Came here on a Thursday so we got seated quickly. The waitress (she's European, I think Polish, tall with brunette hair) asked if we wanted anything to drink. Although we said give us a minute, she took the coffee cups away. Then she came back again and we were still deciding. What do they expect when there are billions of choices on the menu. When she comes around the third time we are ready to order. My fiance wants coffee and she has the nerve to say "now you want coffee." From that point on I was pissed! How can you enjoy the food when the service sucks! Jeez...At least the food came quickly.  In the US, giving a tip has become a standard. And it's a high standard of 15% too unlike Europe and Asia. I know that many servers and waitresses work hard and rely on tips, but sometimes I really just want to leave no tip at all! There's a reason why it's called gratuity; and it should be given when the service is superb....not subpar. I see from prior posts that there are servers here with attitudes, guess we were stuck with one!
