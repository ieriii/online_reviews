Warning: Huge! Loud! If you're looking for something intimate, this is not it! Half the tables seem to be groups that insisted the server take pictures of them. Seriously so very loud: with kind of loud techno music playing loudly, and two stories of space above the loud crowd for noise to loudly reverberate around. Also, really big! Not lettuce entertain you big, but it sort of still felt that way. A note about the space: the dining room has enormous arched windows that face east onto Michigan, so the room is flooded with that orange sodium light. (A plus in my book.) Also, there are several bar / lounge areas to wait in, with lots of nooks for chatting with a small group. So if you're up for a kind of big restaurant experience: the food is fantastic. (The normal small-plate place caveats apply here. It's probably more fun with more people because you can taste more things, it can probably get quite expensive in that way, etc.)  Since we were only two, we did the tasting menu. It was... well, tasty, but they don't give you much of the distinctive food, and the portions were really too big. My favorite part was the wine pairings; there were three, and they were all really interesting and/or delicious. (I asked for a list of the choices and our server forgot it.) The wee tater tots (patatas bravas?) with spicy aioli are great. The grilled scallops were good, but crazy salty. The flatbread was flavorful and complex. Octopus was outstanding - tender and spiced in a really nice, balanced way. I will happily go back if a group of friends suggests it.
