We had a late night reservation elsewhere, but decided to come for drinks and snacks. We were not disappointed. Our only regret is that we did not skip the dinner res we had and just stayed here instead. Oysters were fantastic, delicious beer and the pig rinds! We are still rhapsodizing about the pig rinds! Service was excellent, the space is simply beautiful, and we found the standing bar tables to be very comfortable, functional and spacious. We really loved this place, and next time we come back to Chicago, we will certainly come here for dinner.
