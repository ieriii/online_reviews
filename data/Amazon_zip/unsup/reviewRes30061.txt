really great food. very busy on a sunday night, I had my favorite, spicy green curry with tofu while my dining companions had noodle dishes which they both devoured. We also had crab rangoon and fresh spring rolls,, both of which rocked my world...I think there was only one waitress working the entire room but she did a great job. BYOB. Come hungry.
