I come back here every time I'm in town. Service is all over the place depending on how busy or short staffed they are. The meat is okay. The portion size is good. What makes this place amazing is the amount of sides they give you and they'll give you more of your favorites if you ask. I've been to famous places in DC and they give you 4 sides for 6 people. We got like 30 for 6 people or something crazy like that. We always get at least 4 people to do the family style dinner. It has all our favorites and the amount of food can't be beat. I've been to at least a dozen Korean BBQ places and this is always a consistent fave for all of us and we're all foodies.
