We loved this casual place and there were so many great things about it. First, the price is extremely reasonable for high-quality food. We shared a few appetizers and each had a meal and it was still only $22 apiece including gratuity! The fact it is BYOB with no corking fee is a huge savings. The white fish ceviche had to be my favorite dish, spinach empanadas were great, and tilapia tacos were wonderful. We finished it off with an oatmeal shake - way more delicious than I expected. Overall great experience, great food and hope to be back soon.
