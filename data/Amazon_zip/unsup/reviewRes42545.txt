Best mussels I've had anywhere in Chicago. It's true. I'd come back just to get them again. Very dimly lit, cozy atmosphere. Fun, friendly bartenders. We snagged a seat at the bar around 7 on a Saturday night. By ten, it was packed. River North prices, but worth it for the food and cocktails. The crowd, was for the most part 30+. Great for dinner, or to start your evening at the bar for a few drinks. Great customer service all the way around.
