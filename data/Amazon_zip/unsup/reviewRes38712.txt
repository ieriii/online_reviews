We traveled to Chicago to have some famous deep dish pizza. After reading reviews, we decided to try Giordano's. It was packed. We made it up to the hostess to put our name in. In return, we were hastily given two times by the hostess and sent away. Having never been there, we had to return to clarify the ordering process. We sat and waited, all the while listening to the on-duty manager do last calls - over and over and over again. This became extremely frustrating as, after a trip to the bathroom, we saw plenty of open tables. After awhile, we went to see where we were on the list. With all the last calls, we thought the estimated wait might have changed. However, after inquiring, the on-duty manager was extremely rude. He claimed to not see our name on the list, wouldn't answer our questions, and finally passed us to the hostess. She was able to find our name. And indeed, the wait was fluctuating. We sat and waited for awhile longer and checked back in. Again, we were given extremely rude service. We came here for the experience - this includes service. Never before have we run into such inhospitable service! After these rude encounters, we decided that Giordano's didn't deserve our money and we left. We walked down the street to Pizzeria Due who offered excellent service - we happily paid and left a generous tip. Giordano's - remember, service DOES matter.
