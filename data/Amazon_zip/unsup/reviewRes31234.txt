I've been back a few time since my first review. I simply love this place. It's as close to perfect as it gets. It's not TRU or ALINEA, but those places aren't for me. Nana is a real place with amazing food and they do it so well. I'll be back as often as I can get my friends to drive down there. Keep up the great work!
