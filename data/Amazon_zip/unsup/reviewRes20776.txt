I wanted to like this place. I wanted to give it four stars, but the ridiculously slow service at 3pm on a Saturday when the restaurant was barely half full definitely left a sour taste. Then there was the waitress not looking at our credit card slips and telling my group that we still owed 5 times what we actually still owed. That was the proverbial straw. Too bad, because the burger was awesome. :-/
