Deeelicious brunch! It was absolutely perfect for Sunday brunch. We only had a wait a few minutes and were seated at a lovely table by the window. There are so many delicious looking options on the menu that it was hard to choose. I had the vegetable hash, which was absolutely delicious and full of my daily vitamins :) My friend had the crab cake eggs benedict and was impressed it was served on an english muffin still and so very filling. The other had the Italian Omelet and it was delightful! I cannot wait to go back and try their homemade soup and many more things on the menu! Highly recommend.
