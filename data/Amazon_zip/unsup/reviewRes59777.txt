Ok, there was a lot of hype I guess is the word for AOP around their stuffed and I had a chance to try it last night It was really good. I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to stuffed pizza but you could sit someone in front of this pizza and tell them with confidence that this is what Chicago Stuffed Pizza should look and taste like. Prices are average and delivery took a bit longer than I would have expected on a Monday night but that's no problem. I got a Cheese Stuffed Pizza, the cheese was great it was a little undercooked but I prefer that so that was to my benefit. A very good stuffed pizza will be having this again : )
