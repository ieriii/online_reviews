Nice place to dine in the Edgewater area, outdoor seating is a plus. The fact that Uncommon Ground makes an effort to use produce from local farmers in the Midwest and utilizes an organic rooftop farm for some of their entrees is something that keeps me coming back. I love the interior of this place as well. They've got a decent sized drink menu.. the espresso bar is a plus for me. Although the food menu is on the smaller side, it's always changing with the season, and frankly a smaller menu makes it easier to order (narrows down my choices!) The price is right for the quality of food you receive. Overall, good!
