No wait for brunch on a weekend with decent weather? It's almost unheard of in this area! I was prepared for terrible service and/or food. I was pleasantly surprised on both accounts. Our waiter was friendly and kept us happy while we were there. I ordered the indecisive so I could try the french toast sliders and crepes, but was persuaded by our waiter to have two sliders instead. The wild berry mascarpone slider was really amazing! The mango one was pretty good, but not as good as the wild berry. I also was impressed by the sweet potato hash browns. It was your usual bar scene with a bit better food. I'm looking forward to trying some more menu items. Not sure I could handle the all you can eat bacon, but if that's you're thing, it's probably worth it for 10 bucks.
