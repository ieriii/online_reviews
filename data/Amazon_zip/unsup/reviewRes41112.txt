I've eaten here a handful of times, despite myself. It's just kind of happened. I think because this place is always busy. They have pho. It's not the best in the area. They also have MSG. Oh man, do they have MSG. I was MSG'd twice there, much more than I've got at other Vietnamese places. The spring rolls are why I gave them 2 stars. But seriously, walk somewhere else on Broadway. Any other restaurant on the street will have the same stuff, just done better.
