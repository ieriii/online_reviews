Went here last night with a friend, and we both loved it! Did not mind the communal tables at all - it's the type of place that if it didn't have communal tables, it would be weird. And a plus is that you get to check out everyone else's dishes before ordering to see what looks good. We ordered the Winter Squash & Goat Cheese Arancini with Sage Pesto, three cheeses, and the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. We had our waitress select our cheeses and they were all delicious. You probably can't go wrong there with any of the cheeses. The arancini was amazing! You get five little rice balls so it's not a lot of food, but every bite was well worth it. The pork shoulder was delicious as well. It was just so tender and melted in your mouth. Yum! We had debated between the pork shoulder and the pork blade steak and the pig's tails, and our waitress highly recommended the shoulder. For dessert we had the Sicilian Iris and it was awesome! It's this huge puffy-looking thing with ricotta and chocolate chips inside.... absolutely loved it! We went in trying to be adventurous and we really weren't, but everything we ordered was scrumptious. We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!
