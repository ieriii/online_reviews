Terrible service, unfriendly staff, and nasty food. I've had naengmyeon countless of times and never have had such an awful dish served to me such as the one I received. Large chunky ice cubes, watery bibim naengmyeon, with almost no toppings was what I had received. The ice cubes began to melt which made my dish even more watery, almost soupy. Knowing full well that this is not how naengmyeon is usually served the owner/manager never apologized but rather made excuses trying to tell us that's how they make it here. I will never come back again and will inform everybody I know to AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. If you are looking for quality Korean food I would suggest Cho Son Ok..almost anyplace but this really. The only reason I gave this place one star and not zero is because yelp won't let me post without any stars.
