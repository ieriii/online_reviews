-1 star b/c of the long long long line (2.5 hours in the rain) -1 star b/c the duck fat fries taste like regular fries and i was really looking forward to that otherwise, the hot dogs are pretty good but they're $$, not sure if it's exactly worth it. definitely a place to go and try differnet things and have nice cheeses w/ them... but yah, definitely wouldn't wait in that line again
