So we were very excited about our reservations at Sapori Trattoria. It's only a few blocks from home and we heard great things about it from friends and from the online reviews. We actually were considering it as a possible rehearsal dinner location for our upcoming wedding. We arrived and the place was packed and smelled amazing! Great sign. Our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived so we stood by the tiny bar and ordered two glasses of wine. They have a VERY small wine list for glasses but many selections for bottles. The wine by the glass was just okay. The oil and cheese and bread awesome - great quality. Some Italian restaurants don't invest in good oil and cheese. We ordered the fried calamari. The took about 30 minutes to come out! The table behind us ordered mussels after us and were done with their app before ours even came out. A little disappointing. Then our entrees came out - I had the pesto gnocchi and my fianc had one of the chicken dishes with fresh mozzarella and it was honestly just okay. We've had better and a lot of other Italian restaurants in the city. We probably wont come back except maybe for their Tuesday Italian tapas night to try a few other things. If we want great Italian in walking distance, we will definitely go to Rose Angelis on Wrightwood over Sapori.
