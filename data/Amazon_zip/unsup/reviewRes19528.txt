Ah I can't believe I had to pay 17 dollars for TWO yes count them TWO scallops!! eek! faint! Anyway, the atmosphere here was very boisterous even on a weekday, and I found that my throat was sore after from yelling across the table to my friend. The service is wonderful, and I loved how the waitress took the time to describe the food to us before we ordered! The wagyu beef salad was okay... the meat was a little chewy. And the scallops.. well yes there were only two... but they were cooked perfectly, but the squash side that came with them was rather plain. I had a glass of prosecco here which was absolutely perfect for an unusually warm day in Chicago's winter. And the star of the night really was the peanut butter beignets which were light fluffy brioche pillows filled with a subtle peanut butter cream served with a caramel gelato. Nom nom! This place is fairly overpriced for what it actually offers, but I did enjoy the dessert~
