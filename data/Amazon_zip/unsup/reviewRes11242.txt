Piece is legit. The pizza is pretty good even though the original red style is kinda like New York pizza. it's still pretty good. The sauce is sweet as is all the hot babes who eat and work there. Don't ever go during any sort of sports event because it'll be jam packed with various boners and d-bags. The staff is super nice and the wait for a pizza isn't normally long at all even when it's pretty busy. Karaoke seems to be hit or miss, but my only experience of it was an observer, and some guy did 'Cult of Personality' and that song SMOKES. His version, not so much but it was chuckle worthy.
