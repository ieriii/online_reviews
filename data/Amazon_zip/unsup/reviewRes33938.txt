We went to Yolk on a Saturday at 10:30 am. Big mistake. We called ahead and they said we could put our names in for 4 people- it was a 25 minute wait. Somehow when we got there the wait was now 30 minutes (even though our name was on the list). After waiting for closer to an hour and having checked in with the hostess about 4 times, we were finally sat. Took about 10 minutes to get our OJ and then another 10-15 to place our order. We waited, no joke, 45 minutes more for eggs. Absolutely not worth it. I am someone who loves good food and loves to eat at great/non chain places, and I would rather eat at Perkins. This place sucked. Maybe their oatmeal or pancakes are worth it, but if you want an omelete skip this joint. Oh, they don't charge extra for egg whites, that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place.
