my bf took me here for our anniversary. it was really delicious & great atmosphere for a date! when he said fusion asian, i was a little nervous b/c fusion places are generally a hit or miss. p.s. i mean to give it 4.5 stars but rounded down only because of the appetizer. *Peared Sake: Amazing!!!!! This is absolutely a must-try and I stand by it *Lychee-Tini: wonderful if you love lychee (very sweet) *Rising Sun: Also deeeeeelicious drink, the flavors change as you drink (assuming you dont blend the hell out of it with your straw) *Tempura Shrimp w/ walnuts?: was aiite *Sea Bass: AMAZING *Wa-machi roll: AMAZING, esp if you love Hamachi *Caterpillar: you can pass (this roll has an extra touch on top with some burnt crispy sugar but pretty similar to what you can get anywhere else) *Nigiri: Fresh
