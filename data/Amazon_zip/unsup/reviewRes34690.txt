I have been here so many times and have had excellent service every time.  Sushi is delicious and reasonably priced, service is excellent, i never had to wait very long for a table, and they are BYOB (cvs across the street for drinks). By the way, they are also very accommodating when we stay a for a little while longer to finish our drinks- I really appreciate that they are not trying to push us out the door as soon as they can.  love the godzilla & double stack rolls, and maui waui on occasion.
