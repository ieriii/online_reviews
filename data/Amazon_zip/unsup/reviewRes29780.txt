Being Rick Bayless' restaurant and seeing him on tv making some awesome looking dishes we decided to try it for ourselves. Got in and was surprised that there were so many people waiting to get in. We got in right away because of our reservation. Sat down and enjoyed what seemed to be a tic tac container full of nuts. We ordered a few appetizers. We were not impressed. Ordered some more appetizers thinking the others might be better. Not so much. For some reason, everytime I asked for a straw it always seemed like they were rinced off and reused because there was always water/condensation on the inside of the straw. After the third set, I asked the waitress about it and she said they were a bio-degradable type of straw so that is why it looked like that. I said no way there is water inside it and she said that they sit right next to the bar where they can get wet. I thought that was a little strange. I hate drinking out of public glasses in restaurants. Yet when I looked around, I did not notice anyone else with straws in any of their drinks. I asked for a hotter sauce than what they brought me and I end up getting charged almost 3 bucks for about an ounce of habanero sauce they called salsa. I could not believe that. If I asked for salsa then I could see getting charged for it, but this is ridiculous. I was expecting the appetizers to be amazing and it was just average. After 4 different appetizers we decided to leave. There is no point in ordering a whole meal if the appetizers are just ok in a hyped-up restaurant as packed and supposedly famous as this one. Needless to say we left disappointed and hungry still. I have had a much better experience in a hole in the wall mexican restaurant than in this place. This place is definately WAY to hyped up and we wont be going back anytime soon. I really dont see what everyone else sees in this place. Why anyone would wait 2-3 hours to pay so much for mediocure food is beyond me!
