Stop #1 on my "Eating my way through Chicago/St. Louis and possibly doing other things on this trip Summer Tour 2011" was to Hopleaf Bar. I hadn't heard of this place, but the friend I was staying with suggested it and it wasn't a far walk from where she lived. I will make this review brief as there are almost 1000 others that probably will say it better. They have a huge beer list. I had 5 Rabbit 5 Wizard Wit ($6) which is a local beer from Chicago. I like to drink local when I'm local. For my main dish I had the Organic Montreal-Style Brisket Platter ($15) which came with a dill pickle, cole slaw and Stilton mac and cheese. Everything was quite good. On this night the AC wasn't working inside so the Wit tasted especially good in a slightly warmer venue. We could have sat outside, but it wasn't any cooler out there.
