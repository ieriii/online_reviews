My hubby and I eat breakfast here every couple of Saturday mornings if we wake up early enough to get here before they close at 1pm! (We live in Roger's Park so it's not exactly a neighborhood place for us.) This place was recommended to my hubby by a manager at his job that lives in the area, and we've been going ever since, at least the last 4 months! i get the same thing every time (a BLT w/ fries - but I get a different beverage!!) and I REALLY like the BLT! Hubby tries something different every time, but I also nibble on what he gets, and I have to say the Eggs Benedict is amazing with the hollandaise sauce!! I've never had it before but it was definitely delicious - I might even get that on our next trip vs. my BLT. The staff is VERY friendly - I love the service! The decor is a little outdated, but it's really full of character. I think if this place was open a little later I would have given it 5 stars, but sometimes we have to haul it over there just to be seated before they close. (It's really the hubby's fault because he likes his beauty rest - I'm up at 6am on Saturdays!)
