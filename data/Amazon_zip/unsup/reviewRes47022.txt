Great place...the Moonshine Manhattan they do in the cooler months(that's not the exact name, but it is a version of a manhattan and they call it "moonshine" something made with Catdaddy Moonshine) is worth the trip. Order it served up and you will quickly become a regular. Rogers Park needed a place like this and we're happy to give Uncommon Ground our business.
