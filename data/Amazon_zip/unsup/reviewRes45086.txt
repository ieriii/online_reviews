We had New Year's Eve dinner here with four friends, and it was delicious. My husband and I walked in 25 minutes early for our reservation, because we were dorks and didn't check our watches after giving ourselves a good buffer of time to travel there from Hyde Park. The staff was unfazed, even though the restaurant is tiny and there wasn't any more room to sit at the bar. We ordered a cocktail to share while we waited (something lemony and rosemary-y, delicious) and just sort of pressed ourselves up against a wall while waiters flitted by bearing wonderful-smelling things. The food was great -- portions aren't insanely large, and I thought the menu was reasonably priced for the quality of food we got. Our total bill, including taxes and tip, was $315. For that we got 5 appetizers (get the lobster bisque. It's amazing), 6 main courses (I had the bucatini and loved it, and I heard moans of delight coming from the part of the table where the duck saltimboca and sliced NY strip lived), 3 desserts (they had a chocolate-espresso tart as a special, and the lemon panna cotta was also divine), 2 bottles of red, a glass of grappa, and a coffee. It wasn't the most amazing Italian food I've ever had, but it was a really cozy place to eat at with friends, the service was good despite the fact that they were super busy, and everyone in my party left stuffed and happy. We stole a NYE balloon as we were leaving. :-)
