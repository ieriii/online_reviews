I love this store. Their selection of gourmet food is incredible.  Spending some time wandering the aisles just checking out all the jars, boxes, and cans is a fun way to spend an hour. Their meat and seafood counters are nice as well. The prices are high, but the quality is right. I don't mind paying a little more for items that you can't easily find elsewhere. The parking situation is the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars. The parking is on the other side of Illinois, about half a block down. To get from the parking to the store it's a couple doors, a hallway or two, an elevator, another door or two, hallway, out onto the street, half a block, cross the street, and then you're at Fox & Obel. Not the end of the world, but not a terrific situation. But at least it's free with a $20 purchase at F&B and a validation.
