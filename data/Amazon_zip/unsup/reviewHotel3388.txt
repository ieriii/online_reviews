We went to the Allerton Bar to use a coupon for drinks and appetizers. The drinks and appetizers were fine, but the experience was so negative that if the hotel was trying to use the promotion to stimulate business and bring awareness to the hotel, it was a total disaster. We waited 20 minutes and I then walked to the bar to ask for service. I was told to take a seat and someone would be there shortly. It became clear that the server was so surly because he was one of only 2 people working the entire bar area, and he had to actually go behind the bar and make the drinks after taking the orders. Luckily, he had a busman who retrieved the food orders and brought them to the table so the bartender/server didn't have to do that. It was embarrasssing looking around the room at other patrons waiting for service, and some who left after a period of time and simply abandoned their coupon, rather than waiting the time it took to be served. Unfortunately, the management of the hotel was so inept as to allow this situation to occur. With a promotion in effect, one would think they would have staffed the room adequately to take are of the traffic brought in by the coupon. They set the hotel back for some time with this sorry show of ineptitude, and if they don't emerge from their current bankruptcy situation, I won't be surprised, but I will be disappointed, because it is a nice space and could do well if properly managed.
