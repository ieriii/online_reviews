This place makes me proud to live in Logan Square.Beer, OMG...they have the friggin' best selection...on tap, bottle, watevs.Food is outstanding, great burgers, apps (don't get the pizza though, kinda meh), slammin' bread pudding.Great looking spot, god bless the people who built this place.Late night socializing, lunch with mom, beer with the depressed buddy on a Tuesday at 4, it's all good....
