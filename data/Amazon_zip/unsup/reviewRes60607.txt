This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Love the burgers & the fresh cut fries. The mixed drinks are great also. From the adult milkshakes, to the margaritas. Despite the fact that they are bigger than the tables, I love the over sized menus. Not to mention the cheesy decor. A good amount of kids come in, but when the place is across the street from a zoo that's expected.
