I do love a good hot dog, and this place is the tits!! (I don't like to use such terminology, but I felt Sausage and slang pair well) I started with a classic Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the classic trimmings, especially that neon green relish; and it was SO good. Next came the the Calvados: Infused Smoked Duck Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mayonnaise and St. Pete's Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey...  I never thought a tubed meat product could ever be so tastetastical -- My lady-friend and I shared some fresh-cut fries with cheddar sauce, and I would opt for no cheddar next time because it IS NOT cheese, it's a thick Velveeta-esque sauce. The fries were good though. And since I won't be back there anytime soon, the gluttony had to continue with the Citrus-Burgundy Pork Sausage that had a Red Wine Grainy Dijon Mustard and Smoked Gouda Cheese bits all over the top. This was not my favorite because the Gouda wasn't melted, so it sort of overpowered the flavor of the sausage. the Classic Chicago-style cannot be beat for the price.  Eat 3 of them.
