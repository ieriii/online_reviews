I really thought this restaurant was great but I was really disappointed today. First when I called the location on Clybourn a young lady answered the phone and gave my the assumption that she didn't want to take my order. I've been to this restuarant several times and the men were extremely nice and helpful but I usually go before closing. Today I called around 5p.m.. She keep telling me that this is the location on Clybourn and I responded by saying OK may I place my order. So I proceeded to tell her I wanted a steak sandwich and my husband wanted a fish sandwich and she just suggested I go to the Armitage location. So I got the number from her and I called in my order at the Armitage location.  So I intentionally sat in my car for fifteen minutes before I even parked and walked up the restaurant. So I paid for my food and it wasn't ready yet. The waitress suggested that I have a seat until my order was completed. I also didn't get offered any WATER and it was very hot today. I waited 30 minutes just sitting in the restaurant and no one apologized for the wait until I left to pick up my food. First the steak was dry as hell and I couldn't believe it didn't have the great taste I always got when I went to the restaurant on Clybourn. The fish sandwich suppose to have a crunch and it was so soggy like it was old. Thank God they have good bread because thats the only thing that really saved it. I was so disappointed because I live really far away from this restaurant and I was looking foward to a great meal. The service really sucked and I can't say I will be back to either because I didn't expect the poor customer service. I really wanted to love this restaurant but I felt like no one paid attention to me or I wasn't important because I was just getting a pick up order. I guess I will try my luck somewhere else.
