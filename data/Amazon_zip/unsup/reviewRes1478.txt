I took my fiance here today. We thought that maybe around 2pm on a holiday wouldn't be too crowded. We were wrong, but that's ok.  I don't know what else I can say - Hot Doug's lives up to the hype, Doug is awesome, the food is amazing, the line is long.  Special shout out to the cheese fries - underrated food item that were really freaking good here.
