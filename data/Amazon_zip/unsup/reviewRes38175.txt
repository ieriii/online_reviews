My wife and I tried this place on a visit to Chicago on the recommendation from a tour guide. I have also heard about this restaurant on some TV features. Let me start by saying that the particular staff that was helping us was totally unfriendly. Maybe it's a Chicago thing or because they knew we were tourists. I would have expected that in NY city, but to this point, the people have been accommodating and friendly. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. We order the most popular dish there, the stuffed deep dish "special" and a salad. The salad came out fast and was crisp and fresh. The portion was big and my wife didn't finish between us, saving our appetite for the pie. The pizza arrived and I was surprised. I made sure with the waiter that what we ordered was a small. This thing could have fed four people. I dug in with anticipation. The crust was sublime. It was light and thin like a cracker, but it had some substance to it. The sauce was unintrusive and in fact was a little light for me. I don't like a lot of sauce, but I do like a heartier sauce with more flavor. The "toppings" were good. The were fresh and the cheese was abundant. I would say that the cheese makes up 2/3 of the stuffing.  The first piece while warm went down nicely. Once the pie cooled a little, the cheese starts to get hard and becomes less appetizing. I split a second piece with the wife and could do more. I came away somewhat disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much. Maybe I'm just not a Chicago Deep Dish kind of guy. Next time I will dare to order the thin crust or I will have to try another joint for comparison.
