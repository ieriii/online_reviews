I took a big risk coming here for Sunday brunch. With my vegetarian sister, my innocent grandma, and dad who expects the word "brunch" to imply "buffet". But dammit it was my birthday brunch and I was going where I wanted to. I mean...I'd never been here before, but I should be ok right... Eh? An hour wait? I was doomed. My family was going to hate me. Luckily a table was available within ten minutes and we got to ordering. And with a look of disapproval from dad, I got the whiskey Bloody Mary, which was as smooth as it was spicy. And strong. Generally, the food didn't impress my family too much, and generally they thought it was too salty. I got the duck hash/confit and I enjoyed it, though I've had better potatoes (and there were a lot of them compared to duck). But what really won me over was what came out after my mom ever so slyly dropped that it was my birthday. She did this by telling the waitress, "it's my son's birthday". A plate with a lone candle. And a shot of whiskey. One more look of disapproval from dad later, I was set to lay back and enjoy a day of football and sleep. Thanks L&E!
