I can't tell you how many times I've come here and being a huge tapas fan/snob that's saying a lot for this place. While it may not be my absolute favorite Catalonian spot in the city I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone in the loop or south loop area.  When my mother visits she often stays at the Blackstone, the hotel which Mercat is attached to, so the restaurant is an easy jaunt from her room after checking in. I can say I've had most everything on the menu and you really can't go wrong with any dish you choose but I would highly recommend the scallops and the quail. Seriously delicious. The sangria is good but I'm an after dinner drink kind of girl and love that they serve absinthe in the correct fashion.  Every now and then they have brunch for $35 per person for a three course pre fixe menu which I think is a pretty great deal. Add an additional $8 and you get bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's - which you can make yourself if you'd like at the bloody mary bar, which has allllllll the fixin's you could possibly imagine.  All in all this really is a great place and a wonderful choice is your looking for authentic Spanish cuisine.
