My husband and I recently went to Alinea to celebrate a special occasion. I am a bit of a picky eater, so I was a little nervous about the tasting menu. There was really no problem though because they will easily accommodate dietary restrictions. My husband and I don't eat pork, so we mentioned it ahead of time and they were sure to make a couple of adjustments for us. I also noticed that a woman nearby was a vegetarian, and for each course that included meat they would bring her something different. The service at Alinea was amazing. There seem to be more waiters than diners. One thing that I really appreciated was their occasional instructions on how to eat a course. Some courses are brought out in special serving dishes created just for Alinea. The food is presented in such an artistic way and some of the actual serving dishes are equally artistic. It's nice to have reassurance about how exactly you should eat a couple of the courses.  The highlight of the meal for me was the dessert. I don't really want to ruin this surprise, but it's a gorgeous display of sweets on the table that is also super delicious! While I enjoyed most of the dinner courses (I just don't like some flavors - nothing was prepared poorly), I completely loved every bite of dessert! One last thing, prepare to be there for a while. It's a long meal with all those courses. You don't want to be sleepy during the grand finale!
