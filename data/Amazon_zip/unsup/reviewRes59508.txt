La Villa is WAY overpriced!! I paid $17.90 for a plate of Spaghetti and Meatballs. It was decent, but there are several Italian restaurants that are so much better for the money. The prices on their website do not reflect the ACTUAL prices. Salad Bar does not come with anything as stated on Check Please. Nice people but this place is a joke. Almost Any Place in Little Italy is better and cheaper. Spent $60 for two people no tip!Salad Bar is a joke ---- everything from cans.Stay away from this scam of a joint.
