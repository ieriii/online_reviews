The burgers are good, and the place should be kid friendly, but it's pretty tight in there, so it was a bit rough for me and my little family to manuevuer last weekend for lunch. Also, they have a kids' menu, but no burgers on it, which is what my little guy loves, so I had to order for him off the regular adult menu. No big deal, but when I got flack from the waitress for giving my 1 year old a bite of cottage cheese off of my salad plate ("no salad sharing" says the menu!), I think my eyes literally rolled out of my head. Idiot waitress nonwithstanding, this place is okay.
