The Seoul Sassy chicken wings are sweet and salty goodness. The Buddha Bowl (aka- bibbimpap) has all the veggies that i love and none that i hate. Picked it up and ate it at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Way better than zoo food. Make sure you don't spill any of the oil from the chicken on your clothes... not the easiest stain to get out.
