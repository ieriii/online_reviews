Went to Anteprima last night with my parents. Made reservations three weeks ago. When we arrived at the restaurant there was only one open table and it was literally in front of the door (It was a balmy 29 degrees last night). Unacceptable. The unapologetic "host" told us smugly that "It's the luck of the draw. Sometimes, we all have to sit there." That's an exact quote. If we wanted another table, we would need to wait 30 minutes next door at Acre. As we were all the way up in Andersonville, we waited. 45 minutes later, we were fetched from Acre and directed to a lovely table. Our server, was charming. The wine list was great. The food was just ok. Especially for the somewhat spendy prices. We ordered several appetizers. The buffalo mozz with pesto was nice but the portion was dinky. The best part of the grilled polenta were the greens and tomatoes it was resting on. Seafood stew was watery. NY strip was nice -- the wilted arugula was excellent. About 3/4 through our meal, the "host" asked the diners at the table next to ours to leave while they were still enjoying their after dinner drinks. Apparently, seating four people waiting for a table is more lucrative than four returning customers. (And the friends, co-workers, and relatives they tell about the experience.) We were shocked -- he didn't even offer to buy them a drink at either the small Anteprima bar or at Acre. Turns out this guy is also the manager. Hosting at a busy restaurant is a tough job and this clown is clearly in over his head. There are so many fantastic restaurants in Andersonville and Chicago there's no need for me to go back to this one.
