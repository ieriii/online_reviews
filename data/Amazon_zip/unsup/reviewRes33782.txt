Best falafel in Chicago, period. However, I'm not a fan of the LP location - stick to Bucktown. As a vegetarian this place has a ton of option for me to choose from. Egg & cheese pie is one of my favorite splurge foods (no way that thing can be good for you). My only complaint is that they sometimes ring your order up wrong (and it's always over). I would give Sultan's 5 stars if not for being overcharged on several occasions.
