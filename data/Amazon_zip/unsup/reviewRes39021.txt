I'm not one to make sweeping declarations or commitments to restaurants. But Longman & Eagle is my gastro-soulmate, and I sing its praises to everyone who comes to visit our city. Let's start with the place itself. L&E is well-designed (I wouldn't expect anything else from a place co-owned by Cody Hudson) and has just the right atmosphere for a date or a casual dinner. Everyone who works there is so friendly and excited about the food, and all of Longman & Eagle seems well thought-out and perfected. Oh, and the gorgeous rooms for rent are reminiscent of an old-style pub. Now, the food: stellar vegetarian menu that is extensive and fresh. I've had the pretzel roll starter, the goat cheese melon salad, and the English Pea Aglonotti, and they're all equally delicious and fresh. The vegetables are so full of flavor and fresh each time we come here, and there's usually an optional add-in vegetable that's fresh that day (the other day it was morel mushrooms.) And maybe most importantly, the drinks. I've tried many of them, but for the summer I'm particularly fond of the Moria Solina, a fresh pisco/lemon soda cocktail that is light and perfect, and the Ransometta, a deliciously rich gin cocktail that I can only describe as the Martinezs' hotter, hipper younger sister. Hands down, Longman & Eagle is my favorite place to drink and dine in Chicago. It's definitely worth a trip as often as possible.
