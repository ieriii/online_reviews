With 4 other adults and 2 tots in tow, we headed to Q for lunch last Saturday for restaurant week. We had the hushpuppies, onion rings, kobe brisket, kobe brisket sandwich, pulled pork, st. louis style ribs, carrot cake, key lime pie, and milk/cookies. I understand that they want to be considered an upscale bbq place, but there are no free refills on soda pop. It comes in little tiny bottles which was a disappointment and a little pretentious. Everything was overall pretty tasty, A-OK. The sliced Kobe brisket tasted significantly different from the kobe brisket sandwich. The sliced brisket tasted like your standard brisket, nothing that special. The sandwich had little cubes of kobe beef that were very flavorful so definitely skip the sliced brisket if you go. I will return because I want to try the competition style ribs that have special seasoning and are "made for competitions." Plus they are limited in supply which makes them even more intriguing to me...but for $35+ per slab, I'll have to budget some extra money for them. Maybe next month?
