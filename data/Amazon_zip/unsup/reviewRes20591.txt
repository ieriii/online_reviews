'Expensive' is fine if you're getting good value. I just don't feel like I got a good value at The Gage. Not often do I leave a restaurant feeling ripped off, but that's exactly how I left The Gage. $7 for a bowl of fries? $13 for a glass of the 'house' wine? $6 draft beer? Ok, the $6 beer isn't ridiculous, but it's more than I like to spend for a domestic draft. I wanted the hangar steak (well, I wanted a filet or ribeye, but I'm not paying $38 for a steak at a pub). Anyway, I wanted the hangar steak, but it turns out that's not a whole portion - just an appetizer portion. So you're supposed to pay $12 for a bowl of soup, then spend $15 for an appetizer before spending $30+ on an entree? Then pay too much for a beverage? I ended up with a $10 burger. It wasn't bad, but the bun was a bit stale. Actually, it must have been more than just a bit stale, as I was able to detect the stale-ness over all of the grease that was soaked up in the bottom half of the bun. Not me. For those prices, I expect a little more.  I'd also like a bit more of a 'formal' setting for those prices. I don't want to be seated right off the noisy bar, crammed in a table inches from the diners on both sides of me. We were so close, the servers bumped me every freakin' time they went to the table on either side of me.  No, sir, not for me. Save your money. Skip The Gage. I suspect this place will lose the local crowd as soon as the novelty wears off, then have to rely on tourist business to stay open.
