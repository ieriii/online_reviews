This place was recommended by my SO who used to live in Chicago. Apparently the owners of this place also owned Spruce. I guess they have no affiliation with the people who own Spruce in San Francisco but I think they know each other. Anyway, my concierge got me a reservation (for one - how romantic). I walk in and find myself in this great enormously large and beautiful space. Large windows, not cramped or over decorated, with seating along the wall just the way I like it. Since I was alone, the hostess asked if she could get me a magazine. I think I might have been a little rude because I laughed at her and said, "No". I really hope I didn't offend her but I don't need to draw any more attention to myself. I really don't have a problem dining out by myself but it seems like other people get nervous about it for me. Relax people! I can have a good meal by myself! I know this place is known for the wines and I'm supposed to get a glass of wine and pair food with it but I got some bubbly instead with a great cheese plate (Yum! American cheese local to the midwest), which I took to-go and drunkenly finished it several hours later, and an amazing trout dish. I think it was the Lemon trout with fennel puree blah blah blah. It literally melted in my mouth! It was cooked perfectly and went so well with the fennel. I ended with the chocolate mousse. You really can't go wrong with chocolate and ice cream. I also appreciated the little slips of paper that tell you about the wine and cheese you're having. Really prevents the awkwardness that happens when you can't understand what your server is mumbling to you.
