5 stars... hell yeah! The waiter told me all the most popular order from the cheese, appetizers, dish to dessert. One of my best experience in Chicago so far. The food is def flavorful and original. I know this place is good because i had high expectation reading the reviews and usually high expectation leads to disappointment in my case. But I was NOT at all. I had the blue cheese to start with (it was perfect to open my appetite), then had Ropa Vieja (plaintain + beef), Camarones al Ajillo (jumbo shrimp), Costilla De Res (short ribs) and that enormous Carnival Ice cream cakes (not recommended if you're lactose intolerant). I'm going back to try that ceviche and plenty of their other dishes! I love it and plan to go there one day once i recover from my tab! jk
