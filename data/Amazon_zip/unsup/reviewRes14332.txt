I have been wanting to here since it first opened. Luckily, my sister and her husband were in town for the Fourth and wanted to go out. I immediately suggested this place and it interested them both. It wasn't busy for a Friday night which was surprising. It was also July 4th weekend so that may have something to do with it. We couldn't get a table since the restaurant doesn't seat for drinks only until after dinner (11pm, I think) so we snagged a spot by the window with a couple of chairs. This was a cool place. And big. The service was friendly and prices were on point. Since having eaten beforehand, we ordered the bacon fat popcorn which smelled delicious. I didn't eat any since I was full but everyone else seemed to enjoy it. I can't wait to come back for dinner and sample their fare. Thank god I live about a mile from here. Makes for a pleasant evening stroll.
