WOW. Believe the hype my friends. Although a big wait for their brunch, it is well worth it. A tad pricey, just a bit more expensive than my usual brunch tab, but i was blown away from my eggs Benedict, with BEEF TENDERLOIN, get the F____ outta town !! this was the BOMB !! Best-est ever eggs Benedict. . hands down. Their house potatoes were off the chart as well, didn't even need to use the hot sauce (although i did (Cholula - i love that stuff ). Great Bloody Mary and I had a tall boy of Daisy cutter for my side car. If you have someone special in from out of town and want to show them a great brunch spot, take them here. yummy yummy yummy !!
