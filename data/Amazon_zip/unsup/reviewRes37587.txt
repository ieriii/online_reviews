I've been hearing such good things about Hopleaf for so long that I finally succumb to peer pressure and stopped by. The bar was crowded (and it was still fairly early) so we wandered to the upstairs bar. Be forewarned, the upstairs bar only takes cash. The beer selection was great and the bartender was patient. After what seemed like five minutes of perusing the beer menu, I finally settled on a de Koninck.  My only problem with Hopleaf was the lack of seating...well, the lack of available seating. I was one of those people looking longingly at tables full of strangers, trying to move them with my mind. Had we gotten a place to sit we would have ordered snacks. I've heard such wonderful things about the food that I will be back to sample the mussels and frittes+mayo.
