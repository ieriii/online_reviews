Chicago Italian is NOT true Italian, says the blond from Chicago, but after living there for years I have a leg up on traditional. This is about as good as it gets. The dishes are authentic, the portions are NOT American style (huge) and I enjoy the seasonal specials. The owner is a nice man too! Cheers, keep it up.
