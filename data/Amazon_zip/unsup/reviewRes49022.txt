Soooo disappointed! Service was absolutely awful. There were lots of servers and other waitstaff milling around, yet we had to ask repeatedly for simple things like a wine chiller, which arrived after the second bottle was half gone, when we asked why the bread was burned we were told "oh my that is burned, we prefer it not to be"...duh so do we ....never replaced it. I could go on and on, bottom line we wasted $300 and several hours.
