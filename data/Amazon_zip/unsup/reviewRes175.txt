This will be unlike any other meal you've ever eaten or experienced (price wise too).  I give points to Alinea for the creativity and uniqueness in the dishes: a short rib ravioli with the tomato wrapper being the "flag" centerpiece, fried pheasant served off burning leaves, a shortbread dessert served on a pillow that deflates as you eat, releasing earl grey and vanilla aroma. The presentation is captivating and refreshing.  A couple of themes that emerged throughout our 21 course meal were explosions (the black truffle ravioli; gush of apple juice in a horseradish sphere in celery juice, served as a shot; the way our complimentary bday truffes burst open when vanilla ice crema was poured on top of it) and entrees meant to be eaten in one bite (hot potato shooter with butter; edible cocktails). For $250 for this dinner, service was impeccable, as expected. Overall, though, all of the savory courses were overly salty. Don't the chefs taste the creations and/or make sure it's perfection before sending them out? DISAPPOINTING! I couldn't even finish the rabbit consumme, even though it was probably $7/spoonful. And why was there something that resembled a baby walrus tooth hidden in the fried part of my course #9? So, in one sentence, I'm not coming back here, unless you're taking me, and the meal's on you.
