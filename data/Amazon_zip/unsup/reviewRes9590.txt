Best dining experience I have in a while. The $60 3-course price fixe is a great deal, particularly because you get two other courses one of which is a gourmet take on grilled cheese and is paired with a beer! The wine pairings that go with it are well thought out as well. The Ono fish (like a tuna, but even better, and from Hawaii) entree is out of this world. Best fish I've tasted in a while. And I tried Sprout's take on surf and turf which was a skirt steak with grilled octopus, which seems like an odd combo, but totally works well together and both were perfectly cooked. Congrats to Dale and Sara, the top chef alumns, have really created a great restaurant experience! can't wait to come back next time I'm in chicago.
