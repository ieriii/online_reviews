It's a little expensive and almost always busy, but it's always good. I've had a variety of breakfast specials in a crock, but my favorite is their lox/bagel. I know, not a lot of cooking going on there, but they give you a huge portion of lox with tomatoes, cucumber, capers and red onion. So good! And the ingredients have always been fresh. Definitely a good staple.
