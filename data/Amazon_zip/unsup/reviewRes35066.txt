I've been going to SushiX for a few years. I was introduced to it by my sister and I'll admit that it's one of my favorite spots. The ambiance doesn't give the perception of being a sushi joint...very modern and the art on the walls gives the entire place a different vibe. The music gives you more of a lounge feel, but that doesn't take away from the food. They don't have a bar, but it is BYOB and there is no cork fee. Definitely a plus. As far as the food, the sushi is fresh and it's prepared rather quick. The prices are not bad and about the only concern that I would have is that you can't watch the sushi chef make the food. Favorites: Spicy Tuna Salad, Double Stacked, Dragon Fly, White Tiger and a few more. Service is pretty good, that's also because the owners are hands on.
