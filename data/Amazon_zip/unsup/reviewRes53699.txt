Loved it.Loved, loved, loved it.Went here for the first time after the boyfriend and I got into a screaming fight and decided to make up over hot dogs and cheese fries. Got there around 11:30, waited maybe 10 minutes and was treated with a delicious, delicious chicken and cranberry sausage, coated in honey with thick chunks of creamy, salty cheese. Needless to say, the relationship has lasted more than the day, and my Hot Doug's experience has been cemented in my mind as a top 10 experience. If you're in the city, just go. You're welcome in advance.
