Our room was cozy. I really couldn't hear anyone in the halls or rooms next to ours. Unfortunately, on the weekend we could hear the bars downstairs quite a bit, but it wasn't too bad. I wish there had been more outlets for all our electronic devices. We loved the morning continental breakfast and the evening happy hour. The workout room was clean with modern equipment. The staff was always very helpful and pleasant.
