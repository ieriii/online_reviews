Don't kid yourself, you're paying for location and not much else. Mind you, the staff was nice and attentive, but that's mostly because they know it's the only thing that they've got to cling to. The facilities are atrocious. "Quaint," or "charming," or "has character," would apply if the rooms were small but well maintained and attended to, which they aren't. The shower had barely warm water and backed up such that I had water about 4 inches deep by the end of my short, cold, shower. The images shown of the hotel are of the, admittedly, nice lobby and the penthouse suite. The actual room we stayed in? Comparable to the YMCA room I stayed in while on spring break in New Orleans during college. If it were anywhere else besides 1 block off of Michigan Ave., the phrase "seedy dive" would spring to mind. I really don't want to waste anymore of my time on this place, so I'll stop now. PS, we got it through Hotwire and they claimed it to be a 3 star "boutique." Crazy.
