I wish we had this here in San Francisco! The meats were perfectly cooked. There was an abundance of them - lamb, chicken, sirloin, tri-tip, garlic beef...you name it, they have it. The salad bar was fresh and complete. I wish they had fried plantains but I guess the fried bananas were good enough. I didn't care much for the polenta and sweet potatoes. We shared the papaya creme for dessert and that was very refreshing. I will definitely come back here the next come I visit Chicago.
