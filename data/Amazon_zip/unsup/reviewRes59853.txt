I have had the pleasure of dining at this Chicago style restaurant over the years. It is always delightful!Recently, we enjoyed our Valentine's day dinner at Kinzi. We arrived and greeted as though they had been waiting for us all night escorting us to a special table as requested.Our server, who was very busy for the special day, made us feel as though we were his only table, making recommendations on both food and wine. We selected the pre-fix Valentine's Day special with wine pairing . Not only beautiful but delicious. All for a noticable and delightful value. Both Susan, the owner and staff could not have made us feel more at home. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!PS - We reconnected with Michelle, the manager, who we knew from a previous restaurant and we are thrilled that she found such a great home! Looking forward to our next visit! Warmly, Tim
