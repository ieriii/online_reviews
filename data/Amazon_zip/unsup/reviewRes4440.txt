Only been in here once, to grab a drink before a concert but Oooooh I like! It is small and cosy, retro and had a great jazzy pianist. I don't know if the bouncer was really mean or not (yikes) but he told me date and I 'that if he saw our faces in there after 9 pm we'd be in trouble" as we weren't there for the show. Zoinks! Nevertheless, drumming it up to the fact that this used to be one of Al Capone's hangouts.. atttitude comes with the territory and I for one LOVED it!! :P Will be back!
