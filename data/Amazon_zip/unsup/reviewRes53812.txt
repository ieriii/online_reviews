I am thoroughly addicted. The ribeye sausage with chimmi-churri is phenomenal. Ditto for the spicy pork hot link with the coca cola barbecue sauce. Any bacon sausage is well, bacon...how could it be bad, and the combinations of flavors Doug comes up with are really delectable. Yes, the lines are long...go early, but if you find yourself in a long line, don't fret...it moves fast, even my 2 year old can handle the wait. Try to eat there, as the fries tend to get steamed on the way home. And as for the fries, I am not a big fan usually, but I could eat an entire basket of the duck fries myself.
