Came here for Mother's Day and was excited that they've expanded their menu. They also had a singer out on the patio, which was nice. I had the garlic shrimp special. This was at least 8 giant garlicky shrimp cooked to perfection with rice, beans, and plantains. The BF and my mother had this pork special they normally have that's slow cooked and then fried crispy to order. I'm not a huge fan of pork but I'm coming back for that! My dad also had the chimichurri steak, which was delicious. Service was great and I was pleased that he kept wishing my mom and Happy Mother's Day. I'm so lucky to live so close!
