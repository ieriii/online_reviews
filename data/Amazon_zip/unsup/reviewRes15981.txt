What can I say about this place that hasn't been said before? I visited back in August 2009 and was pleasantly surprised. I had become enlightened to the trend of 'speakeasys' and had visited a few on my frequent trips to NYC. Living in Chicago, I wanted to get entangled in the speakeasy culture that drew comparison to the Prohib-era of the roaring 20's, Capone, etc. I had been to the Green Mill (as most late-night Chicagoans have) and soaked up the jazz and flapper-style service you'd expect at a prohib-throwback, but the Violet Hour pays homage to the underground scene rather than the above floor burlesque-ing. We didn't wait long, by the light on the side of the wall and passed the time chatting it up with a few others who were out of town or new to the speakeasy experience. Moments later a not-so-armed guard opened the side panelling hidden in the wall to let us through to a lobby area separating debauchery with a curtain. In this area we waited another 5 mins or so and were seated at the bar with our Wehman Bros. enlightened bartender and his aptly dressed cohorts. Our drinks were pretty solid. Not the "best I ever had (Drake)" but I always appreciate the mixers that know how to use bitters (and not OVER use) as well as any variants of absinthe. The only lacking piece is how distant all of the people here seem to be, physically and socially. With booths spread far out from the bar spread from the back rooms, it's more of a place to be ashamed of drinking rather than celebrating it. I'd prefer a speakeasy to translate into "let's not have a tv on in the background and talk without being distracted by dbags flailing j-bombs" which Violet Hour more than does, but how easy does one have to speak in this place? Overall: visit, it's trendy, it's legit, it's cool, but next time you visit, try striking up convos with those around you. Don't be bashful!
