Eh, not impressed with the pizza overall but loved their marinara sauce for the garlic bread. We had both the stuffed crust and the thin crust. Thin crust had WAY WAY WAY too much cheese on it. I was literally eating cheese with a tiny piece of crust-not my style. Fun atmosphere, great staff and lots of tv's so a great place to meet to watch a game. However, if you're going for really good Chicago pizza, stick w/LouMals. Not sure how ppl say this is the best deep dish they've ever had...different tastes I suppose.
