Wow, from the moment that I saw Glenn's Diner on Check Please...many, many years ago, I've been determined to come here. Obviously, I'm a bit of a slacker/procrastinator, since my visit finally occurred. Was it worth it? I would say so. My companion (by now a seasoned veteran of Glenn's, courtesy of a few telecom lunches) and I both took advantage of the fresh catch special. This involved a starter course of an ample salad and soup (French Onion for me, $1 something upgrade). This paired along with our Blood Marys could have easily made for a filling and satisfying lunch. But of course it didn't stop there. Our entrees came with a side of asparagus and a potato pancake. He got the trout and I got catfish. The catfish was mild in flavor, meaty and well cooked. I'm excited to step outside of my typical fish eating options and try the other varieties they have to offer. Regardless of the Fresh Catch special deal the check was still a bit on the pricey side, but I think we really got a great meal out of it.
