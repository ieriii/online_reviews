Service was great both times I went. The gal tonight was super nice and recommended all the things she likes and made us feel not so bad for indulging in the chocolate chunk bread pudding, omfg, yuuuuum. I had never had a reuben before I tried it here, because I didn't think I liked rye bread or sauerkraut, but it sounded tempting so I went for the Tempeh Reuben and it was nOm, as was the Cremini Mushroom Pizza I had tonight - so flavorful. I am also not typically a fan of potato salad, but I totally scarfed that Blue Cheese Potato Salad down. I can also recommend the Garlic Cream Cheese Mashed Potatoes, drool.. dang, I eat a lot - not like that skinny jerk sitting at the table next to me who ordered a salad and ate like TWO bites! Seriously?! Anyway, the atmosphere: great decor, large space, pretty. The crowd was mostly yuppie I'd say, but I really don't get people getting all excited about not wanting to go places and being intimidated just because of the crowd. Who cares? I had the Bottom Up Belgian beer, but I'm not a very good judge of beer, so I'm not going to pretend that I know what I'm talking about. I liked it though.
