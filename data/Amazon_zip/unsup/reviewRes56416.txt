Consistently fresh, healthy, delicious food with super-friendly service. If you live in Lincoln Park and you haven't paid this place a visit, you're missing out. Highlights include the shrimp tamarind soup (which is plenty big enough to share) and the dish with grilled beef, calamari, AND shrimp (served over noodles with a light sauce and a salad). Plentiful fresh, crispy bean sprouts and leafy cilantro come with lots of the plates here. The owner is extremely passionate about his food and making the place welcoming for diners or take-out customers. The complimentary seasonal fresh fruit doesn't hurt either.
