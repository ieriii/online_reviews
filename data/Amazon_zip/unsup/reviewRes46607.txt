This place was awesome. I joined yelp just to rave. I live in Chicago, and tho this place probably used to be a tourist trap, its all locals now. The food was EXCELLENT. Huge portions, amazing vegetarian nachos, the salad bar had sooo many delicious and unusual things on it. We ate like pigs and git a free birthday dessert, and our bill was only 65 dollars for three of us. Great for locals or locals with out of town guests. Fun place, good music, great service.
