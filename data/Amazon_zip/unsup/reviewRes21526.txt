Good stuff. This was my first visit to this eating establishment and it definitely will not be my last. I was being dragged along in tow by my wife who was having a crazy ass paper fetish that day (spent almost $50 at that Paper Source place). I had a crazy hankerin' for a margarita so I yelped it and voila: Mayan Palace. And guess what? It was our lucky day! My tequila craving became almost full blown delirium when I discovered that house margaritas were half off! We also happened to be in the neighborhood too. Couldn't have worked out better for us. Now, to the food. It was good, had large portions, but I believe there was some American-ized palate pleasing going on with some of the dishes. There is no reason for whipped cream on flan and the ceviche shoulda been spicier. Not even the bottle of hot sauce he gave us for it could do it any justice. Those margaritas were awesome though! You could smell the tequila before the glasses were set on your table. See you soon!
