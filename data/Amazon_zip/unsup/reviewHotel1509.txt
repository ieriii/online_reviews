Great hotel, great location. stayed here for St. Paddys' day. The rooms were big and the view amazing, of the river there in Chicago. Positives were the staff, especially the front desk were excellent. Check in was super quick and easy and they upgraded my room to a river view! Room was large, the beds were comfortable. Keurig in the room, TVs were nice, and a big desk. Main complaints were that they weren't serving a breakfast when I was there, only a breakfast buffet which wasn't too bad but was like $22 bucks (I think it being St. Paddys day they had a lot of people taking the day off). Also the Elevators were pretty slow, sometimes waiting 5 minutes. I would stay here again.
