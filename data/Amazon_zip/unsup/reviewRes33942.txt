I was brought here for a pre-birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. I hadn't been in a while and now wish I hadn't stayed away for so long. They change the menu daily which is great for variety, but not if you fall in love with a dish. You may have to put an APB out on it as you may never see it again. On the past dates I've been on here I always thought it was too loud, but seeing as it was 2 days before Xmas it was mostly families having dinner. I had the penne alla paesana - sauted Italian sausage with mushrooms and peas in a tomato cream sauce. Again, sure I'll never see it again. My date had the gnocchi with a light tomato basil sauce, with melted mozzarella olive oil & parmesan. The wine by the glass list seems a bit skimpy, so we opted for a bottle. But just because the by the glass list was skimpy.....
