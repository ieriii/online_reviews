Oh Shaw's, how I love you. Hubby and I did a little stay-cation a few weeks ago and since he'd never been to Shaw's (unheard of in our house--he's been absolutely everywhere), we decided to get a table. I splurged on the king crab and dear heavenly father was it fantastic. We got the au gratins and the green beans as sides, and they were to die for, as well. Our server was pleasant, but definitely more on the subdued side, which was fine with us. We don't always need someone who seems to feel he/she is part of our dinner date--our server was efficient and knowledgeable and we liked that. It was a great night to splurge and well worth it, too!
