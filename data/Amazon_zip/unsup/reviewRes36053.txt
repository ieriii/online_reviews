Orange, banana, strawberry with honey juice blend ($4.95) - I asked for a sweet juice snd this is what the waitress recommended. Soo yummy and fresh. I think they usr a Vita Mix because it was blended so well. Came in a very elegant slender glass. No ice though, so it was luke warm or room temperature.  Coffee ($2.65) - good Breakfast Crepe ($9.25) - YUM! Loved it. Came with 2 crepes...i was barely able to finish 1 1/2. Crepe was so fluffy and light, and the inside was super flavorful. Sauce on top was abit too tangy for me tho. Hash Eggs Beneduct ($11.25) - also super delicious! My husband had this and I snuck in a few bites. Came with 2. Side potatoes were perfectly cooked and tender.  Overall, we were very well pleased, and going here reminds me if why I trust using Yelp recommendations :)
