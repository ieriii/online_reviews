I've been wanting to come here for the longest and I had high expectations, but they did fall a little short. I had lunch with a friend on the patio. Her 1 year old son was with us and I must say they were very kid friendly. High chair, crayons, and sippy cup. We ordered the trio of empanadas with beef, ropa vieja, & chorizo. The ropa vieja was pretty good, but the chorizo was disgusting. It tasted like chorizo paste. I had the cuban sandwich and it was not the best I've had. The bread was way too hard. My friend had the steak sandwich. I enjoyed it except for the fact that it was way too greasy. I'm guessing it was all that oil in the chimichurri sauce. The sandwiches came with plaintain chips which i didn't care for. The service was slow at first. It took about 15 minutes for our server to first show up. The service did get better after that. I will give 90 miles another shot, but I will order a dinner plate the next time around.
