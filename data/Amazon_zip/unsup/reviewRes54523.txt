It's rare that my wife and I can find a restaurant that we like as well as our kids. The vegetarian selection is amazing and I highly recommend the gyros. The staff is excellent and they brought out our kids mac & cheese within 10 minutes of ordering. Needless to say, our kids were happy which allowed my wife and I to enjoy our dinner!
