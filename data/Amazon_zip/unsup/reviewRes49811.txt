WOW, what a great surprise! We were not expecting this restaurant to be as great as it was! The decor is super cute and tastefully done. Dimmed lighting. Perfect for a group of people or a date night. Crowded, but not so loud that I couldn't hear my date talk. Our Server was PHENOMENAL!! He recommended our drinks (a mixed drink and red wine) and both were excellent. He also recommended our entrees too...We got the combination entrees and it was absolutely delicious! The steak and chicken was perfectly cooked and the seafood was tasty. We gave our server a 40% tip because he was that good! Overall, a wonderful experience! HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
