LOVE LOVE LOVE Sprout. They know how to prepare amazing fresh flavors and the presentations are like art! You feel healthy after your meal as everything is nutritious and not heavy. The atmosphere is classy and warm. I have had everything on the menu and love that they change things up so you always have something new to try. The staff is so well educated on the flavors which makes ordering really fun. The wine and cocktails are just as good as the food which is rare. If you have not tried Sprout...GO as you will cherish the meal for weeks!
