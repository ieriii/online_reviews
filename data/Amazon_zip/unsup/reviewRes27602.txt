So I went out to a diner club, and I was apprehensive because I'm not a big fan of mexican food. I have to say that both the appetizer that I had, plus the entree changed my mind (I will attach a pic later). The place is a bit pricey, but if all resturants did mexican food as well as this place I would eat it all the time.
