I was brought here for breakfast last week by a friend. Had no idea what to expect but wow was I amazed.  The bar is gorgeous and there selection is fantastic. On their shelf sits a delicious bottle of Middleton whiskey, a special reserve from Jameson. I have never seen a bottle of this outside of Ireland and trust me I have looked. The coffee was superb and strong. I am a regular coffee drinker and I think I got a buzz off this stuff! The menu is full of creative dishes that simply make your mouth drool. I had the crab egg's benedict and it was perfect. The potatoes are also insane. Overall, I felt like I might have a coronary after leaving this place but would happily take a cholesterol pill to return!
