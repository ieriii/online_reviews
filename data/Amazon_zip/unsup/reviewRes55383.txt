This is the best Persian food in Chicago -- so I'm told by an Iranian friend.Quite aside from his words, I like it a lot. Of their kababs, their ground meat one is my favorite. Oddly enough, the more expensive filet mignon is less enticing; it's been too chewy the times I've tried it. Their salmon is also very good, fresh and perfectly done. As for rice, the dill rice is both traditional and clearly the best.Their hummus and babaganush were very good, though not extraordinary. Desserts look like the Middle Eastern classics, whichto my taste buds, come through as all the same.I've both eat in and taken out -- they don't stint on the take-out, and itsvery reasonable, even if you have company. I can almost smell that dill rice.....mmmmm. It's worth a visit just for the rice.
