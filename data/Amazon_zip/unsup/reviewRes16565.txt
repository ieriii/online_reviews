This being my first yelp review, I decided to go with the strange and somewhat intriguing Violet Hour. From first glance, this "speakeasy" seems like another forgotten storefront that happens to have a snazzily dressed man out in front. The good parts: - quirky cocktails, wide array of top-shelf liquor, they even have mezcal! - interesting decor; those tall chairs that make you feel all Alice-in-wonderlandish The bad: - Skip the pork flatbread. It was bland, kinda soggy, and just plain boring. - Supposed long waits to get inside (there was no one outside when I got there) - LONG waits to get drinks. We waited a half hour for two drinks. My friends and I didn't appreciate that the girl next to us (an admittedly hipster-ish looking girl with yellow stockings) sat down and had her drinks within 8 (we counted) minutes. - tons of Wicker park, lincoln park types. Then again, the Violet Hour is on Damen so we should have expected this. Overall: Not too bad, kinda quirky, lovely cocktails, nice chairs. Made me feel like I was in an episode of Gossip Girl (or some other rich, jet-setting young person show).
