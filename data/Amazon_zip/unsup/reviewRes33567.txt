CONFESSION: I ATE CARBS Yes, I admit it. I ate carbs for Mia Francesca, and damn it was worth it. When my giant bowl of spaghetti abruzzese arrived, teaming with sausage and pancetta, it was 'so long' Atkins. I must admit that I was a bit concerned when I found out that the Mia Francesca empire includes 15 locations in Chicago-land. Would this be some sort of Olive Garden/Bucca di Beppo high-on-quantity-low-on-taste experience? Not at all.  Mia won me over from start to finish with fresh, piping hot bread, attentive service, a great wine recommendation, a menu that changes weekly, and most importantly excellent food. I'm hitting the treadmill now to earn my next visit!
