Came here for Restaurant Week with my fiance... YUM!!! The food is amazing! As stated before, the salad bar could easily be your whole meal by itself! Minus 1 star for the wait. We had reservations for Saturday night. When we got there they were definitely over booked. People were everywhere in the lobby, even sitting on the floor. We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated for our reservation. The food made up for it though! The lobster bisque... so delicious!!!!
