Worth the 45+ minute wait? Absolutely not. Worth being herded like cattle and nagged by some random guy behind the counter every 5-10 minutes? No. I really wanted to try something new in Chicago, and with the Rick Bayless name tacked on, thought it would be a guaranteed delicious spot. The tortas were fine. Tasty? yes. Did that wait make those tortas that much better? no. Had the chicken tinga and requested it without the black beans, but the cashier absolutely insisted that I keep them on- and had a long, drawn-out story defending the beans, so I did. Really didn't add anything to the torta itself; I would have been happier without them.  Choriqueso was fine. Good for a lunch if you can avoid a long wait, otherwise turn around and pick another place.
