Make sure to try the Wild Hipster Beard Fois Gras and don't forget to put your specially made rough hewed plaid napkin on your lap. Yea this hipster Hunting Lodge is full of itself and then some. Way to ruin traditional food. But hey, it's hip to be faux every thing these days. But it could be worse, at least they didn't put "Revolutionary" in front of Longman & Eagle. But something tells me that the owners went to the same high school and show up at the same family reunions as the brewery owners. Needless to say, I'm looking forward to trying the "hotel" I never thought I'd say this, but I miss the Winds Cafe. p.s. I added another star because our server was excellent
