Have been going here since 2002. Best stuffed pizza in Chicago. Now to be clear, I'm giving 5 stars to the pizza. I would advise against ordering anything else off the menu. Pizza is what they do best, the rest is unfortunately filler. The stuffed pepperoni and stuffed spinach and mushroom can't be beat!
