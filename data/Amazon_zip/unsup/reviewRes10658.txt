I was at the wicker park location and ordered a french toast with strawberry sauce and bunch of sweets on top, I dont quite remember what exactly was on it. I think the menu changes every so often. The first bite was unique, where it's very tasty and addicting. After that, I feel like just chugging sugar, b/c every bites gets sweeter. I also tried an omelette, which is your typical American omelette. Nothing speical. Other than that, I like the variety and unique breakfast/brunch option. It's not your typical breakfast place. I will try something different next time.
