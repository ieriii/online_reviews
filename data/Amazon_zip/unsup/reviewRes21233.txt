We've been back a few times, let's just say. And frankly, each time we go back, I have food that is absolutely stunningly delicious. My new favorite thing is having burritos or chimichangas "supreme". Green mole and fresh avo? I'm in.  Guac is still as awesome as ever, and the rice is definitely some of the best I've ever had in my life. I haven't yet found a homestyle place in our area with better Mexican; if you're picking between this and Nuevo Mexicano, no contest. No. Contest.
