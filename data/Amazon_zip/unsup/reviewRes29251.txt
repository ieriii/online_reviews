Rick Bayless.... I heart you. I really do. No foolies. Your margaritas are tasty. Your service is friendly and prompt. Your food was smokey with a little bit of spice, and I like that. Frontera is bright but not too bright, friendly and warm. My friend and I came here for dinner here on Saturday and I was excited to dine. I talked all week about coming here and it didn't disappoint. We had no reservations but scored seats at the bar, closer to those margaritas. We had their appetizer sampler, a little of their tasty guacamole, munched on their bright and fresh civieche, cheesy quesadillas, (think more empanada like), chicken taquitos and a great jicama pineapple salad with chile and lime. She had the al pastor tacos which were smokey with sweet carmalized onion and a touch of spiciness. I had the roasted pork loin, in a spicy red sauce, avocados and a little queso fresco and by the time I was done with it there was just the cilantro garnish left on the plate. Then there was dessert, she had a great chocolate pecan pie. I had the homemade ice cream with a scoop of almond and a scoop of kaluha cake ice cream with a caramel sauce, (with cinnamon and goat's milk), and a hot and thick chocolate sauce on the side. I had a really hard time not licking the containers clean. My inner child was pissed off. From start to finish it was a great dining experience. Although my friend wasn't pleased with the smokiness from the chipotle that can be found in most dishes nor the general spiciness, I was in heaven... and I can't wait to go back. But trust me.. I will plan ahead and make reservations.
