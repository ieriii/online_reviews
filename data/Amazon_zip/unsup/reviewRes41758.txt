I hate to admit this, but I love these steaks in butter. Ruth's Chris has certainly played a role in my 20 lb weight gain over the last 3 years, but I've enjoyed it a lot. I'd love to say that I am such a Steak connoisseur that I just love the meat, but man is butter good! Match this with creamed spinach and caesar salad and you are ready for a delicious 4000 calorie meal!
