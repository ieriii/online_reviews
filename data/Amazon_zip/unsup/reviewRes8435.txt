If you ever want to experience what it must have been like to be an ancient Roman during a huge gluttonous feast, this is it (minus the vomitorium). Once you flip your little coaster over to green to signal the waiters, you will be bombarded with choice succulent cuts of all kinds of meat, flying at you from all angles. Remember to flip it back to red to catch your breath. Before the meat course, you'll first experience the amazing salad bar, the best I've ever seen. Calling it a salad bar doesn't do it justice. You'll have to try to exercise some self control here if you plan to eat a lot of meat. But it's not easy. On top of all that, you'll get unending side dishes of delicious mashed potatoes, fried bananas, fried polenta, and out of this world little buttery muffins. There are a few Brazilian steak houses like this in town. I have been to Brazzaz, which is essentially the same, same food, same price, but not as good for atmosphere. I just found out that you can just pay to go to the salad bar, which is a great deal in itself. Also, if you are able, going for lunch is a good idea, because it is all the same food, just half the price.
