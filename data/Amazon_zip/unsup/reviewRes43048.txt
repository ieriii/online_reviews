I didn't really think their deep dish was as good as it's cracked up to be. The service was shoddy, and their salads are PATHETIC. It's like they took the parts of iceberg lettuce that no one actually eats and toss in a couple cherry tomatoes. They seriously need to put more pizza sauce on their pizza, cause it was just kinda dry. Maybe I had a one time bad experience, I don't know, but it definitely could have been better.
