I have had better sushi from a conveyor belt. The rice was gooey rather than sticky. The fish was grainy. It all just tasted like it had been sitting for too long. The menu and decor need major work as does the care and handling of the ingredients. The price would have been solid had the food been enjoyable. Very disappointed since its in my hood.
