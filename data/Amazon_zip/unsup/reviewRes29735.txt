Omigawww I'm in love with this place. It makes me want to squeal and kick my legs like a little girl. I'm trying my best to suppress these impulses since I'm writing this review at work. Anyway, here's why. Steak for $17, perfectly med-rare as requested. Beautiful hash browns and pan-fried potatoes.. how do they get them so crispy?! Option for spinach caesar, uh brilliant. Delicious new orleans burger, especially with those pretzel buns! Cozy spot just off the craziness of rush/division, could def be a regular here. The sweetest servers, ps I want to be your friend, guys. Casual but also kinda nice.. if that makes any sense. Artwork for sale I think on the walls. AHH love it. I've been charmed, and I think you will be too.
