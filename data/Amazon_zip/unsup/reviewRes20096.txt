Awesome sushi. Ask the waitress for an order of fresh wasabi. Someone in my party recommended it, and I didn't believe how good it could be; it really trumps the standard wasabi mash. I was in a large party, the wait to get food was long, but the place was packed, which is surprising (at least to me) for a Sunday night at 8:30 p.m. We did have a reservation, but they wouldn't seat us until we were all there. Not bad though, the decor is really nice and the whole restaurant is open and airy. And once again, I was tricked by a mirror that I thought was more restaurant, but it was really a mirror. They are BYOB, and they do a fantastic job taking care of your bottles, 6-packs, etc. Overall, a great experience, in a clean and modern environment.
