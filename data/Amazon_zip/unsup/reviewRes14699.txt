Went here for the first time last week. It was a little awkward walking in; we went into the bar, which was dark and empty. Wanting to dine outside anyway, we walked into the courtyard and the waitstaff ignored us, then ushered us back inside to speak to the manager (as though we were being sent to the principal's office). My wife eventually found the host in the room behind the bar, and we were seated. The patio was lovely, as was the free pizza bread. However, the service was VERY slow; I do not mind a slow dinner, but the slowness seemed less intentional and more due to a lack of sufficient staff. Complaints aside, the food was good. There was fish, pasta, risotto, and veal ordered at the table, and all were satisfied. Not amazing, not spectacular, but a respectable meal. We passed on the showy desserts. Too full. Maybe next time?
