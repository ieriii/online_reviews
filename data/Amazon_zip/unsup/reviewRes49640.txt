Went here for a girls' night (you would think we'd go somewhere that serves salads, wouldn't you?) and we all left pleasantly satiated.  We called ahead to put our names in, which was a good thing, as it was an hour wait. When we arrived, we got to skip ahead of the line, which was super cool. Although the place is loud (especially if you are seated by a speaker), and the windows don't seem to have much insulation (important point if you visit in the winter), the place had great ambiance, and the air smelled so delicious that it made my mouth water. We all ordered some form of steak combo platter, which included a baked potato, yucca, and plantain. Switching between the sweetness of the plantain and the crunchiness of the yucca between bites of seasoned meat completed the meal. A friend warned that the meat will get overcooked, so I ordered mine medium, and it came out medium well (just what I wanted). The steak was perfectly seasoned, though a little chewy at times, but I'd skip the chicken - it didn't bowl me over.  My friend ordered coconut flan and insisted I try it, though I'm not a fan of coconut. Or flan, for that matter. But it was pretty damn good! I'm not a convert, but if I did like coconut and/or flan, I'd order it next time. The great thing was that we didn't feel rushed to get up from our table once we were done eating. Instead, we stuck around a half hour longer to finish our wine and chat. It was a great way to stay out of the cold. Summary: BYOB + steak. Can't really go wrong.
