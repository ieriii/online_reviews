First fondue restaurant I have been to and was a little caught off guard but then got into the swing of things. The food was ok I would like to try another fondue restaurant to rate the difference but overall I was not as impressed as others on yelp. Be prepared to pay for this expensive meal without seasoning and be prepared to cook it yourself maybe bring some seasoning in your pocket for some flavor. The best i will say is the dessert if I return I will only go for the dessert fondue.
