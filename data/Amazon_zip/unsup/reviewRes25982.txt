The best deep dish in Chicago, hands down. And I don't even LIKE deep dish! I first had Pequod's when it was delivered to a friend's over the summer. I finally got my butt off the couch and made my way to Pequod's -- which is in a totally inconvenient location, by the way (almost impossible to get to via CTA) - and I was so glad I did. We ordered a medium deep dish with sausage and olives. The caramelized crust was phenomenal, and the pizza itself wasn't too overwhelming. There were leftovers for everyone. One slightly annoying thing about this place would be the patrons. Yes, I realize this includes me, but I'm talking about all the bros who look alike/wear the same button down shirts. What's even more awkward is that when I was here, there was a table that was basically having like a speed dating event or whatever. Sigh. But the pizza is good! That's all that matters.
