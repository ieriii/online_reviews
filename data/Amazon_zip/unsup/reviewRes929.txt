On my third visit to Chicago, I finally checked off this place on my to-eat list! It took an hour of commute and almost an hour wait, but the encased meat do not disappoint! Being a foie gras fans, of coz I ordered the foie gras duck sausage. I love its creamy texture and some how the rich and bold flavor of the duck sausage reminds of Chinese sausages. To my surprise, I like the blue cheese and pork sausage even more. It's soooooo juicy I wanted to get another one without the bun :)
