I have only been to Greek Islands a few times and was pleasantly surprised by the food and somewhat overwhelmed by the crowd. I might have given this place 4 stars if they did not make us wait an hour to be seated with reservations in a crowded entrance area.  The saganaki was very good as was some pink fish spread for an appetizer. The wine was also better than anticipated. The lamb chops were delicious and moist and were served with some eggplant thing and potatoes. Many of my dining companions enjoyed the combination plate except for the leg of lamb which was supposedly pretty dry. I think this would be a decent place to go to for lunch but I would skip the weekends as there are way too many people and comprable restaurants across the street.
