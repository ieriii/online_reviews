Had lunch there for the 1st time today. The lechon sandwich was great...and the green plantains side is really tasty. My only regret is that I didn't discover this place sooner. Seating is kind of tight, as there's not a lot of room, but the food is fantastic...and the service is very cordial and upbeat!
