Yes, the location on Michigan Avenue is great, there is also a fairly busy bar scene if you feel like mingling with out-of-towners, but the decor of the place is a little crazy.  The bathroom is small and the room service food wasn't great and the worst part is that I asked for breakfast to be delivered between 7:45-8:00 and they came knocking at 6:30 (that's 3:30am in California).  Notable fact-if you need a FedEx Kinkos they have one on the second floor of the hotel, they'll also charge you a $55 service fee to deliver boxes, you've already paid to ship, to your room from their second floor facility. Wow.
