I heard nothing but great things about the PP, but was somewhat skeptical about the Mich. Ave address (as most restaurants tend to be overpriced, and low quality). Purple Pig scored big in all criteria: food, wine, ambiance, and price. The menus (food and wine) were fantastic, with lots of unique offerings.  Everything we was amazing: - Rosemary, garlic pork fried almonds - Roasted bone marrow w/ herbs - Crispy Pig Ear w/ peppers and fried egg - Pork Jowl...AWESOME **must try/have** The wine menu was super diverse, with tons of esoteric varietals. This makes me happy! Pricing was very reasonable, and anything under $40/btl you could order by the half bottle. Great concept, as I'm a fan of letting people try a lot of new things on a list. We will be returning many, many times! Oink oink...
