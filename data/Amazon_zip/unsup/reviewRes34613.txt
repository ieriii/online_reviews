yeah it's good, but i feel like this is one of those places I am suppose to like because everyone suggests it or mentions it when they share "must go to" for cheap eats in wicker park. So i wasn't amazed. It was cheap and there were healthy options and it was authentic, but the buffet, slop it on style was not very appealing and just didn't make me say " hell yeah". I didn't hate it, it wasn't terrible and I will tag along to go if I'm in the neighborhood and strapped for cash.........but I'm not writing home about it.
