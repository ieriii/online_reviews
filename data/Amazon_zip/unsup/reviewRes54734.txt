We had an excellent dinner at Shaw's. We told our waitress we had a 7:45 reservation for a sunset cruise, and she had us fed and outta there in perfect time. Further, she answered all our questions honestly and knowledgeably and recommended a perfect white wine for our dinner. The crab cake was moist and succulent with tons of crab and an excellent remoulade on the side. Great service, great food, great restaurant. I actually wrote home about it!
