This place is amazing! Some of the best food I've ever had--not just in Chicago but anywhere. And seriously, what restaurant offers a free limo ride to and from the restaurant? We took advantage of the offer and were greeted promptly by a limo waiting for us at our door. The restaurant itself is charming--a very cute spot for a date or a special occasion. And the food was DIVINE! We started with a few appetizers--the flaming cheese dish, calamari and polenta--which all were outstanding. I had the Wrapped Kataifi Shrimp for an entree and it was unbelievably yummy--golden, crispy, buttery and SO good!And beyond the delicious food, what amazing hospitabilty! We were treated liked royalty all night long. The owner, who is so generous and hilarious, treated us to two free appetizers, along with a spirited round of shots and a couple free beers. The wait staff was ultra attentive and kind too--everyone just seemed genuinely pleased we were there and went out of their way to take care of us. The bottom line? You'd be really hard pressed to find a more unique, delicious, and fun restaurant. You've simply GOT to go! You won't be disappointed.
