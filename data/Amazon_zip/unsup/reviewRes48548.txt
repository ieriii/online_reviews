I worship at the Altar of Pigs, and The Publican is my temple. Not much to left to say, but I have 2 tips. Tip 1: Their Sunday brunch is in the $10 range, making it a really cheap way to worship (scrapple that is mostly pig belly = very pious). Tip 2: Order the chicken (during normal dinner hours). I know it sounds boring compared to the other items. But it's crazy good. Get it.
