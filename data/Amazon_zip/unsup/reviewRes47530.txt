I have now been to Zed twice, once for dinner and then for brunch. And I must say dinner pales in comparision to the outstanding brunch that they offer. In both scenarios, you are offered a buffet to start with and then entrees after (once you put a table stone next to your plate). The apps for dinner were similar to the ones for brunch, but more cold cuts were available. On to brunch- and what a spectacle it is. 29$ buys you unlimited amounts of food post the apps. with the $5 mimosas and bloody marys flowing, my faves were - the poached eggs on top of corned ham - beef on a skewer - french toast (was super spongy and had a cake-like texture that was incredible) - duck confit potatoes - man I could have eaten those forever - maple bacon Things that left me cold - frittatas - cold cuts Additionally, you have an incredible ambiance to match your brunch- great space, well designed, awesome fireplace and lots of wood around on the walls and tables Enjoy!
