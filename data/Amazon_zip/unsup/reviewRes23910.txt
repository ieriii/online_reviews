Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. I generally rate an entire restaurant by the quality of their crab rangoon and it was top-notch here (some may disagree with my methodology, but at least it's consistent!). Beef Satay was extra spicy, extra juicy, and extra delicious. Good tea, good service, good selection: this place is the whole package.
