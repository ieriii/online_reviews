Apparently saying "I'm going to Carnivale" confuses people a lot, so it's best to phrase it as "I'm going to a pretty awesome restaurant called Carnivale!" The restaurant is pretty large, and my party of seven was seated in the back bar. The service was pretty solid to start, getting our mojito orders. The coconut mojito is delicious, so definitely try that if you're into that. We started with a large order of guacomole, which was about enough to sustain our table. Our entrees arrived in a timely fashion, as well, ranging from ceviches, fish, other seafood, and steaks. My order of sockeye salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, I only wish it was in a bigger portion. The chimichurri on my friend's steak was pretty fantastic, as well. Everyone was pleased with their choices, more or less. It's also worthy to note that the restaurant only stocks from organic farms, which is the best part about eating here.
