By far the best establishment in Greek town. I go there any chance I get, and still cannot get enough. The out of town guests that I have brought there all loved the baklava, the chocolate eclair and the kadaif. I personally love the spanakopita and the traditional soup. Their bakery is amazing and I order cakes from them several times a year for birthdays or parties - my absolute favorites are the Royal (white chocolate mousse) and the Chocolate Rasberry truffle. They are a hit every time and I get lost of compliments from my food loving friends.
