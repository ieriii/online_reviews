I have eaten here dozens of times, and had them deliver to two parties of mine. Their home-brewed beers are second to none, you can expect to drink some of the best beer around on each visit. Atmosphere is amazing, and it is not only a great place for sports but also children can go there in the afternoons and early evening. Some of the best thin crust pizza in Chicago, and I grew up on NY style. We have yet to find better pizza in Chicago and have eaten at so many popular places. The real test was ordering 15 pizzas for a party full of New Englanders, and that passed with flying colors!!
