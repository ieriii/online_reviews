My boyfriend drunk dialed me from The Publican one night. All he kept saying was, "I'm in Germany! I'm in Germany!". Obviously he wasn't but he certainly felt the restaurant had an Eastern European feel (he lived in Berlin for 4 months last year). I was jealous that he got to go there before me. We'd been trying to get reservations for weeks. Apparently he got a late-night reservation there while I was out of town. My first go at this restaurant was for brunch with that same BF. We called the day of for an 11:30 reservations on a Sunday and got in. When I walked in I could totally see why it reminded him of Germany. There's just this feeling you get. I think it's a combination of the lights and the design of the room with communal dining tables and hanging lamps. It's actually quite beautiful but not in the way that Eve or Perennial or Vermillion are. I totally, 100% loved it. There were little touches like the butter dish and the old-school silverware that reminded me of the ones I had when I was growing up. We split the sour cherry coffee cake to start with my very strong coffee (actually too strong for me). Then we split this pork shoulder sandwich (really, really good) with a side of bacon. Their bacon is nothing like I've seen. It was like bacon on steroids. I didn't care for it by my BF did. Lastly, we split a side of summer sausage. Summer sausage reminds me of going to the northwoods of Wisconsin with my Polish/Czech grandparents every summer because they would get this meat and make sandwiches. So this dish, as well as the whole restaurant, was very nostalgic for me. We got bloody mary's and they all come with a beer side car. Tasty! The service was okay - our bus boy was more attentive than our actual server. I will be back for dinner (if I can get a reservation anytime soon). And hopefully I can upgrade The Publican to 5 stars.
