I go here so often that i had my picture on the wood column of christmas cards for a brief stint in '09. I have very fond memories of eating chocolate chip pancakes with my dad here. Anytime someone wants to go to breakfast in this town and asks me for a recommendation, i never think twice but to push the bongo room, and yet i have met only one person who did not like it. needless to say, we are not friends. I like waiting for a table here, it builds anticipation, although I usually don't need to, as I know the perfect times to go. screw you, i'm not telling. I swear by this place. I love this place. I don't need to write an actual review of this place, because here's all you need to know. DO NOT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS. this place is awesome. i heart lani my favorite waitress who ALWAYS draws hearts on the checks, and chats it up with me and my mom, even when its busy. i miss the banana white chocolate peanut butter pancakes, as that sauce is like the most beautiful thing i've ever tasted and i want all the birthday cakes i ever have for the rest of my life to be drenched in the stuff, and i have seriously considered breaking into bongo in the middle of the night to steal the formula like the krabby patty. When they took this item off the menu, i would be lying if i said i didn't cry. but i have always managed to find something on the menu i love, and have never had a bad thing here, even lunch and savory (eww) items. 1,000 stars!
