3.5 stars... Ok.... so after reading raving reviews, I made my lazy ass up to Edgewater in the brutally cold weather. Good that we went there early(around 6) because by 6 30, the line was out the door. My rating is solely based on dishes we tried. The sashimi platter we had was actually pretty good. They have interesting looking menus, and some items on their menu sound even more interesting. I grew up making and eating sushi, so maybe I'm being too edgy. However, you never, Never use overcooked sushi rice making rolls because the moisture in the rice makes the nori soggy and the texture mushy. In fact, rice should be slightly undercooked for making sushi. They somehow use really overcooked rice in our rolls. I think our rolls would have tasted so much better with properly cooked rice. In decent sushi places, they would probably discard overcooked rice and make a new pot. But I am sure they were under time pressure. Other than the rice, some of the combinations of ingredients in maki rolls just didn't do it for me although they are very original and creative. I haven't tried their Thai dishes yet. I think I will give this place another try and hopefully upgrade the rating. Service here is pretty slow since the place gets so crowded. It's BYOB which is a plus.
