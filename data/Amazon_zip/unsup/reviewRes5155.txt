Absolutely fantastic experience. Went there for lunch and sat at the communal table (party of 3) comfortably. Service was wonderful: attentive but not too much; GREAT suggestions; everything our server suggested was exceptional. Variety of cheeses and in-house cured meats (let the server choose); delicious brioche served with it (asking for more bread was not an issue). No idea calamari could be so delicious, tender, and refreshing! Very innovative dish. A lovely variety of foods for all palettes. Highly suggested.
