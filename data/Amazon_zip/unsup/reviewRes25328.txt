This is a good place to celebrate something special. It's unique, and the food is interesting. You'll end up dropping some cash, and you might not be able to hear any conversation, but hey, you're looking good. Try to get a window seat; otherwise you're kind of crowded in and overwhelmed by the crazy high ceilings.
