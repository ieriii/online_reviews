Good pizza and beer! I also ordered a salad, which was big enough to split between 4 people. BUT they were out of most of the beer on tap the night I went. Also it is very crowded and loud. Probably better for a big party or watching sports than hanging out with a few friends. I couldn't hear anything across the table.
