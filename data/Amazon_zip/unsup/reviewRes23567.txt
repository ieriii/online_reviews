I admit to being skeptical about the oatmeal shake--but I decided to be adventurous and try it. It was amazing! On a second visit, I was equally amazed by the oatmeal shake. Next time, though, I think I'll skip eating and go right for the shake. The tico taco was forgettable. I've never been so disappointed by plantains as when I had their Tostones con Mojo...I love plantains but couldn't love these no matter how hard I tried. The Gallo Pinto are pretty good, though, and the Vegetarian Burrito is yummy, but not rave-worthy.
