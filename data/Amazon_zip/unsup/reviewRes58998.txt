I have submitted many reviews to YELP for Sunda before! It is by far the BEST restaurant in the city (I've lived here 19 years and certainly have had my fix of restaurants!).  The food is FANTASTIC, the service in unbelievable, and the partners....make sure EVERYTHING is to your liking! I seriously go from 1 reservation to the next with Sunda, and dining there is the highlight of my week/year!
