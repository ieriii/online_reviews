I always noticed that this place was packed, so I decided to finally give it a shot and was NOT disappointed! This place is amazing!  Going you first time can be a little intimidating & confusing. People are just huddled around the cash register, so you never know if there's a line to order or not. Also, the seating is kind of odd. You just have to find an empty chair a snag a spot.  The wings here are incredible but my favorite is actually the chi-town chicken burrito. It is a Korean twist on a burrito with rice, carrots,tomatoes, corn, chicken, and the secret sauce!!! Haven't had the buddha bowls yet, but that is next on my list.  Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick bite!
