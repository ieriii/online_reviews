Fox and Obel has some great produce. The meat is some of the best in Chicago, the range of deli product is also great. The seafood used to be great but nowadays it is exactly the same stuff as whole foods just 30% more expensive, they have stopped carrying anything exotic and a lot of the fish on display has seen better days.The biggest issue I have with this store is customer service, I visit there regularly and continually have trouble getting served and/or checking out. This would be fine if it was a budget store but every product is marked up 20% + compared to other stores so you are paying purely for their profit not for appropriate customer service.
