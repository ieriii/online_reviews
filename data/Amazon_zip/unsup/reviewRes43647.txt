So you're in Chicago, you know you're going to have great steak, and you know you're going to spend an absurd amount of money. That's a given. You're in Chicago. This town is nuts like that. Kinzie Chophouse leads the pack in the "intimate upscale casual" category. I'm not diminishing their excellence by categorizing them; there are different classes -different freaking strata!- of steakhouse dining options in this town.  And Kinzie dominates their niche. The atmosphere is antique casual (which of course, today, comes off as tremendously classy) -hardwood everywhere you look, plate glass, felt surfaces... It's rather like having a restaurant in a billiard room. The food is superb. What? Did you expect anything less? It's fantastic. Five stars! But in Chicago, you can almost take that as a given. The only thing you really need to know about the food (so you won't get confused by the menu) is that a Kansas City, a Delmonico, and a New York Strip all come from the same muscle, just different ends, or sometimes they're trimmed differently. (oh, and T-bones and Porterhouses are those same steaks, plus the rib bone, plus the muscle on the other side of the bone. Mystery solved!) The wait staff is very professional. Yes, they're knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, all nice things -but the staff at Kinzie gets shit done. Friendly might be nice, but I never had the chance to find out how much iced tea my glass held before it was filled again, and that's *awesome*.  When my party was finished we sat and talked for a long time. Probably too long, actually, but the folks at Kinzie treated us just as well as if we had just walked through the door, all night long. Later, they brought out a desert sampler, on the house.  I'll definitely be coming back to Kinzie. Regularly.
