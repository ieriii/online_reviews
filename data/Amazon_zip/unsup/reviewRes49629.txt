Went on a Monday night after Pilates class with the girls. BYOB on week nights, split a couple apps, couple bottles of wine, and the combo meat patter. We couldn't even finish it! Have been back a couple other times, same great food. Service could be a little better, but the food makes up for it! Highly recommend for groups wanting something a little different.
