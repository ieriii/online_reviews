I've heard very good things about this place and it did not disappoint. I went for brunch on a Sunday around 1130 and only waited 20 minutes for an outside table.   I ordered the house made biscuits and gravy with 2 eggs which was unbelievable. Very tasty and not overly heavy. I also split the wild boar sloppy joe which is by far the best sloppy joe I've had and probably ever will have. Ordering this sloppy joe is a must! As far as drinks, if you go for brunch, order the "A good day to your sir"
