I used to live by Heaven on Seven, and have missed cajun food. This is a great place to cure that craving. I will admit when they first opened the food was good - not great. They have really found their stride, and I now love this place. I have gone now twice in the last two months and the experience was great. Food was spot on, with good service and the place has a great feel to it. It is small and energetic without being too noisy or crowded. Must haves are the cornbread, shrimp and grits and gumbo.  Word to the wise their drinks are frickin legit. I ordered a whiskey sour and expected over-sweet sour mix with a splash of whiskey (classic well drink) and was blown away. This drink was nearly all whiskey with what I could only guess was house-made sours. Pretty unexpected and very authentic.
