So, I returned last night for girl time (there were 10 of us)--this time we sat inside since it was a chilly evening. I will utter again that their food takes what seems like forever--seriously you will wait a bit of time before you get your food, so don't go super hungry. That really is my one complaint because other than that it is a super place. They can accommodate large groups as the interior is rather roomy--the wait staff is very attentive, and I gotta love a place that is doing the green thing.  Oh and if you get one thing from their menu--please let it be the Sweet potato fries---OH MY GOODNESS--they are delicious!! It is like eating fried candy--yummy!!
