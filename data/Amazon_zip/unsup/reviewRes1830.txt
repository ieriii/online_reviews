Don't mess with the power of Mr. Encased Meat. This guy is the "Sausage King" of the Chicago hot douggy world, all hail da King. Try to copy and fellow yelpers will shot you down, fRed Hot and Fries. Then again, what about the Chicago Dog House? This place is mostly filled with sausage wannabees who couldn't tell a Vienna beef from an Oscar Mayer and for certain, a Thuringer from a Polish. How many of these sausage wannabees wouldn't even notice if they had ketchup on their encased? How many of those would actually prefer it? What's so wrong, why such a big deal about using ketchup?  Then you have the enlightened that can truly appreciated this place. It doesn't take much to be enlightened, probably saying that you have a favorite stand growing up. Chicago has so many places and Sohnny undeniable shines. No need to rehash the menu, plenty of others are glad to regurgitate it. The lines, the street parking, I wouldn't make it a daily or monthly place. I simply don't have intense cravings for a so called gourmet sausage, just a Maxwell St. Polish will comfort me just fine. Yep, plenty of those places without having to wait and provide parking.
