I still love this place and I love the accommodating staff, but it's not vegan-friendly. I know that I shouldn't expect much from a bakery, but there's only one thing that's semi-vegan-friendly and it contains honey. I just like to go here for a coffee or tea and to use the lounge. This is one of the few coffee shops I've found in Chicago where people actually go to study or write.
