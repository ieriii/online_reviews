Back when I was a city girl and too lazy to make my own coffee before work, Milk and Honey was a daily stop for me. It was also the main place I would take out-of-town visitors for weekend brunch/lunch - these things had as much to do with the fact that I love me some Milk and Honey and that it was a block away from my apartment. My personal faves here are the scrambled egg-bacon-cheese sandwich and the roast beef sandwich (though *sometimes* the roast beast is a wee bit too much on the rare side for me...). Oh, and the scones! Get here early for fresh scones - coffee shop scones are usually horrible pieces of shit, but these things are fan-freaking-tastic. Seriously! They are a wee bit on the pricey side, and if you go anytime after 9 am on weekends you will have to deal with endless crowds of Wicker Park yuppies with babies (or young yuppies with their visiting parents), so it's better to go during the week or get your food to go.
