I feel like Indian House is an okay restaurant, with a nice enough atmosphere, but it's just too expensive for what it's offering. Like, I realize that this is River North and I should expect to pay more. And I do. But the quality wasn't amazing, the service was a little overbearing, and apparently when you use gift certificates from http://restaurants.com they want you to pay the balance in cash, which meant we had to find a nearby ATM. The food was tasty, but I've had better both on Devon and in the neighborhood, so it just didn't seem right to be paying that much for food that wasn't incredible. We left stuffed, but also a little put off by the atmosphere of the place.
