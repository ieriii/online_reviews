I came here with really high hopes. That was probably my downfall. It seemed like everyone I knew was suddenly buzzing about Publican and I just had to go! oysters - probably my favorite thing that I got. We got the chef selection. Excellent! 2nd best thing - mussels. the half order is plenty if you are getting other things! they were out of brussels sprouts and i was PISSED. I can't remember what we ordered instead, perhaps the asparagus?? then i made the mistake of ordering the duck confit. no, no, nooooo! it was dry. where did my flavor go? i love duck. what the hell?!?!?! it was terrible! ok it wasn't terrible, but you have to imagine what a letdown it was. especially when i could have ordered the pork belly. and didn't. because of my love for duck. c'est la vie. service was satisfactory. i didn't mind the communal seating as it was pretty late by the time we got seated and didn't have many people near us. but come on. i am paying loads of money here. give me a real table. cut the crap here. oh, also i tried some really delicious beers here.
