This was one of most enjoyable meals from start to finish I've had in a long time. Every meal comes with soup and salad-and the spinach egg drop soup is to die for. As soon as you are seated at your table cheesy pizza bread! and yummy baked bread! The oysters rockefellar were delish and huge! The entrees were great, especially my hubbys lasagna, and the portions are huge. More than enough for dinner the next day, and boy do I love my leftovers.  Also, we went on a Saturday evening and in the bar area where you first walk in there's a piano set up and a guy just singing away and he was really fantastic! I'm a sucker for corny, kitschy stuff like that. The bartender Louise is fantastic and couldn't be sweeter. I can't remember our servers name but he also was an A+. We'll be back soon! Oh and complimentary valet!? So fancy!
