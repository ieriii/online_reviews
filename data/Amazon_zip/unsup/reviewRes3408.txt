It's making a come back. K.F.C.... Korean Fried Chicken!! As a young one, I used to look forward to family parties for the Korean wings. I would gladly trample over my cousins to the the first to crunch into those sweet, spicy, crunchy poultry treats! Shameless, I know. The wings at Crisp must be on steroids, because they're about double the size I remember for my childhood. In this case, more is definitely better. I shared a half order of the Seoul Sassy wings ($8.95) with Julie R. All manners aside, they were finger-lickin' good! The sauce was sweet, garlicky, gingery-all in subtle amounts but combined to form a super sauce. I even poured some of it on the Baby Buddha ($6.95) I ordered. I'm a condiment girl. I'm saucy.
