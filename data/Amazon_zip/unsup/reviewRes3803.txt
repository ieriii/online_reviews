With all the great reviews, I had high expectations for Crisp.... that went unfulfilled. I got the Seoul Sassy chicken. It was flavorful but way too salty. Nothing extremely special or memorable. I've had fried chicken in Korea and Bonchon in NY and this chicken doesn't even come close. My friends both got the Buddha Bowls which I found pretty flavorless and boring. The sauce added some spice but not enough flavor. My mom can make a better version at home. You can get way better versions of this dish (Bibimbap) at other Korean restaurants too. It's sad because I love Korean-style fried chicken and was so excited. Oh well....
