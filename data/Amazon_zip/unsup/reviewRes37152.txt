This star rating has nothing to do with the food or the awesome selection of beers this fine establishment has. It has everything to do with Rob the bartender. Hey Rob, you are a BARTENDER at a BEER BAR, one with TONS OF GREAT BEERS. Maybe you should take some time and learn what you have on tap, or maybe which ones taste better than others, or even just the pretty pictures on the labels. Patron: What are some good IPAs you have on tap? Can you recommend a good lager? I'm looking for something local. Rob: What? Uh, here's a good one (points to nearest tap) Patron: Is it an IPA? Did you hear what I asked? It's kind of loud in here... Rob (annoyed): Theres a lot of beers, here's a list. Maybe Hopleaf should change thier name to 'High Fidelity', then they could hire Jack Black, then Rob the bartender would feel right at home. I'm not saying your a mean guy, just take some interest in your product, like every other great bartender there. I have given up asking you for recommendations, but can you try to remember what I am drinking when I come back up for another? I know, I know - its sort of hard in a crowded bar, but even the creepy guy at my bus stop remembers the hat I wore the day before. My heart sinks a little when I accidentally get your attention at the bar instead of that other cool guy with the beard that is pleasant and knows his shit. Lastly, all of this ignorance and forgetfulness wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so clearly bummed out that you have to get my drink in the first place. You could get your panties in a twist over this review and somehow become even more unpleasant next time I order a drink. Or you could just cowboy-up your awesome job as a bartender at one of the best bars in Chicago. Kisses, D
