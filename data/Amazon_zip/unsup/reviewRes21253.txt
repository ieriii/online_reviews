You have GOT to be kidding me. I have to admit, I never did drink the Kool Aid of the whole Bayless enterprise. Overblown hype, I always thought...(his old chefs are doing a great job at Maya in Oak Park, though....). Anyway, I popped in to buy a sandwich. It was the shortrib sandwich. Pretty tasty...TWELVE DOLLARS for MAYBE 2 oz of meat. I will plop down money for a Gramwich or a salad at Pierrot Gourmet. It's not the money...the value stinks. It actually made me angry. Don't bother ....plenty of places to eat for 1/2 that price....or the same price for more sandwich. REALLY not a fan of the Bayless Empire now.
