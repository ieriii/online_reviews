Their decor is surprisingly modern & chic for a thai restaurant in the Loyola area. I've had some of their sushi AND thai. Both pretty good. My fave dish here: (on their thai menu under salads :P) Grilled shrimp salad. I know. It doesn't sound like much.. but woooooooow, it packed a punch. You know that TANG commercial.. kick in the mouth or whatever? LOL.. yeahhh, it was like that. Yum!
