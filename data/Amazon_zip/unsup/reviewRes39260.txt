We arrived on a rainy Sunday night and only had to wait 10 minutes. If we had snuck in a few seconds before the couple ahead of us, we probably wouldn't have had to wait at all! The wait staff and service here were excellent and on point. Everyone was very friendly. We ordered: shaved pear salad, haricot verts, endive, watercress, frisee, stilton, port wine syrup, sherry-walnut vinaigrette roasted marrow bones, red onion jam, sea salt, sourdough crostinis (I recommend mixing the red onion jam and the marrow) monkfish osso bucco, celery root & apple puree, chanterelles, brussels leaves, barley, red wine veal reduction butternut risotto, plug farm apples, squash, cheese, mushroom (available on the vegetarian menu) Everything tasted delicious! As a starter, the chef offered us a complimentary tomato gazpacho with roasted cauliflower. That was delicious too! It was super easy to get to the restaurant too. The restaurant is right off the Blue line at Logan Square, but they also have street parking available.
