THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. Easily one of my favorite vegan restaurants. The vegan mozzarella sticks are spot on, the rueben I had from here was pretty amazing, and I had breakfast here a few days ago and it was a great morning. I also really enjoyed the atmosphere, the district it was in, the tunes being played inside, and the just general feeling of happy vegans I felt while I was in there with my father. The servers I've had were very attentive and friendly and just overall awesome. And their milkshakes? I had a chocolate peanut butter milkshake and all I can say is mother-of-god. Even my Dad explained he could've never guessed that it was vegan.
