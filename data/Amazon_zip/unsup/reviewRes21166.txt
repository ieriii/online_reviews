Superdawg is a real gem of a place. Since it's a drive-in it's a lot more fun to go with friends.  I'm sure everything on the menu is good, but you should go for the hot-dogs and shakes. The dogs are topped with the standard Chicago-style toppings (my favorite is the large pickle spear) and come packed in a box with fries. They aren't Vienna beef, but why does that matter?
