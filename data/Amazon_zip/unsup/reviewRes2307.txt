Well worth the wait! Hot Doug's is Chicago's pride in an area of Chicago pride! I would recommend everything. Seriously. This place is great. My only issue is that it seems to always be closed. I feel like it should cut it's customers a little slack on the tight time frame that it is governed by. But if you can get there when it is open, you are in for a treat.
