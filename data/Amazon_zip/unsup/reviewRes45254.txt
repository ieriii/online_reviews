Well lets just say I was extremely disappointed in this place. A friend and I were in the mood for some good Italian food and decided to come try this place out. First of all, being a vegetarian I was very limited to what I could order. There were only two pasta dishes from the whole menu that I could pick from. My friend and I decided to split the Ravioli dish that had peas, butter, and mint leaves. We also ordered some bruschetta for an appetizer. What we got for bruschetta, we were not expecting at all. Bread covered with spinach, and had a horrible smell to it. I had one little taste of it and could not eat any more. Our main dish came, and this also was disappointing, our server had informed us that the mint you could not taste a whole lot of, but we both agreed that the mint did nothing for this ravioli dish and would have tasted better with it left off. Our server was gracious enough to not charge us for the bruschetta, but this is definitely not a place I will come back to. There are many really good italian restaurants out there that I enjoy much better.
