Was here just last night: I had the tortellini alla fiorentina soup, followed by the Ossoobuco alla Milanese. Huge portions - I had enough leftovers for dinner tonight & lunch tomorrow. It's my third time; a bit pricey, but again, the portions are huge and delicious. But such tiny tables for such huge plates!
