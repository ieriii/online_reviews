Awful service.  The noise was deafening.  The kitchen was clearly backed-up.  And what made it worse was that there was no manager or owner making the rounds to check on the customers. Nobody noticed how unhappy we were, and we were sitting right by the host stand.  My date and I couldn't hear each other without yelling, so we just ended up staring at each other for an hour and 45 minutes. Our server wasn't rude, but I definitely felt like I was in his way. The employees looked annoyed and rushed. They needed another server on the floor.  At one point I finished my water and our water pitcher was empty. I waited ten minutes. A busboy came and cleared the empty pitcher, BUT DIDN'T BRING A FULL ONE BACK. I waited another ten minutes, staring at my empty glass. Finally we had to flag somebody down to get us more water.  Our food wasn't timed correctly, or the kitchen was backed up, because there was a very long wait in between courses. And again, nobody noticed, nobody came by to let us know when to expect our next course.  The one star is for the lemon panna cotta, which was very good. Oh but wait, our server didn't offer us coffee or tea with our dessert. That's pretty much common etiquette for a restaurant of this level. I know I only had water with my entree, but I usually like tea with dessert. Thanks.  Here's the deal. I've worked in the service industry for over ten years. Restaurants get over-booked. Kitchens get backed up. Servers get over-sat. This crap happens. But what makes the difference between an awful restaurant and a great restaurant is letting the customer know what to expect. That's what a good manager is for. To take the emotional temperature of each table and make sure each guest feels special.  We just felt forgotten.
