Absolutely love this place- wish I lived in Chicago so I could go there at least once a week! A couple of my friends and I met there to catch up over lunch. They had the quiche (and loved it), and I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which was very good. Was not thrilled with their potato chips, however (too thick, no salt, no flavor). The BEST chai tea latte I've ever had! The atmosphere was great- lots of light comes into the restaurant making it a very pleasant space. It was fairly busy, but not too noisy- we were there chatting for over 2 hours and no one bothered us! Decent prices as well- you get what you pay for! Overall, great experience, can't wait to go back!
