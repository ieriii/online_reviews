I wish there were half stars. 4 1/2 ! BEST raw vegan desserts. Karyn's Raw has got NOTHING on Chicago Diner. Even my friends who complain about vegan fare thought that the raw vegan cheesecake was amazeballs. They also have other raw vegan dishes that have been great. Kind of sad they thinned out the raw vegan nachos, though. The nacho used to be a lot thicker. Hm. Anyway, I've tried many of their vegan dishes(I've eaten here a lot, so it's all over the place). Tastes good! I think they have the best vegetarian/vegan/raw vegan food in the city. Then again, I haven't explored as much I should to verify this claim ..
