Eh.I guess the whole ridiculously rude staff gimmick is amusing enough.If you're going to wait outside for 75 minutes like cattle, you might as well have some borderline-satire horrific people making the experience more of a worthy story. It was a bit odd when I dared order a dirty martini and the bartender laughed and said with a snark we don't DO olives.
