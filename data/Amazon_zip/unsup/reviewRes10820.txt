People need to chill out: it's just BRUNCH. And the Bongo Room is just delicious.  The crowds on the weekend are simply unbearable, and I don't think it's worth the wait (even though I love that one breakfast burrito that is only available on Saturday or Sunday). But if you're able to go on a weekday, you can walk right in and really enjoy the Bongo Room.  I highly recommend ordering one of the sinful pancakes or French toast: not listed on the menu, but they'll let you order a "single" (that way you don't feel like a fat ass for eating a whole stack by yourself).
