Carnivale is great because it's consistent. The atmosphere is always up beat. The service is always on par. The the food and drinks are always good. Their specialty drinks use fresh ingredients and have exciting twists on the usual mojito, sangria, etc. I'm particularly keen to their specials for entrees. Even just sitting in the bar area and having apps is great too. The guacamole is always fresh and delicious and empanadas are to die for.  Other than just going to eat and drink, their classes are pretty cool as well. I've done a some winemakers dinners and some other tastings that have been informative, but fun and affordable too.
