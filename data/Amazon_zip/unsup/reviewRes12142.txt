I finally used up my groupon and finally met Ms. Janet E. She has such a great personality which made our dining experience so much fun! I had high hopes for Cafe 28 but nothing really stood out. The food wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable either. The bread was a bit tough but we really enjoyed their sweet butter YUM! I had Bistec a la Cubana. My steak was tender but lacked a bit in flavor. I must say the portion here are big and I think you can even share a plate with another person. They ran out of yuca so I asked if I could get extra plantains. I think they gave me more beans more than the plantains. *darn, I love plantains* and I agree with Janet E. The plantains were "DELICIOUS!" The bf like the bean soup better than his Blackened Duck. Overall, I had a great time getting to know Janet E. and if we do come back maybe I'll try their famous dish " Honey Jalapeno Pork Chops" maybe I'll have better luck in that.
