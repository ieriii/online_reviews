First the positives: ambiance great (although a bit noisy - don't bring a job interview here), food outstanding. Wide range of choices and interesting specials. Quite pricey, even for downtown tapas, but we kind of expected that.  The big negative was the service. Our waiter did not seem inexperienced, but he took the order without writing it down (which always causes some worry) and then, surprise, some of our items failed to show up. Since we had some very specific preferences in the group and had ordered accordingly, this was a problem. Since we live in the suburbs and are wedded to the train schedules, this was a bigger problem. We waited an extra hour and took a later train in order to finally get my meatless meal, and the food was great, but we won't be returning here.
