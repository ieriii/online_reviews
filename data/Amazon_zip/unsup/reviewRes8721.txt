Totally delicious. Gluttons come one come all. We had a lot of fun flipping our card to green and challenging one another to eat just one more skewer slice of meaty goodness. The server said that it is a marathon and not a sprint and he is certainly correct. The salad bar was awesome and the service was great even on a packed valentines day weekend. Its a large place so if you are looking for an intimate vibe its not really going to work for that but if you want to eat and eat and eat.. this is the place. I read another review that talked about them being slow with the nicer cuts of meat and we did have to ask specifically for the filet mignon (we were there for an hour and hadn't seen any pass by). We did see the pork sausage guy quite a bit in contrast. We saw people would wave him away presumably waiting for the better stuff. Poor pork sausage guy.. all dejected. So theres that. Didn't sour me on the place because it was all really really good and I ate until I could eat no more. Mission accomplished.
