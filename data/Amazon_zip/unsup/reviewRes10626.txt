Piece rocks...why? 1-the pizza. it's a great bubbly New Haven style crust. I prefer mine with white with sausage, spinach, and goat cheese. They have mashed potato and clams as options, too. 2-The beer. I usually hate beer, but their hefeweizen won me over. It was YUM-O as once customer Rachael Ray would say. 3-The co-owner, Rick Nielsen. He's an unsung hero from my little hometown of Rockford, IL. And he rocks. But he obviously thinks Rachael Ray is great. If that's his only downfall, so be it!
