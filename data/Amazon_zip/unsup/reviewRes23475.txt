This was the very first place I ate at in China Town. Immediately entering I notice the enlarged photos of panda bears on the walls; very cute. Next, I noticed the relatively small room packed full of white tables & chairs; interesting. The first time I ate here, I ordered the spicy fried rice with added tofu. To be honest the rice was bland, not spicy, and the tofu was dry & unflavorful. Thankfully there was soy sauce available on my table. That helped the dish quite a bit. The second time I ate here, I ordered Lao Mein with added tofu. I was surprisingly impressed, because it was full of flavor, the tofu wasn't dry & overall the dish tasted great. The service, on the other hand, wasn't terribly great. I'm not sure if it was because it was during lunch hour or what. Who knows. I'm still interested in trying other vegetarian-friendly items on the list, however, I'm not in a huge hurry to go back right away.
