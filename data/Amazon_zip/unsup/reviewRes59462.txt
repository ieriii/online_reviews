While the pizza may be good, the owners are not. Living nearby and having patronized this establishment for many years, they are definitely not good neighbors. We deal with the noise in the parking lot, overflowing garbage, which in turn breeds a rat infestation in the area and the total rudeness, I wouldn't recommend this place to a dog. There is a constant battle with the employees about parking, littering and loud behavior, both during the restaurant's operating hours and afterward. The employees have been witnessed urinating on front lawns or in bottles and tossing them on the front lawns, leaving beverage cans & bottles, including beer containers across front lawns and in the gutter of the street. Wish I could say something nice, but the abuse and harassment from the ownership just doesn't permit me to.
