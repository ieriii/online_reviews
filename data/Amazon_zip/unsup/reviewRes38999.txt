Unbelievably great brunch at this cool gastropub. The whole hog crepinette was an incredible brunch dish with an interesting texture that went really well with the cheese grits and maple jus, which turned the savoriness of the dish into a breakfast meal. The waiter suggested adding a fried egg on top, which just made it even better. The roasted cauliflower with lentils, raisins, caramelized onions, and mango was an awesome and unique dish with a great combination of delicious flavors. The service was excellent and the prices were fantastic for the high quality of food.
