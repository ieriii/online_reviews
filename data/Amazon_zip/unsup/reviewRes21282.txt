Mayan Palace is the perfect restaurant (for me) because it's simple, it's consistent and it's awesome. It's not high-heels, it's flip flops; it's not a fancy dress, it's jeans and a t shirt; it's not full makeup, it's mascara and chapstick. My favorite things about Mayan Palace are the following:      1) promptly refilled chips and salsa; 2) promptly refilled water / pop / iced tea; 3) delicious guacamole; 4) delicious chicken burritos; 5) delicious and strong margaritas in many flavors; 6) friendly staff; 7) they don't rush you even when it gets crowded; 8) even when it's crowded I've never waited more than 5 minutes (if at all) for a table; 9) it's very affordable; and 10) It is in walking distance from my apartment.
