Not so bad. I think my reason for three stars is that the Guijarito sandwich was not as good as the Jibarito from Papa's Cache Sabroso in Humboldt Park. I also was disappointed they didn't have a lot of the dessert empanadas. The actual meat empanadas are very tasty and the location is pretty good, right on Clybourn in Roscoe Village. I think it's primarily a take-out place considering only in the summer-time they have a good portion of seating availability. I think there are better Cuban options nationally, and perhaps even in Chicago but they are doing a good job and I salute their efforts.
