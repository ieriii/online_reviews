I'm so thankful that I first went to Schwa when it had just opened -- i would hate to deal with the long reservation wait. But it is worth it! When we went, the place looked very inconspicuous. We loved that we experienced one of the best meals we've every had in Chicago and it was BYOB (not sure if they still are). It made such a mark on me because it was a weird juxtaposition of top-notch food and three young, casual looking sous-chefs in their small store front.
