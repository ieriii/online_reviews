I actually liked this restaurant particularly because its open till 5am however i've went there recently and found a BUG in my soup... i didn't want to make a big deal so i called the waitress and confirmed her that there was a bug in my soup however instead of the waitress and the owner apologizing they said it was not a bug and it was an ingridient in the soup that looks like a bug and they tried to squish it to hide the evidence so i took the picture of the bug and asked the other customers if it was a bug or not... ofcourse they all agreed with me it was a bug. There food might be decent however there customer service and the "INGREDIENTS" is not so appealing. The owner finally agreed it was a bug but it was not there fault she said it was a bug with wings so it fell into the soup. Two waitresses said it was part of the ingredient and finally the manager said it was a bug... they did not apologize. Well unless u like to eat insects i suggest everyone not to go to this restaurant.
