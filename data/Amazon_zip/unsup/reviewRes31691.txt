thank god someone else paid the bill because there's no way in hell i could ever afford to eat here. this is the most expensive asian fusion restaurant i've ever eaten in. i did not see the bill because i did not pay, but i found out later that my one "tale of two tuna" rolls (2 kinds of tuna, jalapeno & avocado) cost $17 !!! the miso soup was the same as anywhere else. same with the seaweed salads. there was an extensive tray of fancy hot teas, which is always fun. the ambiance is "hip". i went for lunch so i can't judge the dinners, but unless someone else pays again, i won't go there for dinner. beautiful tables & chairs. excellent hip service. what i don't always like is how a restaurant can possibly serve indian, indonesian, chinese, japanese, thai & korean properly. but hey-that's the asian fusion movement.  whatever floats your boat. but everything was delicious. i would probably wander back in if i had a six figure income.
