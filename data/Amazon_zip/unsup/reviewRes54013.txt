I really adore the enviornment-- high backed chairs that make you feel royal, and super dark lighting where you have to hunch over a candle. The drinks are amazing. The seating somehow feels really private and intimate, especially if you love the dark. But definitely go on a weeknight-- because swarms of people will spoil the serenity.
