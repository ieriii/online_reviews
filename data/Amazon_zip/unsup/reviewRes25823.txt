I never knew Lincoln Park had a Vietnamese restaurant on Lincoln Ave. I guess it's because I haven't been back in a while but what was even more surprising is its food and environment. I ordered the Sate Calamari lunch special and it came with a soup, salad, egg roll, rice, tea, and dessert. All for just $8.50! Not a part of the meal was downplayed. The calamari was very succulent, tender, and tangy. It was very well marinated into the chili garlic sauce which was mildly spicy. I just couldn't stop digging into the dish! It was a slow afternoon but service was good. The restaurant has a very simple decor but it was comfortable and quiet. I would definitely like to return and try some of their other dishes.
