Pequod's is consistently fantastic pizza--the best deep dish in Chicago. Yes, that caramelized crust is to die for--an almost-sweet and crunchy touch to the savory goodness that lies within its borders. Even better than the crust is the quality of the toppings--hearty and big and just loaded with freshness. I no longer can order pizza with sausage, green pepper and onion at other joints because they cannot compare with Pequod's. The toppings are clearly not from some can or sitting in some fridge for days on end--they are as fresh as if they were just picked. It does get busy, so expect a bit of a wait. Expect to see some hockey on the big screen TVs if there's any being played--the boss here loves it.
