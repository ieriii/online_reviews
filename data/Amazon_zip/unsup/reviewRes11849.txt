ORDER THE CHOCOLATE FRENCH TOAST. I'm a breakfast food addict, and I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best things I've ever eaten. Not too sweet, chocolatey but not too chocolatey, moist and soft French toast surrounded by a creamy, slightly banana-y sauce, topped with banana slices and chocolate shavings. Dear Lord.
