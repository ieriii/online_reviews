I have food allergies, and this place is wonderful! Never before have I had so many menu options. This place is not only great for Vegans, but for anyone avoiding dairy and/or lactose. I trust that they know their ingredients, and I love coming back here!  The soy milkshakes are phenomenal, and the Titanic BLT burger is my personal favorite.
