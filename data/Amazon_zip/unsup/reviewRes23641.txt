Point 1: This place is Algerian, not Swedish, despite being in Andersonville. Point 2: The savory crepes make a great meal. Don't think it is just sweet crepes like you'd get at IHOP. Lots of interesting flavor! Was in town for a weekend away with the wife. Lucked into this place and easily the best we had all weekend.
