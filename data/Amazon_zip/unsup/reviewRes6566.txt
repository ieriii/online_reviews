OK, Missy. It's time for your decision. Your last meal. Your last meal before lights out. It's time??  Ok, let me think.  Lobster, Prime Rib, foie gras, white tuna sashimi.  NO.  Here it comes. Wait, wait. I want the foccacia with cheese from Davanti Enoteca. And get a lot of it. You want a lousy bread for your last meal?  Come on I'll give you 3 minutes to rethink your decision. Not necessary. Fluffy, crispy, rich, creamy, hot and yummy. That's it. Now go get it!
