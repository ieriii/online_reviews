Meat, meat, meat. It's meat-tastic. So much meat. In the age of mad cow, it's like a dare! If you want to eat a single meal of really great meat, you can get a better meal for $50. But if you want to eat 7-10 meals of really good meat in one sitting, this is the place to be.  All they need is a Roman-style vomitorium.
