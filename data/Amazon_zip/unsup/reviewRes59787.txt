Fantastic Pizza, Fantastic Selection. This place does slices better then anyone else in the city!! They have prefected all three styles; Pan, Stuffed, and Thin Crust all are great. The best part is that during all hours of operation they have any style slice with any ingrediant hot and fresh ready for you to eat.I have subtraced 1 star because on 2 seperate occasions the delievery came far beyond the promised time, however they still managed to get the pizza there Hot and Fresh!!
