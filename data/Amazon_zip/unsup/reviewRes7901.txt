Salad Bar is limited but its great! Service is excellent; new plates are replaced every so often. Once you flip your cardboard card to green, men in pirate suits hoard you with swords and sai's of meat ranging from rare to well done. However, after eating meat for 45mins.. everything begins to taste the same. So change it up by eating some fiber from the salad bar. My Favorite. Lamb Chops, Leg of Lamb, and Filet. But the one meat that I need to mention is the Out of Control Tender Moist Beef Ribs. What does it look like? One of the pirates holds a cutting board with what looks like Dinosaur Bones on it. Get IT!
