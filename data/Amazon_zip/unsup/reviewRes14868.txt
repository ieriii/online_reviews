I'm not entirely sure why everyone raves about this place. I went here a few years back and thought it was okay. I just recently made a return visit and the whole experience just elicited a "meh" from my party. You enter through the bar area and, when we were there, they had a lounge singer playing the piano who was just awful. Every song I heard this guy sing (thankfully that was few and far between as the dining area is sectioned off) was off-key. The service was ssslllloooowww....it took at least 15 minutes for our waitress to come to our table and introduce herself, not to mention the several times it took at least 10 minutes to refill our drinks. The food was generous and filling but badly over-salted, almost to the point of being unpalateable. The one exception to quantity was our appetizer (shrimp cocktail) had 4 medium shrimp and a giant tub of sauce. Frankly I would have liked to have the reverse - more shrimp, less sauce. If you're looking for decent italian food, you could do worse....but then you could also do MUCH better.
