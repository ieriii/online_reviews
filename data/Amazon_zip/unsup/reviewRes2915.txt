Ah Tru. What more can I say about this Shrine to Cuisine? Dining at Tru is far from just eating dinner; it's more like an adventure (especially for those brave enough to trust their palates and Amex bills to Mr. Tramanto and go for the spontanteous collection.) I've tried about 100 courses at Tru and almost all of them were truly excellent, with none being less than very good. The decadent and beautiful Caviar Staircase is a fantastic way to begin your palate's journey to Heaven, while the Tuna Tartare 'garnished' with a beautiful live fish swimming in a small bowl under it is a breathtaking way to spend your time there, both visually and viscerally. Tru hits all the little touches to make dining their memorable. From a modern, elegant dining room filled with lovely art, to having the class to include bottled water with the price of the meals, and using fun Versace china, Laguiole steak knives, and having a dedicated staff member whose sole job is to polish their lovely stemware, servers that seem to truly love and revere the kitchen's creations while they extol each course in detail, and sending you home with a sweet little "Gift of Tru" (note: temporarily being redesigned,) and sending Christmas cards signed by both the Chef de Cuisine and the Pastry chef to frequent diners, Tru does it all to perfection. My only regret is that the whole roasted lobe of foie gras prepared tableside is no longer available. Aldermen really need to reassess their priorities, eh?  Tru is also a Wine Spectator Grand Award winner with the tome-like wine list to prove it. With such a vast selection, it's understandable that they do not permit corkage, but their list is heavily weighted towards pricier bottles, which at a price of roughly 3 times retail, can get out of control quickly. Nevertheless, a savvy wine shopper can still find some good wines that won't break the bank, especially in the half bottle area of the list.
