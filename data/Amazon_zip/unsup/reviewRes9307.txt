Le Colonial was previously one of my top restaurants in Chicago. The last few times my husband and I have dined here we've left unimpressed and after the last time, we won't be returning. We were seated in the back of the very beautiful restaurant (which is fine), but the tables are so close together that it is nearly impossible to slide between them to sit on the bench, let alone to hear your dining companion over the next table's conversation. Our server was rude and pretentious. On a previous visit, a server had recommended ordering the lemongrass chicken with tofu instead since I'm a vegetarian. I took her suggestion, absolutely loved the dish and have ordered it ever since. On this occasion when I ordered, our server said that the chef has paired each meat to the proper sauce believing that this is the best combination, and couldn't make any substitutions. As I've ordered this dish before, I asked if he could check with the chef.  He returned and said there would be a $3 up-charge. Really? How tacky, especially since everywhere else charges more for chicken than tofu. To add insult to injury while the flavors were delicious, the tofu was incredibly greasy. Overall, we were disappointed in all the food we ordered. The Bo Bia salad rolls that were incredible on previous visits had very little of "aromatic herbs" this time around. My husband was not a fan of the tamarind sauce that was served with his duck, but after the previous lecture from our server on the proper sauce being served with each meat, didn't comment. As we were waiting to order dessert, my husband overheard our server commenting that he didn't think we'd ever leave so he could turn over the table. At this point, we'd been at the restaurant for only 45 minutes. Well, we did leave, and we won't be back.
