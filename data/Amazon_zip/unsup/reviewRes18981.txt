I was going to leave Chicago without tasting the food of the famous Rick Bayless but I knew I was going to get lectured by my girlfriend. So I did what I had to do, eat. I arrived a little before the lunch rush and even then the place was crowded. I ordered the pepito which is braised Tallgrass shortribs, carmelized onion, artisan Jack, black beans and pickled jalapenos. At first bite I really like the crunchiness from the bread. The tender meant and the oozy cheese was a perfect pair. The jalapenos gave the whole thing just enough spice and warm you up on a cold Chicago day, and it was freezing cold that day! The sandwich was good and satisfying and service was peppy and quick. I thought it was pricey but that's just my opinion.
