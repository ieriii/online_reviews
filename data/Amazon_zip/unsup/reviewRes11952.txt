I actually didn't have to wait in line to get in here since I came on a Monday morning. I was really expecting an awesome experience here but it just wasn't that great. But that's me, I don't really go for the obscene breakfasts with ice cream and chocolate and whatever all over it. People who are into really sweet breakfasts should love this place. I tried a few bites of the cream soaked strawberry rhubard french toast with vanilla ice cream and yes, it WAS very good but I just couldn't eat a whole plate of it to myself. They don't really have much else going for them besides the breakfast/dessert stuff. I had a breakfast sandwich that was pretty good, but I would never wait in a huge line to get in here for it again.
