Nice! Clean! Friendly! Rooms are modernly decorated. Wood flooring in entryway and bath (yay). Great full mirrors directly across from glassed in shower. (so THATS what I look like with shampoo in my hair!) Krups individual cup coffee makers, free WiFi, great continental breakfast offerings with sunshiny attendants. This is only 4 stars because the shwanky coffee maker didn't function and even after they said it was fixed, it didn't work. Sorry, but you can't mess with a Dolls coffee at 530am. Even so, i would not hesitate to stay here again.
