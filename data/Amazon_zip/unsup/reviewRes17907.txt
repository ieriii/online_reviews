ok. all pretention aside. i dig this place. i felt like i should've been wearing a 3-piece suit and flippin a quarter while checkin out the dames. i must say i'm not one for "cocktails." i did however indulge in a hibiscus old fashioned that was delightful. the food was good but it did not fit the style of the place. or at least not in my opinion. i mean really, did they have tater tots with garlic aioli in 1920? me thinks not. anyways, i like the place.
