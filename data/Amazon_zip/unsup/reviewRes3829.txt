Went there for lunch on a Saturday with my friend who got the recommendation from someone. I had the wings with Seoul Sassy sauce and some of the fries we ordered together. Five huge wings, I could barely finish them. So delicious! Not overly battered or sauced. Sometimes you have those cravings for artery-clogging fried chicken goodness, and this hit the spot! The wings were so good that I hardly ate the fries (which could use a little more salt in my taste, but there's a shaker on the table). I will definitely be coming back.
