I am not Italian, and I have never been Italy, so I can't vouch for authenticity of Piccolo Sogno. What I can vouch for is that everything we've had here in our two visits so far has been delicious. Rich without being overly heavy; complimented by a lovely wine selection. The atmosphere is great, we were actually severely under-dressed the first time we came but we still got great service. I'd avoid the cocktails and stick to the wine though. A minor nitpick for our favorite Italian restaurant - even better than the places in old Little Italy (off Western)!
