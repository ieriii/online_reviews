I saw Irazu on Check Please and decided to try it out for myself. It is a great, off the beaten path, BYOB choice.  I had never had Costa Rican food before, but man was I glad that I gave it a try after the meal. The dining area is nothing to talk about, but the food for sure makes up for it, along with their prices. I think you can order to go too!
