My initial reaction to this restaurant amounted to... "We don't need ANOTHER cafe in this neighborhood even if they spell it with a K"... From the outside of the restaurant will underwhelm you. The owners have draped the place with Algerian art with which they went overboard. Less is more people. You however are not here to eat art. :-) You are here for crepes. I have to admit... I didn't imagine there was much one could do with pancakes. Here again! WRONG! As a nutella fan I immediately started day dreaming of their Banana Nutella crepe -served with your choice of ice-cream. Since I have a rule that states, it is not a meal unless something died, I was encouraged when the Mrs. decided she too wanted Banana Nutella. This allowed me to indulge myself in their eggs and beef crepe. This is served with potatoes that just delight! I am very happy to be completely wrong on one more thing in my life and will return here often!
