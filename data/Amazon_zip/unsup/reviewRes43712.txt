I've been here several times for both lunch and dinner. Some of the 1 & 2 star reviews here seem to be a bit harsh, so I wonder if it's just a single bad experience as they never implied return/multiple visits. First off, I like the atmosphere. The main dining room is a bit tight, but as long as you're along one of the two walls and not in the center, you're just fine and it feels energetic and cozy. Here's a hint - request that at the hostess stand! Also, with the comparisons to Gibson's and & David Burke's and others, of which I've seen several, I'm not sure Kinzie is trying to BE them, necessarily. Also, I'm not sure if they're taking into consideration that a) Kinzie wet ages most of their steaks, save one that I can think of, and b) Kinzie is significantly less expensive than some other high-end steakhouses in Chicago. So, keep that in mind, because yes, SOMETIMES you get what you pay for, people. Wet aging steaks in bags is cheaper than having massive dry age setups - and that savings gets passed to you here. I'll keep going back - I've had very nice experiences each time I've been there.
