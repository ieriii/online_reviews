I can't comment on the pizza (I'm lactose intolerant), but it looked good. I came here with friends for karaoke night. We were a pretty big group and it was packed when we got there. We somehow managed to get seated in a private area that was reserved for a bachelor party. The guys were really nice and since they had extra room they let us sit there.  Back to the karaoke,  they have a hugeee book of practically any song you can think of to choose from. After some liquid courage (the drink prices were very reasonable) I got up on stage with my boyfriend and we sung 500 miles by the Proclaimers. So fun, the DJ seemed really excited with our song selection. Everybody was really into the karaoke, and my favorite performance of the night was this guy who did a dead on impression of Kiss by Price. Everybody was super nice, the DJ and the waitresses. I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Chicago.
