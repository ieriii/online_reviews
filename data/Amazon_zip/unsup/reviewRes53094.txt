Wow. First introduction to Cuban food. In fact, our entire party had never had it. Luckily our server answered all of our questions and made suggestions on a beverage when my mom asked him simply to, "Pick one." Being the only one with any knowledge of the cuisine, I was tasked with selecting appetizers. The mariquitas were crispy, garlicky, and fantastic. Filled with melted cheese and ham, the croquetas burst in your mouth and came with a delicious dipping sauce. The chorizo empanadas were among the best I've had. (Luckily empanadas are not unique to Cuban cuisine.) Extra napkins are a must to soak up the chorizo grease. :) On to the entrees... We ordered the Bistec and Lechon dinners, along with the Masas de Puerco. I noticed a small hair on the top of my rice. Normally this would be the type of thing to gross me out, but given the fact that it was the tiniest hair known to man, it could have come from anywhere, including our clothes. But I digress...Back to the rave review. Not the best chimichurri I've had on the bistec, but still quite tasty. I loved the flavor of the lechon and the masas de puerco. The plaintains were sinfully sweet, but a nice pairing to the pork. The waiter--upon being asked if there was a charge for a 2nd can of diet coke--said, "there is, but I'll just bring you another one anyway." Enough said. Not even a hair could ruin this experience. Two thumbs up!
