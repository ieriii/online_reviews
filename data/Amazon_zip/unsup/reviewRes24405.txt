Like a few other reviewers, we also came here with the Gilt City certificate. At around 7:30 on a Thursday night, the restaurant was crawling with businessmen and their clients. While we waited to be seated, we ordered drinks at the bar. If you check in on foursquare there is a $1.99 sangria deal! When we were seated we received the pan con tomate, which really reminded me of when I lived in Spain. Just a simple piece of garlic toast with tomato. Delicious. We then received a beautiful bowl of Spanish olives, some Spanish salami and a cheese plate. The salami portion was huge and the flavor was insanely good. My favorite part was the cheese selection with apples and a burnt caramel sauce of sorts. The meal was off to a great start. We continued with our 2nd course, which was a selection of tapas. My favorites were the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. They were rich-almost could have been a dessert. The ravioli stuffed with butternut squash and lamb were also very tasty.The gambas al ajillo were done very well, as they were a dish I would often order while living in Spain. Moving to the 3rd course, I really liked the jumbo prawns with their heads still on. There were only 2 of them to share, but their flavor was incredible. The rib eye was a little tough for my liking and my boyfriend's pieces were full of gritty fat. The spinach with currants was also decent, but was missing something. Seeing as I was already pretty full, I was ok not loving our 3rd course as much as the 1st and 2nd. Dessert were small chocolate croquetas that were served with a rosemary caramel and banana marshmallow. I thought these were the perfect mini dessert. They weren't too sweet and the portion was great after such a large meal. I enjoyed my time at Mercat. The decor is great and the dishes come out at a reasonable pace. I just really like to see chefs who are very involved with their restaurants, and I doubt Jose Garces will be moving to Chicago anytime soon.
