Oh, I wanted to love this one. Wanted to love it so, so badly. I think Mr. Bowles is absolutely brilliant in an over-the-top kind of way that is different from Grant Achatz. His menus at Avenues, particularly in his earlier days there (he toned things down in later years) just blew me away.  We went to Graham Elliot for my birthday and while some of the dishes were on the level of "close your eyes and moan," others were just... eh. For example, my friend's beet salad was very well done and beautifully plated, but hey, I could get this at any number of places in the city. In fact, I could've gotten it at any number of places three years ago. Yawn. Same with the caesar and the fish app I had (can't remember which one).  But the cheez-it risotto made me remember why I love this guy so much, and the peanut butter chocolate banana dessert ended our meal on a high note. My husband still hasn't stopped talking about his pork chop, which was an incredibly generous portion for the price, not to mention perfectly cooked, accessorized, and plated. We loved the bartender/mixologist and her knowledge and passion for her work (and the drinks weren't bad either, but WAY too small!). There was a really positive vibe about the place and it had a great energy. I would definitely go back--maybe not for a big dinner, but at least to sit at the bar, have a little something to eat, and check it out after it's had a few months to get going. After all, a guy who likes cheesy 80s music and Guns 'n Roses, and who puts deep fried pickles on his his menu, really deserves our loyalty, doncha think???
