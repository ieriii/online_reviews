I like this place. There have been a lot of reviews, so I will keep it short. THIS IS THE COMBO YOU SHOULD GET IF YOU GO WITH A FRIEND!!:.............. THERE IS A 19.99 SPECIAL!! YOU GET a whole fried chicken! 2 small sides- their huge! More than enough for 2! and two cans of soda/water! I went with a friend recently and we got the seoul sassy/spicy bbq chicken basket 2 cans of soda fries fried mushrooms I also got a bowl of brown rice
