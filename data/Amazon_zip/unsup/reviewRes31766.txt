Had a fantastic surprise birthday dinner here last night! We got there a couple minutes early and our table was ready, our server was so sweet and helpful, the service itself was great, and the food was DEEELICIOUS! It's a huge menu so we deicded to come hungry and order a lot of items. Started with edamame, the escolar sashimi (Great White Tuna) special with truffle chips, and the Firecracker roll. The escolar was so fresh - some of the best I've had in a long time. Also had the beef lollipops - wow, they were mouthwatering. For entrees, we split the pork belly (it literally melted in our mouths) and the longribs (again, very well cooked) but got through about half of each because we had eaten so much leading up to the entrees.  The service was excellent - the timing of each dish was perfect but we never felt rushed. Also, the price was pretty reasonable considering how much we ate (and drank) and it came to $175 before tip. Sunda is quite the happening spot and the only negative is that it's so loud it can be difficult to have a conversation. However, gorging on all the fab food kind of got in the way of talking anyway...
