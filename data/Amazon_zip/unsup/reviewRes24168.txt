So my friends and I went to China town to eat something yummy and Aloysius Tak (also a fellow Yelper) suggested Lao Sze Chuan. We went around 8:45PM and it was still quite busy but we were seated right away. Our table of 5 did family style (share all of our dishes) and got the Mapo tofu, dry chili chicken, boiled beef in Szechuan sauce, and salt and pepper shrimp. There was a side dish of the spicy cabbage in chili that was spicy and addicting. I couldn't stop eating the cabbage! The mapo tofu and dried chili chicken came out first with a huge bowl of white rice and omygosh the mapo tofu was so warm and of course spicy but the tofu was cooked just right, not too mushy. The chili chicken was delicious also but I thought there was not enough chicken and too much chili on the dish. The boiled beef in Szechuan sauce was OK, super hot (temperature wise) and burned my tongue and I wasn't wowed by this dish. Also a very spicy dish. The salt and pepper shrimp was very tasty! It was like shrimp tempura but even better. I was surprised the dish wasn't bigger and didn't have alot of shrimp (everyone had about 2-3 shrimps) and the shrimp sizes weren't big at all either. The service here is TERRIBLE. We had to ask several times for our water to be refilled and the waitress does not speak english well AT ALL. I understand this is China town but there is alot of American customers and you should atleast have some sort of understanding of English. Anyways, I loved the food here and I would definitely come back again.
