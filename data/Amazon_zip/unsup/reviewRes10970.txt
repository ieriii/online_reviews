Clearly this place needs no further review: It's Fabulous. But I'll go ahead and add my two cents anyway. :) Upon walking in the door, who should I see seated by the front window but Chef Radhika from Top Chef Season 5. I realllllly wanted to go say hi and that I loved her on the show, but I restrained myself and simply gave her a smile that said "I recognize you, and you are awesome". If Chef Rad eats here, it must be fabulous. My friend and I were seated right away, and besides a few screaming children (who were thankfully and successfully shushed by their parents), the atmosphere on a Thursday morning was lovely. It's hip, it's urban, it's just the sort of environment where you feel it's only natural to have your fancy schmancy $10 pancakes and your latte in a tall highboy glass. (Not sure if I like this though - it's hard to hold onto it until it cools off considerably). I VERY rarely go for a sweet brunch entree, unless I'm sharing with my sweetie, but the lemon ricotta coconut pancakes with gingersnap brown butter called to me. They were amazing and didn't even need and ounce of syrup. I had the Thai chicken sausages on the side, and they were good, but probably not worth $4.50. My friend had the lunch burrito, which was huge and looked amazing. I snatched a bite of her potato salad, which was perfection - not too heavy, full of dill and great flavor. Of all the fancy brunch places, I'd say Bongo Room is in the Top 5. I need to go back and try an egg dish to get the full experience, but those pancakes were crave-worthy. If you want to give an out-of-town guest the full fancy brunch experience, this is the place I'd bring them.
