Wonderful Mother's Day here - great food. Not the traditional boring Mother's Day brunch buffet, rather 3 fabulous entrees to choose from or their already excellent menu. I had eggs benedict which featured delicious, tender chicken instead of ham. Service is great - when we left the bus boy wished me a Happy Mother's Day - very nice and unexpected. This is my third visit there but my first on Sunday. Glad I live in the hood, I will be back.
