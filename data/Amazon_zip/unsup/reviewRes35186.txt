Very simply this is the best place to get Crab and Lobster in Chicago. It has been a great treat every time I have gone here. The lobster bisque soup and clam chowder soup are both amazing. My girlfriend loved the fried calamari (I cannot comment as I do not like calamari). The waiter was very attentive to us and explained everything on the menu well. I got creamed spinach as a side with my Red Alaskan King Crab legs and it was hands down the best creamed spinach I have ever tasted. The crab legs were just amazing and I cannot describe anywhere else I have had better. For dessert we split a chocolate cake and that was great too. Everything about this place is just amazing. If there is one downside it might be that you are seated fairly close to other people and can hear their conversations. You might complain about the price but it is well worth it and I cannot wait to go again. Every year now I tell people to get me Lettuce Entertain You gift cards for Christmas so that I can use them at Shaw's.
