First time at the Grand Lux. My best friend and I went there for dinner last night and we split a Sonoma salad & a Chicken Parm, not to mention with her request the Benies (sp?!) - those New Orleans fried doughnuts. meh. I hate to give it a 3 because everything was delicious, with huge portions, but I felt like it was kind of overpriced and a bit too grand for me. The decorations though beautiful, were too much for me. I suppose I like simple and quiet. This place HUGE + super bustling. If you like action & grandeous things --- this is for you. Our server = excellent, took care of us. Felt a bit touristy there, but we had a lovely seat overlooking the Burberry on Michigan ave. loved the salad. get it if you go there. also dessert dipping sauces... mm. all in all good experience.. would i go back ? nope... too many other places worth exploring. ;-)
