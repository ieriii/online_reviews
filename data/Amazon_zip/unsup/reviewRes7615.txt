This place is worth every bit of the 5 stars, it really is as good as it gets. I absolutely love Fogo! It's worth every penny! First, the salad bar in itself is enough to keep me coming here. Its incredibly fresh, always being added to, great variety of cheeses, cured meats, and super fresh veggies and salads. I have to hold myself back from eatting the whole salad bar, as I wouldn't have room left for the juicy meat. Now onto the meat... incredibly juicy, succulent, grilled goodness! The waiters (in their super cool Brazilian outfits) are quite attentive and as soon as they see your card flipped to the green side, they run right over to offer you a new meat. The only pet peeve with this system is that sometimes you may not get the meat temp you desire. Personally, I like medium-well, and most cuts end up being rare-medium. To get a piece of well done, you'd have to wait till a new seared piece comes out of the kitchen. The waiters are so attentive that they'll remember which table requested a certain type of meat or "temp" and deliver shortly. Also, the extra's on the table, mashed potatoes, palenta and cheese buns are replenished often, but as I consider those fillers, I usually skip them and stuff my fancy face with the bountiful meats!  My ultimate fav is filet mignon wrapped in bacon. I drool as I think about this. Don't be a sissy, try all the meats! Some people only want a certain type, thinking the others are "cheap" meats. Each is uniquely flavored and spiced, taste it all! Fogo - how about the possibility of leaving my salad plate on the table WHILE I eat the meats? Usually the waiters quickly give you new plates, but I actually like eatting salad & meat at the same time. Last time we went, it was a group of 4, its a bit hard to keep a discussion going, sometimes it gets loud in here. Not so much people talking loud, seems like the sound resonates from the walls/ceiling. Till we meat again Fogo! (Pun intended)
