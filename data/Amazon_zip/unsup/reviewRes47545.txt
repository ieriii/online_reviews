I like the fact that we had a vegetarian with us and the chef came out and personally showed explained to her what she can and cannot eat at the Harvest Table. In addition, he created a vegetable skewer just for her. This place is not for vegetarians but they do a great job accommodating.  The meat is typical for a Brazilian Steakhouse but they do have more seafood which we like. It is a great place to bring a group and fun place to go and indulge. We love coming early and having drinks, eating in the dining room then going upstairs on the rooftop!
