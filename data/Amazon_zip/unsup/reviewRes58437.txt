Glenn's. . .oh Glenn's. I started yelp yesterday and I thought, how do I not rant about my favorite seafood joint. I mean every time I make a new friend. At some point or another I have the conversation So have you been to Glenn's? no what's that? The most awesome seafood place ever, I mean 15 different kinds of seafood awesome. Cheesy? Maybe, I am. I never cared. But seriously this place has the best food around and it's so close to the brown line. I have to say the sturgeon and the tuna are my absolute favorites here. But the service, impeccable. Shauma, she is the best waitress. My room mate and I love her. She's funny and social but not overbearing. And I never have a empty water glass. Bottom line, literally. If you want amazing seafood paired with a Mimosa and great service, go to Glenn's.
