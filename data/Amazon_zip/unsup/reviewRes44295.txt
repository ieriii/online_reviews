I really liked Wakamono. It's a BYOB, so you can save some cash as long as you don't spend $10 for a martini at the bar while you wait. We had a 45 minute wait, so we weren't so fortunate. The atmosphere was lively, trendy, but not snobby. The wait staff was comfortable and very helpful in regards to their BYOB guests and serving the wine that we brought. The food was great. We had the fire dragon roll, maki mexicano, the rainbow roll. Although the selection wasn't very unique, it was all assembled very well and had great flavor. I have been to sushi restaurants that make rolls that are so big that you have to cut them in half or take multiple bites just to each one piece, but that's a pain. These rolls were all moderate sized so you could just pick them up and splash them into soy and you're good to go.
