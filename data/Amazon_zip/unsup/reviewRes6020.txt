I'm really a fan of Davanti, I have a couple of minor reservations, but my dinner there left me craving to go back as soon as possible. The fact that they charge retail prices on wine and then a corkage fee instead of marking up cheap wine by 200-300%. The decor is super cool, repurposed wine making items and door locks with keys in them, along with very vintagy furniture.  We tried the burrata, which was really better then I expected, crostini's with cream stuffed mozzarella, it was such a great start to our dinner. We then tried two salads and some meat and cheeses. My complaint with the meats and cheeses is that they give you approximately 1 oz of each selection for $4-7, which means that they get about $64-102 per lb, when I'm sure they are not paying more then 15-20 per lb at the worst. I think that is just too much of a mark up for something like that. I'd be able to understand it a little better if they gave you 3oz per selection for the same price.  The two salads we tried were perfect, one with Roasted corn and the other with escarole, both were dressed perfect and tasted fantastic.  We'll definitely be back here and will try the polenta for sure, it looked great on the table next to us.
