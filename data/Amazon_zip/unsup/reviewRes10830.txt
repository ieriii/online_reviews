Another Yelp based restaurant visit. Very cool spot, we had to wait a little bit but it was worth it. I'm comparing it to Meli's up the street and it's not as good, but still a must stop while in Chicago for sure. We had the Red Velvet pancakes (I think I just like anything that's red velvet) it just kinda lures you in by the name. and the Caramel pancakes, which to my surprise, was better than the Red Velvet. Both were great (yes, I have a sweet tooth) but I think the Caramel pancakes take the trophy here. Must try!
