Great place to go, especially if you want a late dinner in this city that seems to roll up the culinary sidewalks at 9 pm. The kitchen is open until 11 pm AND the Hopleaf is open on Mondays, another tricky time to dine. Mussels and fries are sure bets and the herb salad is yummy and fresh. Way beyond pub grub. Don't let the jam-packed bar stop you, head to the back for your meal.
