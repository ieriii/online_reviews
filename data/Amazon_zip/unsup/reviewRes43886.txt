Oh my... this place is an artery's worst nightmare. Our waiter was outstanding, spent a lot of time with us answering questions about the various dishes and wine. The bottle we picked was incredible... then came the meal: Unbelievable. Three of us ordered different cuts of meat and all were perfect. Perfect! Flawless preparation and presentation. Great Classic-Chicago atmosphere, located a short walk to the Theater / Opera district. Kinzie is a delight and a truly great place. High recommendations. Enjoy!
