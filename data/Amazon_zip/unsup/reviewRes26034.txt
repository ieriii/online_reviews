This is a great little sports bar atmosphere and it gets pretty busy as well, we just got here in time before the crowd hit. The pizza itself doesnt look pretty or anything. But damn once you take a bite of the crust its awesome! We ordered a sausage, mushroom and black olive pizza. The flavors were all there, the sauce was good and the crust was cooked perfectly.
