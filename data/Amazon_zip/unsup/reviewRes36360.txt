Anywhere that makes a crocodile roll look like an actual crocodile has me doing the giddy clap. (That is an excited little clap and a mini-dance party all rolled into one.) I met a friend here for dinner on Friday night and absolutely loved it. We made a reservation for 7:45 because I heard it can get pretty hoppin' during the dinner hour. It was more precautionary but tables were filling up around us left and right. The atmosphere is so relaxed and comfortable, with dimmed globe lights and candles adding to the warm glow. Unique and creative artwork on the walls. The service was great, host seated us quickly and the waitress was right there for drink orders. We tried the edamame which was salty and delicious although it never fails that I squirt myself in the face while eating it. There is so much to choose from on the sushi menu, we were out for maki and it was hard to chose just a few!. They all sound delicious. We didn't order anything too crazy; the Santa Fe, Philadelphia, Summer Passion, and the Sunny Crunchy upon a recommendation from our waitress, which was amazing and our order was up very quickly. Indie is still BYOB but they recently received their liquor license so there is a corking fee. My one tiny gripe, some of the rolls are so big they are hard to wrangle with chopsticks and fit into your mouth without them falling apart. Luckily my friend is kind enough not to laugh at my efforts and neither of us have any shame in using our fingers from time to time. I will be back to Indie for sure!
