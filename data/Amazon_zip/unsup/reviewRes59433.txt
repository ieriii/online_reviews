Worst... never had such an experience... not the food but the staff. I called them in the morning to order a delivery for 5:40 PM and 1st they kept me on hold while they were making fun about eachother and talkin which i could listen clearly.I didn't receive the pizza on time so when i called them they kept me in hold for 10 min... and they said that the delivery guy is in the building and i went around looking for the delivery guy all over the building as this was for the class and had to be there before lecture, i din't find any so i waited for another 20 min and again when i called they asked me to be in hold and i mentioned regarding delivery and now she was rude saying that she wants me to hold... anyways i was on hold for another 10-15 min and she finally said that the order i placed was for tomorrow and when i mentioned that previously i was said that the pizza was in the building she was like are you sure.... the wors customer service in heart of downtown...I was surprised to see that they have many good reviews may be it was just food but i never had such carelessness in any of the thing that i dealt with.I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE MANAGER TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST THE STAFF WHO ARE SO CARELESS WHILE THEY TAKE THE ORDER AND LIE ABOUT THINGS!
