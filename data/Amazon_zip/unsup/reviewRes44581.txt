Alliance designed our wedding cake and it was absolutely gorgeous and delicious! We worked with Mitchell and he was super helpful throughout the process. At our cake tasting (one of the best perks of planning a wedding), he explained all the different flavors and frosting options and left us alone so we could talk candidly about all the choices. To stay in our budget and also have enough cake for all our guests, our actual wedding cake was pretty small (served 75) and we had extra sheet cake of the same flavors in the kitchen that made it enough for all 230 peeps at our wedding. Everyone raved about how good it was. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
