My friend and I have heard a lot about Hop Leaf and wanted to try it. We were there on a slow Monday lunch. We sat ourselves, waited for service and nobody ever came.. The bartender told us to sit anywhere so I assume he was suppose to take care of us but completely ignored the table. He only had 2 patrons at the bar and was on his phone for most of the 10 minutes we were there. We walked out and will not return.
