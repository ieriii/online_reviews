Let me start off by saying, I love hot dogs. Like, more than any human being should. I had an afternoon free in Chicago and had been dying to try this place. It was everything I had dreamed it would be. As they say, there truly are no better words than "encased meats"  This place has every kind of encased meat you could ever want and more. On top of that, the guy at the counter (Doug, is that really you??) was so super friendly and seemed genuinely nice. The only bad thing I can say is that they put grilled onions on their Chicago dog instead of raw onions, so next time I'll have to ask them to substitute that. Even so, it was still a delicious dog. If I had more cash with me (Cash only) I would have tried something fancier than the Chicago dog. I guess that will have to wait until next time...I think Hot Doug's and I are going to have a beautiful future together.
