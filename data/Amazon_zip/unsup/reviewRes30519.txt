Just ate lunch here with a friend, it was incredibly good! We got the pulled pork- OMG it was awesome. The bread was amazing too, nice and crispy and the coleslaw went great on there - it was a lime based slaw, which I've never had before, but very good! It was pretty big, so we split it and that was a wise decision. The waitress wasn't much of a talker but she got the job done. Seemed a bit overpriced- $15 for a sandwich with a side, but it was still very tasty!
