I went for a Sunday Brunch and I can't wait until I go again. My group ordered almost everything on the menu and they asked me how I knew to order all the bacon...uh, duh? Order the maple syrup publican braised bacon ($7). The thing is a thick slice of bacon (half an inch?) and is so tender and melts in your mouth with sweet syrupy goodness. I had the wonderful waffle; so light and fluffy with the honey butter and fruit jam. It has wrecked my standard for waffles forever. The spicy pork rinds were fun to snack on as well as the clams and mussels. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order for brunch. (Unless you miss out on the bacon). Just be advised thats they will run out of the favorites such as red wine poached egg and weiswurst.
