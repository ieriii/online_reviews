Home of celebrated celebrity chef and having won countless awards, most of which can be seen framed near the restrooms, Frontera Grill is an apparent destination restaurant of Chicago. Whenever I've seen Chef Bayless on tv he is always making some kind of traditional Mexican mole. This influenced my decision to order the Mole Trio (grill-seared pork in manchamanteles, two mole poblano enchiladas, and roasted vegetables in green pumpkinseed mole) for lunch. There were definitely some new Mexican flavors that I hadn't ever experienced before in the dishes here, that much I appreciated about the food. In terms of overall satisfaction however I wasn't any more satisfied than when I leave a local taqueria that charges one third of the price for twice the amount of Mexican food. I was generally satisfied with my entree overall but I just don't think the price tag ($21) was justified. Wasn't very full and had a sweet tooth hankering so I went for the pastel de chocolate y cacahuate. This featured a very rich and dense, yet velvety, chocolate peanut butter cake, toasted peanut ice cream and diced mango. This was probably my favorite part of my meal here. Their homemade hot sauce placed at every table is not very hot at all, it's really more tangy than anything else. A little disappointing since I like the heat. In terms of ambiance and atmosphere it's a very colorful cantina style decor here, but if you didn't see the Frontera Grill awning on the outside you might actually think you were in a slightly more upscale Chevy's Fresh Mex from the inside. No free chips and salsa here though.
