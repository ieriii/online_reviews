This place was running one of the biggest scams I've ever encountered at a restaurant when I visited there on July 2. Let me explain. On July 2, it was 92 degrees, with the humidity it was hitting 102. After walking to Yolk I was excited to get inside in the air conditioning. Guess what, for some reason they don't air condition the area where you wait; BUT, don't worry, if you are thirsty and need to cool down from standing in the non-air conditioned waiting area of the restaurant you can BUY a $1.50 bottled water or a $2.00 sports drink. We asked for tap water, AND guess what they wont give you a cup with ice and tap water BECAUSE *drumroll*....... then they couldn't sell you $1.50 bottles of water!!! Believe it or not, it was actually cooler sitting outside in the heat than it was standing in that restaurant on that day. We stayed to eat here (because it was 1230am and I hadnt eaten all day and didnt want to find another place in the heat). The service was sub-par. Our water glasses were consistently empty (probably because we were drinking too fast as a result of the dehydration we suffered from not being able to shell out another $1.50 each for more water during our wait for a table).  The food did come fast; but it was nothing to write home about. I've had better benedict's than the South of the Border that I ordered and the pancakes were pancakes.... If I could award a least ethical restaurant award it would go to Yolk.
