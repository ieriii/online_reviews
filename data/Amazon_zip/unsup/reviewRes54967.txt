I heard about this place a while ago and tried to walk in once without reservations. Quick tip...they don't take walk ins! This isn't a problem...I just didn't know.  My wife and I made our reservations and awaited our dinner (without the kids. Love'em...but not here) A few days before our dinner we received a call from the BonSoiree staff asking what course menu we would like to order...or pre-order. I wanted to get the 7 course for myself and the five course for my wife. They kindly let me know that the table must all order the same curse dinner. Hmmm....ok. The seven course it is. It was also nice that they asked if there were any substitutions for the table. I mentioned my wife didn't like venison and would like something else. They were more than accommodating with this request and I got the impression that most things wouldn't be a problem, if they new about it ahead of time.  Going back to the fact that they don't take walk-ins is really a key part of this place. They know exactly how many guests they'll have, how many to shop for, what they'll have and when they'll be there. It's a bit odd...but it ensure that they'll have maximum profit and the customer will always receive the freshest foods.  I won't go through every course, instead I would ask you to go and enjoy each course for yourself. Sure, some courses are better than the others, but that's part of the fun.  It's not the absolute best dining experience that you'll ever have. But it's very good food that is well prepared at a good price.   two thumbs up!! dan
