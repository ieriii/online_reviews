Went on Sunday for a birthday brunch. All four of us enjoyed our food, and the menu was very extensive for a brunch. My mom's corned beef hash was delicious -- unlike any I've had before. And my boyfriend's fish and chips were phenomenal. Also, the atmosphere and decor are very cool. I would definitely go back.
