I only had sushi/maki. The basic fish quality seemed very good. However, the rice was cool, and falling apart, and seemed to be missing something (vinegar?). I can shovel all kinds of things into my mouth. It's actually perhaps my most graceful, proficient move. The sushi was difficult. It really has to work together at a basic level, and the rice being off threw it. We ordered many of all the individual pieces on the menu as things went on. We tried several of the more interesting rolls - I will give them some credit for trying, but I didn't feel like they came together very well. Maybe I caught them on an off night....?
