I'm begrudgingly writing this review. I had a total "Meh" (shoulder shrug) experience here. It was a busy Friday night (first mistake), but it was late (almost 10:30p) ... It felt like EVERYONE (including the bartenders and hostesses) had an attitude (and not the good kind of attitude, but the $hitty, I'm better than you, I don't want to help you) that just made me feel like I was bothering them or that I was inconveniencing them. It really bothered me and put a sour taste in my mouth. Thankfully, the wine selection is great, but their food ... well ... it was just Meh. As an avid traveler (and eater/foodie), it felt like they were trying too hard and missed the mark. The serrano ham was delicious, but only came with 4 slices of bread (not enough). The saffron compote that came with our cheese selection was AMAZING! The paella negra was so salty, it was hard to swallow. I felt discouraged when I left, I really wanted an amazing experience, but it just .... wasn't. The architecture was beautiful but the next time I am craving tapas/Spanish/Catalonian, I'm headed to Cafe Iberico.
