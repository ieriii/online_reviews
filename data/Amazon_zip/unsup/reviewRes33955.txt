Every fourth restaurant in Chicago is Italian (the rest are all split between Thai, Mexican or another cuisine). In other words, competition and expectations are high...while those who have wheat-allergies try to talk their friends into changing their minds set on pleasing their Italian appetites. Thank goodness for the small Francesca chain. Here, anyone can ask and receive. Mia Francesca has an entire menu of gluten-free pastas that are made purely of quinoa (and by that I mean not a quinoa-corn mix). If you're new to the gluten-free/celiac diet, quinoa is not only a lifesaver but a grain that originates in the Andes which is low in sodium, has no cholesterol, contains 16.2% more protein than any other grain and is rich in vitamins and minerals. Yep, a godsend. For other food items, the calamari salad is full of those little guys causing you to get your money's worth. Or the mussels are also not super full of seafood flavor but garlic. I slurped down the Pasta al Pomodorini: linguini sauteed in a 'spicy' cherry tomato sauce with garlic, olive oil and fresh herbs. Perfectly flavorful, delicious and GLUTEN-FREE ITALIAN! Purchase yourself one of their wonderful bottles of wine and you're set! For those who doesn't have wheat allergies, don't miss out on their profiteroles with pistachio ice cream. D-Lic! Otherwise, the flourless chocolate cake with fresh berries is your match.
