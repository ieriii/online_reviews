The food here is pretty good and there are so many options on the menu. You can choose anything from their bbq selections (pork, duck, chicken), various entrees, and noodle soups. I tried their BBQ combination plate ($4.50) and their wonton noodle soup ($5). Their BBQ is very delicious. The wonton noodle soup was good but I've had better. I also tried some of their beef with broccoli dish ($5) which I liked. The beef was tender and they used Chinese broccoli, not the American-kind. However, I didn't like their rice and thought it tasted a little old. Sun Wah does a pretty good mixed seafood pan-style noodle dish. The only downer for me on this dish was the type of noodles they used -- personally, I prefer the egg-noodles but they used some sort of wheat-flour noodles which didn't give it a very authentic flavor. Their hot tea was ok.  The ambience resembles a busy Hong Kong market-type place with a large area for sit-down dining. I liked the environment and felt that I could easily imagine I was in Hong Kong eating authentic cuisine. Service was fine and we had no problems. We only had a 20min wait but that was a Sunday evening. The restaurant is very close to the Argyle stop on the Red line, which makes it very convenient to get to.  I would come again for their delicious BBQ and to try other things on their menu. However, I was slightly turned off by how over-priced a good portion of their menu was for entrees. The best deals are the rice plates (which include the BBQ) and noodle soup dishes. Overall, a great place and I'm satisfied! This place is better than other Chinese places I've been to in Chinatown.
