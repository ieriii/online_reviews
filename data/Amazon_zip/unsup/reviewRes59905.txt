This place is not too shabby. It's not that bad. If there was a 4.5, I'd give it to them, but there isn't. They can still make improvements. Well, the coffee there is not bad, although I prefer coffee from Atomix and the Barista Coffeehouse place. Now, this spot has some nice cakes. The thing that hits me is the cakes. The cakes are really good. Everything else I really haven't tried, and I can't say I recommend it, except for the cookies. The cookies are pretty good.Now, this is an independant business, so give them credit. Of course they can improve on a few things, but I think it's a decent place. The only thing they can use is some more space, maybe nicer staff, and to experiment on some of their "goodies" in order to get the best flavor and texture. I recommend it for the cake, and cookies. Everything else, you are on your own. Not a bad spot at all. Oh, did I mention, Free Wi-Fi? P.S. Don't bring your desktop. ;)
