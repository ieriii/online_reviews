I took my husband and his best friend out for their birthdays last Saturday to Brazzaz and boy was it great. The food was great and the services were fantastic. These are two guys that is hard to fill up, but this place did the trick. The atmosphere was great and my server, I wish I could remember his name was very attentive.
