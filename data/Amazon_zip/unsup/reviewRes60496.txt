Stumbled upon this terrific restaurant 2 months ago when I moved to the neighborhood and I keep coming back!!! The food is terrific, I have had everything from their famed Mac n Cheese to their Black Bean burger and I have never been disappointed!! My friends and I were in on Saturday for Wilde's big St. Paddy's Celebration. We had a blast!! The music was pumping, green beer was flowing and amazing Irish food!! What's not to love? Being in the Industry myself, the staff did an amazing job. From our waitress to the hosts, bar staff and back of house, the staff was definitely on top of their game. Especially for how crazy busy they were!! It pains me to see bad reviews on this establishment, especially over this past weekend with the craziness that is St. Paddys weekend.First off ,you're in an Irish Pub on St. Paddys...of course the music is going to be loud!!! You're in a BAR on one of the biggest party days of the year.And secondly if you're old enough to drink in a bar, you should be old enough to figure out how to split your own bill. Maybe next time your big group goes out ,you should all bring cash to avoid the confusion of adding your $2.50 coke and your burger on your card.Hands down one of my favorite places to dine, drink and chill in Chicago!!Highly recommend to everyone!
