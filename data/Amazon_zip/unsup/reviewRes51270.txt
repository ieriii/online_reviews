I've been coming to Garcia's for as long as I can remember. Always got tacos, burritos, etc. but the chicken enchiladas with mole, that's the dish I die for! It comes with rice & beans, the chicken is fresh, and the mole sauce is delicious. Nothing more to say, except one day, as I paid for my bill with my credit card, I left the card in the holder and left in a hurry. Thanks goodness they had my card, safe and sound!
