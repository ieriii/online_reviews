Grand Lux seems to be one of Chicago's top tourist attractions because whenever I go in there every single tourist is waiting for a table. Don't they know that they should be trying one of our amazing steakhouses instead? However, I do enjoy the food at Grand Lux. They serve you enough food for 5 people, but there is something on the menu for everyone and it happens to be very good.
