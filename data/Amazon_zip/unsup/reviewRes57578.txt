I give a 5 when I get above expectations. It's not a 5 star but it was great. Don't go to melting pot this is the place for fondue. If you don't want fondue go somewhere else. The wait staff is great and it's a fun atmosphere. We have been to a few five star restaurants in Chicago and we always feel like we spent too much. This one we spent 1/5 of the price and loved the experience....
