Prior to going, I had heard of this restaurant from several of my friends...one in which stated that is was best Mexican food he had ever had. Living nearby, I figured it was worth taking a shot myself.  We went around 9pm on a Monday evening and the restaurant was less than half full. The service was a little bit slow, my gf complained, but I'm a bit more patient. I will say that once we ordered, the turnaround time for when we got our food was AMAZINGLY FAST...I was impressed.  In regards to the food, in my opinion it was just OK. Then again, we both went the safe route...she got enchiladas, me...the burrito. The free appetizer tasted very good. The guacamole that we ordered left a little to be desired...a little bland. We intend to go back again, it's hard to judge off of one setting...however I will say that the prices are UNBEATABLE....less $20 and we left full.  I'd recommend anybody give it a shot....oh and bring wine (or beer) as its BYOB.
