Personally, I had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The ambiance was perfect for an evening out and the service was great. The food was generous sized and family styled, which I really like, and it's great to be able to order a variety of dishes so that everyone could try it. They have one of the best lamb dishes with tomatoe sauce and spinach rice I have ever had (I forget the name of the dish), and I was thoroughly impressed with their dolma and cold plate dip dish. I will definitely go back to this place again and recommend anyone who wants great service, good sized portion for the money spent, and awesome Greek food, should eat at this restaurant at least once.
