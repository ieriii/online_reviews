I'd been wanting to try the original Urban Vegan on Montrose, but hadn't gotten around to it. When I heard they opened up a new spot a bit closer to me, I got excited (good Thai food is seriously lacking in Logan Square/Bucktown) and took the opportunity to get some take-out. This first time I was boring, but just wanted a simple pad thai with soy chicken. After years of only ever ordering Thai food with tofu (and worrying that they wouldn't keep the fish/oyster sauce out), this was a nice change. I got the lunch combo, which came with a little salad (w/ a delicious dressing) and the best egg rolls (eggless, of course) that I have ever had. Warning, they are thinner than your typical egg roll, but well worth it. Next time I'll try something more interesting, like one of the mock-fish dishes (the sweet chili fish sounds too good). But I was overall very happy with my experience (the employees were friendly too).
