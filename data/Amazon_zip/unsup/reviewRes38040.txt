Heh. You know what's fun? Showing up at Hopleaf when they open and taking up an insane amount of chairs with your knit group. And hanging out for hours on end while you all get really, really tipsy. While still knitting. Some of us have special 'easy' knitting for these outings.  But yeah, the glares from the people coming in later and looking for places to sit were priceless.  But yeah. What everyone else said. And seriously? The best. Bar. Food. EVAR!  But fancier.
