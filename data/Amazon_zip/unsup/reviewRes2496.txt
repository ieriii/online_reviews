Yah! I'm a fan....my boyfriend bought some hot dogs to go for me. I loved the pork with cheese dog, it was super rich and super good. He also got me the thai which was a little disappointing and I love anything thai, but i think the seaweed topping threw the flavor off a bit. 4 stars because i haven't actually been there (locationally challenged) and loved one of the two dogs I had.
