You can't be in a bad mood at Carnivale. The environment insists that you have fun and enjoy the bright colors and great music. I often end up only eating appetizers like the fish tacos and pork/plantain dish but by far, the ceviches are my favorite. I try to take out of town guests here. We can walk from my place and everyone is always impressed by the massive colorful space and great food. And they have Liqor43 which is my favorite after dinner dessert....Mmmmmmm...
