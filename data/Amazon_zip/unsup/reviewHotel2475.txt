Not what I would expect from a downtown Hilton. The hotel is large, clean and friendly staff. I was surprised however to find the rooms had not been updated. Big old school TV's and old looking decor. Maybe that is the style of this hotel but not really my cup of tea. Also rather pricy but I suppose relativity in line with down town rates. I think I will explore and find a newer property on my next trip. The location is pretty good, either walk or take a short cab ride to just about anything in town.
