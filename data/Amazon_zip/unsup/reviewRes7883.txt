I've been to Fogo many times now and I still never find anything wrong to say! The meat I think is better than Texas de Brazil or any other brazilian places.. They have the best cheese bread that just melts in you mouth!  I've taken many of my friends and family, and not one said they didn't like it! They were impressed! Service is always excellent, they are at your side at a blink of an eye!
