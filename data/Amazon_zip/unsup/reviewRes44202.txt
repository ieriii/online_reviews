Now this is a bakery that gets better and better every time I go in. The bakers are great to talk to and the lounge is a good place to sit down and get some work done. If you are ever in the area and want some killer macaroons, this is place to go. Salted Caramel, Rosewater and Red velvet are my favorites. The only thing puzzling to me is the $ sign that Yelp is showing for Alliance, since I have never ever spent less that $10 here !!
