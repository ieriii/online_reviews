I think I may have been able to bump this up a star had we not come on the Friday before St. Patrick's day. It was just too busy and too loud. I don't mind noise in general but I couldn't hear a word my date said which made for some awkward silences between us. I'd rather not say anything than say "what" every two seconds. Not good. We were seated quickly, however, which was nice. But we were seated in the front of the house at a two top that was crammed up against another one. Once people were seated at that table I felt like we were all dining together. On the plus side, we had the mac and cheese which was really tasty. The portion was huge and my date and I should have just shared it. He ordered a salad that was also huge--too much food between the two of us. We were on a bit of a time crunch because we had a show to get to and our server was great about making sure our food came up quickly. That made an impression on me for sure. I think this would be a great place for a few pints with some friends but found it difficult to enjoy dinner/conversation due to the noise.
