The joint looks great. Food is pretty good but nothing fantastic. We split some appetizers - we had the ftuna carpaccio, the beef tenderloin tartare, and the gnocchi. Gnocchi were by far the best. I had olive-oil-poached salmon for my entree. It was basically flavorless and had a blah texture. One of our party had had the short ribs, which were better. Desserts were good, and service was good too. Overall, though, I wanted to like the place more than I actually did. Oh well.
