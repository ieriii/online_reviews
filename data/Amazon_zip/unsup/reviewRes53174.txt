Well ...what to say ? Maybe its because i was a big fan of Ray over at Con Sabor Cubano..maybe its because 90 mile was having an off day ..either way I wasnt overly impressed , or actually impressed at all. The food was ok -and in my opinion , just ok .. their cuban frita(hamburger cuban style) seemed to be just a burger on special bread with ketchup and shoe string potatoes .. Ray always used a spicy sauce on his burgers and this was just missing something .. i kno, i kno .. ray's not here anymore and 90 miles is doing good enough to open an additional restaurant , but still -ketchup as the 'sauce'? The tostones were overly dry, bland and didnt come with any type of dipping sauce (yep, sauce or lack of again) and unlike others who have reviewed, altho the counter and all seemed to be well staffed, we werent bowled over by friendly staff either-not rude, just not overfriendly either. Most of our visit seemed to fall into that category "Not terrible but not great either" ... so 3 stars. *edited 7/29 to correct my craptastic spelling in a few places =D
