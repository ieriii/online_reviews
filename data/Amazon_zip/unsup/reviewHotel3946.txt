If I could give Congress Plaza Hotel six stars, I would. If you're going to Chicago, MAKE SURE to stay in Congress Plaza. I absolutely LOVED this place. We had a beautiful room on the eighth floor overlooking the park, lake and Buckingham Fountain. You could see downtown with its tall buildings on the left and all the major museums on the right. It was a short walk from Magnificent Mile, Museum Campus, Chicago Art Museum, Library, and the Loop. The hotel itself has an exquisite interior. The entrance hall is stunning in its old-fashioned beauty and the ballroom on the second floor is simply breathtaking (especially if you're a ballroom dancer like me). The amenities are really hard to complain about: the ceiling and the doors might need a bit remodelling, but who looks at the ceiling anyway? Our room was beautifully decorated in burgundy red and deep green, with a comfortable, always perfectly made bed, elegant Oxford-style armchairs and a table in a beautiful bay window (thus the ease of admiring the view to all sides), and all the usual amenities. My friends from Chicago told me to stay in one of the new hotels and skip the Congress Plaza, but I'm so glad I didn't listen to them. Congress Plaza is not only the perfect location for sightseeing and shopping trips, but the rooms and the views from them are so beautiful that we actually had trouble getting out of the room! Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm not even looking at other places, just heading straight for the Congress Plaza website.
