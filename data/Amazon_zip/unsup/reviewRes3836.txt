Yum, yum, yum, and YUM! I've passed by Crisp millions of times but never bothered to go in. I finally took the plunge this year and I can't stop! Their Seoul Sensation Burrito is absolutely delicious! I've tried their chicken wings too, and although delicious, I'd rather get the Seoul Sensation. One thing that is surprisingly delicious are their fries, you'd wouldn't think they were good coming from a contemporary Asian fusion place, but they make meals go from great to greater (as if that were possible).
