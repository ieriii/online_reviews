Food was good...service brought it down to a 3 star. The schezwan green beans were to die for. The orange beef was very good and flavorful, but the dry chili chicken was a bit grizzly and too dark for me. It was also a tad too spicy and I am not sensitive to spice! The cabbage starter was also a bit too spicy.
