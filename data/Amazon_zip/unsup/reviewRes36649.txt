I ordered sushi X. It is usually good. They are charging me 25 cents to have a plain tuna roll rather than a tuna maki which makes no sense since the latter is more expensive to make. Nickle and dime me not anymore! I am pissed off and will probably get to Hamamastu on Clark and ditch Indie forever. They also forgot to mention the free appetizer for any order over 20$'s. I had to call back and remind them. Normally I give a tip to the driver but not today. They can pay him a just wage. It is not my problem.
