Sapori is dead center between where I live and my friend lives so we decided to give it a shot. The caprese was good, though tomatoes still out of season. I had the special rigatoni which was a very large portion and my friend had chicken with mushroom sauce that he thought was good. This restaurant is shy of greatness but the good food and quaint atmosphere with exposed brick and warm lighting would lure me back.
