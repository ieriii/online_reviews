I had the great privilege of being taken to the Hopleaf sometime around New Year's (can't remember the exact day, probably too much ethyl). All I remember are a few glasses of excellent beer, a delicious pot of mussels traditionally prepared in white wine/garlic/shallots, and french fries served with herbed mayonnaise. Those memories have stayed with me for over six months now, and I still sometimes daydream longingly of those delicious mussels even though a couple thousand miles separates us.
