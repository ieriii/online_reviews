I would give this place a 4.5.... The Publican is one of those rare places that has managed to successfully blend hipster and fine dining into an experience that is extremely enjoyable. The food is way more hits than misses, especially when it comes to the pork (and beef) dishes. These guys clearly know what they are doing. The country rib, pork belly, pastrami, and hanger steak are a few that I would recommend. And definitely the pickles -- some great contrast to the savory food that makes up most of the menu. The fish and vegetables...well, they could use a little bit of work.  Ambiance is 5 stars for me. Really attentive and friendly staff, even though the place was slammed. I have dined there twice and neither time did I have reservations, but we were still seated at the communal tables (which is where most of their seating is) right away. It's tight quarters, but definitely makes for a lively dining experience.  Neither time did any of us have room for dessert.  If there's anything that I'd like to see changed about this place, it's in how they bring out the food. While I'm fine with the "it comes out as it's ready", having items that are clearly first courses (and made far in advance - e.g. pickles) come out after heavier entrees makes no sense and hurts the dining experience.  To me, this is either a gimmick or the ego of the chef/owner -- and someday this place won't be cool and new and I suspect that this approach will go away.  Definitely would go back.
