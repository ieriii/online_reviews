MMMMM! Quanda bellissmia! I double heart Spacca Napoli. True to Italian form, the tables are little, the place is lively, and the service is attentive. The oven itself was flown in from Italy and it makes the wood fired pizzas that much more delicious. We enjoyed the margherita, a red, and the the special which was proscieutto and fig, a white. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked. I will happily return here again and again. Hopefully, next time Mama Lucia will accompany me!
