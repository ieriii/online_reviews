One of the best meals I've ever had. And they have big bottles of beer -- BEER! -- in addition to the wine, cocktails and regular beer. The menu and beer list are a little overwhelming, but in that, holy crap, I have to have everything kind of way. Service was great. The food -- we had a salad, grilled squid, shortribs and mussels. Everything was delicious and enormous. You could have rolled us out of there.
