We originally went for the beer...but no one told us they had world-class pizza!? I only lived in Wicker Park for 8 months but I probably went to Piece about 25 times. It got to the point where my friends stopped asking where I wanted to go to eat because they knew the answer was automatically 'Piece.'It's definitely a great place to take friends/family who are visiting and enjoy great beer...and it's also a great way to introduce/trick your frat-boy brother/cousin into trying REAL beer under the pretense that you can watch 'the game' there and eat pizza (the topping combinations are endless!).The only knock would be the sometimes inattentive staff...but who can blame them when they're constantly swamped. I've waited tables at places that didn't pack in as many people in a week as Piece does in a night so I can't imagine what these guys go through on a nightly basis. Try it for yourselves and thank all of us who gave it 4-5 stars later!
