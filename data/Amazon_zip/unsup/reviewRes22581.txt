hmmm... i know thisis wrold famous and everything, but i did not have a good experience here. it took forever to drive here so i wanted to dine-in. i drove past the restaurant and made a right where i found that i would get stuck on a one way road that got me lost. wheni did find the spot my sister ordered me a superdawg with everything. Pickled tomato?!?!? GROSS!! everything tasted so pickled and it soaked the bun. that was disgusting. the only thing i liked was that the bun had poppy seeds and that the wiener was pure beef. other than that i wouldve given a 1 star.
