I went there for the first time last night and everything was great. First of all having a dinner outside and not freezing at 8pm on 4th of November is great. all by itself. Secondly, on tuesdays they have created their version of italian tapas, where menu items are available in smaller portions and between 3 and 15 $. We tried caprese salad (2 stars - the tomatoes weren't ripe), mushroom risotto ( 5! stars), veal meatballs (3stars), pasta stuffed with pumpkin (4 1/2 stars very nice dish!), and the absolute winner of the night - pasta stuffed with spinach in a creamy truffle sauce (10 stars). We were thinking of trying their tiramisu but were soooo full that it was impossible. When the bill came - without drinks it was $40! No, it's not a misprint. For all the different things we ate i think it is a steal. Will definately return.
