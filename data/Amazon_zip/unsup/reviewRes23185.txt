Been going here for 25 years. Evertime I introduce a "newbie" to it, they keep asking to go back. Great dogs, better fries. A little pricey but great food.  The Supercheesie (cheeseburger) is good too, but it takes a long time to cook......My only beef (no pun intended) with the place is that they take your order, give you a slip...but wait to take the money until your order is ready - thus creating a bottleneck when multiple orders are ready.............Terribly inefficient. Why not take your order, take the money, then give you your food when its ready?  Seems like somebody in upper management never waited in line at fast food place before, very puzzling to me.
