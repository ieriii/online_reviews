Incredible beer. Pizza is good, but the beer is definitely the highlight of this place. Cool atmosphere, just expect to wait in a really crowded bar area. We get the takeout special (growler and a pizza) every once in a while and it totally hits the spot. Definitely a great place to hit up every now and then.
