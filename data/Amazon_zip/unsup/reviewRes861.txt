Like most people I waited a good 2 hours in the middle of Feb for this place. My friends think I'm crazy, but would I do it again? YES X 100!!! This place is the most unique hot dog stand/place I've every been to. I came here with a few friends and tried almost everything. The fries are amazing!! So make sure you come on the weekends or else you won't get to try their duck fat fries. Doug is the cashier and he's super nice. The place feels very much like a local hot dog stand no different then a Mr. Greeks or something like that. Great place! I can't wait to come back here.
