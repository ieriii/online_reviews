I live in Logan Square, and couldn't wait to have a micro-brewery pub in my 'hood. We went there on a Saturday night, and the wait was three hours to get seated. Totally bummed, we decided to have a few beers and wait for a while and check the wait time again. In actuality, the hostess seated us after 45 minutes, so we did get to try the food (relatively sober). Beer: FANTASTIC!!! 5-stars here. I tried all four beers that they had on tap that night, and the Iron Fist Pale Ale took the cake. I don't often love pale ales, but this one was remarkable. The hops were strong, but did not overpower the flavor of the beer. The other beers were above average - to - excellent too. Food: Once seated, we ordered several pizzas as starters. The pizzas have thin, crispy crusts and were very good. Not the best pizza in the city, but for the price, you get an excellent pizza and healthy portion. For my entree, I ordered the pulled-pork sandwich. It was OK, but the pork was a little tough. The kitchen doesn't seem to have a smoker, so I'm not sure how it was made. However, my wife's and our friends' entrees were very good. The fish and chips were solid, and so were the fries and mashed potatoes. The prices are very reasonable too. Bottom-line: Top-notch beer, good food at great prices. Go during the week to avoid long waits. But, definitely, definitely go to Revolution Brewing Co.
