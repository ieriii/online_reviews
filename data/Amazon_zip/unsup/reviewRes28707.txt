A decent enough place for some cheap, quick pasta. So, ok I went there in a foul mood as it was but I still manage to keep my unbiased mind about me. Ms. Kim, James and I went there after a brief run at Hema's across the street, where I discovered that I am not a fan of Indian food after all... Ms. Kim seemed pleased enough with her Peroni and James whose British-ness keeps him happy at pretty much any place we go seemed happy as well. I had the pasta in a tomato cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach. It was decent, very heavily cream laden (can we say heart attack on a plate?) but good flavor.  Ok so I found a hair on my plate, gross, really really gross. After a small tantrum they very nicely and delicately replaced my dish with a brand new one. They get a nice golf clap for that one. Needless to say I am OCD about sanitation and by that point in our night my nerves were frazzled so it was not a good experience. But they done right by me so I am pleased. I would go there again.
