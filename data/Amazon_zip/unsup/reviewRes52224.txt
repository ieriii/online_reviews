We got a thin crust pepperoni supreme pizza delivered from here to my boyfriend's apt in Streeterville. The only reason I took off one star was because it took an hour and a half for delivery and the pizza was pretty cold by the time we got it. Even with it being cold, it was GREAT. I don't even know what it is...maybe the two layers of pepperoni (above and below the cheese) or their incredibly crispy crust...regardless, I was in pizza heaven. While I'm normally a Giordano's kind of girl (stuffed spinach...yum) Gino's East has thrown me for a loop....I might need to reevaluate my pizza preferences.
