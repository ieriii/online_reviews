Its not bad, its just not great. Its a total hot spot, and lets be real, the service cou;d truly care less about you. I saw my server three times all night. Once to get my cocktail order (I ordered a $28 Jolly Pumpkin Oro da Calabaza Blanco), which was by no means cheap. I asked him ONE question before I made my order which he could not answer: What Style of Beer is the Ska Decadent? His answer: Umm....(20 seconds later) its an imperial ale, dark russian imperial ale. I rest my case, you either know the menu or you don't. Next, we made our entire order when he get back as the drinks took awhile to get over to us. Was he nice, yes absolutely. I just felt a huge disconnect. Food was good, worth the price for sure. Very unique and tasty. I had the pork belly and it was outstanding. Drink list (not cocktails) needs work, but whatever, they are better than most other options in the vicinity that serve food. Will I rush back no, but I wouldn't be opposed to heading back if a friend asked me to join them one night.
