Every time I go here, every table is full & the food is absolutely delish! I usually order the sweeter breakfast (pancakes topped with melted white chocolate & a graham cracker crust, for instance). The menu changes every season, I believe. They close early, at about 2 p.m. and I definitely suggest getting there early because there is always a wait. Waiting is not a problem because there are local shops within walking distance to pass the time. The waiters & waitresses have always been good or at least decent. Not that large of a place. Decor is cute & I love the ceiling fans. A lot of entrees are big enough to share. I always see a lot of people ordering omelette's which I'll have to try next time. Fyi, flapjacks, pancakes, & hotcakes are all the same thing; not sure why they refer to them as different names on the menu.
