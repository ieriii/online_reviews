Rarely does a meal inspire me to log in to yelp, but this one did. Start w Tara, our server and Joe, the God of The Purple Pig. Without their assistance, our meal would not have been the same. To start, whipped feta cucumber schmear, with perfectly yummy, warm bread.....along with an order of Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette. Started with cava and these appetizers and it kept getting better. Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley were unique and fabulous.  Next up were the "a la planchas", scallops, with toasted chickpeas and a chickpea Aioli (just a little on the side), AMAZING.....the milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes - comfort food even when over 100 degrees outside. A fabulous white wine accompanied the "main course", artfully selected by Joe, who had a story of the wine to add to our enjoyment. Even though we were stuffed, who could miss dessert?  Panino con Nutella (A Sweet Sandwich filled with a Chocolate Hazelnut Spread, Marshmallow Cream & Bananas). Need I say more?  Could be its own food group. The mixed berry pastry was warm and luscious. A perfect meal. Will be back.
