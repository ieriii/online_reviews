Since the office was a bit quiet, I decided to work from home today. And by "work from home", I mean go to lunch and to the Art Institute with a friend. I have been wanting to try the Gage since it opened and to my delight she agreed with my selection, so we met up around 12:30. It was busy, but not overly so. She started with a Champagne Charlie (made with Grand Marnier, blood orange bitters, and a rock of candied ginger in prosecco). It was pretty good. I had a Gage Ginger Fizz (Jameson, candied ginger, and I don't remember what else) and it was okay. I also had an Old Fashioned, which was wonderful. We split a Scotch Egg (hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage, coated with panko bread crumbs and fried, served with stone ground mustard) and it was surprisingly delicious. She had a fire roasted chicken sandwich and I had the peppered salmon club sandwich. Both were big, tasty portions which we could not finish. I wish we had had room for dessert, but alas, we did not. Service was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. I am eager to return and try them for dinner (and another Old Fashioned).
