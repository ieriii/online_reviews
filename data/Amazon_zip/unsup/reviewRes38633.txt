Since my previous review the front room staff seems to have improved their disposition. The room is still the same size, though. I recommend going right when the place opens, around 3:00 in the afternoon, and avoiding "rush hour" (Fridays and Saturdays from 5:00 until around midnight). When you can get a seat, and you can spend some time sipping a fine brew with a friend or by yourself, there are few places like it in the city.
