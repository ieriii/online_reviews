I loved my room at this hotel with one exception. The walls seemed very, very thin and my neighbor kept playing Back Street Boys on their iPod. (Just kidding Kathleen. ;-) ) The walls were thin, but I never heard any music, just the shades being pulled up and/or down. But, the atmosphere is beautiful. The floors are hardwood. The outside wall is made of floor to ceiling windows, which allows tons of natural light into the room. And the bed, my goodness, it was probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a long while. The staff here was super friendly. And the downstairs bar is a great place for a quick cocktail before or after dinner.
