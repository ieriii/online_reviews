AMAZING food & wonderful, attentive service at Davanti Enoteca tonight. We followed the reviews on Yelp and we ordered : 1) Honey & Ricotta (very good!) 2) Pork Belly toast (good but not something we would order again since we're not meat lovers) 3) Ragu of the day (polenta and pork stew meat) 4) Truffle Egg Toast (amazing) 5) Carrot cake for dessert (very sweet) My top two favorites were the honey & ricotta and the truffle egg toast since they were very original combinations. We will definitely be going back to Davanti Enoteca to try more dishes. The plates were advertised as small portions but I thought that the serving sizes were larger than a tapas portion. The only drawback to the experience was a misunderstanding of corkage fee listed on the restaurant website. We thought the restaurant was a BYOB that charges a $7 dollar corkage fee during the week, and no fee on Sunday. Not true. Corkage fee applies to opening up a bottle that you pay for at the restaurant's wine store.
