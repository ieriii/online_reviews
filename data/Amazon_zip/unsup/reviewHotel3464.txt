I love the Allerton Hotel! I give it 5 stars not based on luxury hotel standards, but based on the money I spent per night and damn right, it gets five shiny stars. I booked a five night stay via http://expedia.com and got a King Room for a $110 a night...total! That to me seemed extremely reasonable. The location is more than superb, located between the Apple Store and Brooks Bros. on Michigan Ave. It's an old boutique hotel that has been updated, modernized yet kept the true charm and details from decades past.  It has character. The elevators were extremely fast. Small yes, but fast. If you want big and lightening speed, I suggest you vacation in Vegas in a new shiny hotel, not an old, boutique hotel in Chicago! The room was extremely clean as was the lobby and hallways. Our room was really a good size. We stayed in King room, not a King suite, and all seemed perfect. I had read that rooms were tiny so I was sure not to book a petite standard room. The bed was comfortable and the room was extremely quite. The only downside was the lack of counter space in the bathroom, but I figure if two gay men can make it work for five nights, anyone should be able to! I can't speak of the services that the hotel offers as we never used the restaurant, bar or room service. But the check-in experience, asking of directions, getting a cab were all successes.  For a good looking, perfectly located, reasonably priced hotel......check out the Allerton Hotel........loved it.
