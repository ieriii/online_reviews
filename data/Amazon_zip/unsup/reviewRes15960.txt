I've been to the Violet Hour twice now; both times, I've very much enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great; if you come with a few friends, you'll be able to have a nice conversation with good music in the background while enjoying the amazingly good drinks. Or you can just sit at the bar and watch the bartenders do their magic.   And the drinks are what you come here for: they're superb. They've got some classic cocktails as well as ones that you don't find everywhere else. Whether you get a Manhattan or a Chicago Flip (or both! :) ) it will be made /well/, with a little twist to make it a little different than what you've probably had before.  When you're going, you'll probably do better to think of this place as more like a nice restaurant than a bar. They're not going to let in more people than they have seats for, and if you come in a large group and/or on a weekend, it's going to take a long time to get in. When you place a drink order, it'll take a little bit for them to make it, but fear not, it will be worth the wait.
