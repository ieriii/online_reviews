This is a solid choice for a gut-busting Italian meal. Quantity is the word of the day at Sabatinos. My fiancee and I had appetizers, soup, salad, pasta entrees, a couple of glasses of house wine, and bananas foster for dessert. The damage was less than $70. Everything tasted good and the portions were huge, but nothing blew my mind or stood out from any middle-of-the-road Italian place. The service was low-key and friendly if a bit hurried, and the nice (very Italian) owner came by our table and introduced himself. The decor is kind of corny, but fun. My loud, sloppy family would like this place -- not because it's loud or sloppy, but because it's just totally comfortable and unpretentious.  Do not even think about maintaining any semblance of healthy eating here -- I'd only go back on one of those occassions when I'm ravenously hungry and looking to put myself into a serious food coma.
