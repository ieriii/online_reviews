Holy balls, two hour wait for a table? I think I'll take my business somewhere else then. Oh, what's that? You serve the full menu at the bar? Well then, yes, I will camp out behind these two drunks until they leave. A table would be nice, but given how loud everything and everyone is, it really doesn't matter to me. Unfortunately for me, I was on medication that prevents me from imbibing on alcohol. But watching them make an Old Fashioned was just something else. That, and one of the bartenders seemed to enjoy experimenting with mixing new drinks. Every time I saw him make someone new or random, someone else seemed to "have what he's having." I had the wild boar sloppy joe, with crispy sage, onion, pickled jalapeo, & the beef fat fries. Now I've never had wild boar before, but this was a meal that for $11, fed more for over two meals. It was really that filling, or maybe I'm just not built like those kids in the Midwest are. The girlfriend and I split the roasted marrow bones with red onion jam, sea salt, & sourdough crostinis , and since I've never had marrow before I can tell you I was pretty blown away the the meal. They even serve it in the bone, which was quite an impressive feature as well. There is always something special with a place that serves each beer they have on draft in a different glass. I hadn't seen a real Stigel glass since I was in Austria, but they had them here. It takes me back. Michelin star food for the price of an Applebee's. Love it.
