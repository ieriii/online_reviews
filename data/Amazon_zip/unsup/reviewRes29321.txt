The first thought that I had about this restaurant was that they put a lot of attention and work into crafting the dishes. Appetizers, entree and desert alike. Amazing presentation and great recipes. Owned by the dude on PBS, "master chef" and t.v host Rick Bayliss (sp?). Nice atmosphere and good music. I was here for a focus group and they foot the bill. Pricey for my taste, so I would not dine here a lot, but I would go back if looking for something to do while in that neighborhood. Side note: They had Rogue Chipotle Ale. That shit is crazy! Spicy beer?!?!?! Try it. You might like it. I did and was very pleased. Cerveza Caliente!!!
