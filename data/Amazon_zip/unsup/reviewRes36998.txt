5*s for their mimosa. $9 for a little bottle of prosecco and a small carafe of freshly squeezed orange juice that was enough for two mimosas. Perfection! While I enjoyed how I could customize my omelet (spinach, gruyere, and sausage), I wasn't impressed with its quality. The half circle omelet that oozed out coagulated gruyere reminded of countless bad hotel and cafeteria omelets that I've eaten. While it tasted slightly better than that, it wasn't anything that inspired me to go back to Fox & Obel. The service was hectic and spotty, albeit very courteous, because they were understaffed and it was peak Sunday brunch time in Chicago (11 am). I'd go back for the mimosa and perhaps a baked good, but I'll skip the hot food in the future.
