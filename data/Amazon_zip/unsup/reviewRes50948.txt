Yum Yum Yum in my Tum!!!! I must say upfront that I only have eaten breakfast here. But it is delish. I almost always have the Black Bean Cakes with cheese grits, biscuit, and spinach. Delish!!!!!! It is super busy on weekends so have a lil snack before you go... so you don't pass out during the wait.
