It was my first time here for a birthday party with 13 friends. I would have to say it was definitely a surprise to me how great this place was. I never thought to venture because I'm not usually into chain restaurants. I ordered the filet and actually enjoyed the sizzling butter on the plate. At first I thought it would be a little to greasy, but by the middle of the steak I was dunking every piece I cut off into it. (surprised myself) The sides were ok, could have been a little better for my taste. (tried a bunch of them, since there were so many of us). They had a decent wine selection and I enjoyed that as well. The desserts were definitely worth getting and I won't be such a stranger to this restaurant even though i had my doubts originally
