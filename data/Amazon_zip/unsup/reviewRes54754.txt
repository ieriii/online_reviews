Best Breakfast Ever!!!So, you will have to wait to get a table and the service will most likely feel a little rushed to those accustomed to sitting around and chatting after their meal. But for me and E it's total worth it. We go here as a regular treat on Sundays when we aren't trying out new places for breakfast. Me and E have become eggs benedict connoisseurs and their varieties are always a crowd pleaser with some interesting variations that include crab cakes, salmon, and avocado. Don't miss out on their smoothie and juice bar. They have smoothies that put Jamba juice and orange Julius to shame. Everything is super fresh and homemade even their cornbeef hash which is something you don't often see. I am a savory kind of guy myself but their banana and nutella crepe is remarkable. You want skillets? They have em and they're fan-frickin-tastic. The only bummer about this place is that they don't serve booze/ Blood Mary's.All and all the very best... Meli is the standard in which to judge all other breakfast places.
