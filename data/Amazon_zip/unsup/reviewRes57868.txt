My friends and I are always looking for good ethnic restaurants to try. Demera being one of the few Ethiopian restaurants we had tried in Chicago was amazing. The place itself seems authentic. Whenever we're in the Chicago area, my Ethiopian friend always suggests that we go to Demera. Normally when people try food from their own country in America, the food itself has been changed completely to match the taste buds of the people here, but she enjoys the food thoroughly. Although I live in the Suburbs, when I have cravings for Ethiopian food, Demera is the one place that I would drive to get it.
