This is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago! I love the food, and even more the atmosphere. Some of my favorites are the Atun and the Pollo Estilo Billy...last time we were in the waitress recommended the Ropa Vieja appetizer...loved it! And always have a raspberry mojito, they are the best!
