Good food, but in a few words: TOO MANY KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is with parents these days. I pay good money for a quiet, comfortable breakfast and instead I am bombarded with the loud offspring of rude parents. I probably won't be back. If you go, request a QUIET area away from the screaming brats.
