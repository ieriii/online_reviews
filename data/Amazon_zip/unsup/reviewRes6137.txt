When you walk into Wildfire it smells amazing. Like a natural wood fireplace. This place has a very nice cozy yet classy ambiance. The service is great, the menu is amazing, though I usually order my favorite: filet mignon w/ bleu cheese crust. The sides are pretty good, too. Most recently I had the double-stuffed potato and the creamed spinach. Yummy! Great drink list, awesome dessert options, and overall a great place to go. Worth the money. It does get crowded after 7PM almost every evening. Reservations are necessary!
