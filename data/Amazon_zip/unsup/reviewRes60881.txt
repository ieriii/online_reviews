The drink specials this Sunday night were great, and the bartender was nice. I would say I had a nice time, but not fantastic. I couldn't get over the idea that it felt like a rich grandpa's ski lodge or something, and with barely any people in there and Gaga blasting on the speakers, everyone in my group agreed that the place was a little awkward.
