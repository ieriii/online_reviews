Came here a while ago, but can't forget it. Just thinking about it makes me drool..(uggh *homer moan*). The place is tiny, but it suprisingly carried a relaxed, warm vibe inside. Must be the candles. Inexpensive, huge burritos that DO NOT dissapoint. I split a veggie and steak burrito. The portions are so big, I had to doggy bag the other half. And don't forget the chips and guac! I'd eat from here again, but probably just convenietly order my food to go up in front so I can chow down like a pig at home!
