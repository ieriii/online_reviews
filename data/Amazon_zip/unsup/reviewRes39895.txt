I don't have any earth shattering news other Yelpers havent stated, so a quick reiteration: 1. They bring you bowls of raw meat (or fish) and you cook your own meat on a flaming pit in the center of your table. Pretty fool proof though. 2. it's smokey in there. It's not an awesome pre-date place imho unless you've already been dating a while. I actually prefer it post-party to wind down with some decent food in my belly and some good sleep. 3. The servers probably don't speak English-or won't speak it to you. But they are cool with point a tthe item you want and will answer straightforward questions. 4. The servers dont want to be chatty with you. Be polite. Don't hesitate to waive them over if you need something. Also, if you decide you want more whatever during your meal, they will bring it (at a cost). 5. It helps if you have some idea what you are bieng served and how the whole thing works. Not mandatory though - scope out other diners! My personal take: A. Stay away when it is crowded. It's a circus in that joint. B. My fave size group is 4 people. More than that and the grills get too crowded and you can't reach stuff and you are always waiting on food to cook and it gets annoying. C. Sometimes the servers are very helpful-sometimes they arent. Oh well. D. If you are a very picky eater or not at all adventurous, just skip it. You probably won't love KBBQ anyway, but there are easier places to try it out. FOOD IS GREAT! It's a great way to try staples and new foods. Always an interesting group of people around. Never gotten rushed out of here. Squid is a bit difficult to cook w/o scorching, try the octopus. If you are really into sushi - I suggest the next door/connected place. you can order sushi at the KBBQ, but it seems to complicate matters more. I will eat here anytime I get the chance!
