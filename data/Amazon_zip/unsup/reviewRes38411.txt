We had to wait 40 minute for a pizza????????? That was my initial thought after we placed the order for a medium-sized deep dish stuffed pizza with cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage (hold the vegies... kthx). While I am no fan of deep dish pizza (let alone deep dish *stuffed* pizza), since I was already in Chicago for the weekend I had to do what I do best: sample the local favorites. So, a trip to Giordano's is a must. What came out at the end of 40 minutes (and it really was 40 minutes - why do these guys have to be so precise?) was well worth the wait - when the server brought the pizza to the table I realized why it took that long to make it... it actually is a freakin' pie! I love the pie crust and the stringy mozzarella, and considering how unexcited I get over Americanized Italian food in general *and deep dish pizza in particular* I actually quite enjoyed it (after pouring half of the chilli pepper flakes on my slice).  The two guys that came with me went for second... and third. I had to stop at the first one and in hindsight, was grateful we didn't get suckered into getting an appetizer because that would've been a complete waste.
