My boyfriend and I don't eat out often, and a place as nice as Geja's was really going to be a once-in-a-blue-moon treat. I called a half an hour before we left to confirm our reservation, we dressed to the nines and headed over. I knew parking was bad around Lincoln Park, but didn't realize HOW bad... We ended up driving in circles for about 20 minutes before finally finding a spot on Clark St. It was frustrating, but that was my own fault, and we were relieved and excited to finally get to the restaurant and start our special evening. Not so much. I gave the hostess our name, and she said there was no reservation. I mentioned that I had just confirmed it that evening, she checked her records again, and said that she had given away our table since it took us so long to park. No phone call, no "but we'll make sure to get you the next table available." So much for our special evening. We waited around for a half an hour to try to get seated anyway, but eventually gave up and left.
