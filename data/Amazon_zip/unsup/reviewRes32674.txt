I love this place! It was the first vegetarian restaurant that I tried in Chicago. Okay, so there WAS a piece of metal in my wrap, but the staff seemed absolutely horrified, gave me a new wrap, and it was comp'd. Since then, I have had no problems of that kind, and I have been there many times. I love the cookie dough cake, the macaroni & cheeze, and the caeser wrap. The Reuben is also good. The milkshakes are delicious, but practically a meal in itself because they are so rich. The pizza appetizer is amazing - it's made with Tease cheeze. I think it's a new addition. They often change the menu with the seasons, so there's always something new to try! I once had a lentil soup that was heavenly, but I haven't seen it there in a while.  Some of my friends have been disappointed with their dishes - notably, the meat loaf. I'm not really a fan of the black bean burgers. It was like biting into a mush of beans. Be warned - it's often very crowded around dinner time, so you may have to wait outside. Go on the off-hours! Oh, and brunch is good too.
