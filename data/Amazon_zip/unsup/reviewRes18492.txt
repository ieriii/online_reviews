This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. The food is delicious and the wait staff is super friendly. I've had several items on the menu and haven't been disappointed by any of them. We generally get one of three different servers when we eat there and even the waiters not helping us for the evening stop by and say hi. It feels a bit like I'm going home to visit my family. The restaurant is also BYOB.
