This place is packed every time I go! They have a huge beer selection and good food on their menu (try their CB&J its delicious!). They also have a fairly extensive beer menu, though I'm not much of a beer person it is fun trying different ones. I only gave this place three stars because no matter how long they tell you the wait will be for a table, its always longer.
