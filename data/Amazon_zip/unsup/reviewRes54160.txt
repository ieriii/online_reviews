Just visited Chicago and had to try Xoco (Rick Bayless).It has potential but he needs to take his hand out of the salt jar! The posole soup was way too salty! Along with the specialty Xoco salad! The torta (mushroom/goat cheese) was good. We tried Frontera Grill the night before and it was really delicious! I think that's why I was so disappointed with Xoco.
