I've been here handfuls of times over the past 5-6 years or so and I always get the same thing - the falafel sandwich. It's $3.75 and stuffed so full of awesome ingredients that every time, the pita splits. Get a fork, guys, it's not the end of the world. Who complains about too much food, seriously? BYOB, but cash only.
