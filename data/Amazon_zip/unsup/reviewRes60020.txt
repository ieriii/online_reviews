My husband and I have been meaning to try this place since it opened-and I'm glad that we finally did! We loved the charming, southern feel to the place (almost a brighter and well lit Violet Hour) as a backdrop to the comfort food. Our waiter was excellent, provided just the right amount of detail on the menu and gave great recommendations. We started with the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were small yet wonderful, they had the perfect crunch. My husband had the shrimp and grits and I had the pork chop. I'm not a fan of grits, but my husband thought they were fantastic. The pork chop dish? WOW! The sweet potato hash combined with the baked bean puree was out of this world.  The food isn't the healthiest around, but the portions are pretty small so I didn't feel too bad indulging! Worth a trip up to Andersonville! Giving it four instead of five because I didn't like the cornbread, a southern comfort food place should have killer cornbread.
