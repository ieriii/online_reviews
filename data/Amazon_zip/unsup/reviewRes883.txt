Doug is some sort of strange sausage wizard. He is the Gandalf of hot dogs. I've never seen so much innovation in the realm of encased meats. Because I love to wake up early and punish myself, I ended up taking a cab from the loop to Hot Doug's and was lucky enough to be first in line. After I sat down to wait for my food, a nice man who works for the establishment interviewed me about how and why I ended up there. He gave me a coupon which I used to purchase my 3rd helping of encased meat(therefore stuffing my gourd way more than needed). So, word to the wise - if you are first in line, you might get some free stuff. Anyhow, I was a little disappointed by the foie gras and duck sausage. The foie gras mousse on top was overwhelmingly thick(which I expected) but apart from being extraordinarily rich, I didn't feel it had much flavor. I cannot say the same about the rattlesnake sausage, which really impressed me. There's something about deadly animal meat that makes it all the more succulent. It was topped with something I can't remember but it was kinda sweet and all delicious. I also had a shrimp sausage of some sort and it was really good. Honestly, the damn menu here changes so much that it is probably pointless to look at reviews for specific suggestions. It is best to just head out yourself and wing it.
