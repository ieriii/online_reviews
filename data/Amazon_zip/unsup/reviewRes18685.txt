Great Food, Service was slow, which surprised me as other reviews commented on the amazing waitstaff. Called ahead to ask if there was a wait for a party of 2 on Saturday night. Was told to come right in. We were seated in about 10 minutes. The menu was enticing, and we decided what we wanted, but sat for 10 minutes without even the water glasses being filled. Once we finally ordered, the waiter recommended the Breschetta special, which was to die for. Could have eaten 2 more orders, it was soft toasted bread, excellent tomato mixture and fresh mozzarella. We ordered the lasagna special and another pasta dish. Both were beyond expectations and we decided we would definitely go back to try more items on the menu. I am hoping the poor slow inattentive service was a one time thing. I do recommend though to anyone who enjoys a hearty homemade Italian dinner with no frills, just a super cute atmosphere with fantastic food.
