I went here the other night with a friend who lives in the area. She SWEARS by this place and I found it to be pretty good too. I got the Peanut Sauce Lovers with Tofu and thought it was pretty good though the sauce could have been a bit thicker. However, after eating at Thai Garden, no peanut sauce will ever measure up. I tried some of her tofu fried rice (which I felt had a bit too much egg in it) and her Pad Thai (which was delicious). I'm interested in going back because they had a very extensive menu and everyone around us got these lettuce wraps that looked incredible. I'm very interested in trying them. The place was packed at 8 o clock on a Saturday night so if you have time sensitive plans after, give yourself some extra time cause you might have to wait. I look forward to returning.
