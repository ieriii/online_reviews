I absolutely LOVED this place. My boyfriend and friends threw me a surprise birthday party here and this place is just amazing. The server worked with my boyfriend and friends since it was surprise party, and he was very patient with us since we were a large group. I am not a huge fan of Italian food so giving this place a five star means this place is amazing! When I opened my menu, it had a greeting on the menu saying "Sapori Trattori wishes Cathy a Happy Birthday". AWWW, I was so surprised and genuinely happy that they did something like this! GREAT way to start off the night! For my food I had the calamari and it was warm, not salty or greasy but just perfect! and my entree was the lobster ravioli. Even though there was only 5 pieces, the size was pretty good and once I had a bite, I couldn't stop eating. I almost didn't want to share with my boyfriend! (Mean, right?) He had the lasagna but I wasn't a huge fan, the ravioli kicked butt. Towards the end, the server brought out the birthday cake that my friends brought beforehand and started singing happy birthday. It was a great way to end the night at a fantastic restaurant. I really recommend this restaurant to everyone, it is a very cozy restaurant with great workers and delicious food.
