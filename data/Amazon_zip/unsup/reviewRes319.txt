As everyone else has already said, the food here is amazing. The atmosphere, is not quite my style - although much to be expected given all the previous reviews. There are a couple things I would change if I were to ever have the pleasure to visit again - skip the 12 course tasting and go for the 24 course tasting. I was practically drooling over the group next to us as they were getting 2 courses for every 1 course we received - skip the wine pairings. Alinea food is better if you're not wasted by the end of your tour -please don't yell at me for putting my silverware in the wrong place - you served me all that wine in the first place For the money, I would go to Schwa every time. I wouldn't, however pass up a trip back if someone else were paying...
