I came here for the first time when it first opened and thought it was fine, but nothing so special that it would make me want to stand in line to get seated. When I was here for the second time recently, I walked away with the same feeling. At least we didn't have to wait to get seated. My friends and I split the calamari and two pizzas: the sausage and the margherita. The calamari was spot on, but I felt the pizza was lacking. I took one bite of the sausage pizza and didn't want to finish my slice. I do like Italian sausage, but something about the spices in this version tasted pretty odd to me and wasn't to my liking. The margherita was better, but I've certainly had superior versions elsewhere. The food here is certainly acceptable, but not particularly outstanding. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if someone suggested it, I wouldn't be opposed either.
