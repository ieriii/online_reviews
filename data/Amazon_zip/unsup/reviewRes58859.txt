I do not understand why this place is so popular. Their food is not very original, or exciting...or authentic. It's not even very well prepared. The steak lollipops are more fat on a stick than anything else! Don't get me wrong, I'm the kind of girl who wants fat on her meat, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. While the design of the place is somewhat interesting, it's ridiculously uncomfortable. When I go out to eat I'd like to think about the food, not a hard piece of wood pressing into my sit-bones. The lounge couches are even worse. The back of the couch is way too far away from the front of the couch, so if you'd like to lean back you can either do so at a 160 degree angle, or you have to scoot all the way to the back so that your legs are sticking straight out over the edge.All in all, this place is totally overrated, and overpriced. There are so many great restaurants in the area...why would you choose this one?
