THis place is great. I've been to a lot of bars around Chicago, but this place seems to have it all. Great food, a million choices of beer, bar tenders who know what they're doing, and an extremely friendly staff. Also, the atmosphere is nice, not sleazy, but not too stuffy either. Feel free to have a good time, eat, drink, and don't worry about going home broke.
