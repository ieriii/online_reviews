Went here for lunch last Fri. with hubby and grown son. We all loved everything about this place. The decor is warm and welcoming the noise level low and the staff friendly and eager to please. Oh, did I forget to mention the food? Well, it is all top notch: quality ingredients and masterful preparation. We shared a cannoli sundae and it was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.I love the fact that they have a great selection of wines at retail price plus a $7.00 corkage fee. We will definitely be back to try the pizza and everything else on the menu. Bravo!!!
