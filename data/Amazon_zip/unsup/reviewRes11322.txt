I'm sure it's all been said before, but Piece really is as good as it gets--which is why it gets so crowded and douchey at times. I won't go so far as to say it's the best pizza ever, but I've never gone wrong with it. Topping options are plentiful and the Red/White/Traditional option keeps things interesting. And the beer is always great with something new brewed on site every time I stop by. But really what has elevated Piece to legendary status is their Sunday take-out deal. A large pizza and a growler of beer for only $25. It's really the best and only way to finish all five seasons of THE WIRE.
