Anteprima gets 5 stars right off the bat because the pappardelle dish they had in July tasted exactly like my family's ravioli. The noodles, the sauce, everything. Over the years, I have become a ravioli snob because this is the one pasta dish we still make fresh and from scratch, and there's just no comparing it to the thick, doughy stuff you usually find in restaurants - even good ones. So, naturally, I was shocked to all hell when I put that mound of loveliness in my mouth. I was so shocked, I couldn't even tell you now which pasta dish *I* had ordered. It was an equally lovely pasta that I enjoyed thoroughly, but it wasn't that. So, 5 stars for Anteprima. Overall, the evening was lovely. I went with a couple friends, and we had some wine at the bar while waiting for a table on the patio to open up. Then we each ordered an appetizer, 1/2 pasta and 1/2 entree from the prix fixe menu. And dessert. Because you have to. Everything from wine on down through dessert was just fantastic (ok, except for my tuna entree... That fell a little flat for me, but that's what I get for ordering pepper-crusted anything. I was trying to be adventurous). The staff wound up having to ask us to leave because they wanted to close and go home for the evening. We just didn't want to go! So, I'm bringing more friends there next week, and you should, too. :)
