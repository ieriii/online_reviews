I'm a fan. I've eaten here a few times now and it's always been very good. The pork belly and tuna salad is hands down one of my favorite dishes. Would literally eat it every day...if I had a robot body that could process all that salt. Another boost is that I had purchased the Gilt City 5 course tasting menu for 2, and I was thoroughly impressed. Usually these tasting menus are skimpy and have varied limitations. The one we had yesterday included: (1st) Chopped Chicken salad, (2nd) Mushroom lover's roll and tuna two ways roll, (3rd) Lemongrass Beef Lollipops, and Rock shrimp, (4th) Pork Belly! and a Chicken dish, (5th) Molten chocolate cake. Now what really surprised me is that you don't just choose one or the other, you get BOTH items in each course in a family style setting. Very pleased by Sunda. Will be all over the next Gilt City tasting they do, and will be back again for their regular menu.
