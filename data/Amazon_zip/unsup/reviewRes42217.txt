I've been going to GIlt Bar since it first opened and instantly became a fan of the place and it's wonderful decor, food & drinks.  Although, I tend to throw an occasional happy hour here and there with all my friends, we always go back for the food and drinks but at times I can tell the service could be a bit snooty if there is too much of a crowd to please. Past experiences have always been good. I recommend to go here during the weekday or if you're going on a weekend make sure to have a reservation. Love Gilt and will continue to be a fan... :)
