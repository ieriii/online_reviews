First Impression: Dark and hip. Great place for up to 4 people to have cocktails. The high back chairs great a conversation nook. We had tried to come here during a previous visit to Chicago but the wait ended up being about 3.5 hours. We decided to come early (7ish) and this time we were successful.Drinks:Where to begin. I had the Blinker which was a perfect summer drink. Refreshing without being too sweet. It was so good I had it twice. In between this lovely cocktail I had the the Violet Hour Old Fashioned which was also great with its single large ice ball. My husband has a Sazerac for the first time and LOVE it. Next he had a Manhattan with chocolate bitters- the best one he ever had. He finished the evening with a gimblet. This was a lot of drinks.Food:We did not order food but the small menu seems like a perfect fit for the cocktails. Service:Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the bartenders make a perfect cocktail.
