I give this place 5 stars because for all the crappy diners in this city, this one is sooooo much better than the rest!  Not to mention, the chalkboard with all the seafood items!  Good fresh seafood and the best po boy I've ever had!  Potato pancakes are pretty good too.  Always friendly service as well. Good stuff and not much more expensive than your local dumpy diner.
