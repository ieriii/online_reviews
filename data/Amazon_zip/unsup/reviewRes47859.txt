I didn't eat here, but stopped in for drinks. I am not a big hot chocolate fan, but it was cold out and I wanted something hot. This was the BEST TASTING cup of cocoa I have ever had in my life. Seriously, all must stop in here and taste this creation. I had mine plain, but you can add all sorts of liquors to it. The home made marshmallow on top was what really set this cocoa apart.
