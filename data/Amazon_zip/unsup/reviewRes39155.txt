I can never remember this name no matter how many times I hear it. Luckily, that's not the case for the food. EPIC repertoire of banchan, delicious food, great service, open on all major holidays, and big portions. On top of that, the BBQ is done not on a gas grill, but on a super-legit down-to-its-roots charcoal-filled stone basin overlain by a chicken wire grill. I don't have much detail about this, just because I think it's an overall perfect deal and tasty Korean food. And that's all you need.
