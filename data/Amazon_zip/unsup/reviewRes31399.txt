My company holiday party was at Mastro's recently and i wish i had better things to report. Ambiance was nice. Wait staff were very friendly and nice. We were crammed into a small room and it was an extremely long wait for dinner. Shrimp in the shrimp cocktail were huge but fishy smelling and appeared to have been frozen and thawed out. Had no taste. Truffle Crab gnocci were just awful. The bread baskets they brought to our table to help us through the very long wait for our main course were wonderful though! My steak was overcooked. I was not even asked how i wanted it. Very long drawn out wait between courses to the point that people were leaving. I got my dessert to go because it took so long for them to serve it. The next day there were several people that became ill and the common item they all ate was the shrimp cocktail so i would skip it unless you enjoy being sick! All in all a huge disappointment!
