I'm a big fan of Hopleaf. My past experiences have been 4-5 stars, but this past weekend I left disappointed. I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly, which I've had before and it was melt in your mouth tender and flavorful. This time it was chewy and bland. It was so bad in fact that I reluctantly sent it back.  I ordered the pork cheeks instead and they were okay. They were not nearly as tender as they should have been, and the potatoes accompanying them were raw.  A friend of mine had the mussels which ordinarily are big and juicy, this time they were tiny. I'm not sure if it was an off night or not, but I'm hoping it was just an anomaly. I'm giving it three stars based on past experiences, it would have only gotten two if this was my first trip. Step it up Hopleaf.
