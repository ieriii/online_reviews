I love the food here. But today, my experience was tarnished by a very rude owner (? not sure). My girlfriend and I showed up around 10:00 and they told us there was a 30 minute wait. So we put our name in and waited. At 10:45, we were getting a little bit antsy, and were just curious about where we were on the list. My girlfriend politely asked the hostess how many people were ahead of us, and the hostess asked her what number we were. Before, she could reply, the owner cut her off and told the hostess, "It doesn't matter what number she is. We told them to wait 45 minutes, whenever we call her number is whenever we call their number. Don't come up here to ask." Now, I don't fault the hostess here. But the owner, or whoever the fat guy in the suit was, is a dick. The food is fabulous (although the juice and coffee are superbly overpriced). The owner is an asshole.
