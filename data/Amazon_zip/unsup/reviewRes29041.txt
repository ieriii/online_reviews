Oh the tastiness that is the gnocchi. Always a favorite of mine, but I also like to try their specials. I've never been let down. Although I will say their "BV" choices - healthier options - taste a little bland. But you get what you pay for, I guess. The bruschetta is very good. And fresh. Also what's great about pasta bowl is watching your dish get made. Those guys make it look so easy.
