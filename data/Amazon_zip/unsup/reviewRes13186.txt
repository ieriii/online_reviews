I have only been to Glenn's Diner once before for a Tuesday night all you can eat king crab and it was fabulous.  But tonight wasn't so great!!!  The service was fantastic our waiter was very friendly and very prompt with checking on us and having the table cleared of items when done. The food on the other hand was not so great! Again I had the all you can eat king crab and it just was not very good especially for the price of $47 and change. The corn on the cob and coleslaw lacked flavor as well. I found myself peppering everything just to have some flavor.  For the price I was just very disappointed.  A friend had the tilapia dinner and said the flavor was okay but thought portion was not enough for the price.  This time was very disappointing and just do not think I will be going back.
