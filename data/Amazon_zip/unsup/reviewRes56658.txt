My husband and I went out on a date night and we figured we would try the newresturaunt on Taylor Street-since we love spening time there. The wait was about 30 minutes-taking no reservations. The food was fantastic and the Chef that prepared our meals was great. Every portion we had was to die for-feeling beyond filled up when we left. Great music, food, drinks, and prices!
