-delicious Italian food -great Italian wine list, but also fun cocktail/martini list -not a huge space, so you may wait for a table They "don't" take reservations, but we got one with a party of 8 on a Sunday evening. If you do have to wait for a table, they will call your phone if you opt to wait elsewhere/get a drink nearby. Dinner was great. Delicious cauliflower appetizer and spaghetti with pancetta. Average entree price was about $20. Out server was attentive and good, but rather loud. Looking forward to visiting in the Summer & eating outdoors.
