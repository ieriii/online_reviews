After I moved out of Wicker Park, and then to Andersonville, I stopped going to Sultan's because it was so out of the way. Time passed, and I started wondering if Sultan's was as good (and as cheap) as I remembered it. Wonder no more. My husband (who has never experienced the wonder of Sultan's) and I took a trip back to sample their delicious foods. Two falafel sammiches (filled with falafels, Jerusalem salad, hummus and hot sauce), a bowl of lentil soup, a side of hummus and two waters. $17 bucks. Srsly? Best falafel I've ever had, hands down. No question. They do their falafel sandwiches perfectly, it's down to a science. Their lentil soup was very good, but I think Taste of Lebanon has them by a nose in that department. Hummus (or should I say YUMMUS) was very good as well. I know if I lived in Wicker Park I would eat here All. The. Time. You can't beat the quality/price of the food. Sultan's easily beats out many other upscale middle eastern joints I've been to...Sultan's will have to be a required stop every time I'm in WP now.
