Along with Art of Pizza, this is my favorite place to get pizza from. If you go between 6-830 on a Friday or Saturday, you'll be in a long line, so it's up to you if you want to stay in it. When I brought my GF, this catapulted to the top of her favorite pizza places in the city. My brother and dad don't care for the pizza and I just can't figure out why. I think they like thin crust moreso than pan/deep dish pizzas, so maybe they were biased from the beginning. My usual pie is the pan with sausage and green peppers. I've tried a few of the apps and they're good, but they just get in the way of the pizza. I like to sit upstairs more than downstairs. Honestly, I can't wait for the next time I go. I do find that when I reheat the pizza in the oven the next, it's definitely not as good. So eat up while you're there.
