Uncommon Ground is more hype than follow through. That being said, I went with friends on a beautiful night and got to sit in the outside patio area. We were at the table under a tree, and despite some spidies coming down to see what we were doing, it was a great spot. I ordered the chicken and succotash, and there was a cheese plate and 2 fish fry orders at the table. My chicken was tender and the skin was crispy, but the succotash was bland and the plate as a whole was pretty small. I understand that with fresh ingredients, you want to taste the food and not just salt and pepper, but I felt a little would have gone a long way. The veggies were mostly raw and tasted more like weeds than fresh veggies.  The service was unfortunately lacking all around. They seemed to be out of menus and possibly short-staffed: that's the only way to rationalize waiting 15 minutes for a coffee drink and 20 minutes for a draft beer to be served :/ The other food orders were pretty good (which is why 3 and not 2 stars). They have a good kids' menu, and the fish fry dishes pleased their diners. The gelato for dessert was large in portion and big in flavor.  I found the price to be too much for what we got and recommend sitting at the bar inside and ordering some food there to save a little and still get the Uncommon Ground experience that seems to be driving the droves there. If you do find yourself here, get the sweet potato fries!
