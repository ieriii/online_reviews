Loved it!! It was recommended by the hotel concierge, so we went on a Wednesday evening! We went to the bar rather than restaurant, and it was such a great choice, very lively and upbeat! Nicely decorated, very welcoming, with both booths and high tables (you can eat at the bar too). Out waiter was very nice and recommended an amazing white wine (can't remember the name, something French), which went extremely well with the oysters!!!!! Delicious, I recommend you toast the bread and put a little butter and salt, and eat it together with the oysters!! Heaven on earth! The desert was amazing too, some pecan pie to die for. A little pricey, but not more than other similar places.
