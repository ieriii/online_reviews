I have to say I was pleasantly surprised after eating at GE. The sweet corn bisque was the absolute highlight of the meal at GE....or any other restaurant this year. It was delectable and creamy with a central garlic marshmallow. So far, so good. THEN, to top it off, the bisque contained Corn Nuts! Who would've thought that? That was the defining moment for me as far as his genius and innovative use of ingredients. The substitution of truffle and parmesan popcorn for bread was another one of his avant-garde calls. The only thing funny was that it tasted VERY SIMILAR to the foccaccia served at Avec. I know the ingredients are similar, just wasn't expecting that. The service was attentive and friendly. Not stuck-up as I was expecting. I want to give GE 5 stars, but.......wasn't a fan of the lobster (sorry, Graham). Don't get me wrong, the lobster was very tasty and the edamame spread was delightful, but the lobster meat was stuck to the shell. It was semi-embarrassing battling the hell out of this dead lobster as other diners glared on. In the end, the lobster won. I had to leave 50% of the meat behind. I know. So sad, so sad. If it wasn't for my experience re-murdering the lobster, I would have given him more stars. Overall great innovative flavors and would go back again without hesitation. Just no lobster. LOL.
