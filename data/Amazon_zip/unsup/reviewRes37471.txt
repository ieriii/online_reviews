Hmm....I had high hopes for this bougie little market/cafe, but maybe I was expecting too much? I got the lobster sandwich, and the tomato basil soup, and my date had the philly cheesesteak. That, with one can of orange san pellegrino (YUM) cost $40!! The lobster sandwich was $19, and the cheesesteak was $12, which I thought was a bit overpriced. Sure, it's lobster, but they put about half a small lobster into the sandwich. I think I may have been more impressed if they used normal sized bread. The bread they used for the lobster sandwich was about an inch thick, and it had two thick slices of bacon in it, which I thought really overpowered the taste of the lobster. Sure it's a lobster club sandwich, but I coulda done without the club. If I pay $19 for a sandwich, I want to taste the best part! The cheesesteak was whatevs. Just a cheesesteak. I walked around the market after to check it out, and it seemed really cool. They had a wide assortment of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, as well as a little deli with all kinds of meats and cheeses. Mmmm. If I lived around there, I would probably drop by pretty often to get some sandwich meats, or cheese for wine, or even wine. They also seemed to have a wide array of cute desserts, which I was impressed by. Very gourmet stuff, which would be nice if I could afford it.
