It's the meat stupid! Which I have to say I like a lot better at Fogo de Chao. This wasn't BAD, I just thought their selection was kind of basic. Heh, funny to think of that for any place that offers like 20 kinds of meat. But if I wan't a hunk of meat, I'll order one. The one thing that did stand out in spice & flavor was the shrimp that my lovely date highly recommended. While the salad bar was good, you're doing it wrong if that's what you're trumpeting about in a restaurant like this.
