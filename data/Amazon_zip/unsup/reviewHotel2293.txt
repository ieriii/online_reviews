This hotel is perhaps the best place to stay for your value. Let me emphasize that I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my time working in Chicago. I've stayed at: Conrad Hotel on Monroe Westin on Michigan Ave Westin on River North Residence Inn on Michigan Courtyard on Grand Palmer House on Monroe This place is still on Michigan Ave, but more like in the middle. It's got Ethel's Chocolate Lounge as a neighbor. You can get to any restaurant you want from this location. I stayed for a full 6 weeks and my room was always clean and neat when I arrived and cleaned well when I returned, and I'm a slob in hotels. When I had a complaint about charges to my room they were promptly taken off without a lot of hassle. Kudos to this hotel. This is where I wish I had stayed all the time.
