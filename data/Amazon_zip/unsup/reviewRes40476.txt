WHAT? THERE ARE NOW LAS PASADITAS THAT ARE NOT LOCATED ON THE 1100 BLOCK OF NORTH ASHLAND? It's true. There are two more now, much further out on the Northwest Side, one more west and one more north. But this isn't one of them. For those of you just encountering the La Pas concept, this Chicago institution used to be the only chain restaurant in the world with all of its locations on the SAME BLOCK. The three originals are still right here on Ashland, and this is one of them.  On to the food: Pico de Gallo - FRESH. With crisp chips.  Veggie burrito: Yummy in my tummy. Question: What's up with the front door that opens up on to the back of a booth seat? If the seat's empty and you're not looking down, the slapstick results could be hilarious/lead to a lawsuit.
