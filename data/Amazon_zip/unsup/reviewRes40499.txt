I went into this place for brunch. I've heard good things. There's a buzz here. The service was very good. The menu appeared very interesting. I ordered the Brioche French Toast, which comes with vanilla ice cream and peach preserves. I was excited. As we waited, we were the only people in the place. I started to think that I've never seen so many people doing so little. It took a little while, not too long, but a bit. Then I got, ONE FIVE INCH SQUARE OF FRENCH TOAST, and a dollop of ice cream! 9 BUCKS. really? It was good. I was done in 30 seconds, but it was good. I went in for a meal and was given one piece of bread, and a $3 small glass of OJ. After I left, I walked across the street to McDonald's and finished eating.
