I have been to this place a lot of times. This is a good place to eat at if someone wants to experience the wonder that is China town. They have an extensive menu, and also a lot of veggie options, which is plus for me. Their food is tasty, although a little on the greasy side. Their service is nothing too great, but that is true of most of the China town restaurants.
