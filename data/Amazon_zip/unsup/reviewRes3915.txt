Great place and good food. I ordered the Baby Bi Bim Bop, which was really like a "normal" bi bim bop that I've had at other places. I think mine was called the Buddah Bowl, or something- it was vegetarian. The person I was eating with had one with meat. I opted for the organic brown rice, which was a dollar or so more, and man, I have never had rice like that before. It was sticky and had a great flavor to it. The veggies and the egg on top were good too. At first I thought I might not have enough sauce because they just gave my one little tiny plastic container vs. other places where I usually get the whole bottle. But, it was plenty and it tasted great. The only downside would be the size of the place and the table layout. It is a small place with seating at the window and three large picnic tables. When we went one picnic table was taken by the owners (?) or managers (?) who were actually being quite loud and annoying- slamming notebooks on the table and talking loudly. Really, guys, not good for business. When we were ready to sit, there was one whole table free, so it was fine. However, you may want to plan to take your meal to go as there may not be enough seating. Overall, great place, good food. I would definitely go back.
