Stumbled upon the Mercat a la Planxa after a long walk down Michigan Avenue. It was a nice quiet afternoon on a weekday.  There were about four other groups in a large beautiful space. Having been to Barcelona last year I was excited! The waiter could tell we were hungry and suggested his favorite. The food came promptly to our table. We took a picture of the salad. The presentation was beautiful! We ordered the Serrano Ham and Fig Salad and Mercat Burger. The red wine onion jam was tasty with the burger. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! We had a view of Grant Park and a statue of a lady holding a lyra. Blackstone Hotel was gorgeous a perfect mix of classic and modern.
