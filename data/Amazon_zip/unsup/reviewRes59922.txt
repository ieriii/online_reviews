I am so fortunate to live so close to this place. The pastries are as good as any I've ever had (but you pay for the amazing factor) and I love the atmosphere. The people are friendly and they offer free wi-fi if you need to get something done in the lounge next door. You will not find a better bakery in the city...outstanding.
