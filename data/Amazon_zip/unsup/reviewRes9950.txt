Disappointing. Have been here a few times and there are too many other options in the city for this kind of nonchalance. Some of the food was excellent but a salmon entree had awkward (only word I can think of) flavors. Seasonal and locavore only works if it is flavorful. Service was perfunctory. Outdoor patio is amazing but needs food too.
