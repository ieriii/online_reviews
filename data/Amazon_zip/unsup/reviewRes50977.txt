Hmmm, I don't know what to think of this place. The concept is good, the menu items unique....both usually good things, right? But after my meal I left with just a "eh" and don't have a huge desire to go back, and don't know why. Service was ok - friendly and helpful with the menu, but not so attentive and often had to flag him down to get another glass of wine.
