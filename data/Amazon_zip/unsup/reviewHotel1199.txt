I stayed here for four nights back in mid-June and had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean and all of the staff that I encountered were friendly and helpful. That being said, I probably wouldn't stay here again unless I was actually attending an event at the adjacent convention center. It's out of the way of downtown and, although the Chinatown L stop is only a few short blocks away, it's doesn't seem like a safe walk after dark or for a female walking solo (like me!). I did like that I was upgraded to a junior suite upon arrival and that they had a boarding pass printing station in the lobby. The free WiFi was hit or miss; you literally had to be a few feet from the lobby to get a good signal. Not a major issue for me, but if you're traveling on business it might be good to know. There is WiFi that you can pay to have in your room for around $10-$15 per day. Next time I'll be sure to stay at a more central location to downtown attractions.
