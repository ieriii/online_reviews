Meat, meat and more meat. It isn't amateur hour, you do not eat salad when you are here. If you do, you have already lost the race, my friend. You eat some freshly made mozzarella, maybe some of the asparagus but you save yourself for the main meal: MEAT!!!! Succulent, warm, delicious meat. It comes dancing to your table, an endless parade of food that plays coy, you choose how much you want and what of. The perfect place for a carnivore! The bread at the table is sooo good, as well as the friend bananas and mashed potatoes. I love coming here, it is something I do once a quarter. The $50 price tag is well worth it. Make sure you come hungry, don't mess around with the drinks.... You have one goal and only one goal: eat as much meat as possible. When I leave, I feel like I have made my money back. They have a lunch special for $30 which is a nice steal! If you have room for dessert, you didn't do your job right and consider yourself a failure at life.
