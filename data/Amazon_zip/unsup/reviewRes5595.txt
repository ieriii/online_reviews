the buzz! had to go. pulled up to the bar and started talking to people right away. 40 minutes in we are still nursing drinks just so we can wait until at least we were hungry... neighbors were wanting to share their beet salad (very good btw) and cheese. We finally ordered a three cheese combo-all fantiastic and all gone. then the bone marrow. nice goody lardy saltiness. then finally some beef tips for dinner. that was really really good. all in all, a great experience, good wine list, and friendly staff. one, gosh we got home to and checked the receipt... our one beer at the end called Saison Dupont was really good, but worth the $13 per glass kind of beer. I would have had another glass of wine!
