I met my cousin in Ukrainian Village, where she proclaimed she was hungover and needed a greasy burger stat. Well, what a coincidence - I was feeling a bit hungover myself. She took me to The Fifty/50, and I've gotta say, this was probably one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Ever. Seriously. Although what I ordered was a vegan burger, I promptly fixed that by getting it smothered in pepper-jack cheese, as well as caramelized onions, shoe-string potatoes (I needed some greasiness), avocado, BBQ sauce, lettuce and tomato. Weird? Maybe, but mother effin delicious, and left me feeling much better than when I walked over. As everyone else mentions, the sweet potato fries were out of this world yummy! We opted to sit outside since the tables were in the shade on a 90 degree day, so I never ventured in. Service was good, and someone was always at the ready to refill our drinks when they got low. On Division, with so many choices available, The Fifty/50 has some amazingly good food. Not sure I'd dig the whole sports bar thing inside, but I'd come back to sit outside again. Hungover or not.
