Anyone that knows me, even just barely, would know that I am a complete sucker for fried chicken. I worship at the alter of Harold's- King of Fried Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz/ . I don't travel much anymore, I live vicariously through eating chicken wings influenced by flavors from around the world http://www.yelp.com/biz/ . I have even been the pusher man to my poor pets (a dog and two cats) who now hover like dope fiends around me as I eat my chicken at home. So it is SHOCKING to realize that it took me this long to come try Crisp. When I lived out in LA I remember having some good Korean fried chicken somewhere along Wilshire and Western. But that stuff ain't got NOTHING on the bird here! "Crisp" is actually the best descriptive word used as the title for a restaurant that I have come across (though I am waiting for an overpriced Michael Jackson-themed restaurant called "Bad"). The skin is done to absolute perfection- which is to say, crisp. I ordered the Crisp BBQ and while it was good, the star of the show was the Seoul Sassy flavor... I feel it important here, out of reverence and respect, to only say this about the Seoul Sassy chicken: go get yourself some and see why I am talking as if I just witnessed a miracle. Thank you AJAY crew for inviting me to this week's installment of the Fabulous, Hungry and Unemployed! Thank you for also showing me the light! Thank you for letting me eat some of your left overs!
