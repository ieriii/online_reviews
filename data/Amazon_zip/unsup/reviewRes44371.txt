I don't usually yelp, but this place drove me to it. All I can say is that this place is a joke. It's the rain forest cafe of sushi. Save your money and go anywhere but here. The food had no love, the music that could have been soothing was some experimental thumping string piece that went on for the entirety of our dinner. When we asked our server if there was something she could do about it she said no because she didn't have the pass code to change it. She then went back to a table where she finished having her dinner. Over all the menu was over priced, the staff was apathetic and the meal could have been prepared by anyone. Stay away and go somewhere where your business is appreciated.
