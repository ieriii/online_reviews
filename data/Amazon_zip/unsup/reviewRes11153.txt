Just went back to piece this weekend and I liked it even better this time! The pizzas are ridiculously huge but VERY tasty and with an incredible selection of toppings. And again, the Worryin' Ale was just so...right. This place moves in terms of having people in there...it's crowded and noisy. But, I'd never see it as anything other than a pizza and beer place...and you kind of expect that. Well done, Piece. I'll surely be back...but only before the hour of 7pm because then you're just asking for a 2-hour wait!
