This was a great BYOB Thai restaurant. The menu featured classic Thai dishes and some new dishes I've never tried. Our service was good and our food was served to us fairly quickly.  I recommend the Tiger Cry and Crab Rangoon appetizer. The curry was good as was the Pad Paak Roum Mit, and Pad See-Iew.  I will definitely become a regular customer.
