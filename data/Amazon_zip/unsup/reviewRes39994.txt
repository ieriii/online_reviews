As I said in my first review, 'I'll come back often' ... and I have! Many times for dinner, once for brunch and several times to sit in their new outside dining area and drink. First advice is: don't come too hungry. The portions are delicious, but small. The burger is heavenly and so is the sausage. The pretzel is good! but I don't love the cheddar beer sauce. flights of whiskey?? Yes Please!! Whiskey for drinking? that too! I've sat at the bar around 5pm when the place was relatively empty and chatted up the bar tender for a while about whiskeys, he was very informative and suggested a few I might like. The eggs benedict at brunch was good (minus the undercooked eggs) and my husband is totally in love with their biscuits and gravy. It also doesn't hurt that Longman and Eagle is the closest dining establishment to my apartment.
