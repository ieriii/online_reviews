When I go to Piece, I begin with a pint of kolsch. Piece calls it "Golden Arm." It's so damned good, such a perfect specimen of the genre, I rarely progress to any of the more hefty offerings. With my kolsch, I usually order a personal-size "white pizza." The base topping imparts a strong note of garlic and offers solid support for any of the optional toppings whether alone or in combination. The chewy bread is my kind of crust. As a space,Piece is kind of a dump and super-noisy even by Chicago standards. But forget that and enjoy heavenly beer and great pizza at modest prices.
