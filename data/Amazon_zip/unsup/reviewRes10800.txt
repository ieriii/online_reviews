Man, you guys really put a dent in my wallet, but I have to say, I could live off your red velvet pancake. Perfect, not too sweet and not too bland. Drizzled with icing goodness and sprinkled with walnuts. It's HUGE, takes up the whole plate! It's not the same reheated though sad to say, always best when it's fresh. BF got an omelet. Not impressed, chicken sausage isn't his thing, and it was a big miss on the ingredients he choose. Plus the eggs were flat instead of fluffy. The "hash browns" are cut up seasoned red potatoes, but I think they're seasoned with something dill and other things, and we were expecting actual hashbrowns, and the seasoning wasn't our style and a little on the salty side on certain pieces. I had a pomegranate mimosa which was good, but small. They're "large" OJ's are small too. I don't know, kinda felt we payed an over-priced meal, but I at least enjoyed my pancakes!!
