Picture this: me, in calf-high black socks, in white Reeboks and shorts, with a slightly worn out shirt asking for a table at the gage during lunch hour. The woman at the front desk gave me a funny look, which I did not notice until my co-worker mentioned it to me when we sat down. Our waiter, Joey, however, was friendly and courteous, so he either did not care that we didn't fit the attire of the usual lunch crowd or was laughing his ass off inside his mind. My co-worker had the fish and chips, while I had the regular burger. My co-worker thought the fries were awesome, and I thought the burger was pretty darn good. The seasoned fries were a great complement to the meal. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and the french toast. My co-worker thought the mousse was alright. I found The gage's interpretation of french toast for dessert quite interesting (they breaded the outside with something crunchy), while it reminded my co-worker of Cracker Jacks. Aside from the attitude, we had a pleasant experience here. Sadly, upscale restaurants are not my thing, but I wouldn't mind coming back here a few times (in approved attire).
