I've only been here for takeout so I can't really comment too much on the service, but the food is awesome. Got takeout for myself, fiance, and two friends the other night. When I picked up the bag of food, it was about as heavy as a sack of bricks. I took that as a good sign.  Everyone but me had burritos, which they all said were very good and were made to their specifications. I had three tacos: barbacoa, pollo, and chorizo. The barbacoa taco was so good I wish I had ordered three of them. The chorizo one was good but after a couple bites, I couldn't really eat that much chorizo (they stuff it pretty full). The chicken was good but fairly standard. But the barbacoa...mmm-tender and delicious. The sauces that came with were stellar - but not for the faint of tastebuds. Pretty spicy - and this comes from a girl who tries to find a way to make just about everything "extra spicy." I didn't find any of them too spicy but others in my group did.   The chips and salsa didn't blow me away but they were adequate. The piece de resistance though, was the horchata. I ordered one to sip on while I waited for our food to be ready. I finished it in about 3 minutes it was that good. I of course ordered another one to go because that's what all normal people do right?
