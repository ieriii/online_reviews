This place is full of contradictions. The furniture and decor inside really looks like it is for the homeless. But the price isn't ...I am not sure I am qualified to say it is authentic or not but I've experienced cheaper, more delicious tacos. For $2.5, you have to pay an extra $1 for avocado. Seriously? I am fine with paying more if the food is good, but in Logan Square, you can definitely find fresh, hot tacos with lower prices. Don't mean to sound cheap here but if you charge people more, at least have some napkins. This is one of the few restaurants in America that make napkins look like gold sheets. The service was terrible. The green sauce was very diluted and seems to be poured out of a mug that did not look very hygienic... The waitress grossed me out when she was pouring that green-ish substance into to-go boxes. Anyway, I won't come here again.
