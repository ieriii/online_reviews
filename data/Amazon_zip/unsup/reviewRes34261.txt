I am a big fan of Italian food but Mia Francesca had an American touch to it, understandable and completely no problem. However, they took it a little to far. We first ordered the bruschetta which had way too much cheese we could hardly find the cherry tomatoes! My boyfriend had a chicken dish for his main and enjoyed it. I on the other hand was looking forward to my vegetarian pasta that was disappointing. Although the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente, it was over- seasoned with salt. I had 1-2 bites and I was done. The worst part about this was how our waiter reacted. He came by when I had a bite to ask how everything was. In the middle of a bite I nodded politely. But by the end when he asked again ( after a bus boy had taken my dish away) I told him the truth and he got back to me saying ' but you said it was fine at the beginning.' wow, really? He apologized, sure, but I was left blank asking myself if he really did just say that. That's when I knew my experience was not worth a return no matter how many free lemon cello's.
