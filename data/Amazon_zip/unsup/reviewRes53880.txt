First night dining during first trip to Chicago; chosen because Burnham Hotel magazine said Bon Apetit touted it as one of 10 Best New Restaurants in America; was not dissappointed.Late dining, crowded/noisy inside, opted for table outside, which turned cold because we were not close to one of the heaters; (we were able to move a little closer to a heater after other diners left). Great waitress, Paige, and sommelier came out and gave us recommendations for other restaurants (1) for the rest of our stay. (We were lucky to get into (1) Schwa and already had reservations at TRU.)We liked the following the most:1.- Amazing deep fried deviled egg on a bed of perfectly dressed arugula with caper berries.2.- Again, perfectly dressed asparagus/hazelnut salad3.-Wagyu sirloin tip with summer beans, cherry tomatoes &tomato vinaigrette ( a third great vinaigrette!)With a Lageder Pinot Grigio, that we started out as a half bottle and ended up drinking the other half.We liked it sooo much, that we went back for late lunch before flying back to Berkeley, (and ordered the Wagyu again, no deviled egg available at lunch, but had the fried manchego/membrillo vinaigrette).Highly recommend this fun place.
