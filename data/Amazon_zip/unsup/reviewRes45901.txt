With a place and menu this size there ought to be something for all. This chain is a huge place, much prettier than The Cheesecake Factory and more efficient. Try and get seated in the giant main room with its OTT dcor. Breakfast is truly good quality (before 2pm weekends) with fresh juices and good range of coffee. When eating for 4, order the baked desserts. They are over the top, quality and fun. Salmon in Miso is a nice lunch entre. Fish and Chips a huge portion and served fresh with vinegar. Burgers are reliable and pastas less so. Salads are huge and can feed 2 or 3. Service is always attentive and all the dishes are explained if needed. Wines are decent but better are the cocktails (although expensive for a chain I felt). Wait on weekends is 40 mins, so beware.
