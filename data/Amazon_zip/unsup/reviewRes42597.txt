Seriously, the food is so good, especially the chicken, like "I cannot believe" kind of good. The only thing I can complain about is the place is way too tiny and people won't get out of their freaking seats even they are done eating. I guess St Patrick Day isn't the best day to go there, well I'm definitely going back there some other time.
