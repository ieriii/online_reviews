Let me elaborate that I am extremely picky and a blatant snob when it comes to steak, wine and vodka. With this being said, I have abnormally high expectations. Last night, wifey took me here for my B-Day. Upon entering, the Host greeted me by wishing me Happy Birthday. Nice touch! In addition, he sat us at one of the better tables. Once again, nice touch. For our entrees, I had the 14 oz. filet, med. rare, and wifey had the "petite" filet, also med. rare. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Most importantly though, the quality was the best I've had in Chicago. I've tried most of the big names: Mortons, Keefers, Gibsons, etc., and this is, BY FAR, the absolute best filet I've had! In addition to the great filets, good wine, and perfectly made "top shelf" martini, the service was top notch as well. Listen, the staff at Kinzie is the most polite and accommodating out of any "fine dining" restaurant I've dined at here. *Unpretentious environment, great service, and unbelievably good steaks! Oh, and to top it off, they gave me a complimentary desert. Kinzie is the best!
