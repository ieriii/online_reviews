This place would be three stars on my list were it not for the amazing decor. When we walked in, I was totally taken away first by the bathroom (which has a communal sink -- very good idea imo), and then by the main dining room, which boxes the booths with wooden doors. My party and I felt very cozy and tucked in at our booth. Foodwise, we ordered the rillettes (pork shoulder-ish jam with toast), the ribs -- which were shaped more like pork chops than ribs, and the mackerel toast. None of the dishes wowed me, but my first bite of the ribs/pork chops were heavenly. Loved the seasoning crusted on top of the pork, though my successive bites didn't have that same flavor for some reason. The rillettes were interesting, though I thought it would be better with more of the blackberry jam -- pork on the toast alone was a bit too salty. Mackerel was kind of strange, with oxtail and pickled pears. A bit of a scattered dish with too much going on. Service was a little surly and distant. Not a fan of our waiter here. Dessert menu, unfortunately, did not appeal to us.
