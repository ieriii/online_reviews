Well, we all know they have the best dogs in town. The veggie dog we had here was by far the best veggie hot dog I've ever tasted. However, they get 4 stars for their inefficient "waiting" system -- they seriously need to implement a Portillo's style drive-thru deal because freezing your ass off in the snow is no fun at all. P.S. BRING CASH!
