This place is usually crowded and there is a reason for that. They serve decent, simple Mexican food, lots of it, they're open late, and there's a huge cross-section of people who go here. On my most recent visit we ordered a pitcher of Mango margarita to share. It wasn't what I expected. I expected one of those cute little pitchers that will fill up 2 glasses twice and that's it. What we got: 4 glasses already entirely filled and then a huge water pitcher filled to the brim with slushy goodness. I did my part, but unfortunately our group was unable to finish the entirety of our alcohol. The quality of everything here isn't the best, but that's not what you expect. It's good, not expensive and will fill up your stomach.
