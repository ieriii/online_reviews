The other reviews I read before I went to Anteprima were right on: DEF get the octopus appetizer. DEF do the prix fixe menu. And yes... some things (ie my halibut) were a touch salty, but it did not keep me from cleaning my plate. I read where someone said the spicy lamb orrechiette pasta was way too spicy, and I did not think that was the case at ALL- it was my favorite thing. The pasta was also really dense and not perfectly shaped, which I love b/c you could tell it was homemade. We had the espresso mousse for dessert which was just okay... not to die for. But I would come back to this place in a skinny second. Service was great. It did, however, get REALLY loud once it started filling up, so that made conversation a little tricky.
