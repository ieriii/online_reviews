Art of Pizza was guaranteed to get at least 3 stars simply by virtue of the fact that they actually delivered to my apartment in Old Town - it took us forever to find a place that would! We tried the pan pizza, and just had it plain since that's my favorite and the boy was getting over a stomach bug. This was the best non-thin crust pizza i've had in Chicago, by far. Perfect ratio of cheese to sauce for me, good doughy, yet still crispy crust. I loved it. We heated up the leftovers two nights later in the oven, and it was still delicious. I can't wait to have Art of Pizza for dinner again.
