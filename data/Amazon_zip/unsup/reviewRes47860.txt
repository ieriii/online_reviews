disclaimer: i got to go to brunch here, complementary, as part of an industry special....so this wasn't a "standard" experience, per se. atmosphere - WOW. big, impressive, many cozy nooks, felt kind of vegasy (grand, bustling, slightly theatrical) but minus the sleeze and fanny packs. candles, wrought iron, wood, glass, fire. all beautiful. food - mimosa came with marichino cherries (i'm a SUCKER for those things). my fellow diner enjoyed the spiced cranberry old fashioned (would get this instead in a heartbeat). the harvest table was such a treat. even with the large diverse selection of items, the quality was not compromised. the mushrooms with the cheese sauce - woah. and the oatmeal?! BEST EVER. service - this is the main reason i knocked a star off. our server, gaston, was a Love, (in the proper noun capitalize that first letter sort of way). the chefs who came by with the hearty selection of meats were all kind characters as well... totally charming. i just wish we would have seen them more frequently. it took quite some time to get our check at the end of our meal. to the point that i was getting tres antsy. i would go here again if i was with a group that wanted something with a "wow" factor, and enjoyed the brazillian steakhouse style of dining.
