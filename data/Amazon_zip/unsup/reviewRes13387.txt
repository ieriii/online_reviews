You say you want a revolution Well, you know We all want to change the world You tell me that it's evolution First thing that caught my eye about this place is how easy it is to get parking right in front of the place so Rockstar parking check! Went here with a crew of hop heads and some that didn't really enjoy beer but the place had a little something for everyone. They even offered a free tour of the place (at the time back in January 2011) they were working on the upstairs as they wanted to start small and grow (very good idea!). Then they gave us a tour of the brewery which is downstairs and walked us through all the key processes which was neat. I personally am getting into brewing my own beer so I always enjoy a tour of the process and a explanation from people that know a heck of a lot more than I do.  Another thing I like is they focus on the basics, in that I mean a Chili Pepper is probably better used on the plate and not in my beer. Focus on making a good IPA and then perhaps find a way to use those ingredients. Revolution defiantly understands this!  Bacon popcorn is AMAZING! It's basically bacon prepared in the fat from the bacon. Yes it goes good with beer!
