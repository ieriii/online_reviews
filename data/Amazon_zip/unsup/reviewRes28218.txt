I've been here several times now and it is pretty consistently good. The complimentary truffle popcorn is amazing.  I would recommend their steak, deconstructed caesar, but stay away from the rootbeer ribs (too sweet and really did taste like rootbeer). They can do a tour of the kitchen after your meal if you like.
