I wasn't expecting too much in terms of service after reading some of the bad reviews here, but we had a great experience. It was our 5 year anniversary and when I made reservations, I made a note of that and requested a nice seat in the house. Upon arrival, we were promptly and warmly greeted by the hostess. She took us to a nice window side table and even pulled out the seat for my wife. So far so good. Then the server came by to greet us and followed up by a nice surprise, two glasses of champagne. As he poured he said, "Happy Anniversary on behalf of all of us here at Graham Elliot." Throughout the night the service was top notch, from their explanation of the menu and dishes to the way the night ended by the serving staff all greeting us good night and even opening the door for us as we left. In terms of food...Heavenly! The food was excellent. We did the food tasting, which was a 7-8 course meal if you include the interim chocolate foam dish which is supposed to cleanse the palate. Yes, the food portions are small but that is what is expected from a multi-course fine dining restaurant. Surprisingly at then end of the meal I didn't feel hungry, but I wasn't stuffed either. But the quality and detail to the food was top notch. Every bite was full of flavor. Every taste sense was going crazy, from salty to sweet, bitter to sour and of course the new sense umami...and boy was some of the dishes savory and delectable. The truffle mushroom risotto was to die for. My wife loved the pork belly and the wagyu ribeye was AMAZING!!!  Because we had such a wonderful experience I had to post something here because I didn't want anybody to miss out on this wonderful gem of a restaurant. It's definitely Michelin star-rated for a reason. We definitely will be coming back.  Thanks to the wonderful staff at Graham Elliot for a wonderful and memorable 5 year anniversary.
