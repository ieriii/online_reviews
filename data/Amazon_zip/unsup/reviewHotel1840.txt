My worst W experience ever. 1. Went to check in at 11 pm, no one at the desk had to call the hotel from my cell (while standing at the counter) to get someone to the desk. 2. Didn't have a food menu in my room. Called to get a menu, after a 10 minute delay they called back to say there was no one around to bring me one. The receptionist had to dictate the menu over the phone. 3. WiFi is free in the lobby and $15/day in your room. So if you want to be comfortable and relaxed you have to pay a ridiculous fee. 4. I was woken up by maintenance work on a neighboring room at 8am on my first day. I talked to the manager and he claimed it was work being done by the city (outside). I disagreed because I had a room that wasn't facing the street, but gave up since he offered no compensation what-so-ever and sure enough on day 2 the maintenance guys were working on the room next door at 8am again. 5. The heater in my room was ancient and barely worked. Fortunately, it wasn't all that cold during my stay. I'm not sure if I'll ever trust the W again, but certainly if you're thinking of staying at a W in Chicago make sure it's not this one.
