Yum! This is a great seafood option in this fine city. We recently ate in the Oyster Bar with my parents and had a great meal and overall experience. The prices are a little high for everyday eating, but it was a great place to go with the parents, who were paying. Everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the seared scallops and they were amazing...so sweet and prepared perfectly. I also tried bites of the crab cakes and shrimp. Everything was very tasty and we will return.
