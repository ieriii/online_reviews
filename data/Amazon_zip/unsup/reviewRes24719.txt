The service here was truly excellent. There aren't really many Costa Rican restaurants in Chicagoland and this one definitely was worth trying. I went with a friend and we shared the Patacones appetizer which were really yummy and not as garlicky as you would think they would be. They came out piping hot and just the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend, who's a vegetarian, got the vegetarian taco which was extremely filling for only $4. I got the Casado and my only complaint was that my steak was a little greasy, but still tasted great. That and the really small seating area merited Irazu four stars. Although I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and had no problem getting a small table for two. The portions here are huge (my leftovers will easily be another meal and a half) and they have a decent number of options for vegetarians.
