I am a vegetarian who loves Hot Doug's. There, I said it. Why do I love Hot Doug's? Because they serve the best veggie hot dog in the world. Two Pete Shelley's with some cheese fries and a diet Coke is pure heaven. Obviously, I can't speak to the meat products Doug dreams up, but my carnivorous friends tell me they are all that and more. So just go, okay? But maybe get behind me in line.
