Penang! Penang! Penang! This is it guys...close up shop. This Thai joint is taking the cake on deliciousness. At first I was feeling greedy upon arrival as well as ravenous. I wanted to share one plate by myself. then I realized that I would like to try different ones and we decided to go family style. We had the penang curry, mixed spicy seafood, and shrimp Tom yum soup. The chicken Penang was by far the most flavorful and creamiest I have ever tasted and the spice wasn't too unbearable. The tom yum soup was spicy and citrus-cy with perfectly succulent shrimps and a medley of veggies. the mixed spicy seafood salad was so fresh and flavorful it made me want to get up and kiss the chef who made it. Thankfully I contained myself and resumed eating. The decor of the place was subtle and best of all , for a nominal corking fee, its BYOB with not one but TWO liquors stores on either side of the restaurant. So picking up some beers or some wine is almost impossible to NOT pick up. The place is very cozy and has a serene feel to it. I am definitely going to find an excuse to come back...because I am a Opart Thai addict and addicts make up excuses...lol.
