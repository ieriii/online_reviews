Good for lunch buffet. Plenty of vegetarian options. Awesome desert (mango ice-cream, rice kheer and gulab jamun when we went). Fresh naan served on table. I only wish they served some special tandoori vegetarian dish to vegetarian on table like they serve chicken tikka to non-vegetarians or else charge less for vegetarian buffet so as to make it equal for everyone. Kinda expensive for vegetarians but nothing too bad. Service was good, ambiance was pleasant. Will return!
