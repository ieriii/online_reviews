My mom has been a fan of this quaint place for years now. Her and my dad have been known to not only enjoy breakfast but also dinner, on the same day, at 3rd Coast.So, when we were trying to find the perfect spot to celebrate her 55-years on this beautiful Earth, we had to go with 3rd Coast Cafe. After setting up the resevation, I recieved a confirmation call from Janet. She suggested we use their baker of choice for the cake - an asbolutely delicious raspberry-chocolate torte.The diverse menu - oatmeal to barbeque sliders to steak - and fantastic wine selection made this the perfect spot for a group of generally indecisive ladies. The restaurant is delightfully unpretentious and friendly to all palates. The food, the staff, the ambiance- all beyond excellent.
