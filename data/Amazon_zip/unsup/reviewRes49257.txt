So you need to impress someone. Maybe its a special occassion, or you feel like getting a little done up? Sounds like a night for Bin 36 First, the place is huge. Sporting a wine/cheeze bar, regular tables, loungy areas, and private sections; it is open and airy with a sophisticated and modern feel. The menu isn't increadibly original, but it is fine dining, and everything is spectacular. They also boast an extensive wine list, including Innuskilin (Canadian Ice Wine). Go there for a great upscale dinner. Or just go for a flight or two of wine and some cheeze. You can't really go wrong with this place if you don't mind paying for it. (Bin36 loses the 5th star because with all that space, my girlfriend and I felt like sardines in a can the last time we went)
