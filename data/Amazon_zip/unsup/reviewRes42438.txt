Art of Pizza, the definition of true CHICAGO style pizza. If you want a taste of the real deal, ART OF PIZZA is where you need to be. Screw Connie's. Screw Giordano's. Art of Pizza will you show why Chicago pizza is know worldwide. I had my favorite (deep dish sausage) and every bite was a pure delight. Stuffed with sausage to the max. A fabulous tomato sauce. Out of this world crust. Does it get any better? I think not.. ...hmm...I'm hungry. p.s. How can you NOT fall in love with a place that has slices of deep dish ready to go at a moments notice!? Swoon.
