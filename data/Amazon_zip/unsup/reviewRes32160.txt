After driving by a million times, and then seeing the positive reviews on "Check Please!" my friend and I really wanted to try this place. The first thing you should know is if you want to bring your own wine, there is an $8 cork fee. No thank you. I walked here, but I think they have parking next door at only $1 an hour, which may qualify for the cheapest Chicago parking. This place is very easy to get to, being right off the red line at Lawrence or the #36 bus line. When you first walk in, the aroma of the food is amazing. We wanted to try several different dishes, so we got the veg/meat sampler for two. The appetizer we chose was the chicken sambussa, which was the highlight of the meal for me. But when the main course came, we were kind of surprised that nearly everything was in a paste-like form. Granted, the beef, lamb, chicken, and carrot/potato dishes were our favorite (I don't remember which we got), and the Missionary's Delight dessert was a winner, but as far as entrees go I think we were expecting something a little more...solid. Service and atmosphere are both very nice (they have sidewalk seating), although during our meal (inside) I had to swat away two gnats. Ew. Also, we were presented with our check before the meal was over. Strange. The lag between courses seemed longer than it should have been with only a handful of other tables occupied. Bottom line, I'd give it another shot, but there are two other Ethiopian restaurants nearby that I might visit before I repeat this place.
