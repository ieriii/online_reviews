I love the food here. It is fresh, healthy, natural, and not too oily. A great option when my stomach isn't feeling up my usual Saturday greasy spoon lunch/brunch. I don't bother when the wait for a table is long because I just plainly refuse to wait for a sandwich. However, I hate the quasi-counter quasi-table service. The system makes zero sense for a restaurant with their level of turnover. It is inefficient and just plain annoying.
