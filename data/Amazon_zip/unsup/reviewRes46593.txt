We came here late on a Thursday and sat right down. We started of the dinner with their buffalo Nachos... pretty boring looking but damn tasey and just takes a little work to get it all mixed up right. I order a Peanut Butter/Chocolate malt also tasty maybe a little heavy on the peanut butter side.  For dinner I got the Hickory BBQ Bacon Burger. Huge, but NOT good. The meat tasted like it was a frozen patty that had thawed and was mushy. The BBQ Sauce was mild and boring, the bacon not freshly cook and dry. My girlfriend had the salad bar, it wasn't bad. I'm not sure either why people rave about it, it's definitely not your traditional salad bar, it has more unique choices which I appreciated but still not impressive. For dessert we did get they're special cookie and ice treat. It was very delicious but it was too much after we had gotten so much food already.
