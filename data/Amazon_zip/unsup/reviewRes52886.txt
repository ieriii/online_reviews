We have been here for dinner several times and came for the special mothers day and fathers day brunch. Every experience has been excellent! The staff are very friendly and accommodating, and there are a ton of items on the menu to choose from. I have tried many of the entrees, but my go to is always the sandwiches. The restaurant is BYOB with a really great covered outdoor patio.
