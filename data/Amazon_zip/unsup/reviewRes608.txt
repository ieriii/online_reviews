This place is the most amazing 5 hours I've ever spent at a restaurant. My ex took me here for my birthday around the opening date. The service was flawless, the food was fantastic. I especially loved the filet of beef that emerged from the eucalyptus leaves. If you want to really, really, REALLY impress that someone you love, this is THE place to take them.
