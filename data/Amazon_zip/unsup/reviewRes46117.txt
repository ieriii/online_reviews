Grand Lux, where do I begin? Well for starters, this is my favorite restaurant, however, I have to be honest: A few years ago, I went to Grand Lux Cafe for the first time and fell in love with it. The food was amazing, although I wasn't really a fan of the Chicken Pot Pie. Even better was the dessert! I declared the restaurant as my favorite and kept returning every time I could. The food was perfect every time. Until recently. In the past three times that I have went, I've noticed a significant decline in the food quality. I get the same thing, Short Ribs of Beef and Shrimp Scampi, so I would notice a change in the food. It just doesn't taste as good. One time, the short ribs were overcooked, another time, the food wasn't seasoned (it tasted flavorless). And one time, my mom order a steak, and Grand Lux, known for their huge portions, brought her a steak about the size of a credit card. Yes, a credit card. So, the food has fallen off quite a bit in quality and taste, however, the dessert has stayed the same (which is why I'm keeping four stars on the rating). I am what you would call a sweet freak, so as long as the dessert is good, you will keep me as a fan. (and customer)
