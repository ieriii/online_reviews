Cannot beat the location, entrance right out to Michigan St. Smiling Doormen made us feel welcome. Beautiful and classy lobby. Check in took awhile, seemed to take about 15 minutes per party but I guess that's just good guest service right? We were in what I believe was the older part of the hotel. Room was very small (which we expect in Chicago), and carpets were worn. Bathroom was very clean and seemed to be more updated than the actual room itself. Old TV (no flat screen). Starbucks in the hotel was convenient. Took forever to get our car from Valet parking but our vehicle eventually arrived without a scratch so all's well that ends well. Planning a return trip to Chicago soon and not planning to stay here. Lots of other places on the Magnificent Mile to try!
