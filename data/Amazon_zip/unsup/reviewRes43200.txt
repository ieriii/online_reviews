I'm really sad to not have liked this place. The environment was very nice and it seemed like it had delicious food (I mean, it looked fantastic). I came here with my sister early morning before the crowd and we got our order in and a table. It became busy super fast (lots of STROLLERS, omg, kill me now) and when we got our food, I was so disappointed. It was bland and nothing special. I had some-type of pancake and it was a bit dry. I don't know if I was expecting too much since I was hoping to go here for sometime. Sis had the huevos rancheros and they were okay, but nothing different from other breakfast places. It was also a bit pricey. I finished my food and was hungry again rather quickly. Coffee was good at least.
