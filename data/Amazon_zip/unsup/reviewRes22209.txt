I went there last Wed. for lunch by myself- I waited 25 minutes and absolutely no one acknowledged my sitting at the table waiting for service. Despite many waiters loitering in front of the TV watching a soccer match. My Greek family ran restaurants for over 40 years and we would be ashamed to treat a customer like this. I left after 25 minutes and I will not go back. Costas
