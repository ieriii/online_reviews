The Good: The spices they use in their meats are phenomenal. I have no idea what they use but whatever it is, it's good. I've been too busy eating and enjoying my tacos and burritos to even wondering what it is. I even had their $25 meat plate which is a steal for how much meat and sides you get. It can probably feed 6-8 people or just 5 bigass people. The burritos are layered nicely and even so that all flavors are tasted with each bite. This place is straight up ridiculous and a must go to if you love mexican food. The BAD: The La Pasadita right next to the largest one. I went to that 1 to try it out since a friend said it was better than the more southern 1 I normally go to. The burritos are smaller and for some reason less tasty. Also the place doesn't look as good or as clean. The UGLY: Parking. It can suck if you go at bad time. They do have parking on the side of the crappier one though but that's usually infiltrated by bums. I had a bum pretty much yell at me in some Euro language the last time I went there while his bum friend was being the Yes man for him co-signing everything he said even though none of us knew what he was saying.
