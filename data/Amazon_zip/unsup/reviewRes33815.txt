I went here during the chicago marathon so it was packed....we still where seated (two people) within 10ish min. On a normal weekend its not quite as busy. Pretty big portions, especially for the money....wow and YUM. I got the corned beef hash with potatoes, it was excellent. Pancakes are good too. The service was great, we sat at the bar and it was very entertaining to watch them cook and serve people. Breakfast and a show? Sure!
