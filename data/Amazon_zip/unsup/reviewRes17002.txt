First, we waiting in line outside for a half hour. Then we were taken into a dark canvas walled cove, much like you would find at the beginning of a haunted house, where we waited for another 20 minutes before being seated. We then were led to our table where we waited for another 25 minutes without a single person speaking to us. We left without having an opportunity to order a drink. I will never go back. Unless you are a masochist with an incredible amount of time to waste, I suggest that you too avoid this dump.
