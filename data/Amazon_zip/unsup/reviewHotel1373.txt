Nice jumping-off spot to go shopping on the mag mile. Our room was fairly big for a city hotel. People working there were really friendly.  They're currently charging $55 for valet parking, but you can find cheaper (like $29 for 24 hrs) if you're willing to walk a block. Note: For this hotel "Millennium" refers to the hotel chain, not that it is near Millennium Park. It is in the touristy Streeterville/Gold Coast/North Michigan Ave. shopping area.
