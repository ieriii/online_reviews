I walked in for brunch and had no wait whatsoever for a table for two. The decor is charming and the staff very friendly and genuine. The menu had many options which made it hard to chose. As we waited for our meal the waiter dropped off mini beignets which was unexpected. My omelet and hash browns was delicious and filling and companions french toast was to die for. Prices seemed right to me. I had to ask for coffee refills but that is only possible complaint. I will be back- perhaps next weekend? to try other things from the menu. Great place for breakfast/brunch.
