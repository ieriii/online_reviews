Well, if you read through the reviews you get the picture. Everyone who actually got to eat here gave 5 stars. Everyone who got the run around and cancelations gave 1. The food is some of the best around. It took quite a while to get in Schwa and we did have one cancelation but for the most part I think we got lucky. Once inside the food is every bit as good as advertised. Make of it what you will. The food was worth the headache to me.
