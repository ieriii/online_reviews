Living so close to Glenn's Diner is great. I can wake up on weekends at 12pm, roll out of bed and they are still making breakfast (all day, in fact). I like the casual atmosphere and the amount of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I've only eaten breakfast there and it has always been delicious except the last time when it took over an hour for my two friends and me to get our food. It wasn't overly busy, after all it was 2pm. The manager finally came over to our table 2 minutes before our food arrived to apologize and said that she was unhappy with how some of the food turned out so they made it again. I did appreciate the apology however when they served our food my toast was charred and inedible. I fault myself for not saying anything about it but I found it ironic after the excuse she had just given us. With that being said, I really like the food. I highly recommend the scrambled eggs with chives and fresh parmesan cheese. My friend said it was the best omelette he's ever had. I look forward to trying some of the other dishes.
