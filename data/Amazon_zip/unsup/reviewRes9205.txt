Love the atmosphere and dcor. Good service. Great food. Only negative - the smart-ass waiter (not ours) who, when in desperation I asked him why it's been 7-8 minutes since the server had taken my snapper to be deboned (at his suggestion), leaving my wife to watch her meal get cold, said smugly and with no effort to find out what was happening, "I'm sure it's almost ready." Nice blow off, jerk. But every other aspect of the service was fine - I'll just be sure to avoid this guy's tables on future visits. The dcor has a great classical Vietnam style to it. Long established restaurants in old spaces can have their own style and vibes, which Le Colonial definitely does. It's a nice feeling, classy but inviting. Somewhat like the better New Orleans restaurants. Some Yelpers have said they love the upstairs, some the downstairs. We were in the bigger room, the downstairs one, and it was fine. The upstairs area is clearly more intimate, but I think we'd be happy either way. And the bar area looks inviting to come back just for cocktails. We shared two appetizers: Tom Cuon Ram: crisp beignets stuffed with shrimp, chicken, vegetables, and an orange ginger dipping sauce, and Banh Cuon: steamed Vietnamese ravioli of chicken and crimini mushrooms, in flat rice noodles with lime garlic sauce. The ravioli was unique, soft- as rice noodles always are, very Asian tasting. And full of flavor. It'll be hard to pass the ravioli on future visits. For my main course, I had the Ca Chien Saigon: a crisp, seared whole red snapper with a light, spicy-sour sauce. It was delicious, moist and tender, just the way great fish should taste, with the extra kick that comes from Asian spices. All the food was wonderful. Wine selection was good. Service, with that one exception, was always attentive and friendly. Everything was wonderful. This will now be a regular stop for us.
