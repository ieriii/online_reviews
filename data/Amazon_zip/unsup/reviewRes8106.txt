Eating at a competitor's last night made me want to wax poetical about Spacca Napoli. How do I love thee, let me count the ways: -crust is puffy and crisp and tastes smoky in a good way -mozzarella di buffalo's saltiness -fresh arugula or basil spread evenly across each slice -eggplant appetizer atop margharita is extraordinary (and got one of Chicago magazine's best things to put in your belly award for 2007) In sum, better than any other thin crust gourmet wood or coal fired pizza I've ever savored in this town.
