Shaw's is one of my boyfriends favorite restaurants. Such a fave that when he introduced me to his parents...we met and ate here. Also, we spent his 36th birthday there last night. Shaw's was very accomodating to our large party of 17. The first time I ate here I was crazy in love with the place. The decor, the service, the food! We took advantage of the 'three course crab dinner'. This is definitely the best bang for your buck here. $40 per person(minimum of two) and more than you can eat. I do have a problem with this place though..and that would be pricing. Last night I got the 6oz fillet and crab legs combo. "the signature". For $53 you would think you would get decent portions and maybe some sides, but you don't. For $53 you get a tiny steak that is nothing like any fillet mignon I have ever had. It was tough(even though it was rare), not juicy, and nothing I like in a steak. The crab legs were delicious, but we only got a few bites. I was left very very hungry. And our service was just 'ok'.  It would be nice if shaw's offered some seafood pasta options. Shaw's is completely overpriced, but if you have the money to do the $40 three course meal...i recommend it.
