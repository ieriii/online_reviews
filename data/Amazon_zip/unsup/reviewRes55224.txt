really good restaurant, ate way too much but that's probably the point. Parking was pretty easy and gave us enough time to stop by wildfire next door for a martini after dinner. The plan then also was to stop by Martini Park but alas is closed. All things considered these days a restaurant has to be REALLY good to warrant a return (with the abundance of options in Chicago) though and Fogo was certainly good enough to be back again.
