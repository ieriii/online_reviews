After doing a bunch of shopping, we stopped into Grand Lux for some dindin. The location was a bit hidden but quite sheik. I was really hungry and didn't want to wait, and didn't have to! I was quite surprised for a Friday night. The restaurant staff had a very prompt system working which kept things moving along. After we sat I observed. I think working in restaurants for years has made it impossible for me to visit a place and not critique. The place was huge and the bus staff could bus tables in a matter of seconds, pretty impressive! The waitstaff was a little less impressing. Our waiter was very nice and very young so I forgave him for not knowing what a Manhattan was or what Knob Creek was but he also didn't seem very informed on the menu. Honestly, it must take quite the memory to be able to be informed on their menu, it's GINORMOUS! Already curious about the decor it was the menu that made me realize this place had to be owned by the same people as the Cheesecake Factory. Now as for food, we ordered a bunch of tapas and then some steaks for dinner. They have fried pickles! That's always a plus in my book, although, they weren't the best I've had. However, everything else was really good. The steak wasn't the bomb dot com but it was pretty good as well. Overall the place was pretty legit. It wasn't top notch but it wasn't mediocre or bad by any means. I enjoyed my dinner and the environment. My only complaint would be to liven up and enlighten the staff on their products. OH! And don't bring the bill when I want another drink. Thanks :)
