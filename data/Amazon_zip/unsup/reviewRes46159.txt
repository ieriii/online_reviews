What happened to Grand Lux? Its been a few years since I last dined here but for some reason I didnt recall it being like Chilis and Applebees. Our appetizer of fried pickles were good but then it kind of goes downhill from there. My table was sticky we had to ask for it to be wiped again and then my friend saw her bread saucer and totally refused to put her bread on it. she asked for a new plate too. ok.. well... we're here so lets eat. fish and chips looked extra fried hard and lame, nothing special, i had the ahi tuna burger which was pretty good. my other friend got a "rustic" pizza that came in an odd squared oval shape. it looked bad from the jump but it was actually so bad that she had the leftovers packaged and then decided not to take them. she said it was already soggy and not good. The beignets were good but not "order these first because it takes 30 minutes for them to cook" good. they tasted kind of heavy and though i love sweets could not eat more than one. one of my friends recommended the place and we all agreed the service was blah and the food was blah so in closing i would like to share the words of my friend's email to me this morning... "Someone please select the restaurant for our next evening out; I don't rate that place very high anymore :-( "
