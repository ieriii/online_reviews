The food is hit-or-miss, and with great breakfast places in the city (sweet maple cafe, m henry, or big jones), there's no reason to ever hit this place up unless the environmental spin is important to you, and even then, there are better places in the city that provide local fare. Also, the customer service is decidedly lacking, but it seems to be more of a problem with management than the actual floorstaff. Upon being seated, we were given 3 menus to a party of six, and were told they'd try to find us some additional menus because they "always run out of menus when the patio is full." I'm not really uppity about these things, but I kind of wonder, if it's a persistent problem....why not print up more menus? Also, be warned that according to our server, it's against restaurant policy to split checks for groups of six or more--regardless of how many cards you are trying to pay on (meaning that if it's a party of 12 and you attempt to split it down the middle on two cards, they won't accommodate). I get it that it is obnoxious to ask a server to split the check on several different cards and there's definitely a point at which it becomes ridiculous, but there are plenty of other eateries in the city who won't mind splitting the check in half for you :)
