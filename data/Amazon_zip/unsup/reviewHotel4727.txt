How is this considered a 4 star hotel? Please explain....The rooms are so small, no bar in the room, no coffee machine, the room can hardly fit the bed and a small chair in the corner. The gym is even smaller than the rooms...its 100% not considered a 4 star hotel, I would rate it 2.5 or 3 at most.Very disappointed with Hotwire for making me pay so much for so little.
