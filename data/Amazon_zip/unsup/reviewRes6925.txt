Sorry bro, gonna be a downer on this one: really, really not impressed by Chicago q. 1. It didn't seem overly busy, but the service took forever. If your restaurant can seat that many people, you should be able to offer all of them service without a long wait. Oh well. 2. Hush puppies: maybe they just aren't my thing: tasted like fried cornbread. Didn't get any real "jalapeno" or cheddar taste. Don't think I was that drunk, so unclear where these flavors were. 3. Kobe brisket: HOW CAN YOU HAVE DRY KOBE BEEF??!! Yeah, it was dry. And not very tender. I do not understand how that is possible with Kobe beef, but there you go. Sauces were fine, nothing special. 4. Everyone is all like "oh mac and cheese mac and cheese." Honestly it tasted like all other mac and cheese: a creamy roux with some added cheese tossed over noodles and baked with a bread crumb topping. So yes, compared to Kraft, better, But at a place like this, nothing special. 5. Coleslaw was good. 6. Good beer selection. 7. Free pickles and chips are nice, but fill you up. So there you have it.
