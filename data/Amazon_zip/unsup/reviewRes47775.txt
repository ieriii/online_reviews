Beautiful space & interior. I think this is a place where you go for more of the experience and atmosphere than the food. Loved the various cheeses, soups, bread, and side dishes at the harvest ( i think thats what they called it) bar and the fact that they had fish on the menu too. I haven't gone back since I dined here last summer, but would love to check out the outdoor patio/lounge when the weather gets nice!
