I asked some friends to go with me to Bon Soiree after finding them in the A La Card deck that I got as a gift. Of course I read the Yelp reviews, and they we totally on par. I was really impressed by the food, by also by the service. I got a call a few days before the reservation from someone at Bon Soiree, who was checking in to see if any of my quests had any food allergies or dietary needs. We were going for the No Menu dinner on a Sunday (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED). I thought that was extremely thoughtful that they would plan ahead around our needs. They also suggested some places in the area that could help me with a wine pairing if I was searching, since it is a BYOB. The service was just as accommodating inside the restaurant. We were seated on time, wine uncorked and onto the fabulous meal. Everything was the perfect mix of flavors, and the right amount of food. In fact, I was really hungry from not eating most of the day and it was plenty of food to make me feel full and happy! I would think it would best for a date or small group, since it is a smaller restaurant, and has a nice private feeling. As a note, if you are a picky eater then maybe the Sunday No Menu dinner would not be for you. I frequently have ordering regret, since I never seem to pick what I actually want, but turn into a health food nut when I look at a menu, so it was perfect to not have to make any decisions. I would definitely go again!
