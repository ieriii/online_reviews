INEXPENSIVE-CASH ONLY-BYOB Reliable food, good service. My daughter loves the huevos rancheros, the other daughter & I like the enchiladas suizas (you can choose your sauce-ancho, mole, or green & your cheese-white or yellow) and the chilequiles with tomatillo salsa and eggs. My husband likes the huevos americanos and the enchiladas suizas and the combination plate. Nothing particularly exciting here---very reliably good food though. Notably, Breakfast is available during ALL hours that they are open. Also good are the nachos dias, puerco asado, chilequiles, and the fresh pico de gallo, made on premises pickled jalapenos, fresh tomatilo salsa. I don't care for their mole, but my husband likes it.
