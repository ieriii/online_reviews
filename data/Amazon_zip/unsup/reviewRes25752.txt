If you like a pan pizza with a thick (at least 0.5 inch) doughy bottom layer of crust, little cheese, little sauce, tiny outer crust/edge, then this is the place for you. I'm not a fan of these types of pizzas with the thick bottom layer of dough. I like a good sauce and would like my pizza to have decent layer of it, but this one had little. I had a sausage, pepperoni, green pepper, and onion pizza. The sausage was ok and came in big chunks (up to 2 inches long), the pepperoni was large but thin, and the veggies were decent size and good. Their caramelized crust was like taffy in texture, nothing special. I felt that the pizza simply had way too much dough on the bottom. I, too, heard much hype about this place, I just didn't care for it.
