If you're extremely hungry, and have a sudden desire for giant servings of meat or fish, coupled with salty, gooey soupy sauce to dip bread in... then Greek Islands might well be your sort of place. It's not really my kind of thing, so I can't really give it more stars than this, but if you want homely food that "sticks to your ribs" in a very satisfying way, then this will do the trick nicely. The place has a great, lively atmosphere: warm, busy, fun interior, friendly waitstaff, affordable wine menu. I had the salmon and my friends had the whitefish and the lamb; all of these dishes were huge servings of beautifully cooked fish/meat, complemented by over-cooked vegetables. So, what I gathered from this experience is that they seem to do meat and fish very well, and vegetables not so well. The artichoke side we had was just 2 artichoke hearts absolutely soaked in what tasted like cream of mushroom soup, for example. My salmon came with steamed broccoli and steamed cauliflower, a rather boring addition to the plate, I thought. But if in doubt, just dip some more bread in Olive oil, and all will be well.
