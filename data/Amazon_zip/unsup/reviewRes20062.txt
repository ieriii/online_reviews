Oddly enough I was her twice this week and enjoyed my time. The atmosphere is nice and the waitstaff is fairly attentive. They do have a wide array of specialty beers at premium prices but at least the selection was good.  I had fish and chips which were good although nothing outstanding. My dining companion had a french toast which was also good although I think mine is better.  I would probably go back if I was in the area for a drink with friends or for some networking. Maybe some of their more exotic dishes are better- I saw some elk and venison dishes.
