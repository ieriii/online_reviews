My wife & I selected Shaw's to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We had been to Shaw's on previous special occasions such as New Year's Eve, where we had a great dining experience. Our evening was off to great start when the host wished us a happy anniversary,and escorted us to the booth that we had requested in our reservation. Beyond this point, the inattentive and unfriendly nature of our waitress marred the evening.This server never introduced herself by name, rarely checked in on us, and two times we had to remind her about drink orders that we had placed. The wine, appetizers, and entrees we ordered were enjoyable, but the distant yet abrasive demeanor of this server put an damper on the evening. Needless to say, we were disappointed. We'll be sticking to Catch 35 or Hugo's Frog Bar for our next comparable dining experience.
