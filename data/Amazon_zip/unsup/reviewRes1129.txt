This place is a keeper!!! Doug himself is doing the greeting. Hot Doug's doesn't deliver the typical dog. Nope, far from it. You know you're on to something when the businesses slogan is "The Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium" or at the very least in for an interesting ride. It didn't fail to deliver. When you think of dogs, do you honestly think "Portabella Mushroom and Swiss Cheese Pork Sausage with Blue Cheese Dijonnaise and Shiitake Mushrooms sauteed in Duck Fat" come to mind? How about "The Mountain Man Sausage (A damn tasty combination of Elk, Venison, Buffalo and Antelope) with Smokey Bacon Dressing and Vintage Van Gogh Cheese" dog? I've had both and was worth the stop. To think no one thought to do this at the hot dog stand level. Amazing, rich & full of flavor. I've had these on other visits: "Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel" & "The Atomic Ribeye: Damn Spicy Ribeye Steak Sausage with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Crispy Fried Onions" and both fantastic. I wish I had thought of this!!! For good measure, french fries cooked in DUCK FAT (off the charts good). Only small things are the waits can be long. Hot Doug's is cash only as well, so you won't need to have your plastic with you. It isn't often I get to this part of Chicago (at least as much as I would like). The hours would make a banker blush (Mon-Sat: 10:30AM-4:PM) but he, if it's still open, he's doing something right. Keep it up!!!
