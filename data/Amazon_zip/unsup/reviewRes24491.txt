i lived in costa rica for a bit and having a costa rican restaurant in chicago definitely gives me a taste of being back in san carlos. i would say that the food is not as good as it was when it was being made back in CR, but it does the job. Plus, its great to know there is a place in chicago that I can purchase costa rica's famous sauce... Lizano salsa. YUM! give it a try just to have a taste of something new.
