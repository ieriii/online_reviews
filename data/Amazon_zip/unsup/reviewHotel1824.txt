We used this hotel for the girls in a wedding party to get dressed. This place has beautiful architecture and decor which allowed for many great photos of the bride and her bridesmaids. They were even able to give us a day rate which gave us access to the spacious room for the time frame that we needed. My only complaint was that staff, possibly a manager, roped off a staircase once she saw that we were taking pictures in the lobby. Maybe she thought we walked in off the street? Anyway, we did get plenty of pictures.
