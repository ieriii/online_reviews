It's always good when I'm looking over a menu and think "oooh I want to try this next time... and this... and this... ooh and I have to come back and try this!" Echoing over reviews, great fresh and delicious food, excellent service, food came FAST but very fresh, and immediately brought our white wine a bucket of ice. No complaints, and many intentions to return.
