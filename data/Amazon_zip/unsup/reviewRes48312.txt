I've been to Publican three times so you gotta be thinking I must love it. I don't know. I love great beers and so any place that's got a superb beer selection (and they do) is on my radar. Having recently been "hopped" out in Oregon--Gawd do those guys love their hops!--I needed a few malty Belgians (ooo, now THAT sounds kinky!) and Publican has more than enough to choose from. And I appreciate that. I really do. But do they have to charge the price of an entree for them? I suppose they want and need to weed out the grungy beer geeks that don't go with the decor but I find their prices borderline offensive. That said, I keep going back so obviously one can overlook the price-gouging for some quality pig and wonderful beer pairings.
