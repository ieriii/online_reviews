I was a little disappointed, but not enough to never return. The falafel sandwich was very delicious, just as everyone else says, but I thought we got kind of crappy service. Maybe they were just having a cranky day. I felt rushed through the line and unable to ask any questions about the menu. I also agree with a few other reviewers who said that the hummus was bland. It was just kind boring!
