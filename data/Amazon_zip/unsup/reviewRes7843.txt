Tips on Fogo de Chao: 1. A week before going to Fogo de Chao make sure to eat very light, lots of salad no meats as to prepare your body for full the Fogo de Chao experience. 2. Go to you doctor and make sure you have your meds (Lipitor, Vytorin, Alli or whatever) so you can enjoy the full Fogo de Chao feast without stressing out about your health as you are pigging out 3. The salad bar is a distraction! But if you must, please tread lightly as you will be full and not be able to complete the full Fogo de Chao meat marathon. 4. More distractions! Cheese puffs/bread, fried polenta, those delicious glazed fried bananas and that mashed potatoes! Evil! I always fold for the cheese breads! Call me weak! Remember to order one of those Papaya mousse concoctions after your meal which will help digest all that meat. By the way, lunch is about $30 and the food is the same if you can pack in all that meat at lunch without going into deep food coma at the office. Good luck there. Favorite cuts: Picanha, Filet Mignon & Bacon Wrapped filet mignon, parmesan crusted tenderloin, beef rib eye. And don't forget the Capirinha cocktail. Obrigado.
