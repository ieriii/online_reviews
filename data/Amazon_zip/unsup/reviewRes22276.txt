[12:00PM] (Boss) Hey, I'm ordering Irazu. Would you like something? [12:00PM] (Me) I don't know. Let me look at their menu. [12:05PM] (Me) I guess I'll just have a steak burrito. Thanks for lunch! 1:30PM - Food arrives (1.5 hours later?) 1:45PM - I finish my burrito (Tasted okay. Nothing to write home about) 2:00PM - Profusely vomiting 2:15PM - Yelp review Pass. EDIT -- I'm bumping this review up to three stars because the business owner contacted me to express his sincere apologies for the problem with my food (and was able to do so politely and without violating Yelp's rules about that sort of thing... Something few people are able to do.). I don't feel that my particular experience was completely the restaurant's fault, as it's probably pretty tough to keep food-borne illness away from food when you're delivering in 100 degree temperatures. 3 stars for now. I'll give them another shot in the near future and re-evaluate the review at that point.
