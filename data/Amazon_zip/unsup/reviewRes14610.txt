Dining at Sabatino's is like going back in time when going to a restaurant was a special experience. This place is quaint yet not overbearing or pretentious. I feel they would treat a guy in a suit and a guy in nice jeans and button down shrt the same way.  The pizza bread as an automatic starter is nice change of pace and delicous. What really amazed me were the side dishes. Usually those are just okay but at Sabatino's they were incredibly delicious. We definitely plan to go back and even might drop by the lounge for a drink now and again.
