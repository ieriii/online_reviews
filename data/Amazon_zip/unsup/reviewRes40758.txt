My favorite restaurant in Chicago.... hands down. Low key, no frills restaurant, that really cares about the food they put in front of you. Unique flavors, Japanese inspired. Plus its BYOB, can't beat that. Highly recommend it to all you vegetarian gourmands out there. Like me, I'm sure you get NO love at french restaurants. If you're tired of paying $25 for a fancy plate of Mac n Cheese, you seriously need to go to Bonsoiree. They don't just substitute the meat with some sad vegetable. No. They create a dish for you. Make sure you tell them your dietary restrictions when you make reservations, and they will more than accommodate you.
