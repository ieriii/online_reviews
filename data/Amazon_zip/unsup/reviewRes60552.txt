This is one of my favorite places to eat at. It's clean and really shiny inside! The inside is really beautiful. They have a room in the back left that has beautifully painted walls and a great view of Michigan Ave. The bakery is really nice with a glass case where you can see all the amazing looking desserts as you walk past. The food...where do I begin? The potato spring rolls are the best. The shaking beef is amazing, the strawberry lemonade is great, and the desserts are soo yummy. The best are the chocolate chip pecan cookies, the apple crisp, and the deep dark fudge cake. The only negative is that the floor is really really slippery and the wait for a table is long, but the amazing food makes up for it.
