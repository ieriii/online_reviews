Meh....I've had better. Plus what a disappointment coming from the people who run Avec and Blackbird, honestly I expected more. First off, some of the food just plain wasn't good. What was decent, I usually could think of somewhere else I had gone to that cooked it as good or better and for less. For instance their mussels, they were fine, but Hopleaf, Bistro Campagna and Bristol all do it better....
