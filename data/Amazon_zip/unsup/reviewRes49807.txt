The food here was very good, great flavors and a vary eclectic menu. If you're looking for bar food, go somewhere else. But the portions are tiny and the prices enormous. Everything is a la carte, so be cautious of the soup and salad that is offered. The wine selection is very nice for those who have the palate, but otherwise, I wouldn't return. Come for the wine, leave before the food.
