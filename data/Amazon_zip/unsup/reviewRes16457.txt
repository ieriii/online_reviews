Well, Violet Hour, you could have received many more stars than this if you hadn't left me and my friend waiting outside for ONE HOUR while also not admitting anybody else! Believe me, I am patient and understand you have to wait to get in to bars/clubs sometimes. But the manner in which they handled (or didn't handle) the line was something I've never seen before. A girlfriend and I decided to start our night out at the Violet Hour on a Saturday and got there around 10:30. There was a decent sized line outside that only grew as we waited. The first problem was, the bouncer was rarely even outside. He would come outside, look around, try to act important, check his walkie-talkie, and then go back inside without addressing anyone. Second problem, they were not admitting anyone, which I found ridiculous considering the fact that every time the door opened, the place looked so empty. We decided to leave as did numerous other people waiting outside.  I'm sure it's a lovely place once you get in but I honestly can't think of what would make that strange hassle worth it. Given the loads of other options in the area, I prefer not to spend my night standing outside for something that "might" be cool.
