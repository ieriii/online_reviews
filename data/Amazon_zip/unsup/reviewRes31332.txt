I dined at Sunda with one of my best friends over the weekend, and had a first-rate experience. This was just as good as the first time (last summer). We were greeted by a warm and friendly staff upon arrival, which was fantastic. Often times, you go to these hip and trendy restaurants, and the host staff ends up being complete jerks who are more in to themselves, than actually providing great service. This was not the case at Sunda, and I really appreciated their professionalism. Within minutes of being seated, we were offered a complimentary small chicken and mushroom salad (delicious). As for starters, we ordered a couple of Dim Sum dishes: soup dumplings and oxtail potstickers (good, but the least favorite part of the meal), as well as the longevity garlic noodles and baby bok choy. We also ordered the Oh No You Didn't hand roll, as well as the garden vegetable sushi roll. If I could have re-done anything about what we ordered, I probably would've dropped the oxtail potstickers and swapped it out with the chicken and mushroom shu mai. We didn't have dessert this time around, but I've had a couple of dishes before, and remember really enjoying it. The service was impeccable. We never had to ask for any water refills, and as we finished plate after plate, the server assistants were there to seamlessly remove it from our table. Overall, the meal was fantastic and the service was wonderful. Without a doubt, this is my most favorite "Asian" restaurant in the United States and I will undoubtedly miss it when I move out of the Midwest and back "home" to the Pacific Northwest.
