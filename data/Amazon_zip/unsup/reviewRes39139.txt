We had brunch @ Longman and Eagle for easter, and boy did it make being away from home quite dandy. Recommended to us from some good friends, they suggested the chicken and waffles. I cringed when told the suggestion as I just tried it for my 1st time in WI a couple weeks earlier and found it not the most appetizing combo. But with much dismay I ordered it and it was fantastic! My man got eggs benedict which he loved and the service was great. Side note: Our receipt came with "Their favorite Yelp Review Yet" on a postcard. Which had a review from Yelp stating that the place was dark, gloomy and noisy and asked who would eat bone marrow & wild boar using the word yucky to describe it. And even said the place was not for them and that it seemed so awkward. HAHA! GREAT marketing idea Longman! If you're only going to print these kind of reviews mine won't make your next post card as I loved my experience.
