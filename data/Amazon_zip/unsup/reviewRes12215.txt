I can go on and on about their white pizza. Get the large, you will eat for days...that or you can share. :) If you don't care to wait an hour for a spot in the restaurant, order take-out right next door and pop into one of the nearby funky boutiques while you wait for your pie. The stores are usually open til 7-8ish during the week.
