Honestly, this is really a 3 star hotel. I gave it the additional star because the concierge gave us a magic card that put us at the top of a VERY long wait list at Yolk for brunch the Sunday of Labor Day weekend. Fairly recent renovations, decent check-in staff, Bliss amenities..... We had two "Superior" rooms. Tons of room. Nice bathrooms. I typically stay elsewhere when I'm in the city, but it was great for what we were doing. We did drinks and apps at IPO, the restaurant in the hotel. The service was EXCEPTIONAL. Everyone was very helpful. The drinks and apps were great. I'd definitely try some dinner there next time I'm in town.
