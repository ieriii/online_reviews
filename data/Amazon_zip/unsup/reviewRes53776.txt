Great place to hear old (and new) school jazz. Points given for excellent atmosphere, great music and a decent beer selection. Points deducted for a sometimes snooty staff and certain clientele who seem to feel above the place itself. Often the crowd can feel touristy. Show up early enough (8:00 when the set starts at 9:00) or you'll be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the socialites. A great place...I just wish it were a bit less known to the trend-seekers.
