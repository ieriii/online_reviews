Food is better than good, large menu selection and a lot of side dishes (what I love). The meals are authentic and the value is excellent. The cost is lower than a lot of other K-restaurants with the taste being just as good. Somewhat of a dive, parking is not friendly. Food taste and value is what keep me coming back. The kalbi is awesome, ji-gae, and soups are tasty. The best part is they have late hours as well.
