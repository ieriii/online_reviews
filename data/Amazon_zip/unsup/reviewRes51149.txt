I have NEVER given 5 stars on Yelp. But I can be honest to say, GREAT experience. Starting from the phone for reservations-good. Arrival- nice people, seated immediately, great lil spot, cute and cozy. Immediate service! Nice TEAM working here- together. The liver pate- nice! Cornbread- now common, it is cornbread- how could it be that great- IT WAS! not dry, just nice- sweet & moist. The sweet tea- EWWW, definitely sweet- but good. An amazing blend of flavor, well done. Did get the special of the night- a batter fried fish, which i do not ever eat battered fried anything- but it was good. The dessert- my guy DESTROYED it. Citrus cheesecake. Our Wait staff- just great!
