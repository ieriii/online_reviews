small bustling place in the middle of downtown chicago. seats available on tables, communal tables, high tops facing the kitchen. i came here by myself and luckily had a seat immediately by the high tops facing the tiny kitchen. got to see how food was made and executed! got the fried pigs ears and bone marrow. pig ears were delicious!! cut super thin and fried to crispy goodness. i wish they were a bit thicker to get the full texture of pig ears. served on top of generously salted fried kale and topped with sunny side up egg. love the piggy bowl it came in. bone marrow was ok. not a big fan of it. it became overly greasy for me (maybe bc of the pig ears as well). spread on buttered toasts, sprinkle of sea salt, and some crunch from salad. lovely presentation. dessert-i really wanted to try the silician, rec by my friends...but they didnt have it. got the salted caramel soft serve rec by the waitress. i love a good salted caramel dessert....this one was ok. they had a mix up on who ordered it..so it was sitting by the counter for a little until i told them i think that is mine. was a little melted but that was ok. didnt have a full caramel taste as i wanted. sea salt was delicious. i would imagine a place like this to add candied bacon on top...but they wanted to watch the weight, i suppose. overall, i liked the menu. food can get a bit toooo greasy but it tastes good. i want to go back to try some of their salads and other piggy dishes!
