I've been going to Hot Doug's since early 2005 and it seems like as every year passes, my desire to go lessens. I think people need to start focusing on the food rather than "Doug" to start getting some honest reviews here.  For anyone new to Doug's, you would swear that he is some sort of God-like figure... people walk up to that counter with nervousness and admiration. Everyone seems like they have to "consult" with him on advice. Questions like, "Do you get that new (insert indie band) CD" or "Where did you go on vacation?" Just order your damn food and maybe the line would move and it wouldn't take so long to order. I was there this past Saturday and there is now a line out the door at 10:30! Why? On paper (the website) all the food looks so good. Foie gras, blue cheese, wild boar, etc. But, when you sit down and eat the food, I'm always left saying, "Why?" Why did I just wait an hour for what is simply a sausage on a bun. No matter if it's boar, elk, ribeye, pork, it just tastes like a sausage on a bun. His gourmet condiments sound better on paper than they taste. Usually, when you are happy with a restaurant you are looking forward to coming back, but I don't get like that with Hot Doug's. Hot Doug's is simply overrated and all hype. It's like the hype you have waiting for an iPhone or a PS3... You open the box, take it out, and then it becomes just a thing on your desk... all that anticipation and then realizing it's no big deal. I'm done being part of the crowd of people that would rather ask Doug what he had for breakfast than actually start going their for the food. Matt
