As everyone else has said... the bacon popcorn is great. The flavor isn't too overpowering and its not too salty. Definitely going back to try more food (than beer) next time. That is not at all to put the beer down... I was very fond of everything I tried, especially the BA Baracus (extra points for a highly creative name). They will answer surprising questions on the brew tour... all you have to do is ask. Great time... too bad I didn't know about this place when I had easier access!
