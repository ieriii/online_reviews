Sophisticated bbq with a reasonable price tag. ahhhh-mazing! They give you pickle chips and potato chips dusted in cinnamon as nibblers, I had to restrain myself from eating all of the chips. We ordered the hush puppies with the spicy dipping sauce and they were marvelous, it was a sad moment to see them all gone. I am not much of a meat eater so I ordered the bbq chicken sandwich with the poblano cheddar cornbread. Let me warn you, THE SANDWICHES ARE HUGE!!! I ate about 5 bites of that tender chicken and had to stop because I wanted to hold out for dessert. Also, it is brilliant that they give you 4 different types of bbq sauce to try with your food; I like having options... My only complaints are that the cornbread was not all my heart had hoped for (but it was good enough), I ordered a cocktail instead of one of the great beers they offer, and that I did not get the cookies and milk; these are all errors I plan on correcting the next time I frequent this gem. (this will probably be pretty soon). Service was fantastic, the ambiance is refined but welcoming (felt like I was at a southern country club with the Kennedy family eating in the private dining room next to our table), and the whole meal was less than $40. Yes, you read that right....
