A fantastic hotel top to bottom. I stayed here for a few nights when I was working a conference at the McCormick center. The room was sleek and modern without being cold. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. I wish my house looked like this. I got a free voucher for breakfast and took advantage of it every morning. The Dana Breakfast (eggs benedict with smoked salmon instead of ham) was amazing. The fruit smoothie was only okay, but good for breakfast on the go. I also ordered food from room service and it was very good. The door person always remembered my name (even days later) and was very friendly. Overall, I experienced great service. Finally, I took advantage of the spa for a hot stone massage. My therapist (Dana) was nice but not chatty and totally professional. It was a good massage, but not the best I've ever had. However, the price was lower than I am used to paying in SF, so I was satisfied. I really would recommend this place for anyone looking for something in this area of Chicago. It's chic, not expensive, and really nice.
