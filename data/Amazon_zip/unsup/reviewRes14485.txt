We can welcome another great brewery to Chicago.  My friends and I went for dinner and drink on a Friday night and were happy with our experience. First of all the food is great. I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was very good and was topped with spicy coleslaw. Yum. One of my friends got the burger with the egg on top (can't rememebr the name) and she loved it too. Now, let's discuss the beer. The Eugene, named after Eugene Debbs, is a great porter. It is well balanced and complex but not overwhelming. The Workingwoman Brown was also impressive. It is a typical brown but with a touch of hops. Very good. If you like dark beers you will not be disappointed. If you are a hop head, this is not the place for you. The pale was not too impressive and you really couldn't taste the hops. However they have some great guest taps and a good bottle list so you can find something you will enjoy. If you haven't heard of the guest taps the servers are very knowledgable.  The atmosphere is great. Good lighting and nots of space to sit and stay a while.
