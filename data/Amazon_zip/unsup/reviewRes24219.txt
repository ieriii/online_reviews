I am not going to pretend that I am any kind of expert on Szechuan cuisine, but the food at Lao is mouthwateringly tasty, kick your butt spicy and leaves you craving it for a week after your visit. I just ate there for the third time yesterday and it just keeps getting better and better. We ordered the Szechuan chicken, the salty pan fried pork, the boiled beef and pan fried noodles. The meat in all of the dishes was tender and tasty and most came in a sauce that I could've just eaten alone over rice. The impressive part is that each dish has its own distinctive taste, rather than a lot of mediocre Chinese places across the city where everything tastes pretty much the same. Even the spicy cabbage freebie that they give you is so addictive! My friends and I love spicy food and they definitely do not mess around at Lao....when they say spicy, then mean crying hot! On our last visit, our noodles were so hot, not even water or rice could stop the inferno. Just a suggestion--unless you are a native or have no sense of pain it might be good to order food "medium".  In addition to the food being absolutely delicious, the restaurant is nice and clean, the food is reasonably priced and the service is decently attentive and pretty darn friendly (especially for a Chinese restaurant). If you like spicy and Chinese, this place is a definite must!
