Pho was ok, not the best I've had in Chicago nor anywhere else! The best was in Vietnam, then Virginia, then CA. I got pho tai (rare meat but become medium/fully cooked in the piping hot broth). The broth color is darkish, and the basic aroma is there. It just didn't hit the spot for me. The pho itself was decent, meat was ok.The bad: I also ordered 1 LARGE pho to go  -- and it pissed me off that they didn't give me much at all. While I ate in, a large is HUGE. When I got home and opened the to-go Large -- it was SMALL and PATHETIC looking. It looked even smaller than the "small" portion at the restaurant. Also, they barely gave me any veggies/beansprout w/ to-go order. Seriously, 1 mediocre stalk of limpy basil, 2 toothsaw stalks, and about 20 bean stalks along w/ 2 skinny slices of jalapeno pepper? COMMON! At the restaurant, you gave me a plateful of veggies for ONE portion. They didn't pack the rare meat well because the blood get all over the "pho". YUCK! Please at least tightly wrap the meat so it doesn't spill everywhere onto the noodle.! Finally, I found a hair inside the noodle when I opened it. One disappointment after another. I deducted 1 star for the take-out experience. The place wasn't very crowded on Thursday night (10 people total) The atmosphere was informal, brightly lit cafeteria style. They have a lot of options on the menu, but I just ordered pho and spring roll. Spring roll was decent.
