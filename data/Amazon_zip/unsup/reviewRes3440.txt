So its interesting... to say the least. Not what I expected, but I guess you could call it fast food korean?!  I guess the place sorta confused me, but my sister and I had the rice bowls they have and they were pretty good. Ingredients are fresh and there was a TON of rice in them that we coulda split one. Definitely on the pricey-er side, but you pay for the quality of your food.  Overall I enjoyed it, not sure I'll go back a whole lot but its something different every once in a while. If you're into asian food or non traditional this is definitely a place to try and let me know what you think;) I feel like to give a more accurate reading I should try it again sometime so we'll see what happens:)
