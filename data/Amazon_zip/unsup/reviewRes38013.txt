This place is really neat, but the overcrowding was a vibe killer for me. I had some garlic fries which were tops. They also have the best selection of beer I can remember seeing since I've been in Chicago. My favorite part is the name: Hopleaf. It just really makes you wanna get in there and drink. Too bad it's so small and popular. I guess if they had less patrons they couldn't provide the stellar beer selection they have, but still -- the space is nice. There's a grad student crowd kind of crowd -- not bad. Pricey, but if you want a reliable place to drink and try something new and that'll knock you on your feet, get to Hopleaf right now. I'll definitely return. And that area of the neighborhood is really neat -- great atmosphere.
