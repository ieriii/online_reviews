I was expecting amazing and to say it fell short was an understatement. There are so many great places in Chicago why settle for poor service.We had a really early reservation, and of course, in typical fashion, you can't sit until your party is there - even though the restaurant was completely empty due to the early weekday time and there were no seats at the bar - ok, not accomodating but their policy, I'll let that one pass / get over it.We sit down and order drinks. They come out correctly. My friend tries her drink, decides she doesn't like it, and orders another one. We weren't expecting it free - it was a mistake on our end. But the waitress removed the first drink with a huge attitude and without asking us (at which point we wrongly assumed they were being accomodating) and brought out a new one but charged us for both. We didn't mind paying for both but within the group - someone would have drank the first beer. Basically we were completely ripped off - poor showing for such a supposedly high caliber place.Our waitress was unfriendly and disappeared frequently coming back smelling of smoke (or worse) blatantly obvious as she leaned over the table to explain the menu. We are non-smokers but it ruins the ambiance.The food was decent (although I don't recommend the pot-roast option - really fatty which I guess you can typically excpect from the type of meat) but not worth the less than pleasant service experience - the other Michelin's are too good to settle for this one.
