My fiance and I love this place! They have a wonderful menu and their service is always good. We especially like to request Rafi - he always remembers us and chats with us. He is great! If you aren't having steak, a great option is their grilled chicken parmesan. It is light but really hits the spot and fills you up. They also have a nice seasonal prefixed menu for $20! Also, one thing they don't really mention to you is that you can sign up for a VIP card for free. After you spend $250, you get $25.
