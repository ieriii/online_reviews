First time here on my birthday for lunch! They lost two stars because I was looking forward to the Bison Burger for days and when we got there at noon, not long after they open, they were "sold out" of it. I get that it might be a rare ingredient but it's highlighted on the menu so you should be prepared for a lot of orders. I'm willing to redo the review if I go back and have it. Points for the free birthday toffee bread pudding. It was awesome. My friend had the tomato bisque soup and it came with adorable grilled cheese croutons. points for creativity.
