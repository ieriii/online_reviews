This place is great. My wife and I ate here for the first time 8/17 for dinner. 6 pm reservation and not very busy. Our waiter, Ivan, was just fantastic. Very knowledgeable and attentive. The assisting staff were also very attentive. We ordered a raspberry and a coconut mojito for our cocktails and they were very good. We had the Ropa Vieja for a appetizer and it was outstanding. Very flavorful with a little bit of heat. Enough for 3 people. My wife had the Peruvian style chicken which was large enough for two people. The chicken and side veggies were very good. I had a corn chowder that was a special for the night and it was the best corn chowder I have ever had. Sweet corn and a very creamy stock with jsu a hint of chile heat. I ordered the grilled skirt steak as my entree and it was out of this world. It came with rice and beans and sweet red onions, topped with a chimichurri sauce. This whole dish was great but the onions made it outstanding. Did not have room for dessert. Cannot wait to go back.
