I. Love. Wilde. Just the right mix of adorable gay servers, beautiful old-Irish pub decor, the perfect pour of Stella, and rich, delicious food.  My husband and I come here for all occasions--date night, brunch, entertaining out-of-town guests, birthdays, etc. Even his conservative parents love it (but non gay-bar fans beware--the club remixes of broadway songs kick in around 11 and give the place a much different vibe). Come early enough to get the full menu. I always either get the fish special, the mussels appetizer (heaven!) or the meatloaf, which may very well be the best meatloaf I've ever eaten. Plan to take food home. The portions are huge. AND leave room for dessert. They have weekly special ice cream pies that are TO DIE FOR. And the turkey burger! It's available both regular hours and on the late-night menu and it is heavenly. I actually prefer it to the regular beef burger. Overall, a wonderful place. You'll spend some money, but you won't feel cheated. Yum Yum YUM!
