Superdawg is worth the trip. You need to experience a real, live drive-in hot dog joint. The drive-in (restaurant/ movies) is nearly extinct, which is too bad. It's a throwback to a simpler time, but also, there's something fun about having a meal in your car, brought to you by a carhop. Aside from nostalgia, the food is surprisingly decent. It's all made fresh; my only quibble was that my burger was on the greasy side. Crinkle cut fries were good; and the hot dog itself - pure beef - was one of the better ones I've tried. My husband dislikes both hot dogs and fries: here, he sampled each and liked them. That is saying something. We're on the fence about the green pickled tomato, though. For me, the friendly service from our carhop earns 5 stars. She talked to our daughter, and went out of the way to find us to return a plastic dinosaur said daughter had dropped. Unasked, she also brought us extra napkins, knives and wet towelettes. (She is a grandmother, she explained, and knows from toddlers).  The whole experience left me with warm fuzzies.
