The Amalfi is a very nice hotel. my wife and i spent my birthday downtown wining and dining. we then retired to the Amalfi Hotel. it's a very nice stay. the room was different than others. they've added a lot of nice touches. the only reason i am not giving it another star is cause i really like architecture. i wanted more. Italian contemporary can really be wonderful. we got free drinks at 5:30 and the drinks were great. the bar atmosphere was not there. i had already imagined what the hotel would be like from their website and i wanted a swank, fancy bar. the breakfast was specacular. great choices in coffee and breakfast items. very kind and helpful service at the front desk. again, the front desk could have been a real beautiful room. it is my disappointment and not their short-coming. the Amalfi's rates are considerably more reasonable than the Peninsula or the Four Seasons. honestly, stay at the Amalfi before you go to one of the larger chains, if money were not an issue, i'd stay at the Peninsula. cheers
