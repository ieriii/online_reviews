This is NOT Bucca di Beppo, people. The portions are huge and fresh, which is both why the food costs so much and why it takes so long. It's real Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere. Bring your own bottle of wine and you can bide your time. Bring two or six and some good company to help you down it, and you won't even notice time passing! This neighborhood is about quality, so learn to enjoy it. Because Ravenswood's so isolated, it's a great find for anyone in the city looking for a quietly romantic meal with weird art surrounding you. But yeah -- don't go on a Friday or Saturday night. Then it's packed. Caro Mio is run by authentic Italians who make the pasta by hand. So when things take awhile, you'll know why. Still, I agree that things do tend to drag on. You will get seated right away, but after the water comes out, the bread takes awhile. Then you dump on the olive oil and fresh garlic and grated parmesan and wait to be waited upon. It kinda sucks. But I drink my wine like it's going out of style, so I don't really notice. They bring you a bucket to chill it in and uncork it for free. These touches eventually even out the cost of your and wait for your meal. I do think Caro Mio could benefit from use of some spices, but whatever they're doing now is definitely yummy enough to bring me back. And OH MY LORD are their desserts good. TIRAMISU!!!!!!!!!
