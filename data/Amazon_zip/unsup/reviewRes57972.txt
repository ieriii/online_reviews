I agree the management is horrible. I've came here on a Sat. night when the place was busy (not to long ago) and was treated horribly by a male host only to sit an hour later after I had reservations. They simply didn't care we were on a time schedule. It was very upsetting when were leaving to find the manager leaning against the bar chatting with the host and staring at his feet. No goodbye have a good night! I probably will never be back at this location as I found Taylor Street to be very attentive.
