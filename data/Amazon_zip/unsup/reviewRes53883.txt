Given the prevalence of dining opportunities in Chicago, I found it offensive that they don't accept table reservations. I have dined here before and it is not worth waiting an hour and a half for a table. In short, you are better off taking your dining cash to another place that values your time and allows one to make a table reservation like the rest of civilized society.The hype is just that, hype.
