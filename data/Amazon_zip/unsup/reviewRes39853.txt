I can't seem to not order the chicken and waffles- they are absolutely amazing. The chicken is tender and juicy- skin, fried to perfection. The hash they include as a side used to be my favorite part of the dish. Unfortunately, it's just not as tasty as it used to be?!  The service is also something to rave about. Brendon is always a riot, especially when serving up whiskey!  My only regret...haven't had the chance to try the dinner menu out. Soon, I promise.
