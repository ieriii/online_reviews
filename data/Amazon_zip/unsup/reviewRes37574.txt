Very cool bar in Andersonville, a ton of different beers, but beware, many of them are higher in alcohol than what you may be used to. If you're feeling adventurous I would recommend cabbing it back and forth, and bring a note with your address to pin to your shirt for later so the driver knows where to dump your body. Start with the hardcore Belgian Ales that borderline on wine and then end with something light and easy, that's my advice.
