I recently revisited Milk & Honey after it fell off my radar for some reason. Anyway, I was not disappointed. A friend and I split the huevos rancheros and granola with yogurt & fruit. Now usually I think granola is overrated and that it's pointless to buy granola in a restaurant when I can easily have it at home with little to no effort, but my friend really wanted to try it so I didn't say anything. Milk & Honey proved me wrong here! The granola is very very good, and filling, and the yogurt is also awesome. I have to say I wasn't blown away by the huevos rancheros, but the granola made up for it. We also had fresh squeezed OJ (so good) and cafe au laits, which were made very well. They do have a nice spread of alcoholic drinks available as well - I can't wait to try their bloody marys and mimosas. I suggest going early or late on the weekends (avoid the 10-11 a.m. crowd) if you don't want to wait.  The place is small, so waiting for a table is kind of awkward, but not awkward enough to make me stay away.
