Great environment for groups or a date. The service was attentive and knowledgable. I ordered a cab that the server recommended. I wasn't a fan, and he switched it out for a different wine.  Peaches and burrata: delightful. Charcuterie plate: had a wonderful variety. Steak tartar: ground with an over medium egg on top. Melts in your mouth. Salad with crispy pig ears: Wonderful combination. Blueberry fool dessert: Devine. the bacon pieces in the cream were a nice surprise.  Digetif and limoncello were also delicious. Overall, fantastic restaurant. Highly recommended.
