Yuummm. I came here back in Feb for my birthday with some girlfriends, and needless to say, we were not disappointed. We ended up consuming FAR too much food, but it was so worth it! One of my friends and myself had the shortrib dish, among many other appetizers, and both of us wanted to lick the plate clean. The rest of the girls thoroughly enjoyed their food and would definitely come back - it's a great place for a group or just one-on-one.  Looking forward to going back sometime soon!
