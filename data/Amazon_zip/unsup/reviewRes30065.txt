To put it simply, The Chicago Diner is junk food veg food. It's pretty much a mecca if you're of the herbivore variety. I had such a hard time figuring out what to get; everything looked so delicious when I looked at the menu online--the pictures are drool-worthy. My server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu to give suggestions (not to mention, cute, to boot). But I settled with the BBQ bacon cheezeburger with sweet potato fries. For the former, I've had better, but it wasn't bad. The latter? Well, SPFs rarely let me down. Their desserts are something else. I ordered a slice of cake, not knowing how much I had to conquer. I have a decent appetite, but this was just too much--not just in portion, but in sweetness. I had it boxed up after a few bites, which barely made a dent in the cake, and ended up dumping the rest once I got back. The PB and chocolate, hockey puck of a tart (not its formal name), however, was heavenly. There's so much to try that it requires repeat visits to fully appreciate what they have to offer. That said, my tastebuds were satisfied enough to propose another visit.
