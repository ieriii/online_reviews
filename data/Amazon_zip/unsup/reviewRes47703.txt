This is only a review of their brunch.  First off, it's a bit pricey at $25 plus drink, plus tax and tip it'll easily hit around $35 per person, but this is one of the few places that is worth spending that much on brunch. Everything, and I mean everything was delicious. That is no small feat considering the number of dishes they bring to you and the vast array of choices available at the buffet area. Everything was obviously high quality, and they definitely take pride in their preparation.  The atmosphere for brunch is pretty laid back, and I really enjoyed it. It looks like a pretty hip place during the evenings, but I haven't been there for anything other than brunch. In fact, I'm not sure if I'd be hip enough to have dinner there. I whole-heartedly recommend Zed451 for brunch. Give it a try.
