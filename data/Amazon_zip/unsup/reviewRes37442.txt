One word: unimpressed. We went here on a semi-busy weekday night to check out the famous beer selection. The card-checker was rude, and then nobody came to take our order. Maybe that's the way it is at Hop Leaf, but I got the impression that there were one or two servers going around. We had a round and left...probably never to return.
