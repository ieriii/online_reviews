i was recently introduced to pequod's last year by a co-worker and i boy am i thankful. i always get the pan pizza which comes with a carmelized crust. HEAVEN! it's a little more puffy/doughy than you might expect, but they don't get cheap on the toppings. with pan pizza as good as this, who needs deep dish?
