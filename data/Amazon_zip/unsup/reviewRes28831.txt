Pequod's was ok. I noticed it while sitting in a bookstore across the street, and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was fun - both booths and tall tables to choose from. The service was also quick, attentive and polite. They had a good beer selection as well. I was disappointed by their pan pizza, however. It was advertised by Pequod's and by readers on yelp as a 'deep dish' pizza. However, I found that the only thing deep about it was the crust - there was a lot of bread with very little cheese and marinara on top (not what I've come to expect from a deep dish). Also, the veggies on top did not look or taste fresh, although a second pie with only cheese tasted a bit better.
