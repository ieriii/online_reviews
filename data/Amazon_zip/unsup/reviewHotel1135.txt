i should start a blog... adventures at the fairmont chicago. today, no room cleaning. i called housekeeping, and the guy tells me i must have left the privacy sign on the door. no, it's still hanging on the back of the door where i left it. can i just get some clean towels... please? really hoping the laundry i sent out this morning shows up. otherwise, looks like i'll be going to dinner in my sweats... or naked. *sigh*
