If you like Middle Eastern food, you'll probably like this one. It's super cheap with good size portions of things like lentils and rice for $2, and Falafel sandwiches for about $3. I personally love the falafel here and always have to get it. I tried their egg pie and a friend tried their meat pie. The egg pie looked a bit too oily for me, but wasn't bad (pretty cheesy) and the meat pie tasted pretty darn good (I might have to get that with the falafel next time.). I would have to say the food, price, and the area are really good here. If I lived in the area, I would be a regular.The negatives are that parking sucks in this area. I hate looking for parking here sometimes because it's near the 3 way crossection. Another negative is that it lacks of the caffeinated drink selection (There's only two foreign caffeinated drinks there.). So if you're a junky like me, it's a downer. There is a starbucks a few steps away, so you can get your fix there. It's still definitely worth it to go- they DO have the best falafel in town.
