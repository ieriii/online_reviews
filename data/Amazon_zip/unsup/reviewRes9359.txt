The tasting menu is where it's at. Oh, and the cocktails, too. Unfortunately, the cocktails rendered me unable to remember everything on the tasting menu, and it's not on the Sprout site, so... You'll just have to trust me. This was one of the best meals I've had in quite a while. The service was friendly and laid back without that fine-dining tight sphincter. Some highlights: the pork rillette, the split pea & something soup, the Sazerac cocktail, the Vodka cocktail (I swear that's what it was called), and the potato & chocolate ice cream. Really, I loved every single thing except maybe the beef dish. But with ten courses, who cares?
