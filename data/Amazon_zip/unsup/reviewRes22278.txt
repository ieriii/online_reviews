My first time being at a legit Greek restaurant and I couldn't been more satisfied. We had the family style dinner there which features a lot of different foods. It was perfect because I got to try a lot of different Greek dishes and it helped me decide whether I like Greek food or not. The verdict: I love Greek food. It was delicious! The service was very good and food was coming out very fast even though the place was pretty packed! All of the food tasted fresh, flavorful, and well prepared. I will return!
