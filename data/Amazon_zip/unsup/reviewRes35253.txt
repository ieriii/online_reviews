When dining in with a friend, for a filling, delicious, wallet-friendly meal with diverse tastes, order: (1) Any of the "Barbecue Over Rice" plates (one per person). In addition to the barbecued meat(s), each plate comes with a small amount of greens (such as bok choy or gai lan, a/k/a Chinese broccoli), half of a salted egg, and rice. Most of these plates = $ 5.25. I recommend the roast pork & duck; and (2) Split one order of wonton dumpling soup (they'll give you two little bowls to divide the soup). You can get your choice of some meats in the soup, including five-spice beef tripe. Price = no more than $ 6.00 (for one bowl of soup, so if you split it, it's $3). Hot tea is free. Service seems to have gotten friendlier recently.
