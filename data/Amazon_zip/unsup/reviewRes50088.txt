This place is solid. I've been here for a couple of times for drinks (for two birthday parties) and each time I enjoyed myself. They have great deals on bottles and the place gets crowded but not the feeling someone's sweat on your arm kind of crowded. The music is good (but that could be because it was Zeen A.'s friends dj'ing) and it's usually a pretty diverse crowd. All in all, it's a pretty chill place that is easy to go for a drink with oddly good nachos.
