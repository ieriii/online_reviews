It took us forever to find the place cause it's so hidden. Apparently used to be a speakeasy? From the outside, no name/title or anything, just a cement wall with a sketchy-looking door with a red light ontop of it. However, inside is totally opposite. Very dark, sexy atmosphere. Pretty crowded, and a bit pricey, but good drinks (cocktails about $12). I wouldn't really come back for drinks, but definitely for atmosphere/ambiance.
