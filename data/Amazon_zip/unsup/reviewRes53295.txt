To call Hot Doug's a Hot Dog Stand is an insult. It's an encased meat emporium filled with some of the most unqie tasting meats on the planet enclosed in thick sausages. If you come here for just a Hot Dog you're going to dissapointed with the 30 minute wait.Spend money here, it will be worth it. $12 for something that looks like a sausage might seem like a lot but you're getting some of the most unique taste in all of America. Not 100% what mine had in it but I know there was Crayfish. I also tasted my buddies Foie Gras and another buddies Boar and both were great. Hot Doug's lives up to the hype and it's honestly one of the best places I've ever eaten in my life. Duck Fat Fries are great as well.Hot Doug's is a treat and with it's long lines and limited hours you need to plan your trip in advance.I don't have too much experience here but I'm sure everything on the menu is great. Doug is also always working and is a very personable man.Is Hot Doug's the best tasing food I've had in Chicago?It just may be.
