Good food, great beer selection, friendly staff, reasonable prices. If you like cheese, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get the cheese curds. I'm sorry Culver's, but you've got nothing on these chewy, perfectly breaded nibblets of awesome. If you're feeling youthful, try the PB&J. The Lindemans Framboise jam is is fruity and tart and (dare I say it?) so much better than that Smucker's nonsense. And it comes with fries.. and it's only $5! Is it weird that I get truffle fries with a PB&J? I don't care! Try those too! Vegetarians... the veggie burger is actually pretty good.. and you can get it on any of the burgers! Though that's a little easier said than done because a lot of the burgers are topped with other varieties of meat... still, good to have that freedom. So sad that they're only open for lunch on (Thursdays and?) Fridays.
