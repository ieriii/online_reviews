Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... Yup, I ventured back for the food and it is at best ordinary across the pork chop (bland), steak frites (over salted fries), mussels and (was it?) duck Reuben. It was also very ordinary to be sat at a table for four with five in our party. Whilst, the beer range is extensive it is not cheap and does not have a good representation of local and WI/MI beers. The highlight of the night again was the doorman (greeters actually greet) and his staring blankly without a word at 'customers' as they left was gold. I think he has confused Hop Leaf with hottest nightclub in LA. Yes, I have a copy of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment at home and do not need to take it out at night to read between checking ID's to give me some type of hipster cred. If you are looking for a good beer range, welcoming service and good food try Fountain Head or Uncommon Ground (Devon). Or a nearby friendly with a solid beer range and hipster free option hit Acre, Hamburger Mary (mainly brewed on premises) or less beer range McIrish - Lady Gregory.
