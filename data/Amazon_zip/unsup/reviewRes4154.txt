I had the best meal of my life here and tell anyone who is even thinking of going to Chicago to try to get a reservation. I went about 2 1/2 years ago, before Schwa went on temporary hiatus, but it sounds like the caliber of food and service has remained the same. In an effort not to repeat the other reviews, I'll just point out two awesome things about my experience at Schwa. First, my husband is vegetarian and the chef easily and graciously accommodated his dietary restrictions--even changing one of the courses for him. Second, our server thought we were running out of wine halfway through our nine courses and actually offered to share some of his wine in the back with us. HOW AWESOME CAN YOU GET??? We actually had some wine hidden under the table, so we were set, but I was really touched my how generous our server was. I had heard all these stories about Schwa employees being snotty and rude, but I found the exact opposite to be true. And, as all the other reviewers have pointed out, the food is exquisite. Believe the hype--Schwa is hands-down the best money I have ever spent on a meal. Also, as you might know, Schwa is BYOB, so do yourself a favor and head to Sam's or Wine Discount Center and ask the employees there to pick a nice white and red to go with your meal. They'll hook you up!
