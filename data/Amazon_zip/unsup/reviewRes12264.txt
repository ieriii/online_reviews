would have given it 5 stars, except that it's such a long wait to get in on the weekends. not their fault i know, but you should be aware that you can be facing a 1-2 hour wait on friday and saturday nights. the pizza is amazing. best in the city. the beer is amazing as well. all of it is good. they really are one of the best brewers in the city. don't even waste your time with the goose island crap. this is real beer.
