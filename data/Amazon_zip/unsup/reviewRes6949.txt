Me: "Is it reasonable for two people to share the q3 (3 meats, $30) and a couple of sides?" Waiter: "Yeah, a lot of people do that" Me: "Ok, we'll do that" 10 minutes later, two large plates of food arrive, each with our selection of meats and we are suspicious that we may have gotten two q3's. We dig in. A few minutes later, the waiter comes by and we thank him for separating our shared q3 for us. What's that? He ordered us two of them? Completely scammed by our obnoxiously smug waiter, I felt pretty peeved at this point. But not as badly as later when I got home. We had plenty of leftovers and asked them to box it up for us. When I opened the box later, there was only about half of what we hadn't eaten! They got rid of our remaining brisket and pulled pork. Livid, I called the manager and explained our situation and she took one q3 off my bill. This is a nice gesture of reconciliation, but still: be on your toes! To be fair, the food was delicious, the sauces are delicious (though the vinegar one was perhaps too strong even for me, a vinegar lover), and the house made bread & butter pickles and bbq chips they give you to start the meal are killer. Nevertheless, this place is obnoxiously expensive, and I can't imagine myself at Division & Dearborn again with a craving for BBQ that I can't extricate myself out of the Gold Coast to satisfy.
