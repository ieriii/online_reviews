Tuesday night, hour wait, sit in the 'lounge' type area, have a beer, maybe an appetizer.. OR just have your dinner there which is what we ended up doing which was perfect. My divine friend and I split a pizza with duck and a huge salad. Ok that is one of my all time fave meals- salad & pizza. and I am not a crazy fan of pizza, mostly because I am not a big fan of dough or lots of cheese (2 very important ingredients with pizza, yeah?) But this pizza! Thin crust, light on the cheese (besides it was Gorgonzola or something delicious like that..) so good. I am not really a fan of duck typically, but on pizza I was converted. It was delicious.. And the salad was fresh and bright! The waiter was really nice and attentive without crowding us. The restaurant itself looks kind of cramped, so I was happy to just lounge in the 'lounge'.. Also, so I am not a beer drinker typically, I just don't really like it, except stouts.. love a good stout, but so rich, so heavy.. Revolution does not do half pints. HOWEVER!! They will do little flights, a little glass of beer. It was perfect! Loved it!! Its more of a grownup place than I am used to. Everything is lovely and wooden and it definitely caters to the Logan Square contingency of home owners that are psyched to have a nice yet casual place to go for dinner.. And Revolution delivers this well, to be sure.. The menu is super meat heavy, and really heavy hearty meals.. I am hoping there is a new summer menu on its way otherwise I wont return probably until next winter.. but I really enjoyed it last night..
