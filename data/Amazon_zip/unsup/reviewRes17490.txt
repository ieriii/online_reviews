by far my favorite indian restaurant! though it's a more upscale and pricey indian restaurant it's WELL worth it! delicious and plenty of food! i have to agree that the naan and sauce they bring out to you before ordering are sooooo good! you really can't go wrong with a zagat recommended restaurant!
