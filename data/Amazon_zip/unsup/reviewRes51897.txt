Hands down the best Deep Dish pizza in Chicago!! I saw this on Man Vs. Food and I ended up getting the Meaty legend pizza! From what I remember, it has bacon, sausage, Canadian sausage and ham. It was wonderful! SO much flavor and the crust was beautiful!! I love biting in to this pizza and the crust was a cornbread like texture. Simply amazing. Warning you only need to order a small if its just you and one other person. I made the mistake of ordering the Fried ravioli and salad. Both are wonderful but it took up space in my belly that I couldn't make it to the second slice of pizza. FYI- Try to order the pizza right when you sit down. It takes about 45 minutes to make. Most deep dish is like this.
