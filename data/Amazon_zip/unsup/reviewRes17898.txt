Know going in that you will wait in line. Much like the Hot Doug's debate, is it worth the wait? I would say if you go here early to start your night it's great. The seating is intimate and the decor is Tim Burton-like with old chandeliers and large drapes. The cocktails are what make Violet Hour a must visit. I had three of my own and tasted many others. I started with the Sasparilla Sling, moved on to A Little Bed, and finished with El Diablo. I'm not sure if it's because I was already two cocktails in but El Diablo was possibly the best Margarita I've ever had. I also had samples of the Tattooed Seaman, The Orchard, and The Short Bus which were also amazing. Two other outstanding things at Violet Hour are the ice cubes used in the glasses. For shorter glasses a giant, round piece of ice is used whereas in taller glasses a long, rectangular piece was there. I also enjoyed the sidecars that came with certain drinks which just made them last that little extra bit. Look forward to coming back here many times.
