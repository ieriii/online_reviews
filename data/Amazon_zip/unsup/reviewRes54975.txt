Food here is amazing, definitely a great experience. Eating here is somewhat like what I would imagine eating on Top Chef to be like, you dont get to order but the food is so good it doesnt matter.  The venue is pretty small so book reservations early as they fill up quickly especially on weekends. A bit pricey but the fact that its BYOB is nice as it allows what is usually the most marked up thing to be purchased cheaper. Overall a great place.
