I bike past Wishbone on the way to the Loop daily, but stopped in with my dad and wife the other night. Other posters have chimed in that the food is fairly simple fare, but it's fresh and our waiter was great at steering us around the menu for the fresh veggies and healthy options. There's a discount for bikers who bring in bike helmets during the week and I noticed signs for both family nights and "adult swim" after 7 p.m. to keep the noisier children out of the restaurant in the evenings, which is great.
