OK I get it now. I am a convert. I have seen the light. Thus, I must go back and refine my relatively negative review to a "hell yes". Their thin crust is pretty weak, and I stand by that. But I finally had the pan. O lord the pan...WHOLE different ballgame. Lots of nice tangy sauce, good crust, but the real kicker is that carmelized crust. WHOO! Granted I had the pan in the Morton Grove location, but I assume it is the same here. It completely kicked me where I wanted to be kicked. Plus they have Fat Tire on tap, which always brightens my day just a little.  See Pequod? It took me awhile but I came around to your charms.
