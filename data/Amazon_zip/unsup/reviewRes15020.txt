My expectations for Revolution were a bit high. I just visited a bar with fabulous food, friendly clientele and was expecting the same from Revolution. To be fair we only had a salad and dessert, but both were just ok. Some of the clientele were a bit too cool for school, and it gave the place a not too welcoming feel. On a different note, the beer was fantastic! I had a really yummy dark beer and my friend had a tasty Pilsner like beer. Overall, I'd go back for the interesting beer selection, but not for the dining experience or friendly feel.
