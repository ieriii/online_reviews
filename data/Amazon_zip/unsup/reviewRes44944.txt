Deep dish pizza made fresh (or at least I assume so because it took about 40 minutes to arrive--though in all fairness, they warned us.). We had one deep dish pizza and one regular pizza. On a quick trip to Chicago, it's perfect to be able to eat some Chicago style deep dish pizza. The sauce is on top and the cheese and toppings below. The crust is really buttery, which is not my favorite, but for a bit of pizza and a different style, it's worth it.
