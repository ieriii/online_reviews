I have been going to Sultan's for years. I think I go there mainly because of the price. The falafel and taboulle is good- but again, the price makes it better than an okay. I get a little skeeved out by the salad bar- and that is after the remodel! Last- I cannot stand it being cash only-it was not always- but they have an atm in the restaurant? Tacky.
