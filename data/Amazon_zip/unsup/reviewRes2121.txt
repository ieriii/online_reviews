I haven't had a dog here since around when they opened and I ate meat, but man.. it was delicious. Now I stop in for perfectly done fries (not on duck day). The veggie corndogs get thumbs up from everyone I know whom as tried them, and my family is crazy about the duck fries. Friendly staff, good service, really fun environment. Avondale is Proud of its own cased meat emporium.
