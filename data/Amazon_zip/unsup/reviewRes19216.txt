I love this spot for a business lunch. I have been multiple times and have never been disappointed with the food nor the service. It is a little on the pricier side, so I prefer to go here when it's business but I have spent my own money and not felt bad about it *wink*. The booths in the front are the most comfortable seating mainly because the tables towards the back are on the small side and smushed together pretty close. It's hard to have a private conversation in such close quarters. Food-wise, the scotch egg for starters is to die for, even though I feel my arteries clogging with each bite of sausagey-eggy goodness. Their soups are always a good way to go as well - I have enjoyed hot and cold soups depending on the season. For main courses, all of the sandwiches are good but I like to try the specials. Most recently (a couple weeks ago), I had a salmon special and it was served with the freshest asparagus and cooked very nicely - the right texture. For dessert, I had the peanut butter Beignets (also on my most recent visit) and wow - sinful, delicious, thank you.  Overall, for lunch this is a great alternative, especially for business related gatherings.
