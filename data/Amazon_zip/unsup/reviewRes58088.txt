What a terrible way to run a restaurant! I think their belly is full with how much money they make. I have been to this place on several occasions in the past including last night. I have to admit their food are good however service really really sucks. We were waiting close to two hours trying to get rest of our four dishes. When we confronted the manager about it, instead of apologizing, he was making excuses and had an attitude of if you do not like it, you do not have to stay. The owner of this place should be shame of himself for have staff like the ones above. Instead of counting money at home, he should make attempt to visit his store to see how customers are being treating. Will never never go back to this awful place.
