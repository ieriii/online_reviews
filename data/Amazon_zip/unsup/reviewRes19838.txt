This was my first visit to the original Coast in way too long, I'm not sure what kept me away because the food is delicious. Maybe it is the extended wait if you don't have a reservation? Rolls were really great. The best maki I've had in a some time. Rainbow roll - Great fish AND the pieces are appropriately bite sized rather than mongo pieces you struggle to eat politely. Ceviche roll - Lime marinated shrimp, jalapeno, cilantro. Unexpected and awesome. Eel - Very standard. Solid. Pumpkin roll - Really great. I thought it had pumpkin inside, but apparently not according to someone else. It does have salmon on top. It was really yummy. Bottle limit is weird and annoying, but probably helps avoid people camping out on a Fri or Sat night which I can appreciate. Also, you have to open your own bottle. Evidently this is a city law that is not really enforced, except they were busted for it recently which means they are enforcing it now. They have the really un-user friendly type of opener, so you may wnat to bring your own bottle opener. And the service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive.
