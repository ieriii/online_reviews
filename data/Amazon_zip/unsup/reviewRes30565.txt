Went here this past Saturday after hearing the hype. Walked in and our table was ready right then. Lots of open tables for having 0 reservations 2 days out. ( checked again after I already made them ) Got the miso soup w/ mushrooms and it was GOOD. We got 3 sushi rolls....ummm..the Dragon..tale of 2 tunas..and rainbow... They were all good. The server tried to have us get more, but we were full after 3. Let me say that I am new to Chicago, but I feel you can get sushi of this quality all over the city for probably $5-10 cheaper. It was good-great don't get me wrong, but $110 worth?? hmmm
