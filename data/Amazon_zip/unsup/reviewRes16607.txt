I was taken here for my birthday and it was a thoroughly awesome experience. The service was over the top, which bothers some people, but I'd rather have them hovering and being over attentive than ignoring me when I'm in need. All the dishes were delicious, I had an entree that include lamp chops, spanish chorizo, corn, and some other delicious things I can't remember. The ceviches were great, the tequila flight was well worth the price, raspberry mojito and seasonal fruit caipirinhas (it was lemon when i went, much better than i expected it to be) were off the wall good, and the atmosphere is pure grandiosity.
