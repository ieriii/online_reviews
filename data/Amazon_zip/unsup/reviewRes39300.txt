It was a Thursday morning, so there was a table or two open, but if you plan on trying L&E on a busier day of the week they don't reservations unless you are a guest upstairs. As we slowly caffeinated ourselves I took in the similarly hip, down-to-earth and amazingly branded decor as I had I experienced upstairs as a guest in their Inn. A vintage juke box in the corner plays a mix of classic honky-tonk and low-key indie music, the impressive whiskey (etc) selection covered one entire wall, and all of the worn and natural wood played well off of the subtle golds and black throughout. The first time I ate here I had the sunny side duck egg hash with incredibly moist duck confit, yukon gold potatoes, spring onions, and a black truffle vinaigrette turned out to be one of the greatest meals of my life. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the hash was bursting with flavor, very down-home yet sophisticated and well thought out. This was refined comfort food as its best. The service has been great but totally laid back every time I've been in there for both a meal and drinks. I don't have a singular bad thing to say about Longman. You must eat there, clearly, but if you have the opportunity to stay in the inn you almost owe it to yourself! Enjoy!
