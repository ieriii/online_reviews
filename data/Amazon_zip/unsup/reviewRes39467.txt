I used to live down the street from this place and I used to dream of coming here after a night of drinking because of coure, nothing is funnier than drunk people with fire and sharp implements. Alas, my dream was never realized. But I did manage to spend a fun evening here with a table full of friends/acquaintences/strangers and I loved it. San Soo Gab San is a madhouse-the parking lot is always packed and the night we went there were conflicting stories from management about whether or not they accept reservations. Luckily, one of the members of our group is Korean and she straightened out the matter and we seemed to get better service after that-which was a relief since one of the servers ignored us and I felt bad asking the nice server for more lettuce leaves every five minutes, but dammit I had lettuce leaves needs that were not being met. The BBQ was great as was the plum wine and unfortunately I didn't have anything else. The most important to know though is that the place is almost always packed, so be prepared to wait.
