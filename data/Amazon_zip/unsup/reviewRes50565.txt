Absolutely fabulous brunch experience. I had the cheddar omelet and grits and my husband had the popover/crabcake/benedict. Both were delicious and beautifully prepared. The coffee smelled fantastic and the touch of having simple syrup on the table instead of sugar was a real southern treat I haven't seen since my grandparents were alive and living in Baton Rouge.  The owner came over and introduced himself and explained that his partner was the chef. Just a wonderful experience all around. I'm really looking forward to going back for their Monday night prix-fixe dinner special!
