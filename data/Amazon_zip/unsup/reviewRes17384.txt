Walking in to a lively bar scene with a great band - hottie bongo player to boot -- good start for a fun night! Great cocktails, and a good wine list. Colorful, playful decor creates a great ambiance. I would say this is a better group/party spot than a romantic place, but perhaps the tables on the mezzanine level might be a more more intimate. Lots of great starters - empanadas, beet salad, etc. Variety of entrees were ordered - fish, chicken, beef -- mine was the best! (Arrachera). There way some plantain embargo going on, so we were not able to order the plantains... a tab disappointing for a latin restaurant, but we still had a great meal.
