We booked a table on Friday night through Opentable for 9:00 pm. My party and I arrived about 10 minutes early and were told they were running about 15-20 minutes behind that evening. Fine- we went to the bar and ordered drinks. Without seeing a drink menu I ordered a Mojito. It was good and went down smoothly as we were waiting. About 25 minutes after our reservation we had not been seated. The hostess apologized and said she would put us on some kind of VIP seating list (?? confusing because we checked in early for our reservation with our entire party and were given a pager). About 5 minutes after that we were seated. As we were shown to our seats the hostess apologized again and told us a manager would be over to talk with us shortly. (I thought this was a very nice redeeming gesture!) Well, no manager came...  The waitress was really nice and made some great recommendations- Ropa Vieja and the Guac were delicious starters. I had the Churrasco as my entree and really enjoyed that as well. I also ordered a special drink I believe was called the "last straw" or something. As the evening was winding down and my friends and I were ready to leave our waitress was no where to be found for the check. We asked a really nice busboy who became very attentive when he noticed the absence of our waitress. I would totally return to Carnivale despite the manager not coming over to apologize for our wait... I believe in second chances...
