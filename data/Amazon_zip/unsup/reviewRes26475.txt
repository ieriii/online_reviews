Pequods has officially done the impossible. I have finally met a pan pizza worth raving about! Before my ex took me here two years ago (whomp whomp), I was loathe to let a piece of pan cross my lips. I mean what was the point? It wasn't thin, foldy and greasy and it sure as shit wasn't stuffed!!! (Still my absolute fave.) My mentality was save myself the calories and walk down the street to Art of Pizza. But much like Sarah Palin, Pequods is a game-changer. Maybe its the sauce, maybe its the memories or maybe its the carmelized cheese burnt right into the deliciously buttery crust (impossible to leave it on the plate). Pequods is good for take-out, delivery, a Hawks game or the non-cinematic half of a dinner-movie combo (the Webster theater is right across the street.) Can't promise you'll have better luck romantically than I did, but the pan is more than worth the shot :)
