Amazing. If you want quality food that isn't ridiculously overpriced, this is the place - their lunch special is around $12 (I think? I don't remember exactly...) and just the right size. And last time I was there, I ordered an appetizer that just didn't appeal to me (first time that's happened there) and they didn't charge me for it. I was so surprised when I got the check and saw the shrimp wrap thing I'd ordered with a note next to it - disliked - and then the money taken off. That's a way to get customers to come back.And whatever you do - ORDER THE PHO.
