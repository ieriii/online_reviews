This Sheraton is a total Monet - the good old "good from far but far from good". There is a rather grand lobby entrance - circularly shaped. Behind that is an enormous area with couches and a lively bar. This has all the hallmarks of a potential good stay. The goodness stopped there. While the service was friendly, it took more than 10 minutes to check in - I had already worked a full day and traveled hours on a plane, sat in traffic from O'Hare, and I simply wanted to get to my room. When I finally made it to my room, I entered to find someone's shoes in a plastic bag on the dresser - not a big deal on its own and I know that other people stay in this room on a nightly basis, but I don't need to be reminded of this fact. It was 92 degrees that evening and the climate control was set to 75 - I changed the settings to 65 but the ac didn't turn on all night. The iron in the room was broken and the hair dryer was on its last legs. Overall, it was a subpar experience for me. While the gym was excellent, the room I stayed in was in desperate need of renovation.
