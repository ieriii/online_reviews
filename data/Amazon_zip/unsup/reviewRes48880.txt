Our aunt and uncle from Portland, OR wanted a delicious dinner last night, so we brought them to The Publican. Everything we ate and drank was great. Here's what I remember: We drank a variety of whites, wits and saisons throughout the meal, along with a few Tito's cocktails here and there. Oysters, octopus, soft shell crabs...(you'd think we were at a dedicated seafood restaurant at this point!)...corn (ridiculous glob of aoli on top), whole chicken with a couple of eggs on the frites...and finally some pig in the form of a ham chop that was braised in hay which resulted in an incredible earthy flavor. Finished the meal with coffee and 2 desserts, the waffle with honey butter and raspberry jam being the best. It was sad that we didn't get the charcuterie or the lamb loin or the mussels, and the pork belly wasn't on the menu, but the bottom line is that there's way too much great stuff on the menu for you to eat everything every time you're there. So make sure to try a few new things each time you go and I'm certain they'll wow your taste buds from start to finish. It's funny how I think about this place as a festival de pig yet we end up loving the fish, seafood, and chicken just as much as the pork whenever we eat here. Great for groups!
