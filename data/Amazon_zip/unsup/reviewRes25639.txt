This place is great. It was my first "real" fondue experience and since I (or my boyfriend) had any idea what to do, the waitress was nice enough to help was out, with no attitude! I was very impressed. The food was delicious, I wasn't too thrilled about having to cook my own chicken (the vegetables I could handle, but I didn't want raw meat). The chocolate fondue was OMGSOGOOD. The cheese was so-so. It was kinda pricey in my opinion, especially since I was cooking for myself.
