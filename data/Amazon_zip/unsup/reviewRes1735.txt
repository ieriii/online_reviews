So what's so great about a hot dog? What's NOT great about a hot dog from Hot Doug's! I have only been here twice, most recently, just yesterday. I have tried a few of their sausages, but due to their unique names I have trouble recalling. When I hopped on over with a coworker earlier this week, I sampled the gator dog - Smoked and Spicy Alligator Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Goat Cheese. Absolutely delicious. Smoked? Good. Spicy? Good. Smoked and Spicy? GREAT. And did someone say goat cheese? And how! The ample amounts of feta on my dog made this girl's mouth water. Can't wait to steal away again to that lovely corner of Roscoe and California =)
