I've always had a soft spot for this place because I was around when it first opened, so my opinion might be a little biased. I've always been an enthusiast for this restaurant and am ecstatic for their success! With that said, I decided to bring a date there to prove to him how great this place is. It took us a while to be seated even with reservations, which was upsetting, however we were treated with a complimentary appetizer (I believe it was a version of honey-walnut shrimp....my fave!) With both my date and me being filipino, I had to have him try Sunda's version of Crispy Pata which in absolutely no way disappointed. The meat was so tender, it fell off the bone while the outside was nice and crispy. It also came with two savory sauces, reminiscent of what Mom makes, but upgraded. We also ordered the kobe beef tar tar and a roll (I think it was called The Number Nine) which were equally amazing. I know that one of the chef's best desserts on the menu was "The Ridiculous" which definitely lived up to it's name. Both of us were stuffed, but I insisted he try it and ended up finishing the whole thing clean! There's no doubt in my mind I will be back! There is a very rare amount of upscale filipino food around in this city so this restaurant really hits home with me.
