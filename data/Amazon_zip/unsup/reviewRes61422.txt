Ok, I will admit, I haven't actually purchased anything from them yet as I don't carry cash when I am walking my pup but I definitely need to start so I can treat him when they happen to be by our dog park (follow them on FB or Twitter so you know where they will be; their menu, including ice cream for dogs, is just so fun). For now, they will get a 5-star review for having a nice big water bowl out for the pups walking by on hot days- we definitely appreciated it since that happened to be a day I forgot his water bottle :) I also know they were a huge hit for a recent doggie birthday party at said park, and that the pups were stealing each other's treats they were so yummy.  I know Bailey had a sad face when we had to walk by without buying anything :) Brilliant idea and we hope to see you more often!
