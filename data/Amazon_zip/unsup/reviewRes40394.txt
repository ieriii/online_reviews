This place is pretty darn good. Granted we were all tired from a night of dancing and walking around, but dang it hit the spot. I wouldn't recommend the Chile relleno, but the carne asade was amazing. The simplicity of onions and cilantro as the topping emphasized the seasoning on the meat and the salsa verde was spot on. I would come back again.
