Came here on a Monday night and there were only a few tables occupied which was REALLY NICE given all the reviews I've read here about how crowded this place gets on the weekends.  What an AMAZING mix of flavors. Everything was delicious. We took advantage of the half off pitcher of sangria on Mondays for $12 which started off the evening well. Then they brought us bread with two bowls of green dipping sauce -- spicy vs. non-spicy. Very very tasty.  We ordered the empanana sampler for appetizers. The BEST empananas that I've ever had -- freshly fried. We got cheese, chicken, and beef. The beef was my favorite with the cheese a close second. For our main course, we couldn't decide because everything looked so good so went with the Picada Colombiana (serves 2) for $38 that included a little bit of everything -- Entraa skirt steak (house specialty), rib-eye steak, pork loin, chicken breast, homemade chorizo, pork ribs, arepa, crunchy green plantain, fried sweet plantain, yuca and potato. My favorites were the skirt steak and chicken....great spices and very tender. The chorizo and pork ribs were a bit dry though. The potato and plantain was pretty tasty too. Then to end the meal, we got the fig dessert with caramel on the side. I've never had fig before so it was interesting. Definitely tasty and would try to get it again when figs are in season. To sum it up -- an amazing dinner with GREAT service. (*Note: Our waiter told us to only come there on the weekends if we liked loud music and bad service....so take the advice to heart if you really want to have great food with a good experience.)
