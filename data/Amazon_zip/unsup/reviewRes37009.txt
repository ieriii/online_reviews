We went to Fox and Obel completely by accident. It was starting to rain and we thought we'd get away from it by going to this market. It was a great decision. We bought an 8 oz jar of jam and was trying to figure out how we'd get it back to Houston without checking in a bag. We thought of various ways to do this and through this entire effort, one of the employees (John Finch) ran around the market trying to figure something out for us. Thank you so much!!! Another employee also provided me with some saran wrap so I could wrap up my half package of rye crackers. Seriously, the most helpful employees we've met on this trip. If I lived here, I'd come here often for the food and friendly service.
