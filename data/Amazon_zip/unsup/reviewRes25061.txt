I'd been meaning to give this place a go for years, so when my gal pals decided to try it for our most recent Girls' Night Out, I was definitely down. A couple of our girls had public transportation woes, so while we awaited their arrival, we snacked on tasty tortilla chips and salsa and the bottle of Sauvignon Blanc I brought. The rest of the crew arrived and we pondered the menu. Two of my friends did their study abroad in Costa Rica so they were loving the experience and couldn't wait to have a culinary trip down memory lane. I just wanted to make sure I ordered something that would be tasty. After asking our server for suggestions, since two of my friends ordered the Casado, I opted for the grilled steak and a side of the gallo pinto. Boy was it good. The steak was *slightly* oversalted, but overall magically delicious and perfectly cooked. It was served with two stalks of chargrilled green onions, and the side of what seemed to be a mixture of black beans and white rice, sweet fried plantains and a cabbage salad. The whole plate reminded me of other caribbean food (like Jamaican and Trini) but with a decidedly latin slant. With generous portions, BYOB and tasty food, I'll definitely be back. I wanna try the sandwiches and empanadas I keep reading about!
