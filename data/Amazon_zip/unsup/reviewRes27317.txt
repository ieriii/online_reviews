Great Mexican food just far for me to go on a regular basis. The steak tacos were really good. Big cuts of ribeye not those small little squares of meat you get at other places. My friend ordered a side of mole and OMG! I haven't had mole that good since Oaxaca (home of mole)!! It's worth a visit for the food and price (my three steak tacos were $5).
