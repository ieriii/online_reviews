I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Lincoln Park, and I just returned this past weekend. I wasn't dissapointed at all. First I had the toasted ravioli appetizer which was fantastic and the roasted tomato soup which was amazing. Our server Jeff was on the ball and didn't allow my glass to go empty. For dinner I had the farafalle garganzola. I don't like sun dried tomatos so I had them change it to spinach- no problem and no extra charge, My husband also had the farafalle. All of this was under $35. I was so happy and full and it was just as good the next day.
