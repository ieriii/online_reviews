This place is fine if you feel like stuffing yourself with over buttered slabs of meat and paying $12 for a beer. That's what happened when my boyfriend and I went. The place kind of poses like it's super fancy and nice but it's a steak house. I love steak and this place is one of those places that everyone says you must go to! So I did. My boyfriend and I don't mind paying a little extra once in awhile. We go out to eat and once in awhile we go to overpriced places to see if they're really worth it (in our opinion of course). The food was good. Definitely enjoyed the steak but it was really really really buttery. I ordered one flute of sparkling rose wine. It was good. My boyfriend ordered a chimay. When we got the bill we were surprised to find out that my tiny flute of sparkling wine was $16 (cheapest sparkling on the list btw) and my boyfriends small chimay (12 oz) was $12. That automatically ups the price by $28! Anyway, like I said, the food was good but I didn't fall over in my chair or have a heart attack from the deliciousness of it (although with that much butter a heart attack would be possible). When I go out to eat I like to have a drink so this place will probably not be visited by us again, simply because of the over inflated prices of the beer and sparkling wine! If you go, stick with water like the people sitting inches away from us did (yeah, they were really that close).
