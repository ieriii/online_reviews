Today, my waitress, Alejandra gave us tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa. Then we had the combination platter with rice. Mom tried the horchata water (rice water) for the first time. It's better and sweeter than when I tried it at the mexican art museum at day of the dead. I had a mandarin jarritos though. I also had pastel de 3 leches, but I should have tried their cheesecake instead.
