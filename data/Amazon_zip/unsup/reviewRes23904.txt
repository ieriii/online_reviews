This review is from an August 2008 visit. Icosium was a Roman city on which the modern city of Algiers now stands, thus the name. Thus the cuisine! We had CREPES. Very Mediterranean-style food with a French "impact", in the form of said crepes. The crepes themselves were almost tortilla-like in texture, and it was what was held inside them that was amazing. After briefly considering recreating the Punic Wars, we each picked our crepes. I picked the Crepe Marrakesh: Raisins, cream cheese, caramelized onions, toasted almonds, sun-dried tomatoes, homemade olive tapanade, fresh mint, and baby spinach. Now, this might sound more like the results of a restaurant kitchen sink or garbage can than an actual crepe, but I have to tell you: those ingredients? Were AMAZING together. I mean, every bite was just unbelievably flavorful and coordinated. One of my dinner companions and I had cream of mushroom soup, to which she said "I now know what it tastes like when it's not made in a can." Hee.
