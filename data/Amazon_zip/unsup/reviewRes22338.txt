Yum Yum! I wish I could dip myself in the tazatziki and swim around in it. Everything we got here was very delicious, the grilled octopus was our favorite. My fiance and like to go to places that tend to be very packed or trendy for "dunch" so we don't have to deal with crowds. Based on all the reviews here regarding large groups, we decided to swing in for dunch at 3pm. Very prompt service, 1 water standing attentively by 3 tables and he raced over if we even raised our eyebrows at him.  We will definetly be back.
