I first went to GE with my wife a couple years ago. It was awesome - the tasting menu, bistro menu, awesome drinks from a mixologist was just an awesome package. We had the tasting menu and were blown away. The delicious popcorn to start your meal was a great informal touch which really made me love this place. Fast forward to Valentine's Day when my wife and I returned. To our surprise a new chef, tasting only menu, fewer tables, and a cleared out bar area completely changed the restaurant. It was a huge bummer - the food was overly formal. For us we were sad the original restaurant is gone. The price for the new "5 starr" experience is not worth it - I'd rather go spend my money at Bonsoiree, Per Se, Del Posto, or many of the other top restaurants that charge $150+ a diner. All I can hope is the new bistro restaurant recaptures what we loved about this place before. Don't fix it if it ain't broken.
