The chicken.... well we all know that is like crack. Saucy, sweet, crunchy, juicy crack. What I learned thus far in my trips to Australia is that what they call "Buddah Bowls" is just bibimbop. Marinated and pickled veggies, rice, meat, and a perfectly fried egg. It is damn good, its the only bibimbop I know of that is outside of a Korean neighborhood. Only complaint, it would be nice if they had the hot stone bowls that makes some rice really crispy and even better than you could imagine. So if you are too full of fried chicken and want a nice complete healthy meal in one bowl... get this
