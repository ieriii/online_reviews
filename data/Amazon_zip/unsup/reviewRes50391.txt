i went on a Thursday night w coworkers. they're drink specials were great, but the food needed serious help. the waiter was friendly and more than willing to suggest anything we inquired about on the menu. however, i was a little confused/curious when he compared their burger menu (a choice of 3) to the wonderment of the burger menu at kuma's corner. i tried one of the burgers here. you drop a name like kuma's; that's a challenge. the burger was good, but wouldn't easily slide into the midst of the legendary shadow. a friend of mine ordered the salmon cesar salad. she didn't make it in to work for a couple days. hopefully we just caught them on an off night. though i am not sure that the drink specials and the uber-sports bar atmosphere would con me into a second chance.
