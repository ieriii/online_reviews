Thus far, my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Coming here always re-inspires me to open my own restaurant. It's charming. The food is incredible, and the portions are generous. They have a great wine menu, an equally great dessert menu, and the staff was helpful and friendly (which is remarkable, given that the dining room is relatively small). The lobster pasta is SO good that I have trouble ordering anything else. It's particularly lovely on warm nights when they open the street wall-windows... something about the outside breeze and the inside ambiance is just perfect.
