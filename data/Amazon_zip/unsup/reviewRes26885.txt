We ordered Pequod's pizza delivery last night on a whim. It was so delicious that I didn't even mind the almost 2 hour wait! They have this amazing ring of burnt cheese around the edge that looks ugly, but tastes devine. I had canadian bacon and pineapple which was so messy and yummy. And this is coming from someone who usually prefers thin crust pizza!  The only downside is that this place is expensive for pizza. But whatever, it's cheaper than what I would normally pay for dinner, and i ate it in my pajamas sprawled out watching the travel channel!
