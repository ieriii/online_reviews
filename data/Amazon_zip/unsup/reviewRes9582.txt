I can't say enough good things about my experience here. Everything -- ambiance, food, service, value -- was excellent. We did the prix fixe option and shared a ton -- everything was great. I was especially impressed with the server Mark -- who described everything in such detail you would have thought he was the chef - he also knew all the wines very well and recommended a winner. We even were able to speak to Chef a bit since it was the end of the night (he just finished filming Top Chef All-Stars but wouldn't say a word about it).  He and the owner have created a real winner here -- elegant, sophisticated, delicious yet highly approachable food. I thought the prices were fair -- $60 prix fixe for app, entree, dessert and two "mini courses" -- one of which was more of a palate cleanser. They just expanded their space too -- no doubt they will keep it filled. Can't wait to go back!
