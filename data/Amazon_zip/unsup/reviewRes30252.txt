3rd Coast, where to start? Attentive service, never too packed, good prices, and a damn good breakfast. Servers are not rude and always make good suggestions if you can't decide! I really can't add much more to what everyone else has said, except for that the eggs benedict are great as well as ordering just eggs-you get more food than you will know what to do with!
