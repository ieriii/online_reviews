I don't remember having such great Greek food. Everything we ordered was great. We loved the fried zucchini appetizer with this butter/garlic sauce. It was yummy. I got a chicken dish and the meat just fell right off the bone. My whole party left happy with their dishes. The wait staff was amazing, there was never an empty glass. We had a great time. We even heard a little girl say Oopa! when she got her dish. How cute is that?
