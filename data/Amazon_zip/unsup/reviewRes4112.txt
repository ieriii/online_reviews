The wife and I went to this place a couple years ago after it first opened close to our old home. We had no idea it was by reservation only (and that there was a long waiting list), but they were still able to seat us. The whole dining experience was magnificent. With unique ingredients/dishes and great service (although they seemed a bit nervous), it was one of my most memorable dining experiences. I would highly recommend Schwa, especially as an alternative to higher priced places in and around downtown. We have yet to go back since (we want to respect the reservation system this time) but hope to arrange a special evening there soon.
