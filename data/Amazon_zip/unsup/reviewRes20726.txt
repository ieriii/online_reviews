XOCO not only lived up to my culinary expectations, but exceeded it. I went in on a Wednesday night at 8pm (an hour before closing) and the wait was about 15 minutes. The wait will generally be longer, but it's not that bad when you're with a few friends and you can ponder about which delicious items to order. Plus, you can order chips & guacamole and eat them in line, and there's free tap and sparkling water (with limes)!  I started off with chips & guacamole, which are definitely good but not great; I was really disappointed with the low guacamole to chips ratio. Then, I went with the daily torta special: pork belly with dark salsa negra glaze, bacon, arugula, queso anejo. INCREDIBLE. Toasty bread and a wonderful explosion of flavors in my mouth! I was initially concerned that it might be too greasy, but it was just perfect. Highly recommended. Also, the tortas look modest in size, but they are incredibly filling. I was pretty full just from the chips and half a torta, so I packed the rest up. For the record, the torta is just as good the next day, oven fresh. The only drawback to XOCO is the dining area. With a seating capacity of only 40, I ended up sharing a table with a random couple. The space was quite tight and most people sit on bar stools. It's not a place to go for a romantic date, or if you want to be comfortable eating, but it's definitely a place to get great eats. I will come back for sure, and look forward to trying the other items.
