Went here for brunch. The Cocktails are amazing, out of this world perfect. I had the sparkling pinot noir mimosa which was awesome. Rabbit hash was delicious too - the meat was pulled and tender, and nice big pieces of rabbit, not hashed. The poached egg was perfect too. My only criticisms are that the service was a little rushed, and our two top table was in a tight space in the center dining room right by the bar. If you can get a table in the front dining room that would be nicer.
