I recently brought some out of town family to L & E for an impromptu brunch. It wasn't exactly on a whim, because I've heard so many good things and have been wanting to come, but we were on a Tour de Force of where I've spent the last decade of my life kind of Chicago neighborhood adventure and I remembered that this place is where the Winds used to be.  When I lived in Logan the only satisfying options for breakfast or brunch were Johnny's Grill, which was the I'm-still-drunk-and-will-go-back-to-bed-after-we-eat-this-and-smoke-a-bunch-of-cigarettes kind of meal or Lula's, which meant my parents were checking in on me. Longman & Eagle made me miss my old apartment. Maybe it was the bloody cocktails before noon, but I almost called up my old landlord to see if he had any apartments for rent. The breakdown: everything that hit the table was delightful. I can't say one bad thing about anything I ate or drank. Since we're a close family, there wasn't a plate that I didn't stick my fork on. Also I'm an egg snob. It is an inherited gene that can ruin even the most charming of brunches, but I'm glad I can appreciate an egg that is prepared properly. Truly one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time and I am so glad that I got to share it with some people that I love, because it is hard to find a place that runs as smoothly and deliciously as L & E. I can't wait to come back.
