Sushi: very strong. It's nice to find sushi the quality of other upper tier restaurants at a BYOB sushi place where you don't have to drop $100 for dinner for two if you want to share a bottle of wine. Of particular note was the Sunrise roll, which featured a nice combination of tuna, mint (?!) and mango exterior, but went together extremely well. The White Dragon and Crunchy Spice Tuna roll were also delicious. Unfortunately the Ceviche roll was fairly disappointing; I was unable to taste any of the lime marinade advertised for the scallop in the roll. By far the highlight of the meal for me was the special appetizer, the hamachi carpaccio. Paper thin tuna, dressed in an acidic vinaigrette with cilantro and a thin slice of jalapeno. This appetizer literally blew me away with its intense concentration of fantastic flavor. I would get two of them next time.
