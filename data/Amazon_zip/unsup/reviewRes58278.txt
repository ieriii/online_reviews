I am definitely a fan of Rick Bayless having watched his show Mexico One Plate at a Time as well as watching him compete on Top Chef Masters. My review is based on my only visit so far and the one item I got which was the Wild Mushroom Torta. It's one of the vegetarian options and although I'm not totally vegetarian, I do like to incorporate vegetarian meals in my diet. The torta itself was a great idea although for my tastes I found it a bit too salty . It came with some kind of crumbly goat cheese, and the wild mushrooms were also seasoned of course. The baguette-type bread the torta came in was a little hard in texture also but I suppose this is needed so the entire sandwich doesn't become a soggy mess. Overall though it was a little hard to eat and could get a bit messy (I ordered take-out and ate along the Riverwalk one Saturday morning.)The salsa was some type of red chili de arbol and while it went well with the Wild Mushroom Torta, it seemed to overpower it. Overall with the Salsa, the Mushrooms, and the Goat (?) Cheese too too salty. I will be going back at some point to try some of the other menu items. I am nevertheless still a Bayless fan. P.S. Be prepared for a wait also. This spot is incredibly popular.....
