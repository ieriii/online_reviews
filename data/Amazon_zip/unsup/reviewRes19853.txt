We ate here for lunch one day shortly after they opened. I loved the fish and chips. The fish was crispy and flavorful without being too greasy. The lemonade was nice and refreshing. Our server was a little-over-the-top - in that friendly but fake kind of way. I also didn't like the salt & pepper containers. Seems very unsanitary to me.
