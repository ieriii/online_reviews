I love Caro Mio. I just plain love it. It's romantic and special, warm and cozy, friendly and inviting, and the food is delicious. I love the homemade pasta and I love the slightly salty marinara sauce. The specials are always intriguing and the chef has even created a veggie alternative to a listed dish for me. And BYO always rules. Even if the food were just so-so, this would still be a 5-star experience for me. I just feel a rush of good vibes when I walk in here -- it's a combination of the pretty red walls and nice golden lighting, the local art on the walls, the sweet waiters, the charmingly mismatched place settings, and all the smiling happy customers. This is a good place to celebrate and be happy.
