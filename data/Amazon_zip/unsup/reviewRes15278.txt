The husband & I haven't takent the stroll to Sabatino's in a while, so decided to head over. It's STILL our favorite neighborhood place, so I guess there's a real yelp-out going on. We both love the straciatella soup and salad with loads of delicious blue cheese so we always get that and it did not disappoint. He had the special sauteed soft shell crabs which were tasty in a nice lemon-butter-wine sauce. I had my hearty standby- the chicken livers continental. I LOVE them and I always eat half the portion for another meal. The waitress was very knowledgeable and speedy, although she could have handled the check processing timing better. We even got to watch handsome young Enzo perform the dessert SHOW for a neighboring table who had ordered one of their dramatic flaming desserts. FUN! I don't know what people are complaining about in terms of value. With the soup, salad and complimentary bread, we have always found Sabatino's to be very satisfying and much better than fancy pants down-town restaurants.
