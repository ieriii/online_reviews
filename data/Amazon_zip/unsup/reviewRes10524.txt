I went to Piece on a Thursday night for Karaoke and to spend a little time with friends I hadn't seen in a while. Without a doubt, some of the best thin crust pizza around, and the bill for six people (including a few who had alcohol) was only $55. The only reason I've subtracted one star is because one of my friends spilled his drink and wasn't offered a replacement - as a matter of fact, he was barely offered a napkin - and also because the server was just generally sort of "blah".  I will definitely be back, and hopefully will be able to add that star back on by receiving better service.
