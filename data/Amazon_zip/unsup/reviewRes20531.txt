The Gage is the go to recommendation for out of town guests. Not only is the food fantastic but the location (near Millennium Park) is perfect for a quick stopover. The one thing you have to try is the Brussel Sprouts. Yes. Brussel Sprouts! At The Gage, they are served with Brie. I know it sounds double stinky but the taste is fantastic. The only problem is that they serve it in some very cool Staub cooking dishes that would be very nice to borrow. Wine and beer list is great too.
