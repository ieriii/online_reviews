I have only eaten at the oyster bar which is off to the side of the main restaurant but don't be fooled by the name the oyster bar is actually a more casual restaurant inside the "fancy" one. And it actually seems more fun at the oyster bar, it has a laid back feel and the food is terrific would definitely go back again and again. This place is fun and lively with really good food.
