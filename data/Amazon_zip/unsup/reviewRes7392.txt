The food was amazing! Love that they give you a couple of options to choose from with their bbq sauce. The first time I went there the service was great. The second time, we were such a inconvenience for the waitress to come over to the table. I'm a server myself, so I try not to judge, otherwise it ruins the experience. BUT come on, the bus boy got my drink, she never once checked on us during the meal and you could just tell she could care less about us. I think because my mom didn't want a full meal. Get real. We are the people that pay your bills, you should know better!
