This place just has great food. It tastes even better when you are not flipping the bill. We had a private dinner held in the room upstairs (oolala), where about fifteen people showed up. You know all the Great Gatsby shit happen in the upstairs rooms. There was a huge center facing table with satellite tables for peeps to sit around and drink their pricy wine. Did I tell you I love pricy wine? Well I do.  Anyways when we finally sat down, they had 3 + people waiting on us at all times and the menu was custom with our parties name on it! Talk about great service. Everything that touched my tongue was scrumptious. My palate was having a mouth orgasm. You name it, I loved it. I would recommend getting the filet with the shrimp, everyone seemed to die over it.
