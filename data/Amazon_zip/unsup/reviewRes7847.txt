Fogo de Chau does so many things so damn right. The Service -- This place has an amazingly attentive wait staff considering the restaurant is the size of an airplane hangar. All the servers work together, so there is basically an army of servers at your beck and call, all extremely enthusiastic about making sure you're eating and drinking like a king. The Gaucho meat men were very knowledgeable about the meat they were serving, and they all seemed to genuinely enjoy stuffing you full of meaty treats -- almost like they were trying to one-up each other. Like, "Yeah I see you looking at that Gaucho with the Bacon-Wrapped Chicken, but have you ever seen a filet of beef thiiiis big!?" kinda thing. Oh and when you flip that card to green (giving them the OK to start offering you their meaty wares) they would swarm your table like you owned the place. Meat frenzy = awesome. The only part of the service I didn't like were the guys rolling around carts of chilled booze. The classiness factor decreases a little when some dude is offering shots of Jager table-side. The Food -- The meat was all cooked very well, and my god there was there a lot of it. I tried every single meat variation (15 in all), and then when I told one of the servers of my gastronomical accomplishment he had one of the Guachos bring off-menu Beef Ribs out for me in a meat consumption challenge of sorts. They were awesome, and I think right then was where Fogo went from "good meat place" to "great meat place" for me. As far as meat rankings, the star of the show was undoubtedly the Bacon Wrapped Filet, which was cooked perfectly. The Beef Ribs were definitely a close second and the Top Sirloin an even closer third. Also I guess there was a salad bar or something. Just kidding, the salad bar was awesome. Even a Vegetarian could eat like a boss at this place.
