This place has its strong suits. Mainly the world class beer list, and it's a somewhat cool space even if the crappy tables and chairs aren't up to the prices. The food is fairly tasty (mussels not so much) but a bit overpriced, but the big problem is that the service is consistently WEAK. I am talking AMATEUR HOUR here...downright PATHETIC. Management should hire some more wait staff, train what they are stuck with or get their heads out of their A**es, but do SOMETHING!! Zagat has a class of restaurants called "Teflons", those places that are popular for NO currently relevant reason, that coast on their reputations; this place is well on its way to that status. See ya.
