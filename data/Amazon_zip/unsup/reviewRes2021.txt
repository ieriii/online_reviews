ok first thing is first. when i signed up for yelp, i kept seeing all these reviews about hot dougs. i thought to myself, "i must try this." decided to go yesterday before we saw the cubbies play, (they lost :( ). i had read that sometimes the line is very long, and the wait could be up to two hours. psssf. got there at 1045. NO LINE. beat that. i had the chicago dog, and it was amazing. i cant wait to go back to have another, and try something else. the fries, were even good! (i dont like fries) they didnt even need ketchup or cheese. i also would like to go back and try the duck fries one day.  but yeah. im now obsessed. and i live in the burbs. ugggggh
