My first Chicago yelp review! I had passed by this place a couple months ago and thought it looked pretty cool- large windows, and I heard it has a good rooftop bar. My friend and I finally came for dinner and enjoyed the variety of choices at the harvest table, but of course saved room for the plethora of grilled meats that we knew were coming our way. My favorites were the super-juicy ribeye, and their signature buttermilk braised steak. Everything was pretty decent, although not mind-blowing, but sadly, I was too full for dessert. I will definitely be back to try the butterscotch bread pudding, which I hear is pretty spectacular. We stopped by the rooftop bar briefly after dinner and I have to admit, it was not as great as I thought it would be based on the yelp reviews, but maybe I've just been spoiled by the rooftop bars in New York. The best thing about Zed451? The people! Super friendly and extremely helpful, they made this place worth going back to. My friend and I were lucky to be sitting at the chef's table, where we got to watch them prepare the meats while talking to them and getting Chicago restaurant and nightlife recommendations. They even gave us printouts! Not the place to go if you're a vegetarian or if you want really creative food, but if you're just craving some meat and a good time, definitely stop by.
