My first experience with Superdawg was for a photo shoot with my roller derby team. It was full of fun and wonderful hospitality from the owners/staff. I was in love. My next experience was a few months later - on a date with my boyfriend in his '55. Again, love! I've been back a few times (it's not especially convenient for a Ukie Village resident with no car) and still...love! I am a big fan of Chicago-style dogs (even being from STL), and they're excellent and hearty at Superdawg.  My favorite thing, however, is the Superveggies. Deep fried vegetables? YES PLEASE. Seriously, once you eat fried corn you'll never want to eat regular corn again.
