My wonderful boyfriend decided to take me to brunch on Sunday and said he had heard good things about the brunch at the Publican. I only had one question, "Do they make good Bloody Marys?" We found a picture of one of their Marys online and it looked decent, so he made us a reservation. The Publican is laid out like a German beer hall, with a large horseshoe shaped communal table. They also have a number of two tops and these cozy little shut in booths. When we arrived for our reservation, we were promptly seated at a private two person table. Someone came by immediately and filled our water glasses and left the cool bottle of water on our table and someone else came by with delicious coffee. Definitely what we needed first thing on Sunday morning! Our waitress was prompt and friendly, delivering our Bloody Marys with a beer back (just as every good Mary should be -- I got the lager -- yummy!) The Mary itself was smaller than I've gotten at other restaurant, with pickles, green beans and well, pickles and green beans. Not the best "accessories" but the vodka was plentiful and it was just spicy enough. My boyfriend ordered the red wine poached egg and I got the fried French Toast. His eggs were delicious and there was this delicious cream cheese type sauce on the bottom of the toast that was just fantastic. My French toast was creamy and delicious (though I should have asked for more syrup -- such a little bit they give you! I'm a sugar fiend though so maybe that's just me) and the maple sausage that came with my toast was melt in your mouth delicious. Our plates were cleared promptly after we were done and the check delivered soon after that. The service was friendly and without fault and the food was delicious! I'd definitely go back again.
