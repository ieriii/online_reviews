Seriously? Best service I have ever had...hands-down. Upon arriving home from my most recent visit, I emailed the corporate office to sing the praises of the staff there AND I spoke to a manager while I was dining. The food here is phenomenal: the cuts of meat are savory and, as long as you eat meat, will delight any palette. The salad bar has a great variety--though I did fore go the salad bar last time in the interest of leaving more room for the meat! Well, it wasn't only the meat I was leaving room for, but also the fried polenta, the cheese bread, and the carmelized bananas. Absolutely, 100%, no-reservations do I recommend this restaurant. I'm still drooling over it!
