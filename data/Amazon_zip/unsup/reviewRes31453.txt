Dear Chicago Diner, I've had a love affair with you since the tender age of 16. A little young? Maybe. I just can't seem to walk away! You have withstood college, break-ups, the competition of other vegetarian restaurants, rejection from my close-minded, meat-loving friends, and yet you always come out on top.  I'm not sure how you do it. Is it the way your food melts in my mouth, and I literally have to stop, close my eyes, and savor every moment? Is it the fact that you make tofu and seitan taste so good? Or is it your desserts....oh your desserts. That cheesecake....Can't. Get. Enough. I've had to resort to saving you for special occasions. You're my reward; my "congratulations on a job well done" place. And I'm very careful about who I introduce you to. One bad word about my beloved diner, and....well, I won't even go there. Keep up the good work, my love. I can't wait until the summer when we can rendezvous on your outdoor patio.
