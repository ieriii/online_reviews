I have been here for both my husband's birthday and my birthday and I have never been disappointed. First, the service is always top notch. They check on your frequently but are not obtrusive and they are honest in the recommendations. As far as the steaks, this is hands down the best steak I have ever had in my life! It is cooked on a 400 degree plate with butter. They know how to make a medium rare properly which is hard to find. So amazing!! They also have the best sweet potato casserole, it almost like a desert. Speaking of desert, they have an amazing chocolate trio dessert or you can't go wrong with the chocolate moose cheesecake which is whipped and fantastic. I can't recommend Ruth's Chris enough. It is great for a special occasion and depending on how large your appetite is, you could easily split a steak and get more sides.
