the crepes are crispy, the water is cucumber-y (deliciously so), and my stomach is full. id love to try any of their lunch crepes, since my eyes (and stomach) couldnt make it past the Crepe Labella (belgium chocolate, bananas, almonds, and coconut, with a side of ice cream) when looking at the menu. their coffee was perfectly brewed and the service was great.
