I had a craving for some chicken and only Crisp would do... especially since I was over at the Century Mall, I just had to walk around the block to get to Crisp. I called in the order, very interesting conversation on my part since I didn't have a menu and the guy probably thought I was flaky and he told me so with a mean note on the receipt when I picked up my order. I ordered a whole chicken (NO, I'm not going to eat the whole thing by myself, well, at least not in one sitting). I remembered that I wanted to try the Plain Jane and I knew that I loved the Seoul Sassy. I must say, the Plain Jane really sucked. It wasn't as crispy and juicy as the chicken I had last time. The Seoul Sassy was definitely better than Plain Jane. So it seems that the chicken tastes better when slathered with some sauce. This is not good in my opinion, but who cares what I think, this is one of the top 10 fried chicken spots in America, what do I know. I just know that I will try it again but only if it's saucy, oh and I need to try the wings. Minus 0.5 for the yucky Plain Jane and minus 0.5 for the crappy note on the receipt from Mr. Crabby Pants, I guess I should have told him from the get go that I didn't have a menu, just a craving. We'll see what happens next time.
