Lord have mercy!!! This was AMAZING!!! The food is ridiculously good. I had dinner there on a Monday night and it was fairly busy. We were seated right away and actually served our appetizer within 10-15 minutes of being there and the rest of the meal a few minutes after the appetizer. Everything was hot (as in warm & fresh). We ( I was with a friend) had the Sampler plate for our appetizer [Crab Rangoon, Shrimp Spring Rolls, Egg Rolls and Fried Shumari (fried Shrimp)]. It came with a side of sweet & sour style dipping sauce. The soup was then served and normally I not a big soup person, thank goodness I listened to my friend as she ordered the seafood soup (Poh Tok). It's a sweet & spicy soup with shrimp, crab meat and fish. It was very good and I had to stop in order to make sure that I had room for the entree which was the Peanut Sauce lover served with Chicken over Jasmine rice. Magical is the only way to describe what I ate at this place last night and if I could, I'de give them a few more stars. Highly recommended. Price is inexpensive and it's a BYO place. Service was friendly, courteous and fast.
