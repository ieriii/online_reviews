Cute. It's classy and defiantly attracts a higher-end crowd which is fun. Drinks take a while to come and service is usually slower but extremely knowledgeable! I ask to be surprised with something made with Tequila and am never disappointed with a drink that has over 7 ingredients in it. Bartenders know their trade and the atmosphere is whimsical and refreshing. Also like the list of rules as it keeps all the annoying people off their cell phones, drunks to find a different bar, and trashy people to stay at bay. Dress nice and have a drink in mind other than a light beer or shot.
