I love this place to get dessert. OMG- their PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE is one of my ultimate favorite, absolutely heavenly desserts in the entire world- NO JOKE!!!! YOU MUST GET THIS!!! It's this caramelized, buttery, brown sugary, crusty pineapple in this sweet moist cake, drizzled with caramel and served warm with vanilla ice cream. It's sweet, chewy, crunchy, caramely, pineapplely goodness in every, single, amazing bite. I dream about this dessert. And the ambience is awesome. Our server totally sucked though, we had to go actively looking for him, and our dessert sat out on the counter for over 5 minutes (I saw it on the way to the bathroom and on the way back).
