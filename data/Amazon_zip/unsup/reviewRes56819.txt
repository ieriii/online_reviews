I must say that this pizzeria is far from authentic. Living in FL, my girlfriend and I go every Sunday night to a pizza joint to experience the best pizza maker this side of the Atlantic. I will not mention that restaurants name nor his name because I want to validate my displeasure with Spacca. Both of us have spent time in Italy and know the flavor, taste and experience of an authentic Italian flat pizza. We were excited to have Spacca recommended to us from the same chef in FL. He assured us that the owner did his apprenticeship and purchased his equipment from Napoli, thus making him a good cook.So, we made the trip from River North on the train. Once we got there, the owner of the restaurant was running himself tired. We knew right away that if he was the owner, he couldn't be possibly making the pizzas. We put our names in and waited a short 15 minutes. Seemingly because other people were told the same thing we were told, that the pizza was authentic. After we sat down, we were greeted by a nice server. Ordered some frizzante and two pizzas, one margherita and one margherita with proscuitto.WHAT DISAPPOINTMENT!The pizzas were undercooked, and you could tell, if you feeble people knew anything about authentic Italian Pizza, that they had been pass producing them, turning them too fast, thus being undercooked. The owner has obviously been confronted with an enormous amount of business and has hired 2 or 3 cooks from central america making $10/hr to ruin the pizzas. I will tell everyone I know that this place is fake and should be put on the worst restaurant list in Chicago. We gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the server was nice and the place was clean. What a waste of time. The owner needs to either get back to the oven and hire someone to host or give up the job he has been acclaimed for doing. He is a fake.
