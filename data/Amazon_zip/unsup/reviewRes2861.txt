I was introduced to Tru because my roommate had brought home a few financiers, which were delicious and definitely heightened my expectations of Tru. My friend and I each ordered the 3-course tasting menu, and got to sample 5 of the 6 desserts on the menu, among other things small amuse bouches. My favorites were the lime & blueberry "vacherin," and the gianduja souffle. The service throughout the dessert tasting was painstakingly perfect, and it was almost perplexing for me to figure out how the waitstaff would so carefully and silently coordinate their service for my table. I would strongly suggest coming here for a very occasion...because if you're like me (and didn't really come for a particular special occasion), you'll wonder what type of place would top this for an even more romantic evening.
