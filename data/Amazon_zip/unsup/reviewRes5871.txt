Wow, I definitely was impressed. A tad pricey for some of the items we got but everything was good. Ricotta with honey? OMG GET! I was scared to ignore this as I hate honey and I don't like ricotta but I thought this was the most delicious thing ever. Egged on by yelp and my dining companion of course to order as this many people can't be wrong. Mascropone with Ragu Delicious, like creamy potatoes with meat. It doesn't taste that good cold though so gobble it up right away. Cace peco? (the pasta dish) This was delicious, and I can see why it comes in such a small portion(it's really very rich and simple) but I thought it was overpriced at $10. If it was $8 or something that would be more worth it. I guess percino cheese is expensive. Pizza della Really yummy even the day after (made my kitchen smelled great) but my taste buds didn't tell me wrong. This was slightly overdone, somewhat burnt on some pieces. I was stuffed when it first came out so I thought it was maybe me since my dining companion didn't say anything. The parts that were not overdone were good. Can't wait to try the others!
