stellar experience!!! my fiance took me here this past saturday night for my bday dinner... it was a 6 course tasting that was amazing... and don't let "tasting" fool you... it was plenty of food, and i like to eat. so don't ever worry about not getting enough. i also can't say enough about the dessert... most amazing, light, delicious dessert. also, this is byob, so it was so much fun to bring our own favorite wine and save money, too. the service there was fantastic. they had so many wine coolers, and the servers were constantly making sure we had enough wine poured from what we brought. absolutely awesome... do make sure you give this place a try!!! i can't wait for us to bring others to experience this. our good friends told us about this and we checked yelp before and knew we had to try, and glad we did. we'll be coming back for sure!
