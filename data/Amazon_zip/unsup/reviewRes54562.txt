A lovely, inexpensive lunch in Wicker Park. The falafel sandwiches are delish and the crowd is laid-back and fun to watch. It does suck that they don't take plastic, but I have this small obsession with the idea that lunches taste better (and films are more enjoyable, sweaters are prettier, &tc) when paid for in cash. So it's aright with me.
