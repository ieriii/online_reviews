they have a big space here, but on popular days ie: sports games, etc.. this place can get packed. but it is a fun place to go to for game days.. lots of tvs.. just make sure you go early to get a table... even w/o games on.. this place has always seemed to have tons of people.. if you and your company get stuck sitting at the lower tables where one side is booth and the other side has chairs.. it gets a little too close for comfort. the tables are soo close to one another.. my husband and i actually left because i felt so restricted and closed in by people on both sides of us. pizza is delish though. tons of topping options. never have been disappointed with my pizza here.
