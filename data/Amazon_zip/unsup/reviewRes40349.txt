Location is across the street from the blue line, but Logan square is a bit of a hike. Wait for a table for four on a Wednesday night was an hour and a half- get there early and grab a cocktail (ask the hostess what's good). Cool decor/ambiance/crowd. Pretty small space, prep to stand while you wait for your table. Menu is exotic as far as I'm concerned. We ordered duck pate, wild boar sloppy joe, and sweet breads at our table. I didn't care for the duck and didn't try the sweet breads (cow's thymus gland, looks like a boneless wing), but the sloppy joe was really good. Service was great. Bathrooms clean. Great date spot, but not much else around. Dim lighting.
