I'd been trying to decide if I should save this local gem for a date or a visit from my sister. Little Sis introduced me to sushi, so I think of her with every wasabi-tinged bite, but I must say I'm very glad my first visit to Coast was on date-night. The dark, sleek, candle-lit interior makes you feel a bit sexier before your Miso soup even hits the table. Speaking of the Miso soup, it was delicious. And don't worry, they do have spoons if you are hopelessly Western like me and want to scoop out every last bit of tofu goodness. Next was the toro sashimi. Heavenly. As promised, it practically melted on your tongue. We followed with three different rolls (Spider - a personal favorite, Alaska, and Hamachi Jalapeno). My date picked the Hamachi Jalapeno, and to be honest, I wanted nothing to do with it (Jalapenos? Gross. No thanks. All yours, buddy). However, when they arrived, I had to try one (all in the name of Yelp, yo) and they were shockingly good! The jalapeno was very subtle - a very pleasant surprise. Throughout the meal, our server was great - very attentive and willing to help or explain if we had questions. I'll definitely be back - next time with Little Sis.
