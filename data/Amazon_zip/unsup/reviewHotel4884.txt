I would not recommed this hotel. The staff was very rude. A hotel security in a suit stopped me from taking photos inside the hotel. He was extremely aggressive with me, got really close to me, and seemed to have issues other than keeping the hotel safe. He and other staff left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  They didn't seem to appreciate my business. There are so many awesome hotels in the area, so I will stay at another hotel next time.
