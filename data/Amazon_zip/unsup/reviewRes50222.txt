Big Jones is a great place for great food. My wife and I have been to Big Jones about 20 times total (big fan) and never been let down. Brunch is especially great and make sure you get your share of the beignets...trust me. Oh, and fried chicken on Tuesdays. But call ahead and reserve your order; it goes FAST! Fan for life!
