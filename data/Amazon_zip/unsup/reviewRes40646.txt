there is a gift and a curse of living a block from a world class taqueria. The gift being mouth watering tacos and the curse being my biological composition being 68% carne asada. tips from the well acquainted: 1) vets agree that, unless your on a hot date or in need of fresh OJ, you can skip the sitdown restaurant and go for the location next door with the big yellow and red sign. 2) unless you have a healthy appetite for greasy flower tortillas, skip the gringo burritos and stick with the tacos. They're a bit healthier for you (corn tortillas over flour, negligible but we'll take what we can get), more fun to eat, and a bit more authentic. 3) little known fact is that La Pasadita has killer Guac, and if you ask for it on the side, they'll give you a little ramekin of it for 50cents that will last you atleast 3 tacos. 4) got a vegetarian back in the pad? My roommate is always pining for their chili relleno tacos which she says are the best she's had outside of mexico.
