I've been going to this little gem now for about 4 years, and it's simply the BEST. After trying many italian places in Chicago, I keep coming back here for the WONDERFUL food, cute atmosphere, and excellent service. Some of my favorite parts:1. Warm, soft bread to start out with (not just a hard knob of bread like some places offer)2. Pumpkin Ravioli - too die for :-)3. Chicken Pesto Gnocchi - Also to die for :-)4. The Bread Pudding - holy cow, save room for this!5. Chef Anthony - so nice! he is always out and about chatting with people at some point during the night. He really cares about this place!Try it out! It can be really busy, but make a reservation, then it's no problem. When the weather is warm, sit outside at one of their patio tables, they are great!!
