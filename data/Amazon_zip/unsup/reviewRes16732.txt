Love love love this place. Love the decor, the ambiance and the drinks. I loved that they were playing slow jazzy latin music when we walked in, I loved the vibe that it gave of a prohibition-era laid back speakeasy private club... it takes you away and makes you feel special. I was lucky and went on a rare Saturday night without lines. The drinks were delicious and the menu items looked delectable, I will have to try out the fried peanut butter banana bites with wildflower honey and bacon next time. A wonderful find in the bustle of it all, a definitely must to take out-of-towners to. I wish there were more places like this. If anyone knows of any, please let me know.
