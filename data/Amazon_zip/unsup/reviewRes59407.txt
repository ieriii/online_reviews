The original location of Girodano's is still putting out delicious stuffed pizza, and the cheese alone is out of this world. They don't slather much sauce on their pizza, but if they did, you'd probably only be able to eat 1 slice. Pre-ordering your pizza when you walk in the door is a little odd, but the wait allowed me to try the spicy Italian Beef. The Italian Beef calzone with hot peppers was delicious, and they serve it with some au jus that really gives that beef a savory kick. The amount of peppers on it was perfect-not too spicy, but definitely a flavor party! I liked Giordano's much better than Gino's East; the latter's cornbread crust really turned me off, to be honest.
