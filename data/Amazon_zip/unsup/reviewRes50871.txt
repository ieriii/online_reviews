I'm not sure how many times I have visited Big Jones, but I have been there for both dinner and brunch, and now consider Big Jones one of those rare restaurants where I KNOW I will have a great dining experience whenever I visit. Service is ALWAYS friendly, though occasionally inconsistent in quality, but only to the point of quaintness, as if I were dining with family. My first-ever visit to Big Jones was perhaps mid-2010; I had heard that Chef Paul Fehribach was serving a dish with monkfish liver, and since I had never tried that, I made a reservation.  Each dish was amazing, but that monkfish liver preparation demonstrated Chef Paul's brilliance with flavor combinations: rich umami of the liver, bruleed with sugar for sweetness, bitter frisee dressed with a slightly sour vinaigrette ... not only one of the best dishes of the year, but of my life, and I've dined in some of the top restaurants of North America and Europe.  Each subsequent visit has been rewarded by more deliciousness and brilliance. This sort of consistency is rare in restaurants, and while the cuisine is billed as "upscale Southern," it is so much more than that. It is a gastronomic destination that yields unpredictable but amazing gustatory delights.
