if you want greasy, this is your place.i cant believe how many people are raving about this restaurant. yes, it's inexpensive and it's packed, so people do love it, i just think that if you're hoping to get authentic mexican food that is wholesome and natural (ie, lots of veggies and not so deep fried -- which is what i was hoping for) then this isnt the restaurant that you should visit. in my opinion, it's just your typical, greasy mexican restaurant where you feel like your getting bigger with each bite.
