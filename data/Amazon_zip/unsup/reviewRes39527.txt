So, I live out in the 'burbs, but a couple times a month I try to head into the city to go out to eat with a foodie buddy of mine. This time though, we didn't even meet up til almost 10, so we knew our food choices would be limited to bars. After a short perusal of this site, we settled on Longman & Eagle - but we did not "settle" on quality of food. It was without a doubt the best food I've had in a hipster bar/pub ever. I think the experience would have been even better for me if my drink tastes didn't run (in the words of my friend) "from the girly to the super girly" since this place had a bourbon selection that made my friend swoon (85ish). The Great: What we ordered: 3 drinks, the welsh rarebit (that crispy soft pretzel was AMAZING) - bar snack, ricotta gnudi - small plate, tete du cuchon - small plate, pork shoulder - entree, and flank steak - entree. This perfectly rare specimen of steak was mine, and I cleaned my plate. Even with a morel jus (I'm not a mushroom fan) and creamed ramps (the closest I get to dark greens is spinach dip). The Good: All of the above for $125 (including tax and tip). The Less than Good: The one, singular complaint I have about the food is that my steak was a little over-salted - not to the point where it wasn't yummy, but the salt made it taste less steaky and probably not as delicious as it could have been.
