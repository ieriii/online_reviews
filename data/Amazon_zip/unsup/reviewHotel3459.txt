Our stay was pleasant. The rooms are definitely small and our view was a brick wall - but that's to be expected for the reasonable deal I got on a nice hotel in a large city. If a view is important, and it should be for anything more than one night, ask for a good one. The brick wall was dreary. The location is what this place is really all about. Just blocks from Watertower Mall and other Magnificent Mile shopping. The room was relatively clean, though I did see an errant hair around the shower drain which is a pet peeve of mine. Decor is updated and stylish. I wished for a coffee maker in the room but wasn't there long enough to worry about it. The lounge/bar area is small but effective for late night cocktails. My only serious complaint would be the $48 for overnight valet. That's a little steep for Chicago but my car was brought up quickly and the valet staff was friendly and professional. Overall, hotel staff was functional, the room was clean, the price was good, and the location was perfect. I might stay here again though I'm not uninterested in trying another hotel with better views for the price just off Michigan Ave.
