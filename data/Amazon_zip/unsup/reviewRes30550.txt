My wife and I dined here for the first time yesterday. We waited an hour and a half to see what all the hype was about and glad we did. Great food and great service, Krash was awesome! Both of are sandwiches and sweet potato fries were excellent. The shake was great as well. Only negative was we brought a couple extra desserts home and they were not very good. But our dinners and shake still make it 5 stars. We will be back.
