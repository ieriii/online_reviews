11am. 7 people. 2.5 hours. 8 margaritas. 2 mojitos. 1 Topo Chico. 2 Diet Pepsis. 2 Agua de Jamacia. Appetizer Sampler platter made for 6. 3 Carne Asadas. 1 Sopitas. 1 Hot Cakes Indigenas. 1 Enchiladas con Huevos y Bistec. 1 of every dessert. 1 extra order of flan. 1 Skirt Steak tacos with 2 pieces of Applewood Smoked Bacon to go. 2 cups of coffee. Everything was gone. Seriously. Every bit of every plate and every drop of every drink was eaten. Now home and about to go into food coma.
