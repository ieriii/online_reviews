Ick. Ball of cheese. I went with three friends on a recent trip to Chicago and we all thought the pizza needed more crust, more filling, and more sauce; anything but more cheese! We all left feeling sad and confused- is that really what Chicago deep dish is supposed to be like? I've certainly enjoyed the deep dish I've had in other cities, including San Francisco, much better.
