The sushi at this place ROCKS!!! Esp the White Dragon Roll...it is a MUST have! Also, I like the fact that they have a good amt of veggie sushi...my wife is veg so we can both enjoy the sushi here! However, I am taking 1 star away b/c the desert we ordered was just pathetic! I think it was called fruit sticks which really was few pieces of fruit on a stick and small bowl of hot fudge...it was nothing new...deserts could be better! oh and btw, this place is BYOB so be sure to bring a bottle of wine or sake if u plan to drink...
