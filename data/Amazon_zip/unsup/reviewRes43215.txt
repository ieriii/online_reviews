The place is ideal for brunch. If you don't have a waiting time they are very efficient about the food. Order at the counter and they bring the food to you fresh and fast. Atmosphere is a little busy but quite cozy. Perfect for a quick brunch. It is true the Huevos Rancheros are quite delish. Its cheap and comes in a huge bowl. mmmmm... FYI: The rush on the weekend we went started around 10AM. They open at 8.
