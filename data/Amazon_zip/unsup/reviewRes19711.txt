Semolina dumplings with fiddleheads. They are yummy in my tummy and probably the #1 reason why I will continue to return to The Gage. Also, this is the place that taught me all about the deliciousness that is a perfectly roasted baby beet. The menu at the Gage changes throughout the season along with the selection at the local farmer's market. Yes, this place is pricey, and it does attract a seriously yuppie after-work crowd. But, for those who want to experience a well-prepared and flavorful meal paired with the perfect wine, then you should overlook the shoulder to shoulder crowd and make a reservation. I have come here with friends before and after concerts at the Symphony and Buddy Guys; have sat in the outdoor sidewalk area, the private party room in the back, as well as at a bar table on the edge of the bar area. Each time, I have enjoyed myself, my conversations with the wait staff, bartenders, and sommeliers, and delighted in the food. Great date place for those willing to splurge a little. The average price of dinner for two with a bottle of wine or a couple of cocktails per person comes to around $100.00 to $150.00
