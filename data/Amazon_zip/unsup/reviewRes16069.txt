Before your evening enjoying the entertainment at Madrigals, you must stop at Calo's for some dinner and pre-party cocktails. While enjoying your excellent meal you may be entertained by the live "wedding band' or Elvis impersonator. Hope you have your dancing shoes on...cause when "Celebration" breaks out...it is mayhem on the dance floor! Once you go to Calo's you will be back.
