My new favortie place!  Went yesterday with a party of 5. They do not take reservations, so we went early (5:30) and was seated right away. I guessing by 6:30, you'd be waiting at the bar (which would be fine)! They have rooftop seating also, but we ate inside. We each picked 2 different items off the menu - think Italian tapas - and shared everything.  Everything was so good!  My favorites:  special ragu/polenta, mushroom pizza, risotto, ricotta w/honey.  I could have passed on the pork belly, but others at the table liked it.  Wine selection was great - service was awesome. Can't wait to go back. There is a little wine bar right across the street that plays jazz. We stopped there after.
