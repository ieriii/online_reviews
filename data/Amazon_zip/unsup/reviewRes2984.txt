Went to TRU last night and everything else was exactly the same.... The service is still truly impeccable (if I can give 10 stars for it then I would), the ambience untouched but the food really wasnt as good as it was years ago. I had the 95 dollar prix fix menu and chose the lobster soup with Ground Hominy, Lobster emulsion and spoon breat (didnt really care for it), my bf had the beef cheek ravioli, marrow and orange bordelaise (delish). For the main course I had the Alaskan Halibut with Leek emulsion reduced Chardonnay and bacon vinaigrette (yummo) while he had the scottish king salmon, granny smith apples, coconut and thai long peppercorn (soso). I had the Dense chocolate for Dessert while he had the cheese plate. Mind you, the cheese plate had the most incredible cheese that I ever had.  We are both not dessert lovers but I sampled some and they were just ok for me nothing wanting me to have more.  Forget about the ambience and service but from the food per ce, I cant help but compare this place to Charlie Trotters and I have to say that Trotters would still be my choice. The restaurant is French progressive which means that they follow the culinary principles of french cooking and the cuisine is french-based but the end results are fusion so in short it is FRENCH FUSION. So dont get me wrong, FOOD is really good but it does not blow you taste buds like Charlie does I have been here 7 years ago and I loved it. I would recommend this place for the experience because it is a gastronomical one but for the amount of money we spent, I will try new places like Alinea or just try to make a reservatio n at Trotters. I like TRU but not enough to lure me back over and over again.  If the price is not so high I would have given this place 4 stars or even 5 but for this price, I expect a bit more.
