Yep, yep....another place that knows what they are doing. Beware that you have to get there at an decent hour (read 5:00pm) in order to get a table in the bar. However, if you are a lover of things involving alcohol, fantastic tastes, and a lot of choice this place is for you.  The beer selection is serious and you better have an idea of what you want before you step up to the bar. I found the bartenders to be a little pretentious but you know what?? You are in a freaking beer bar. Don't go here thinking you are going to sip on Bud. When in doubt say "Chimay Blue" and enjoy. I don't suspect you will remember too much if you stay for a while....
