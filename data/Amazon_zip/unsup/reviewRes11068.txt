I just don't get it. I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant this inconsistent. Literally every other time I go there, it's either phenomenal or totally unremarkable and borderline bland. Sometimes it's totally worth the hype and others it just doesn't make sense. I think at it's best, it's just slightly better than my stand-by favorite, Feast. At it's worst we're talking slightly above Denny's quality. Oh, how I would like to go here knowing that I'm going to get my breakfast burrito the way it was those few, magical times. But alas, it's a roll of the dice.
