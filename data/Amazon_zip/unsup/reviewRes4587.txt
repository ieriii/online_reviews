+ nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long waiting time Since it isn't that easy to find a nice hang-out on Magnificent Mile, which is not a rooftop bar and where you can sit outside without being blared by music I was happy to find 'The Purple Pig'. I have to admit that it is hard to get a table without a longer waiting time but the wait is worth it. The menu offers decent European wines, most of them for less than $40 a bottle and tasty tapas/small plates you can share with your companions. But the most important you can spend hours talking and have an enjoyable evening with friends without being interrupted by noise. If you cannot decide on the menu try the milk braised pork with mashed potatoes, the spreads, and the artichoke, potatoes and asiago cheese appetizer. The restaurant's inside also looked promising but I guess it will be noisy. + nice patio to have drinks with friends, + delicious small plates to share, + good European wine selection, - long waiting time Average price for a plate: $10 Average price for a bottle of wine: $35
