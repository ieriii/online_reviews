I love finding cheap and easy food that's different from your usual greasy spoon or take out joint (or at least different from my usual greasy spoon or take out joint!). I went to Icosium Kafe tonight, looking for a quick and cheap meal with a friend (with the implicit understanding that we also like our food to taste good) and it absolutely fit the bill. For 8,50, you get a savory crepe and a cup of soup-it's a great deal, because they certainly don't skimp on their crepe fillings! The soup choices were "chicken" or "vegetable"-not particularly descriptive, but my vegetable soup was delicious! It was more of a puree than a clear soup with floating vegetables. I followed that up with a Crepa de Roma, after a serious internal debate over the menu (I can't wait to come back!). It was very good (tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, capers), but a little cold in certain parts. The food came almost immediately, I wouldn't have minded waiting a few more minutes for a piping hot crepe, but it wasn't a big enough problem to merit sending it back or complaining. Icosium Kafe is no frills, but very clean and very efficient service. And for 8.50, all I really need is my delicious crepe and cup of soup!
