This place is pretty good. They serve many side dishes although not all taste fantastic. I find their marinated meat to be a bit bland. It's definitely a good place to try Korean BBQ. Their service isn't all that great. You are going to smell like smoke for few days after visiting this place, so be warned. They open 24 hours a day, which is why it's getting 4 stars. Not many 24 hr places serve good and healthy food. On-site parking is somewhat limited, but you can always street park nearby.
