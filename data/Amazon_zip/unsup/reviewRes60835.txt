I did not know I would be paying $50 for food that sat out all day. How many people sneezed, coughed, and spread germs on the food before I ate it? I can tell you enough that I now sit here with the flu. I spent around $180 for my wife and I to eat. Next time we go out to dinner I will not dine where I have to serve myself off a buffet. If your looking to go out and try small portions of different food, I recommend one of the many tapas restaurants in town. You will pay less and have higher quality food.
