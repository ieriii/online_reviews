To be honest, after reading all of the hype, I expected a lot more out of Pequod's. Don't get me wrong, they served up a good deep dish pizza, but I actually found the bottom crust somewhat spongy and dry. The best part of the pizza, by far, was the carmelized crust....I wish I had an entire pizza of just that. If I'm ordering a deep dish again, I'll likely give Pequod's another try, as it ranks right up there with Gino's, Giordano's and all of the other Chicago staples. Also, while the food probably deserved 3.5 stars, I had to deduct the half star for the terrible customer service when ordering.
