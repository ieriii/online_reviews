This is absolutely one of my favorite places in Chicago and I have been here countless times. To begin with, the atmosphere is fun, fresh and bright. Wonderful for a large group (they add tip with large groups as noted on their menu). They will make you wait regardless if you have a reservation or not so that you can sit at their bar for about 15-20 minutes. I have had many of their frozen cocktails and all are worth the time and are delicious. The fresh guacamole is devine and my favorite part of the meal. The chips are crisp and homemade and they use locally grown veggies. Opt for the large sized guac. Fish taco apps are really wonderful as well. I do not eat meat but my friends meals looked fantastic. It is a high energy place that is wide open space, but they have seating areas that are off to the side of the main dining room that provide more of a private space. I absolutely love this place for birthdays and group events. Two new-ish things that are exciting in my world is the photobooth and shoe dispenser in the basement by the bathrooms lol You CAN find metered parking (free after 8/9pm) if you look around the area but they do provide valet for a fee.
