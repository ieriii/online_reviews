I've been a fan of Sunda for a few years now. We make it an annual stop for our convention calendar. I took the family this last time. Great experience as usual.Our server was great, made some great suggestions although we were a bit disappointed with the crispy rice sushi. We ordered a carafe of the sangria. Interesting but pretty bland so we added some of the mango syrup from our kids beverages and we were back in the saddle. Our show season starts at the end of the month so we'll surely be back.
