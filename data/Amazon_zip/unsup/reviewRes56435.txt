I came in here for lunch today and it was fabulous!Prices shocked me at how much I can get for so little money. Beef sandwich for lunch with all the little extras they give you at this place. Since it was sunny today, I also opted for the fruit smoothie, fresh fruits and blended on the spot I've never tried such an amazing bubble tea. I work on a pretty tight schedule, and came in on my lunch hour, I was in and out on time back for work.Food was just delicious, and as I am able to write this from work. I plan on coming here after I get off work for dinner tonight, we'll see how that goes. I'm excited!
