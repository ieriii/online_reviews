This has to be one of the ODDEST sushi restaurants I've ever been to. #1. Has anyone looked at there website??? It's pretty scary to me. . . Especially the front page with some lady holding a knife? #2. The restaurant looks very strange on the outside! It's all black and no windows I believe. Somewhat "sketchy" looking. #3. There isn't a sushi bar!? Where does the sushi come from? Is it even sanitary? #4. What are the servers wearing? My server had long hair (which she did not tie back... it was quite disturbing), and wearing a hoodie. I mean... I know the restaurant is more low key, but the staff can still look tidy. Not to mention it is a health code violation to to tie her hair back. Pros: Good sushi for the price, Byob Cons: #1 - 4 + Small Will I go back? Probably not! Food gets 3 stars, everything else 1-2. Enjoy! :)
