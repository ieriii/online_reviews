This was a real find. Wonderful small plates. A foodies paradise on S. Michigan Ave. Smoked quail with polenta was awesome. Butternut squash dumplings with lamb ragout - another great dish. Spinach a la catalina with currents pine nuts and apple was wonderful. Beef shorty rib flatbread - amazing. Chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallows - what a way to finish things off.
