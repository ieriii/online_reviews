woweeee, delicious!!! try the german riesling!!! it goes great with the spicy food... they start you off with free naan & this delicious tomato dipping sauce... we started off with the tandoori peh-kush (mixed platter of tandoori: chicken tikka, chicken reshmi kabab, lamb boti kabab, fish tikka, tandoori shrimp and tandoori chicken) DELISHHHHHHHHHHH!!! then me & boyfriend both tried their house specialities... kadhai khana's.... i had the samundari (prawns, crabs & lobsters) and he had the lamb.... both were delicious. even tho it was the same sauce persay... the different proteins made the sauce taste differently... we paired our food with saffron rice & two different naans... (kashmiri: pineapple cherries & walnuts... and khurmi: garlic, tomato and chili)... DEF get the kashmiri.. it's fluffy, thick and stuffed with the sweet filling... the latter was good but just super garlicky and i couldn't taste the chili (not spicy *pout) we ended the night with two cups of tea (altho i'm a huge fan of dessert, i find indian desserts to be too sweet) My review: http://misstiffie.wordpr
