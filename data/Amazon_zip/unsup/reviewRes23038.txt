You have to be either very hungry or prepared to eat leftovers for a week if you visit this restaurant. I know an oatmeal shake sounds a bit odd but give it a try . . . I was surprised to find out that it was actually delicious. Who knew? Be prepared to wait 15-20 minutes for a table or if you don't feel like waiting there is always carry out.
