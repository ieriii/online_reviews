I haven't had fondue at many places, but the few I have had it at have taught me that it's either done very right or very wrong! Geja's Cafe does it to perfection! We started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. I had a Strawberry Mojito that was one of the best mojitos I've ever had. Then we were seated in a nice booth, which is so much more private than a table. We started with the house salad, which was very good...loved the dressing, though it may have been a bit too much. That was followed by their signature cheese fondue that I couldn't stop eating, such a good blend of cheeses! We both had the Aged Beef Tenderloin which was delicious, especially dipped in the multiple sauces they bring to each table. I could barely find room to get in even a few bites of the chocolate fondue, but what I did have was delicious. I highly recommend this place, but you MUST MAKE RESERVATIONS ahead of time. They take walk-ins, but one couple that arrived at the same time as us, was still waiting at the bar 2 hours later when we left. When you do make reservations I highly suggest asking for a booth. They won't guarantee it, but at least asking will give you a better chance of getting one. The booths are so much better because the tables are so close together!
