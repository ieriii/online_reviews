We went here on the recommendation of someone we met and because it popped up under my PLACES app. We were seated without a reservation very quickly but inside and not outside. There were tables empty but the wait was an hour for one. If you have empty tables and an hour wait you haven't balanced your waitstaff properly. The menu seemed very interesting. Opting for a fowl meal, I chose the fried chicken livers. Awful. Over cooked beyond consumption. I would have asked our server to take it back and bring another but we never saw her again in a reasonable amount of time before our entrees arrived. When I finally got the bus help to ask her over, she was defensive about this, saying "If I'd asked her she would've brought another one". That's fine if you're checking your tables, but you weren't. Thankfully the manager came over and said he'd take them off the bill. The roasted amish chicken arrived and I would imagine this should have some kind of specific flavor and it didn't. It's just plain roasted chicken. Even what I get at the grocery store has more flavor. AT least it was juicy and not overcooked. The wine choices are decent but horribly overpriced considering the prices on the menu. $67 for a bottle of California red is way too much considering the most expensive entree is $38. The place needs to re-price it's wines or get other choices that are more in line with the entree prices. The ambiance of the establishment is very nice. The green subway tiles on the columns are very handsome. There are lot's of places to eat in the Loop, but I wouldn't visit this place a 2nd time.
