Ahhhh, India House. I love this place so much.  I believe the lunch buffet is the best deal they have, so that is when I go for the most part. The staff is extremely attentive. So attentive in fact, that my sister, cousin and I play a little game to see how low we can get our water glass before they refill it. Trust me when I say that it is RARE to be able to get your water glass completely empty. That is impressive. But if you want to fully enjoy their buffet, I advise against playing this game. Just take my word for it. I have been here once for dinner where I actually ordered off the menu and I had Chicken Chili Masala. Now, I have always been a fan of Chicken Tikka Masala, as it is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so I thought I would get a little crazy. Oh. My. God.
