I've only been to Wishbone during the week, but I can imagine how crowded it can get during weekend brunch rush. I love Wishbone because of how spacious and colorful everything is and how good the food is. Most of the breakfast dishes are pretty standard: omelettes pancakes etc. Hands down, the stand out at Wishbone is the crunchy french toast. How is it crunchy? They coat it in smashed up corn flakes! It's like a textural applause in my mouth. They also suggest trying the french toast with some fancy schmancy Vermont maple syrup, unless you're some kind of syrup sommelier save your money for a different side (see below) Thankfully, the crunchy french toast is easy to replicate at home, but I'll keep coming back to Wishbone for brunch anyway. Other highlights: cheese grits, fresh squeezed OJ and crawfish cakes.
