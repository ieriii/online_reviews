I would definitely get breakfast at The Yolk again. This place has a nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and their food portion is HUGE! I could not finish their peach cobbler crepe, which is more of a dessert than a breakfast item. I would advise you to split the fruit crepe with someone else unless you could handle the intense sweetness factor in one sitting.
