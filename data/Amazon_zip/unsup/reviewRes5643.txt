Loved this place! The atmosphere, the food, the wine, the service - all wonderful. First of all, they graciously accommodated our group as we grew and grew on a Friday night after work. Never complained. For food, we had the almonds, the cheese plate, lots of the prosciutto bread balls, and olives. Everything was delicious. And how cute are those bottles of water on the table? I always appreciate when I can serve myself and not wait for someone to notice my water glass is empty. The wine list is extensive and they offer some wines by the glass, 1/3 bottle, half bottle and full bottle. Our server was also able to suggest wines based on our descriptions of what we generally like and don't like. Can't wait to go back.
