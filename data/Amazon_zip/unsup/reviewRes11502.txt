snooze-a-roo. I ordered some breakfast sandwich, and when it showed up, it was just a croissant with two strips of bacon on it and nothing else, so fifteen minutes later when the waitress came back and I complained, she brought me a plate with the other stuff that was supposed to come on it. It cost 12 dollars and the wait is a half hour to be smashed in a corner where there is nowhere to put your winter coat. I can't understand the appeal of this place. I would recommend that folks try anything else for breakfast. Maybe a donkey punch or a dirty sanchez would be more satisfying.
