When it's 2:30am and you're slightly drunk and greasy food just isn't what you want this is the place to go. It's open 24 hours, so you just can't go wrong. I walked in with two friends expecting the place to be dead, but I was dead wrong, the place was half full.  We sat down and ordered out food, which comes out quickly cause you're obviously cooking it, and there are about 20 little dishes that come with the main meat. Now, if you're not adventurous don't go here without someone who knows all about the little dishes. The meat was okay, this is coming from someone who doesn't really like meat, but the people I was with enjoyed it. Overall it was a great late night snack and I would definitely go back sober or drunk. I would've given this place five stars if the server was a bit more friendly and told us what the dishes were.  NOTE: If you're really drunk it might be a bad thing to be sitting in front of an open flame.
