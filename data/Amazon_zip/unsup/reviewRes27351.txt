I have been here more times than I can remember at this point. I took my mom here, been on dates here and it just never seems to get old. I know there are other places in Pilsen, but I keep gravitating to Nuevo Leon. From the minute you walk in, you'll notice you're in a queue. It moves fairly quickly, but be prepared to wait (especially on the weekends). When you finally do sit down, there's a ton of people eating with you, mostly in groups. It's worth it. I've had the mole and the beef tongue and was satisfied. It was just the right amount of food. They also have a delicious horchata, my favorite. Parking's becoming a problem on 18th, but you can usually find some on 19th near the museum or you'll have to head west on 18th a bit more.
