I wish I liked this place better as my wife likes going here, but it is sooooo boring and bland. I have tried a few different things and have never been impressed by anything that I've tried. The food here takes absolutely no chances. Lowest common denominator all the way. Don't expect any bold flavors unless you condsider salt bold. They certainly have an audience for this type of food, but I am not the target.
