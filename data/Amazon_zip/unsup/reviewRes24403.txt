Pretty good food. I like the food here, i'm just not as taken by it as others seem to be. I love seeing a vegetarian section on any menu. The vegetarian burrito is pretty good, but i can't stand the mushrooms they put on it (by request only). I don't know if it's the way they are prepared or if they are canned or what but they are not good. The vegetarian salad is very small. The green salsa is super hot n good. The chile relleno is pretty good and stuffed with tons of cheese. The sides are good but nothing special. The best thing about this place is the shakes. Got to try a shake and get one you can't pronounce. Call ahead for take out cause if you have to wait inside there isn't much room.
