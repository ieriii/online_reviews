First of all, I have to say that, in my opinion, Sushi X has the best sushi in the city. They have very unique rolls and you get a lot for your money - AND they are absolutely delicious. Tonight a friend of mine who used to live in Chicago and is visiting and I ordered sushi that we picked up and brought home. When we got home, we realized that even though our reciept had the correct order, they made a mistake and gave us the wrong order. We were so dissapointed - but it was late and we were so hungry, so we started to eat what they gave us. It was good, but just not what we had ordered and had wanted. I called and explained what had happened, and even though we were out of their delivery range, they appologized for the mix up and delivered the 3 rolls that we had orginally ordered. Now that's great customer service!!! We couldn't have been happier, and will be back soon for sure!
