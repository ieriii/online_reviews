My husband and I have wanted to come here for several years and finally made it a priority for Restaurant Week.  I will say that I love, love, love the decor. My friend said it had a "Tommy Bahama" feel to it. Airy, relaxing, and beautiful inside. Our server was helpful and attentive. I really liked him and appreciated the good service. He even checked to make sure we had enough time to get my husband and coworker back to work- even though they can take as long as they want at lunch. Thoughtful.  The highlight of the meal was the cha gio- a fried roll with a side of veggies to wrap around it. Totally delicious. I will be back for this appetizer and a cocktial next time. The other parts of the meal were not too exciting for me: banh Pho Xao and Crispy banana wonton With crme anglaise & DARK CHOCOLATE SAUCE. The entree was fine but dull. It was very similar to lad nar, and unfortunately, I have had better versions. The dessert would have been delicious with chocolate inside the wonton with the bananas. They do something similar at Ben Pao, which is not as nice of a restaurant as Le Colonial. The dessert at Ben Pao is much better. I will be back for the lovely appetizer and a drink when the weather improves!
