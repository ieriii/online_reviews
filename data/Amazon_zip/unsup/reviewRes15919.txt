We waited outside in the blistering cold for an hour to get in here....and it was worth it! It's so dark and intimate inside and the chairs are so contemporary-gothic, it's like new-age vampire (not those pansy sparkly twilight ones), or at least that's what it reminds me of. The drinks were EXPENSIVE. But hey, you don't get some crap that some random ass guy at a bar slopped together and called it a long island. No, these are meticulously constructed works of alcoholic art done by professionals! I recommend trying something with egg whites in it because the frothy foamy whipped texture is unlike any other and makes drinks taste creamy without the density of milk or cream. Mm Mm GOOD.
