Hard to complain about a place after I just blew $200 on dinner...I would just feel like a dumb*ss. So I will give four stars and be honest. Geja's is rated the most romantic restarant in Chicago so I was ready to treat my male friend to this as it was my first time planning a paying for our date. We were a little early (15 minutes) for our resevervations and were told we will have to wait. We aopted to go to the wine bar next door and have some pre-dinner drinks. The wine bar (don't remember the name) was very chique...things were going well. I was excited to try something new and loved the intimate setting that this venue provided. But the smell...was a little overwhelming. I decided on the lobster etc dinner with a bottle of wine and desert. I realized half way through the meal that I was soooo over the grilling my own veggies in hot oil and smelling the smell of veggies and meat being seared in hot oil...I just wanted some "Outback" at that point. We completed the meal...and had the desert but I was a bit dissappointed. I think I blew $200-250 on that meal...plus wine and wine bar, but the food was not that appealing to the palate. The wine was decent but the meal in and of itself would not warrant a return visit...and they need better ventilation...cause hot greasy lobster..is.not a particularly appetizing odor.
