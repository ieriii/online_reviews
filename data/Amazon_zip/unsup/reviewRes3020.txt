First, not sure where the perception that Rich T. has anything to do with this restaurant but he left like two years ago. Unfortunately the portion size issue has not changed since he left the kitchen...it was a problem when he was there and is since he was gone. Unfortunately I made reservations to go with a client who wanted to go while he was in town and found out after we went that the current Chef left about two weeks ago which explains why the food was uneven and my client was completely disappointed also which did not make the bill any easier to swallow. I heard Les Francais closed recently...maybe they could get the chef from there...at least the food would meet the price then...The reason I gave three stars was that for that type of money the place should provide superb dishes every course and some of them were just okay...one was undercooked...However when it comes to service there still is no better place in the city, starting with the valet through the meal...
