Almost eerily hospitable staff serve up a mixed bag of dishes in a cozy Lincoln Park setting. I ordered the lemongrass chicken and was not disappointed: it was fragrant, tender, and not overly oily. My friend had some kind of beef dish that he liked well enough, but I found it addled by that unfortunate "tastes like gasoline" phenomenon. Balance a so-so appetizer with free tea and oranges, and well...I am caught between 3 and 4 stars.
