Friggin Yummy!!! Came to this spot for Gal Pal breakfast and this place is amazing, refreshing and bright. Food and atmosphere. a very comfy place and really is a good group spot for brunch. Have yet to try dinner, but can't wait to. A friend of mine had the baked chilaquiles, I had a bite of those, they were delish, my plate was the Nanadict which a version of eggs benedict with a latin flair. made with popusas rather than english muffin. I can't get over how great the good was. So glad Gal Pal Breakfast club came here. Lattes were perfectly delish. Service was great also, very friendly and no way do they rush to get you in and out. Loved it! and I will go back. =)
