I feel that Violet Hour is overrated, having been there three times, I think it's safe to say I should have stopped at the first visit. First off, you have to wait in this teeny tiny room all squished up with other people while you wait for someone to seat you...this process is more ambiguous than I'm describing. The place is very dark and is decorated with velvet -- the color scheme is plain and uninteresting. The second time I went, we were completely ignored by the waiter, so we left and decided to come back another day (because my bf had never been there).  We finally had a chance to go back for drinks and we weren't too impressed (you'd think you'd get amazing drinks for $12+).  Overall, this is a good place to take a date or to come to once, otherwise, you should waste your money elsewhere.
