We have gone to Meli's on Halsted and the Ontario location. We had a bad experience at the one on Ontario so we decided to give their original location, on Halsted another try. On both locations we were served promptly, but also on both occasions the food came ice cold. I ordered the French Toast. The menu said that for $1.25 extra, you can get "real" maple syrup. I asked for that and our waitress said they only served real syrup. My table mates all ordered egg dishes. Skillets came warm, their toast was not freshly toasted, therefore, cold. My French toast was ICE COLD as was my bacon. The syrup was not real. Our server did not come by to ask how are food was, and when we were given the check I mentioned that my food was served cold. I hardly ate any of my dish. she said I should have said something. Perhaps I would have if she would have asked. I was very surprised that the manager did not come by after a complaint was made. This shows very bad management. My meal should have been taken off the bill. Then I would give them another try. Their prices are so high, you would think the food would match the price. I never will return. For the price,I expect hot food, and management that cares how their customers meals are served.
