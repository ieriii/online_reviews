I wouldn't change a thing. My girlfriend picked Geja's for a celebratory dinner. This place really fit the bill. The dcor is over the top romantic with dim lighting and live guitar music. Fondue in general is a social, calm and relaxing dining experience. The food was excellent and competitively priced. We went with the option, which included a starter cheese fondue followed by a main course of lobster, scallops, shrimp, steak and chicken that are accompanied with about 12 different dipping sauces (the dill and horseradish are particularly yummy). The meal was finished with a chocolate fondue set aflame to roast marshmallows with...I don't think I've ever been so stuffed that I didn't finish dessert until this day.  The wait staff was amazing, always attentive and had that special talent to always sweep in when you need something but never hovered or interrupted an important conversation. I have been to melting pot, which is nice and does have good servie but honestly this place blows them out of the water. Everything is just done better here. Granted the prices not conducive to dining here every night (well at least for me) but I will absolutely keep Geja's on my short list of pricey options for a special night out that is well worth the money!
