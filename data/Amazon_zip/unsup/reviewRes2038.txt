You cannot get any better than Hot Doug's when it comes to a hot dog shop. They do not cut any corners when it comes to your hot dog. From a wide range of fancy dogs, one had foie gras on it, to your simple dogs. All the dogs are cooked and prepared very well, ingredients are fresh, the duck fat fries are pretty darn good, and the service is great. Doug has mastered the art of the Dog!!!!!
