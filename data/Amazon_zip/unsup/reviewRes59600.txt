The food is delicious, but they can certainly do better on the service. If you go there, don't expect to be treated nice. Remember that restaurant with the bitchy waitress???? Yep. That's the one I am talking about. Think about that restaurant, then you won't be disappointed. Overall, If you are in just for the good food, it is the place for you. If you like to be pampered, go someplace else. There are others in the area.
