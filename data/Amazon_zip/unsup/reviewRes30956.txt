First time at Mastros and my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite! The wine list is good with a variety of pricing. The pomegranate martini was fabulous.....and they actually know how to make a Korbel old fashioned! Our server, Heather was friendly and attentive. We are steak house junkies and we both loved the variety of side dishes. The charred Brussels sprout quickly became a favorite.......as did the sinfully delicious butter cake. A MUST try if you go. Chef Justin has this set up great. We can't wait to come back! We need to try more and stay later to enjoy the bar scene.
