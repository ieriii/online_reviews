Dined at Icosium this afternoon with the husband. I have walked by dozens of times and finally decided to give it a go. SO glad I did!! Kafe Mocha - organic, not too sweet...yum! Iberica crepe - sounded interesting, but wasn't sure if it would be delish or strange. It was definitely delicious! Savory with a touch of sweet and a hint of spice. Well done! Chicago crepe - good, not amazing. Lacked the POW of flavor the Iberica had, but still very tasty. Both crepes came with soup! I had veg and hubby had lamb stew. Both yummy! Our server was sweet and the busboys were constantly cleaning up and refilling water. I had lipstick on my water glass. I understand these things happen so I won't hold it against them. They were very apologetic and brought me a new glass right away! I can't wait to go back and try some other crepe creations! I think this would be a great place to bring visitors too!
