Disney land for your mouth. The bad: We were kinda stuck in a corner where the only way for my dinner companion to get out was for them to move the table. Our primary waiter was very proper. Although I list it as bad, it added an elitist vibe that let us know that he took his job very seriously. Food secret service serious.  The good: The wait staff was totally on the ball and my glass was only half full once. Everything was immaculately clean. It looked like an OCD person came and cleaned it just before we arrived. If something had fallen on the floor, I would have been totally comfortable eating it regardless. The decorations were warm and friendly. I wish my house looked that nice. The great: The front hallway lets you know that you are in for something special. I tasted things that I will never taste anywhere else ever again. Everything was presented in a way that was a fusion of art and science. I wanted to take a photo of every dish they brought out but I was scared I would look like a tourist. One of the waiters said "We are all food nerds here." and laughed like a boy about to do something really wild. I was jealous of how much he enjoyed his job. The dessert was prepared directly on the table cloth by the head chef... on the table... no plates, bowls, or saucers... on the special table cloth. Blow torches and liquid nitrogen were included in the process... Mad scientist kinda stuff going on here. A few people on Yelp have said that this is a once in a lifetime experience. Damn the cost, we will be back when they change the menu. I am a customer for life.
