This restaurant was incredible! I had Bone Marrow which is a rare delicacy, Rack of Lamb for the entree, and Creamed Spinach as a side dish. All were incredibly yummy. I also went nuts for the complimentary bread that included pretzel bread!Atmosphere was great - the band music was a wee loud in the bar area, but it faded in and out. Staff was highly attentive and very patient in describing their specials. Our meal (party of 3) was about $300 (which includes the tip). Save up and come here - it's well worth the treat :)
