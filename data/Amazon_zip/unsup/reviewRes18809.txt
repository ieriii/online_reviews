A+ for Creativity and Obscure British Dishes. I had no idea what a "Scotch Egg" was. Turns out a Wikipedia page won't tell you that its delicious, so my yelp review will. ITS DELICIOUS! Don't think too hard about the cholesterol attack from deep frying a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat and coated in breadcrumbs. My entree was the Hanger Steak served with apple cider soaked watermelon and a coleslaw with marcona almonds. My steak was more well-done than I prefer, but it was good quality and flavorful. I loved the whimsy the watermelon added and the light taste and juiciness complemented the steak surprisingly well. It was steak, but still managed to be a light summer dish. The Cheesecake with some sort of liquor drizzle and graham cracker crust was wonderfully sweet, creamy, and bitter all at once. Somehow The Gage managed to serve a 3-course fixed lunch menu that didn't overwhelm me for the rest of the afternoon. Bravo! The basement dining space is elegant yet casual. I thought it was a good spot for a 50-person luncheon with presenters. I'm reserving my fifth star because of the overdone steak, and what seemed like a rather loud main dining area and slightly overpriced menu. However, I don't walk into too many Gastropubs and find them to have a creative, hearty, fresh, AND traditional menu. I will be back!
