I felt like a pawn in their little game.. We arrived & checked in about 15 minutes prior to our 10:15 reservation. Were told our table wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes. Whatever. So we headed downstairs to grab drinks. As we walked up to the bar, the bartender was slightly scowling. He told us 'go towards the back of the room and stand behind the podium'. Ok. We did and were seated 2 seconds later, no big deal. Just funny, all this fussiness. We ordered drinks and gave the waitress cash. SHE DID NOT GIVE US OUR CHANGE. $20 change! For 3 measly cocktails! We had to wave her down and she seemed very dissappointed that we weren't tipping her $20 for our 3 drinks! She said, 'You want change?!' As Stephanie Tanner would say - HOW RUDE! Shocking actually. I know times are tough but my god. We went back upstairs, as our table was supposed to be ready. We had to wait another 30 minutes. Come on, why do they take reservations? The only reason for two stars is - the food really was DELICIOUS. I don't even remember what I had though because I was in such a bad mood. Not going here again, there are too many other places in this great city that have tasty meals with a much more comfortable dining experience.
