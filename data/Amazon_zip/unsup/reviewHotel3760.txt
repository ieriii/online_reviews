I really enjoyed my stay here this past weekend. It was clean, the staff was friendly, and I thought it was a wonderful price for you got. The rooms are big, waterfall showers, and awesome views of the city. My only complaint was that I stayed on the top floor, right below the nightclub "Vertigo" on the roof so I did hear some music late at night but it wasn't too bad. Stay below floor 25 and you should be good!
