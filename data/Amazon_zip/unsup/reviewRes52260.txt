So while visiting Chicago, deep dish is a must, but there are so many places how do you decide? I like both Giordano's and Gino's East, but in the end Gino's is what I consider the best of the best. The main reason is the fantastic crust. It almost tastes a little like corn bread and it is like a little slice of heaven with every bite. It was nice a crisp and very flavorful. Also a little tip: if you go during an off time or a weekday there isn't a long line- we went at 3pm and walked right in. Though remember deep dish takes about an hour so be prepared to wait, order ahead, or be disappointed! Oh and bring fun markers because you can draw anywhere you want-the walls the ceilings you name it.
