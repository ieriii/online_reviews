I love this place. All of the food is delicious, moderately priced, and not too bad for you. Great atmosphere, byob, fast service, and cool people usually there. Priced decently, always filling. I often crave their food, not something i can say about most dining facilities. Great location too, in walking distance from my house, as im sure is the case for thousands of devoted customers! A+
