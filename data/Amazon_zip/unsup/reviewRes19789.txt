Finally! I've been wanting to try Coast for years now, but never made it, mostly because I kept hearing how crowded it is. Well, not on Super Bowl Sunday, my friends! I started with spicy miso, which was quite tasty and the mug helped warm my chilly hands. My friends and I shared four rolls: the volcano, the coast crab, the sunrise, and a special roll called the Pauper (I think). All four were excellent rolls, but the volcano and the coast crab knocked my socks off! The volcano was just the right amount of spicy, piled high with the delicious tempura crunch. Yum! The Coast Crab surprised me. It was probably my favorite roll. What can I say? I love me some roe. And they were generous with it. I'll be back.
