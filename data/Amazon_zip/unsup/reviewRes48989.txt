What a turnaround! We decided to give The Publican a shot for brunch and were absolutely blown away. Our server was wonderful. We got the waffle and the quiche which were amazing. The waffle was light and fluffy and the quiche had great flavors. Even the salad that came with it was delicious. Drinks, the poppyseed cake, and the doughnut were all fantastic as well. I know we will definitely be back for more!!
