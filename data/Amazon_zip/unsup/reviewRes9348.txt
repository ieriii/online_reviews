Visiting Chicago for a weekend and wanted to try something new. This place was within walking distance of our hotel and we were in the mood to try a bit more upscale Vietnamese. It was delicious! We had two appetizers - CA BAM XUC BANH TRANG - seared monkfish with toasted sesame crackers and BANH UOT - grilled sesame bill rolled in flat rice noodles. Both were nice portions and tasted delicious.  For an entree, I was a little boring - I had BUN THIT NUONG, which is traditional thinly sliced pork served over rice noodles. My dining partner got the best meal - SUP DO BIEN - Bouillabaisse of coconut saffron broth, lobster, mussels, shrimp, scallops, & whitefish, with vermicelli noodles & aromatic herbs - I WAS JEALOUS.  They have a great selection of drinks too - I had a lychee sangria and he had a lemongrass martini. Both very light and flavorful. For dessert, we split the banana wonton, which is pretty standard - banana wrapped in a crispy wonton and deep fried. It was a great meal and was pretty reasonable for everything we got. Our server could have been a little more attentive. She didnt even drop our check off or say goodbye to us. I'd think that at a place like that, your server would wish you farewell.
