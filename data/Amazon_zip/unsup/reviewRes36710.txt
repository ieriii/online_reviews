Yowza this place is great for breakfast! And MAN you need to go early. Loong lines, good specials and probably the best breakfast in West Loop! I have never seen such a limitless variety of crepes, pancakes, french toasts, waffles, etc. etc. etc. As well, there are about a hundreded different varieties of omlettes, scrambles and frittatas. Extremely interesting combinations here too. And, everything comes out hot and FAST! It's like clockwork - in & out. Oh,and they serve LaVazza coffee - which I love! Can't wait to go for breakfast again, and try lunch too - GLAD it's across the street from my apt!
