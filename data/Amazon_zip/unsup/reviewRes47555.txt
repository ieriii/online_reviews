went here for brunch w/my girl a few months back. it was spectacular, i loved our server, he was all proper speaking with some sort of accent, was wearing some spiffy white smock, and made us feel very comfy. he was attentive and warm. they have an amazing amt of things to choose from at their walk up brunch bar. the cheddar biscuit with tangerine butter was awesome. i still speak of that tangerine butter to this day, how i would like to lather it up and rub it all over my chest, hopefully that's not too racy for yelp. the bacon was spectacular, buttermilk ranch sirloin was awesomeness. chicken n waffles was pretty tasty, never had it before, kinda diff, but i liked the chicken, very juicy. they had some really tasty meats and cheese as well. really enjoyed my bloody mary, nice presentation too. not sure why i haven't been back yet. 5 stars. final answer.
