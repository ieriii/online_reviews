I was in Chicago for my boyfriends 30th birthday and we had an amazing meal at Sunda. Our reservation was not until 10pm, so we showed up early for a drink at the bar. Fantastic decor, energy and superb service. Our waiter was extra attentive and provided the best recommendations. I am still dreaming of the Chilean Sea Bass...it is a MUST! Also the Ox Tail Pot Stickers were an excellent (albeit unique) appetizer.
