My husband and I had a GREAT dinner here! We had the beef vegetable soup to start. So flavorful! You get homemade bread with it, tastes just like mom used to make!!! Ask for sour cream with the soup, they'll have it ready for you and that's the traditional way to enjoy it. Then we had the Mitite sausage appetizer. So good and garlicky! I believe they make it themselves Main course we had the steak and stuffed cabbage. The steak was so flavorful and came with delicious vegetables. The stuffed cabbage was wonderful with the best polenta ever! We had dessert too...Crepes! Cooked traditionally so they were perfect! We will be back with our whole family!!!! We enjoyed the great service and week night special!
