I parked in the garage across the street not realizing that there's valet for a much cheaper price. I brought this to the attention of the manager & just as quickly as I mention to him my dilemma he suggested I get the car out of the garage and valet with them.. No charge. Left the cell at the table as I was moving the car while rushing back to Geno's. They suggest I park right in front as a few people were in front of me. Then I sat down and ate the most delicious deep dish supreme w/ pepperoni I've had in a while. Bottom line: Friendly and helpful.. Delicious food... Great atmosphere... 4.5
