i've found that i don't care much for ethiopian food and authentic indian is usually too spicy for this lady, so my choices in edgewater were sort of limited during my tenure there. luckily, when i go out i almost always want japanese or thai food. its just a thing. i can't make sushi or pad thai myself (my homemade pad thai experiment didn't turn out well), and i want someone else to make it for me. dominicks sushi, while a guilty pleasure, doesn't always cut the mustard, especially when i'm eating with someone else instead of sitting alone on my couch watching law&order reruns. with this in mind, know that i was a frequent patron of indie cafe when i lived in edgewater. the thing i liked about indie, and what could make me overlook the stupid skinny tie printed tshirts the employees have to wear, was that the food was just... pretty. everything i ate was presented well, which adds a ton to the dining experience for me. all of my sushi meals were good, with the exception of the broccoli roll, which i really wanted to like because i loves some broccoli, but kept falling apart. not graceful. the noodle and rice dishes were great too. but the stand out at indie is, and listen to my words here: the crab rangoon.  i'm a vegetarian, save for crab rangoon and gefilte fish at passover, so i've had crab rangoon in many forms. these, kids, are the cutest little rangoons i have ever laid eyes on. when i was little, i remember going to a wedding where they put rice (i know, i know) into little twisted sachets, like tiny sandbags, to be broken into and rained down upon the bride and groom during their exit. the crab rangoon at indie cafe is pretty much exactly like that, except the outside is a wonton wrapper and the inside doesn't make bird stomachs explode (to my knowledge. the internet told me that cheese is acceptable for some birds). bliss.
