SO SO SO GOOD!  The line was out the door and I had no idea what was going on (my first time here). I eventually made it to the cashier to place my take out order. I ordered the mushroom torta with goat cheese. WOW, all the flavors worked together so beautifully and the salsa they give you on the side is delish. The churros here are also delicious! I've had the real deal in Madrid and these came pretty darn close. Forgot to ask for the chocolate on the side though (OOOPS). Wish they had Xoco in NYC!
