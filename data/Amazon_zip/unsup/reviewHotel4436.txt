Palmer house is a classic example of a historic hotel that seems to be getting renovated floor by floor. Here's the rundown of pros/cons: Pros - Gym is one of the best hotel gyms I've been to anywhere in the US (Second best in Chicago - Hilton across from Grant Park) is the easily the best gym in Chicago - Pretty good concierge lounge - solid spread, great views, but you have to ask for waters - Overall a good property in a excellent location Cons - They charge $14.99 for mediocre internet and $19.99 for good internet speed (4.06Mb/s down) http://www.speedtest.net - Room was freezing when I walked in - thought there might be dead body in there - Room was an upgrade and was still NYC small Long story short, regardless of the shortcomings, I'll be back.
