Probably the coolest rooftop I've been to in Chicago. I came here for drinks one night last fall and it was an amazing atmosphere. I can't really describe how cool this place, I'll try by saying it was modern and very River North'ish. Oh yeah....the view of the Chicago skyline from the bar was freaking ridiculous. I'm only giving this spot 3 stars because it was kinda expensive and I didn't spend a lot of time at the downstairs part of the restaurant, but it looked really fancy and definitely out of my price range. I'm going to check it out again soon so stay tuned for the update.
