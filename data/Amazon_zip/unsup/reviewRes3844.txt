it's just ok if you're coming here thinking you're getting REAL korean fried chicken, you'll be disappointed - Gyo Chon / Bon Chon chicken, this is not. If you have no idea what gyochon and bonchon is... then you have nothing to worry about... just try it out. Their sauces are pretty good... BUT the names are straight up corny. As a Korean person, it made me wanna puke to tell them that I wanted the Seoul Sassy sauce on my chicken. Also... buddha bowl. not even gonna get into that. Not sure why it's even on the menu. it's like their veggie alternative... but then... u're a fried chicken joint. I don't see veggies options at popeyes or kfc. like i said... i dont wanna get into it. and the name... jeez. ok i'm done. Service is just ok (could be better). Food is just ok (not sure how much better it can get... i'd rather have bonchon). Names are stupid. Take this place as a unique fried chicken joint and nothing else... you might actually enjoy it more than me. Oh... stay away from those korean burritos... completely disappointing. Owner has some crazy korean accent too. He's half german or something and he tries to pronounce korean words and it's just straight up awkward. i guess it shouldn't matter. I think it's cause i just don't like him that much. had some bad customer service experiences with him over the phone and in the restaurant. one piece of advice... if you caused any kind of disappointment to a customer and you knew it was your fault... try to make it right. don't blame it on comcast. you could've at least put my order in first before the line of 4 people... that's the least you could've done after putting me on hold on the phone for 15 minutes and then hanging up because "comcast messed up." maybe you just don't know how to use the phone?
