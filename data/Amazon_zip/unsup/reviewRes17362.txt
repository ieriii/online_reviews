The four stars are for the ambience, the drink menu, and the bartenders. I went here for a birthday on a Thursday night. The back room has a cozy fireplace. The place is very dimly lit with these somewhat Alice in Wonderland chairs. It's definitely swanky and romantic. The drink menu is creative which means some drinks take a long time to make. Be prepared to wait for a while at the bar for your drink. I'll have to come back for the food.
