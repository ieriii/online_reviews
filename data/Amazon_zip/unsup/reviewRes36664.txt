This place is my absolute favorite sushi restaurant on the north side. period. They have amazing crab rangoon; even though i often dislike crab rangoon this place's is totally different, light crispy bags of deliciousness. They have my favorite signature rolls, offering new fresh and delicious rolls (my fav is the sex on the moon) Definitely give this place a try
