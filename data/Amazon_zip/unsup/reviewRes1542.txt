The food is amazing. I live in NJ now, but everytime I'm in Chicago, I try to visit Hot Dougs. I have tried many of the hot dogs, but I now exclusively order the Duck and Foie Gras with cheese fries. The rich combination makes me so incredibly happy and I salivate just thinking about it. I would give this place 5 stars except that going there is always a big "to do." Hours are short and lines are long.
