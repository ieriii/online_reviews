brought the jewish co-worker here for her lesson in korean bbq. its a good spot to do it too, nice and grimy from all the bbq smoke, just how it should be. u cant really go wrong w korean bbq, unless the place is stingy and cheap on the meat. a lot of non-korean explorers here, which is fun. what stood out here for me was the large banchan (side dish) offering. its normal to get several side dishes at a korean restaurant, but this place hooks it up. keep in mind u can ask for more of a particular side dish when u run out.
