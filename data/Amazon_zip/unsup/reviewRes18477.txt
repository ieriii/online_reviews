Omigod!!! I LOVE this place. More specifically, I LURVE the pappardelle con porcini (when I was eight, my friends convinced me that "lurve" is a higher form of love...true or not, I like the sound of it). Anyhoo, back to the pappardelle, SO AMAZING!!!! It's rich and not for anyone watching calories or fat. I can't say enough about this dish. I would simply lie down and die if they ever discontinued it from their menu. On a side note, Caro Mio has a great atmosphere to just hang out with a group of friends for a leisurely dinner or for an aphrodisiactic (probably another made-up word) experience.
