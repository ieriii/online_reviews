One of my favorite restaurants when I have a craving for some good sichuan food. The neiro mien (or beef noodle soup) here is delicious. The noodles, beef, and veggies are excellent... and there's a perfect amount of spicyness in the soup (just enough to rile up your intestines, but not quite enough to give you reflux) (but i think spicy preference is all relative). Also good here: sichuan dumplings, huo guo (hot pot). I forgot what else. Oh, fish. But forgot the name...
