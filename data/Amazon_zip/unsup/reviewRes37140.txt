Man Alive!!!! Dark wood, rustic environment (there is a quaint, restaurant within the grocery store as well)! right on the river! River East 21 movie theater is located kiddi-corner from Fox & Obel. Chicken Enchalada and Vegetable lasagne in the deli counter were two trophy finds! I also snagged a "butter cupcake" (yellow cake w/choc icing) from the bakery! YUM-O!!!! If you think Whole Foods is expensive, then seriously don't go here!!!! If you want to entertain out-of-towners/stubborn family vacationers, TAKE THEM HERE!!!! It's a fantasy grocery shopping experience that you'll never forget! Groove on! I recommend bicycling here.
