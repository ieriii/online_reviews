I went here for a late night snack with friends. I had a great time. It's very luxurious and nice. The food is fantastic. And the ambiance is nice. It's pricey, but it's high end. I heard they're having financial issues and they fired their head chef, but I should go more often and support them. I wished I lived in the city so I can frequent this place more often.
