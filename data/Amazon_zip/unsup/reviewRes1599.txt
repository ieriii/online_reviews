Hot diggity dog! Chicago has a few claims that no one can deny. Among them... ...crooked politicians ...cold weather ...a flippin' big lake ...damn good dogs Even New Yorkers can agree (http://leisureblogs.chic) that our dogs are the Rolls Royce of the encased meat world and while you can find a proper red hot on nearly any corner in the city, there's really only one place to complete the sausage tour d'force in a single seat. Hot Doug's. I'll leave the background to other more knowledgeable Yelpers (many of whom consider sausage a religion), but just let it be known that Doug has been making award-winning red hots since your pappy was dipping cocktail wienies. He does the classics. He does head-scratchingly bizarre. But just like grammar, you have to know the rules before you can break them. Doug does. So here's my recommendation to all visitors, whether old timers or newbies: get it all. God knows you're going to be spending an hour plus waiting in line to get in, most likely in sub-freezing temperatures (see things Chicago does well, above), so you might as well make it worth it. What I mean is (especially for newbies), you have to get Doug's take on the classic Chicago dog. You have to try an Italian sausage or Polish. Have to. From there on out, you decide how weird you want it to get. With unique takes on foreign cuisines (on my last visit I had a Thai chicken sausage with seaweed relish) and more exotic animals than you can find on an African safari (buffalo, ostrich, alligator, snake all come to mind), you're only limited to your own boundaries... or the size of your stomach. The good news is that's it's all good. From A to Z and everything in between. And if you ever find yourself lost and confused, just ask what Doug suggests. Yup, that's him right there at the register, day in and day out, preaching the gospel of the sausage who anyone willing to listen. And believe me, there are plenty.
