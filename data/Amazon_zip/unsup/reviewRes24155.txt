I've been here twice with a few years in between. The atmosphere is great and the service is quite attentive. The first time I ordered sweet crepe with chocolate. It tasted awesome but when I wondered how many more hours I had to run on the treadmill to work off the extra calories, I stopped coming here until some of my friends want to check it out. This time I made sure to order something salty. Is it still kind of sweet? After so many years I still tasted the chocolate? Anyhow, this place is awesome. I just don't have the sweet tooth for it. Sigh...
