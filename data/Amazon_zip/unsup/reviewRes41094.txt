Pretty good for an $85 tasting menu. The style is French/New American/Asian inspired. This place is about as good as any tasting menu in this price point. I like that they use fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Of the eight dishes, I only felt that two were truly memorable. One was the signature dish motoyaki. It's basically a scallop with buttery cream sauce. The other dish that stood out was the dessert with tobacco ice cream. I didn't think the flavor was all that special, but the tobacco ice cream actually burned my throat, if you can believe that ice cream can burn. I dug it because it was surprising. I wish more of the 8 dishes surprised and excited me like these two.
