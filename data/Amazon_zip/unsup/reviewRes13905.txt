Revolution has been on my to do list since it opened. I finally had the chance to check it out on Labor Day. We drove and street parking was not a problem. Had I known better we would have taken the blue line to the California stop because Revolution is crawling distance. The place was busy, but there were a few open tables and plenty of space at the bar. We opted for the bar so we could discuss the different beers on tap with the bartender. The beer list is impressive. Plenty of in house selections and other craft beers. I chose the Gomorrah, their stout on tap. I enjoyed it and would order again. As for the food: The bacon fat popcorn was as good as advertised. I also opted for the Forest Burger. It was a monster. I was able to eat half and took the rest home for leftovers. Service was good, food and beer were what I expected. My overall experience was great.
