I love NAAN. Their naan rules. Their mango kulfi is a creamy delight! Their dal mahkni is the best. Nice flavor, not overcooked to death, just great! Butter chicken pretty decent. (Best Butter Chicken to me will always be Gaylord's) Rice is always perfect. I have been a dedicated fan of India House from their location in Rockford. Both have different flavors, but all great. Sunday Brunch buffet is a great way to try the menu without disappointment.
