Went to Sprout tonight for our holiday dinner (wife and I). Took a cab because parking in that area is nuts...not fun at all and they don't have valet. We both had the pre-fix menu...Wife started off with Butternut - which is like a Waldorf salad (with a good twist). She thought it was yummy. I had the Scallop...thought it was very yummy...not as warm as it could have been. For the 2nd dish wife had Onaga, which is like a flaky white fish with skin on one side and miso sauce around it. She thought this, again, was yummy...I was lucky enough to get a bite and thought the crispy-ness of the skin side was fantastic. I had the lamb, which is preferred at medium-rare...it came out more medium. It was just ok and thus the 4 of 5 stars (I guess I'm a tough grader).  We then had desert, wife had, which she asked 'what has the most chocolate', the Beat - I thought it was very interesting and a taste I've never had before, the cold-ness of ice cream with chocolate, beats, & goat cheese. Another reason for the 4 of 5. I had the banana, which was a mixture of banana, coconut, chocolate, and marshmallow on top...yum. Since the wife is prego she wasn't drinking -duh, so I had two beers and the total came to $160...pretty steep but worth a one-time try.
