When I want to remember why I like living in Chicago, I go to Tank Noodle. It's always packed, and the Pho is wonderful - to my taste, better than the other places around Argyle I've tried. It has all the fixings, including basil and some other green herb, plum sauce and the hot sauce, lime, plus plenty of bean sprouts, cilantro, and peppers. The broth is rich and complex, which to me, is the mark of good pho. Recently, we've branched out and tried some other things there, including the lemongrass chicken. We also had a rice/beef/shrimp/egg roll dish - pretty much everything you want all on one plate.  I'm also a fan of the bubble tea/smoothie phenomenon. I've had my favorite smoothie - avocado, no tapioca - at a number of different places around here, and this place does it the best. Not too much ice or other ingredients so that you can really taste the avocado. Asian smoothie fans, try the avocado - it is the smoothest of the smoothies. If you like avocado, you will not be disappointed.  The menu is huge. There is something for everyone, especially me, who likes everything! I will never get bored at Tank.
