No, No, No. I have never had a worst bowl of pho and bun bo hue in my entire life. The pho completely bland and needed to be doused with lime and cilantro and the bun bo hue was basically a bowl of chili oil with noodles in it. Look, it's supposed to be spicy and flavorful, complex and palatable, it is not supposed to be more flammable to a match than high octane gas. There is a delicate balance in Vietnamese food that must be attained, that's what makes it such a wonderful cuisine, and yet it is also what can make it so awful. I've had superior pho at Pho Binh Minh in Kentucky(of all places) and in numerous pho shops in the Bay Area(the world's culinary paradise). I have yet to find a pho shop here in Chicago that is flavorful and complex. There was one upside and that was my Vietnamese coffee. Actually, no, it was mediocre and clearly pre-prepared in mass quantities. You're supposed to make the Vietnamese coffee fresh each time, otherwise it tastes absolutely foul. So, instead of going here, go across the street to Ba Le and get some three star banh mi.
