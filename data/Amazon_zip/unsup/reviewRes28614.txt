I had anticipated this visit ever since I saw Mr. Bayless on TC Masters, so I didn't mind the two-hour wait. And I knew what I wanted even before I got there, so when we were seated, I glanced through the menu just so I didn't seem like an overeager maniac and ordered the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. So did it meet my expectations? Hard to say. The mole was good... a little sweet and a little savory. Did it knock my socks off? Sadly, no. The same goes for the homemade tortilla (don't get me wrong, I liked it) and the chicken. It just didn't leave me feeling amazed. I think part of it had to do with the fact that the dish came out at room temperature and I wanted it piping hot. I know it's an enchilada and not a fajita, but I wanted the sizzling effect of a fajita. Overall, not bad by any means. Good food and good service. I just wouldn't wait two hours again.
