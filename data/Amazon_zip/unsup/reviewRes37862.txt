On my most recent trip to Chicago, we were told by multiple people from ALL over that Giordano's was a MUST.  I ended up eating 3 SLICES of the "Small Pizza" that supposedly served 1-2. Two slices were barely do-able, and 3 was just excessive. I succumbed to gluttony, just to see if I can do it. It's totally worth the price and the wait. I could have fed myself for 3 days! It wasn't "all dough" like some people think. Not in the least. I even ate the crust.
