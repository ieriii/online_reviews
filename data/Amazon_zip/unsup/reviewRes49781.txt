Excellent, friendly service. Amazing vegetarian plate. Steak was Ok. Seasoning was nice but it was a bit too grissly and fatty for me, although for the price I shouldn't complain. Personally, I prefer Tango Sur - however if you are not interested in the Tango Sur marathon wait for a table, Las Tablas is a great alternative.
