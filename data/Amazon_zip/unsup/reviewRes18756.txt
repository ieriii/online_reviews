Word got around to me that this place was the new Kuma's. Thing is I've never been to Kuma's (yeah, I know, I've never been, deal with it!). Point is, with all I've heard about how good the burgers are at Kuma's, I had some high expectations for this place. They were met. The service was below average. When the place is not too busy, you'd expect the waitress to notice if you need a refill or at least stop by to check on you every so often but this wasn't the case. Don't get me wrong. She was friendly when she was around, but problem was, she was barely ever around. One other thing was we were sitting next to the door to the patio area and there was no spring or stop on the door so anytime it was opened, it would slam, really loud! You would think the waiters, since they work there, would be aware of this and not let the door slam EVERYTIME. Again...not the case. Just don't sit by the door, you'll be fine. The food, however, was pretty damn good! I had the Ole Imperial (Gonzo Imperial porter glazed mushroom and onion, white cheddar on an English muffin) with chipotle fries. Yes, it was on an English muffin and it was a nice twist from the typical burger bun. The muffin, being thinner than a normal bun, got a bit soggy but held together just long enough for me to finish it off. The porter, ordered medium, was perfectly juicy and had a lot of flavor. The glazed mushroom & onion & cheese had this slightly sweet taste that just put it over the top! Btw, I love mushrooms! The fries were great too. This place is definitely worth a visit or two or three or... And there was no wait!!! Ready, set, GRUB!!!
