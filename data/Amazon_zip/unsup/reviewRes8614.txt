If I could give this place a negative rating I would. THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE, UNETHICAL. The service was nice in the beginning, when they found out we don't want our meat mixed with any form of pig they cooked meat just for us, but barely cooked any. We went there for my friend's graduation dinner, Fogo de Chao ruined the rest of our night. My friend left his iPhone there when we went to get the car and went back to retrieve to find it wasn't there anymore. The workers had already moved the tables back to the spot and nothing was left on the ground. We talked to the manager and they said nothing has been turned in, but we just had the iPhone a few moments ago and we knew it had to be in the restaurant. I asked to the review the security tapes and they allowed us to. In the meantime they were yelling at us for even thinking about accusing their workers because they enforce a very a good policy. I told him I don't know him so I don't trust him, I can only see for myself. So as we were reviewing the tapes, the arguing got more intense and heated. Finally I came across the clip where ONE OF THEIR WORKERS TOOK THE IPHONE. Unfortunately, the camera did not let us zoom in for us to physically show the iPhone, but it did show the worker bend down TWICE. The manager was furious at US and started going off how he probably bent down to pick up a napkin. Yes the first time he bent down, he picked up a napkin. Then he saw the iPhone lying there and bent down again to pick it up. He picked it up very closely to our chairs and we had no clue he was even behind us. The manager and security kept denying what was physically shown on the tape. We had to file a police report to have this further investigated, but I cannot believe the rudeness the manager and security guard had. There was no need for talking rudely or to even yell at your customers who spent about $3k on the bill when we were not even yelling in the first place. HORRIBLE PLACE.
