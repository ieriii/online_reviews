I've made two visits to Cafe 28 and overall my experiences have been positive. The food is on par with some of the best Cuban places in Chicago. You must try the "Taste of Cuba" appetizer, which comes with empanadas, chicken & ham croquetas, plantain chips and a delicious saffron sauce. For an entree, I've had the honey jalapeno pork chops, which are tender and flavorful and huge! You have an option of getting a single or double chop. A single is plenty for one person so don't get the double chops unless you're sharing with someone. It also comes with a side of sweet potatoes. You can't go wrong with any of the flavored or regular mojitos or margaritas. My favorite is the raspberry mojito, refreshing on a hot summer day. Atmosphere and service are warm and friendly. My only complaint is that the entree prices are just a tad expensive, but great place to grab some appetizers and drinks.
