Went there with 2 friends tonite. Heard about them through http://restaurant.com where they were promoting, so bought a $35 voucher for $15 to check it out. Good service, great burgers and wings. So looking good. But it stops there, evening ruined becos of a very very retarded supervisor with an attitude problem. Basically, at check out time, the nice server said the voucher is no good with promotions. We wanted some clarity and asked to speak with their supervisor. A very thick (headed) Scott Wiener came to our table looking very impatient. Babbled on and on about the domestics were $1 and they would lose money if they took the voucher, and how he is wasting his time explaining to us while he has other customers to attend to, even asked my friend to not interrupt him when he interrupted us in the first place. We were shocked! SHOCKED!!! We've never been treated that way in a restaurant before. Our points are simple. 1. Our food was full priced. Not promo.We have used similar vouchers for food before, just don't include the drinks or allow us to pay full price for drinks. 2. The concept of http://restaurant.com and promoting there for limited time only is to find new clients and attract repeat business. They just lost a whole bunch tonight. 3. And if we had only bought $1 domestics, then according to him, they are really out of luck. If the idiot had explained to us professionally and with courtesy, we would've tried to understand. But he was plain rude and we will never go back there for as long as the Wiener works there, and we will tell all our friends in Chicago the same thing and I urge you all to avoid this place like the plague.
