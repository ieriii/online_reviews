I agree with those who say that the only reason this place falls short of a 5-star rating is the ambiance and the craziness. The wait can be epic, and I recommend eating at the bar if you have the option. That said, the burger I had was the best burger I have ever had -- and I'm a big burger person. The caesar salad was great, as was the beer. I loved that they consistently tap new beers, and the beer flight was the perfect way for my boyfriend and I to explore the menu. In short, HIGHLY recommended for both the food and the drink, but beware the wait and have a back up venue prepared just in case.
