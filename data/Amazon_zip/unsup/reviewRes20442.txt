Amazing service was followed by some o the best bloody marys we have had. The only real problem I had was deciding which menu to choose from, the lunch or the brunch. I went with the corned beef hash, and awesome was an understatement. Their full bar had a number of beers that other restaurants had been sold out of.  Definitely worth stopping in.
