I stayed here last weekend for some family-time. I was initially disappointed when I found out we'd be staying here as opposed to one of the "hipper" hotels in the area. My opinion very quickly changed. The Chicago Hilton is one of the grand dame luxury hotels in Chicago. They've hosted a bunch of presidents, celebrities, rich folks, etc and they've got the system down pat. Luxurious well-appointed spaces, an attentive staff, a tony location and comfortable rooms make this a great hotel. The ball rooms are absolutely gorgeous - dripping in elegance,class and timeless beauty. The spa, fitness center and pool/hot tubs are clean and lovely.  We booked a suite - a great upgrade at only a small price jump - and were delighted by the amount of room we had including many many windows, a Murphy bed, a bar, sweeping lake views and lots of storage. The only downside of the room was the tiny bathroom with very little counter space. Oh well.... I got over it.  One more thing to note - We ate in all of the restaurants (Kitty O'Shea's, Lakeside Green Lounge (the hotel bar) and The Pavilion) and found the food disappointing in each - overpriced, underwhelming, and very limited in choices. Your best bet is to take advantage of one of the many wonderful restaurants Chicago has to offer and skip the hotel's food offerings altogether.
