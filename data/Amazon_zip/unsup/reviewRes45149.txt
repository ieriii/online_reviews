Ate here last night, and for those that read this in the future it was 80 degrees yesterday on April 1st. To say they were busy was an understatement. The service was great even though they had so many people in there. Our server was attentive enough to even tell us it would be a bit until our main course was ready after our apps. It took about 15 minutes which gave us enough time to start digesting the first two courses. Everything was cooked perfectly. Highly recommend the prix fix menu. $30 for app, meal, desert -or- app, 1/2 pasta, meal. The portions were smaller for the apps (understandable), but the total amount of food we had was enough to stuff two starving people.
