It may lose some credibility with some for being a 'chain', but when I think of a great steak-and-potatoes dinner, Wildfire is nearly unrivaled. Sure, I haven't tried some of the legendary decades-aged, hand-cut dinosaur steak places that are strewn around the city, but for reliability in quality and service, and a really, really good meal, I'd pick Wildfire any time.
