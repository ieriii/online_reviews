My favorite place in River North!  Xoco is fantastic! From the delish sandwiches to the yummy soups, this is one of my favorite spots to bring people from out of town. Don't be intimidated by the crow, the line moves quick and if you order chips and guac they bring it to your table right away so you can start munching. I've even seen a couple eat theirs while standing in line. I'm too much of a germaphobe for that but if that works for you, go for it.  The place is basically a semi-gourmet fast food joint with beer. What else could one ask for? I must be a little kid because the highlight of my trip to Xoco is always the sparkling white station - you can pick from still or sparkling tap water and fill up yourself. Good for the environment and endless entertainment for me.
