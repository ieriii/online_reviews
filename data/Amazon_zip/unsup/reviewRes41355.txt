So, um, I'm addicted to bubble tea. It's a fact. After picking up some boba from the grocery down the street, I decided I couldn't wait to get home and make my own bubble tea. So I walked into the closest place and ordered my bubble tea. This place was super packed and smelled so good. I think they use a blend of powders and fresh fruit in their bubble tea. I noticed containers filled with powder and marked "taro", "green tea", and so on. They also had fresh fruit through. My bubble tea was made quickly and topped with four huge chunks of mango and two chunks of watermelon. So good and sweet. The only downer was the small amount of boba. Oh well. I'm definitely coming back to eat at this place.
