I LOVE IT! There is tom of out door seating.Another Great BYOB spot for some lunch on a nice day, or a great priced summer dinner. I had the Sopa de pollo, it was good home style with torn chicken off the bone, big potatoes, and spaghetti noodles. (YUM! I'm a sucka for good soup!) Yuca con Mojo which wasn't dry! My only criticism was the Tostones where on the thick patty size (NOT my thang when it comes to tostosnes I prefer thinner and more well done) OH Yea great Cuban Sandwich ham and moist Pork! Yummy!! Authentic for sure... I dont mind paying about a dollar more than the shack down the street the set up is nice for crowds and NO Cork fee for BYOB. I believe consistency is worth that extra cent. I'll be back soon.
