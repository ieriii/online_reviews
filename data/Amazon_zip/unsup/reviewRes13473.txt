Sundays I like to frequent eateries that serve bloody marys. metromix lead us here. We went on labor day, that's basically another sunday. It was busy, but we only waited about 10 min. Ordered bloodies and beer. Bloody was above avg but nothing spectacular. It needed more depth, but it was spicy enough (they put siracha-thats legit). and they put a good amount of vodka. who can complain about that right? Brunch was good. I had egg in a hole over cheddar ale soup. yum. i didnt like the sausage though. I asked for bacon not sure why sausage came out. but i understand the kitchen was prob slammed nbd. we will prob be back. they brew their owns beers so I want to try some another day.
