Let me preface this review by announcing that I AM the QUEEN of bacon! Don't put it past me to have a plate of bacon for breakfast, lunch or dinner. No joke. So I was more than just a little esctatic to sample the Italian tapas menu @ Purple Pig. Sat down at a tall communal table a little after lunch time with Beth W. & company after some intense Power Point slide editing. Didn't quite beat the lunch crowd but then again only waited 2 minute for a table. Service was definitely just right. Our server didn't give us the evil eye for turning her away about 4 times before we were finally focused enough to stop chit chatting and have our orders down. Plates are small yet made for sharing, so order plenty! Items from the a la plancha portion of the menu are slightly larger. Never had brussel sprouts before and boy, is this the right place to try them! They were served as fried crispy flakes with a refreshing dash of lemon flavor. I couldn't get enough!  Tried & loved: *fried brussel sprouts *bite sized fried aracini balls stuffed with winter squash & goat cheese with sage pesto *Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki (they should bottle up & sell their tzatziki sauce!) *Milk Braised Pork Shoulderwith Mashed Potatoes (mmm....tender porky goodness!) Didn't try but will go back for: *prosciutto bread balls *pig's tails braised in balsamic *wine!! how could we not try the swine but not the wine?! *Affogato dessert...this is my new found favorite sweet treat! Truly cannot wait to return to this cozy spot off the Mag Mile!
