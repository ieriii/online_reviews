Me and my husband LOVE this place!! We went here for my birthday a few years back and it was great! Rick Bayless even signed a cookbook that my husband purchased there...I felt so honored that he would take time away from the kitchen to sign it for me! That was something I will never forget! And the food speaks for itself. Everything is very fresh and very well prepared. One of the stand out items we had were the tamales, my husband said they were better than any he has ever had, even in Mexico!! (Cause he is Mexican) I remember them being very moist and super flavorful! We weren't 21 yet when we ate here so I can't comment on the drinks from the bar, but I hope to get back their soon and then I can update. This is just the perfect place to go for what appears to be upscale but is really peasant style Mexican food, which in my opinion, is the best kind! Try it!!
