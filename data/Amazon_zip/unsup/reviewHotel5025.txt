Customer service was terrible. The front desk staff of young girls seemed better suited as cocktail waitresses. They were very unprofessional and first declined my credit card twice (because they entered the wrong exp. date). They never reviewed the charges with me and our credit card called that they were putting through an extra $200 per night for incidentals as a deposit. Then, when we paid $400 per night to stay during the Chicago Air & Water show, we were told the 7th floor balcony was closed even to guests unless you pay $25 per person. After complaining to the manager, there was no follow up on this at all.  In the room our TV remote was broken as were the blinds covering the window; the A/C was loud and the room seemed musty and dirty. They charge $14.95 for daily internet per device connecting. People roam the lobby and front lawn with dogs, which just doesn't seem appropriate given the swanky lobby feel. Surprisingly disappointing for a hip, higher end hotel chain. Won't stay there again.
