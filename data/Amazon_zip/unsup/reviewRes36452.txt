Sorry, Indie. I love your sushi, but you lose a star for the marked decrease in service. It used to be, when this was a once-a-week place for me and the gf, the service was fine. Cheerful, pleasant waitresses. Water always full. Fresh wasabi and ginger. Not so much anymore... the straw that broke the camel's back was the guy who repeated our order, still missed a roll, never spoke to us again, had to be flagged down for anything, and not even entering our subsequent orders into the system. Maybe this is retribution for forgoing our monogamous relationship. I don't know. But what was once a standard has become just another place, albeit with top-notch sushi, in our sushi rotation.
