enjoyed a leisurely saturday lunch here with two of my best and most demanding girls: neither of them can eat gluten, one of them is a vegetarian and the other can't have dairy. tall orders for any restaurant, but 90 miles had something for all of us. the vegetarian platter, vegetarian sandwich and chicken sandwich (sans bread!) were all great. this place does simple food very well -- loved the "avocado on the side," perfectly ripe and served just with salt, pepper and olive oil. but my mango shake stole the show -- everyone who saw it was jealous and wanted one for themselves. the set-up in the outdoor enclosure was cozy and cute with a nice little fireplace keeping customers warm. if i lived in chicago, i'd come back here for sure.
