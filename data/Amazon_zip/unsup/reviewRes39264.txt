If you ate at Longman & Eagle last night, you may have noticed a devilishly handsome fellow by the bar watching you eat. Sorry about that. This was only a sipping stop only on our whiskey-themed pub crawl, and I immediately rued our decision to eat elsewhere when I saw and heard about how food is done here.  Whiskey, you're the devil. The bourbon selection is as good as anything you'll find this side of the Ohio River, and there's plenty of rye, scotch, and Irish stuff to boot. A lot of them are just 3 bucks for a shot. That's a beautiful thing.  Whiskey is done en masse here, but it's also done very well, as evidenced by a deliciously bittered Manhattan and an Old Fashioned with all kinds of flavor.  Four stars for now, but only as an incentive to get me back, as L&E has been bumped to the top of my queue. I intend to drink much whiskey and eat maybe everything on the menu.
