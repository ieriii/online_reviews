Hot, friendly waitresses/bartenders in corsets that serve you beer quickly and efficiently. +1 Star Great beer selection at reasonable prices +1 Star Don't have to wait 3hrs to be seated like at Kuma's for a good burger +1 Star Good music videos playing +1 Star I came here the other day to see which metal head bar had the best burgers. I had been to Kuma's and wanted to try this place. The location is a bit tough with the parking, but once you find it on the main street, you can enter Lockdown Bar. The first thing you'll notice is that there is no huge waiting time and rude people like at Kuma's. The bar looks cool on the inside, and you can amuse yourself with the fun variety of music videos they play on the TONS of flat screen TVs they have.  The beer selection is great. These girls also know their beers. I mentioned some not so well known Belgian brews, and the bartender knew exactly what I was talking about. I usually get a blank stare at most bars. The burgers are not as big as Kuma's, but they are much more flavorful. Mmm...you'll not leave empty either! They do not have the delicious waffle fries, but their fries are still pretty good. I was served this delicious burger, and I never had to ask for a refill or beer once. The waitress kept a hawk-like eye, and every time the glass was nearing empty, she'd fly over to refill. Now that is what I call awesome service.  The place wasn't too packed for a Friday night. I just wish there were slightly more people. 'Cause meeting a hot guy there would just add to the awesomeness of this place. I will definitely be back soon and if service is consistent, I'll be upgrading my review to 5 stars!!
