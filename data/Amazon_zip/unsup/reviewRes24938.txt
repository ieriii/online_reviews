Very cute cafe!!! Great place to meet a friend for coffee. The Turkish (oops sorry GREEK to them as I was corrected, even though it is the same) coffee is very good... I have been here many times and I love it! This is a great place to go for lunch too. I can't say that I would come here for dinner, it just doesn't seem like that kind of place to me. The wait staff is pleasant, but always very slow. I would not recommend it here if you are in hurry and just stopping for a quick coffee... :))
