I'll keep this short and sweet, Mercat a la Planxa (Market on the Grill) was hands down the best dinner I've ever had. Not only was the location convenient for a 6 PM reservation (in the loop, near the touristy spots I hadn't seen yet) but the ambiance was warm and welcoming too.  My dining companion loves food just as much as me so when he chose this spot I knew my taste buds would be pleased. The restaurant is run by world reknown chef, Michael Fiorello - so my expectations were plenty high. All of which were exceeded with their famous bacon-wrapped dates and creamed spinach dish with delicious currants. The marbling of the meat selection was ideal and tasted exceptional with the saffron coated goat cheese tray.  All the 'seasonal tasting' plates made sense and had a unique flavor that lingered until the next mind blowing item hit my palette. The service was incredible and the red sangria was refreshing after a long day of work. I look forward to a return visit and highly recommend your next meal be here.
