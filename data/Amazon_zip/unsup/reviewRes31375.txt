Stopped in late night on a Sunday - the wife had read about this place in Vegetarian Times. Jamaican Jerk BBQ sandwich was good - strips of seitan with sauce on a multrigrain roll with sweet potato fries -- which were slightly undercooked, but tasty nonetheless. Wife raved about the veggie polenta, and I had a few bites to confirm that it really was tasty. Friendly service, free weekend parking in a well-lit alley lot next to the building.
