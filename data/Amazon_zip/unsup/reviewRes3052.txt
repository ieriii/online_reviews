Why four whole stars? -fried chicken: tell me where else in this city you can get your fingers sticky with plump, juicy, out-of-this-world-flavorful Korean bbq? -bulgogi: the Seoul steak bowl was delicious. Meat was sweet and flavorful, just like bulgogi should be. Top it with Alison's Atomic Sauce. -kimchi: yes, you do have to purchase it on the side. But it is homemade and you get a ton of it. Take it home and it will only get spicier and more delicious. -staff: super friendly and helpful for those of us who are newer to the Korean food scene. Why only four stars? -space: it is crowded and cramped. -tables: kinda cruddy and you have to share your table. Other tidbits: -gotta love the rolls of paper towels on the tables. Very helpful! -the bottles of sauce on the table are delish. Sassy Seoul, Alison's Atomic, and sriracha.
