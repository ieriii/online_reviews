All this place has going for it is that it's clean (and there is a lot to be said for that!) and it is convenient for taking the L. It is way over priced. If my company wasn't putting me up there, I would definitely not have stayed!  The lobby is beautiful, but the rooms are drab, dated, and a little creepy. They are also awkwardly arranged. I thought it was just me because I had a corner room, but several of my colleagues mentioned it as well. I had a room with 2 beds. They were unusually small for hotel rooms (I'm small so it wasn't a big deal, but if you are big and/or like to move around when you sleep you should request a king, otherwise you may roll onto the floor). Anyway if you get some crazy deal like some of the other reviewers I say go for it. Otherwise, it's NOT worth the price! I recommend the Hotel Majestic.
