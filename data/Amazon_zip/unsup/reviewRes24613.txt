We have been hear many times. The atmosphere is just amazing. Chic and edgy. We were seated promptly in a corner booth, which I love. The food and drinks were amazing as usual. They bring out the tapas as it is ready, a pretty fast pace, but we eat fast. Some people might not like this so much. Our downfall with the place is the service. Our waiter thought he was hot shit ( for lack of better words).  He was borderline rude at times when we asked questions. Example...my boyfriend asked if we could order a few plates and go from there. The waiter informed him that the restaurant encourages people to order there whole meal at one time. Really.  Been to a lot of tapas style places and the usually encourage you to order as you go. Whatever.  The time I came hear before this, I brought my 11 year old here. He is such a little foodie, he loved the food. The waiter that night pissed me off soo bad, when me left I asked to speak to a manager. Rude rude rude. I think the management need to look at who is in the front of the house because again the food is wonderful, the wait staff leaves a very bitter taste in your mouth!
