So, I went for Ethiopian food for the first time last night, and it was great! Lots of veggie options to choose from, and the beef dishes that we had were great as well!  I definitely recommend the beet/potato salad, and the Ethiopian tea - both were delicious, as was the cabbage dish we had! I will definitely be back to Demera, and I recommend it to any Ethiopian newbies - our server was really helpful!
