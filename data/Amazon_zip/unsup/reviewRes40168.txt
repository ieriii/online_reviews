Korean is my IT food right now. This was my first BBQ exprience and I loved it-becuse I love trying things I've never heard of before in my life. On that note, I would have liked for someone to have explained at least 10% of what was on our table. The meat was mostly good, the sides were VERY interesting, but mostly just ok. I'll be trying Korean BBQ again soon-but probably some place else. Its super fun to guess at all the wierd looking sides and you grill your own meat at the table-makes for a very food focused conversation at dinner-FUN. Beware-you will smell like meaty smoke forever!
