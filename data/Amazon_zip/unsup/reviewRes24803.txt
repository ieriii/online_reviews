Opa! If you're in Greek Town and want a lot of tasty choices (Greek and non-Greek) you should try this place! Artopolis is an adorable bakery/cafe in the heart of Greek Town. One of the things I love about this place is that it's a total ego boost. Most of the male employees are very friendly, hot and somewhat flirtatious (in a flattering, not an uncomfortable or creepy way either). I got the Spanakopita aka the Spinach and Feta Artopita and my friend got the Tequila Pollo sandwich. They come with potato or pasta salad, we both got the potato salad on the recommendation of her husband and it was yummy. I think it was made with Greek yogurt instead of mayo so it wasn't really heavy, it reminded me of a Greek version of the potato salad you see at tapas places. The Spanakopita was great, the crust was flaky and the inside very flavorful, I've had some at other places which was quite bland. My friend liked hers too, she finished most of it and she's not usually a big eater. When the server laid my plate down I didn't feel like there was a ton on my plate, but after I was done I was too full to even have dessert. I was bummed because everything in the bakery cases looked so good, I was going to take something home, but at the last minute I decided not to (my jeans thanked me, my sweet tooth didn't). Service was ok, our server was fairly attentive. Toward the end of our meal we saw her less and less and had to wait a little bit to get our check. Bottom line this is a solid choice if you're in Greek Town and want something tasty, but a little quicker than a formal sit down restaurant.
