M-E-A-T! Whoa-to the ness of goodness!  My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday evening with our handy dandy groupon of course.  First we were told there may not be a table right away so we saddled up at the bar and tried some caihparinhas...which by the way are delectable.  Once we got a table we had a waiter that was completely genuine in recommending what to get on the first visit and guided us through their menu. The empanadas were delicious, the SKIRT STEAK is like the most delectably flavorful piece of meat you could ever have. And just because you get TWO pieces of meat with the combination plate I also had the most juicy delicious pork. SO freakin' good.  Overall a really great place to go with a group of people of on a date... whatever you choose its for everyone as long as you're not a vegetarian.
