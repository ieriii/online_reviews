Piece has some of the best pizza in Chicago. I always order the white pizza...with extra garlic. Usually we get the same additional toppings - sausage and mushrooms. It's certainly not healthy, but it's so good. The only bad thing is that they serve lindemans framboise (yes!), but they give it to you in a teeny tiny little cup. I usually need at least 3-4!
