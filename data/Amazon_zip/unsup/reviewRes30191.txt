I liked this place, I had the burger, which was tasty and served on a pretzel roll (totally sold me) and my wife had grilled cheese and soup which were both good. They had a good selection of beer and wine, I had a Lagunitas IPA I'd never had, it was very good. We also took dessert back to the hotel, cheesecake was decent. I'd go again for sure especially if we stay in the neighborhood again.
