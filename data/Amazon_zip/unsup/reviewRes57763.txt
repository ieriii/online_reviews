This is my favorite place to come for breakfast in Chicago. Everything I've ordered from here has been great. From Oatmeal to French toast they do it right. Service is sometimes spotty but for the most part they are on it. Food always comes out fast and even though they are packed on the weekends I never have to wait to long for a table. Go check them out. You can't go wrong.
