I don't have much to say, besides I'm a foodie - and this is the best italian food I've ever tasted. The La Villa special pizza and veal dishes both highly recommended. The staff is friendlier than I imagined any staff could be. Coming to La Villa is like a family dinner - minus the the family members you can't stand.
