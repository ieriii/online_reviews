Heaven!!! I love Le Colonial. I came here with my boyfriend last summer and the dining experience was amazing. We came on Wed. night for their pre-fee menu and the food was superb. The best part about Le Colonial is that you are whisked away to a romantic getaway the moment you walk in the door. With the dimly lit lighting and the bamboo trees, Le Colonial serves as an urban oasis in the heart of Chicago. If you want to get romantic, I recommend sitting on the couches on the second floor. (You can't reserve them - first come first serve). You can eat your entire meal on the couches cuddling with your significant other :) I loved it! One of my favorite restaurants in the city!
