Having grown up in the city it's amazing that I have never been to Superdawg. Granted, I'm a South Side girl and the best dogs were at Poorboys on 46th and Halsted, but I digress. We came here after seeing it on Chef vs. City just as a cute thing to take the kid to. I'll say that it's a pretty decent dog. I personally liked the fries a lot but it seems lots of people here don't. The tamale is awesome but yes, it's a Tom-Tom knockoff and not something out of your Abuela's kitchen. The waitresses kind of scare me as they look like they've been working there forever, hate their job and likely spit in your shake as they walk over. It can be obnoxiously crowded and seriously, the scary red devil eyes on the hot dog caveman dude have to go.
