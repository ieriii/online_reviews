It was disappointing. I mean, it was of course excellent, but it was not the best restaurant in the country. Not close, actually. There is no bar, just wine. They caution you not to drink too much because they feel it could interfere with the experience. It's very interactive, with lots of playful presentations and some do it yourself stuff.  I have no problem with the obvious pretense of all of this, if you deliver the goods. But they didn't. When you have this much arrogance, if you pull it off, that's great. When you don't, it comes off as just arrogant. Some of the dishes were just awesome, but others fell flat, and some just didn't make sense. And there was not nearly as much of the molecular gastronomy-type presentations as I would've expected--the kind where you are surprised by the flavor or texture or both. Just not much of that.  Much of the experience depends on the instructions from the wait staff. Since it is so interactive, you rely on the waiters to explain exactly how to assemble and eat your food. One dish in particular, involved short rib dished onto a piece of pasta, on which you then spoon about 10 different accompaniments. The waiter basically said, just put it together and eat it however you want. My wife stuffed it all in her mouth in one bite, which in retrospect wasn't the way to go. Even I, who ate it in three bites, thought the number of accompaniments was overkill and prohibited me from really appreciating what I was eating.  And one of the dishes was borrowed from their Next menu, which annoyed me because it just seemed lazy to do that. My guess is that a lot of this was due to Achatz not being in the kitchen that night, which was a huge disappointment. Anyway, I can't say I would recommend it. I would like to try it again when Achatz is there, but that's rather impossible to predict, and I don't know when I'll be in Chicago again.
