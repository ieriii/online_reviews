We are on a Pho kick right now.. just can't get enough of it... We were actually directed to Tank by the place in our home town that we get our Pho from.. They know we like it and like to go to Chicago to try new places a lot. It was good. But I have to say that the place in our home town is better.. like the broth has a much better taste to it. It was good though. The staff was super nice and helpful. We would go back.
