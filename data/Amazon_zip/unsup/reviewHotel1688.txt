If you ask the online travel gurus, this is a three-star boutique hotel, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a four star, thanks to all the thoughtful little details. The Allegro is a Kimpton hotel, which means: 1. Free wine reception every evening for guests. 2. Your darling pussies and pooches are as welcome as you are 3. Tootsie rolls are free free free 4. Decor is zany, but tasteful There are themed suites at the Allegro, including a Lion King suite and Second City suite, if you're into that sort of thing. Staff is very friendly. The rooms are great. They can be a bit small, but the comfy beds make up for it. And the bar makes a mean roster of 'tinis. Really good place for girls weekends, bridal parties, etc. Not as romantic as some other hotels in town, but still very cool.
