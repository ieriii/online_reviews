This place is fantastic - great food, great beers, good service, laid back atmosphere. Came here on a Thursday evening. When we got there, we were pretty much the only patrons (it was early - a little after 6 maybe). By the time we left around 8:30, the place had filled up nicely. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about both the beer list and the menu. The burgers were delicious, and the fries (just 75 cents extra to get truffle! or old bay! or... three other choices that i'm not remembering right now) really stood out. Prices were reasonable, all burgers under $10, beers were neither cheap nor expensive - my only complaint there was that there were no "cheap" beers for those of us who actually like them. I'm not sure this is a true "destination" place but it's a wonderful addition to the neighborhood and a fun place to hang out, have a good beer and enjoy a burger. Though next time I'm trying the poutine!
