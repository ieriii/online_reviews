Celebrated a friend's birthday there just this past Saturday. The pizzas were okay, but I'm not a big lover of the thin crust pizza, which is what they serve. If you are, you'll probably love it. Our group was relatively small group (6), yet I did not find the service to be amazing. Our waitress was nice, but the service was nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered as an appetizer the baked goat cheese with marinara sauce - it was good; anything with goat cheese is good :o) They bring it out with sliced bread. The bread was hard though, and since I prefer soft bread I didn't enjoy it as much. I did, however, slather some of the "dip" on my pizza slices and it went along great. Also, the pizzas are big. The large says it feeds 3-5 people; well that means that 3-5 people eat and repeat :o) good if you're hungry.
