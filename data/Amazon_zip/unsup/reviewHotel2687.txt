I've stayed at 4 hotels in Chicago in the last 3 months and this hands down is my favorite. My thoughts on The James: top notch staff, clean and modern rooms, and free Kiehl's products. It was a convenient location to the office as well as all the shopping (even though I did not get to partake in it :) ). One huge plus is the Trader Joe's across the street which makes it easy to grab essentials. I would highly recommend this to travelers of both business and pleasure.
