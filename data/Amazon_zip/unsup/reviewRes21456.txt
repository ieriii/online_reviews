They could serve poop on a platter, I'd still come to Superdawg for a good meal. Classic cars revve their engines, idling in the stalls waiting for their food. Cheery, smiling waitstaff bustle to and from the building with trays in tow, never tiring or sassing back. Superdawg on Milwaukee will be around after World War 3, after the apocalypse and after every other hot dog stand on Earth has closed shop. Their food isn't the best you'll ever eat, this much is true, but there isn't a more dependable, clockwork-like experience than Superdawg. They're never off, at least none of the thousand times I've been there. Here's the scoop. Get a side of their fried veggies. Among the standard zucchini and mushrooms are also fried orbs of what I have to believe is creamed corn. My wife's not a big fan but that's fine - more for me. Next go for a Whoopskidawg which is really just a slightly customized Maxwell Street Polish where instead of mustard they use their own tangy sauce. Get some Cherry Coke, sure, but also get a pineapple shake for the drive home. You'll be wanting more an hour later but man, what a good time.
