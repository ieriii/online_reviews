Fantastic location if you are visiting or working in the downtown area. I stayed a week in the hotel and never slept better. I'm a big fan of the Hilton hotels and this was the first Doubletree I've stayed in. Rooms were spacious and being on floor 17 offered a great view of the city. The door man was fantastic and the service was great. There is an Einstein Brothers Bagels downstairs, which was very good. They are about 2 blocks from 'Magnificent Mile'. It was a great experience for the money.
