The best Vietnamese food I've ever had.Service starts with complimentary tea (excellent). We ordered the Bon Vivant Platter (combinations of spring and egg rolls), the #8 Avocado Chicken, and the Simply It Beef. The Chicken was strong, flavorful, and amazing, and mixed extremely well with the the mango salsa. The beef was indescribable.Strongly recommend.
