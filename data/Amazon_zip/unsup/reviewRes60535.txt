I really want to give 4 stars for the ambiance of this place alone, but taking in account the food I'd have to say its just ok. I had the flat iron steak with potatoes. When my dish came I wondered where the veggies were but remembered that the choice was either potatoes or veggies. So i cant get my bit of "healthy" on without paying extra for veggies or a potato?Huh?! Where do they do this?! At Grand Lux! At apple bees (which is what my meal reminded me of) you can get potatoes and veggies in a meal. You dont have to choose either/or. Why not here at such a nice place? My husband had BBQ chicken which was good but it really tasted no diff than what he does on the grill at home. On another note: I was celebrating my bday in Chicago this weekend so my husband snuck and told them. Heads up: if you let the staff know it's someone's bday in your group they will bring a VERY thin toffee tasting thingy (which was good) that flakes and cracks up in your hand. It's a mess! Then there's two small decorative icing swirly things on the plate with a candle in one. I was so confused on what to do with it that we had to ask the waiter "what do you do with this?" She had to guess. I'm used to a special (full) dessert or a mini cake for bdays at restaurants... This was very different. Unsatisfying to say the least. I won't count this place out completely for now. I'll try something else when I decide to go back.
