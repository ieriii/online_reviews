First things first...the ambiance in this place is sexy, from the high ceilings and exposed wood to the plethora of candles and open fire in the area of the salad bar. The bar/lounge area is quite large with a large screen projection TV tucked into the far side -- perfect for those who want to watch (NCAA was on) but unobtrusive to those who don't. I don't recall hearing any audio from the TV, just the generic hipster lounge music that was piped in. The bartenders were very friendly and they serve a variety of 'muddled' drinks. I went for a glass of a Washington state Cab 'the Sharecropper,' which was jammy and delicious. Zed451is a churrascaria with an emphasis on the chefs. You see, they are the ones who serve the meats as well as cook them. One of them even took his meat back to the kitchen to cook it a bit longer after seeing the inside color. We also got amuse bouche dishes of corn chowder with jalapeno and apricot glazed warm dinner rolls. The art of the chef is also on display in the salad bar which features more prepared salads than a traditional 'make your own salad'-type salad bar. In this regard I must say that I still like individual ingredients and missed the hearts of palm, artichokes and sun-dried tomato you get at Fogo. Then again, the garlic wild mushrooms, duck pastrami and homemade tapenades were awesome... The best meat of the night was the Moroccan chicken -- moist and savory with complex spices. The New Zealand red deer venison was a treat (tastes like veal, not gamey) and the Australian leg of lamb was well seasoned. One more thing -- they even run a shuttle to bring you home if you've decided to get your drink on in addition to getting your meat on. They run as far north as Irving Park. Call ahead if you're thinking of this option. There also is a separate dining room in the back for large groups.
