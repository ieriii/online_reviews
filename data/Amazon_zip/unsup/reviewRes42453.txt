I wish I could go back to August, 2009, before my innocence was lost. I would have ranked The Art of Pizza's stuffed pizza among the best in Chicago, rivaling Chicago's. In that time when I tried it in August until last night, I ate their pizza probably 4 times. Until last night, it was excellent every time. However, after last night's slices of stuffed pizza (3, split between my girlfriend and I), I would have been more satisfied eating DiGiorno's. Namely, the crust sucked. It tasted refrigerated, or frozen, or undercooked, or something. Not good. Was this all a fluke? God help us, I hope so.
