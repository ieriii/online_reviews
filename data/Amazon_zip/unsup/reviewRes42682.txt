I was born and raised on the north side of Chicago. I've tasted all the pizza there is...or so I thought. We ordered from Art of Pizza on Sunday during the Bears game. A Small Stuffed Vegetarian and a large Stuffed Sausage. It EASILY fed the six of us and there were three slices left over. The crust is amazing and beats out even my fave, Gino's East. Try it. You will not be disappointed. Delivery came is under an hour and they gave us a free 2 liter of pop, just because. Nice. Do yourself a favor and give it a whirl.
