It's kind of unfair for me to write a review for P.B. bc I'm just not a huge pasta person unless it's amazing homemade pasta. But since my boyfriend thinks this is the best restaurant in the entire city, we go here once in a while. The garlic cheesy bread is delicious! Definitely my favorite part of the meal. I think my favorite dish here is the seafood in marinara sauce. I do have a few gripes. They only ever seem to have marinara sauce or cream sauce on their pastas. How about just some wine and olive oil? Some of their specials sound good, but I just can't handle the cream sauce, so I can never get them. While their wines are cheap, they come in correspondingly small glasses.
