I live just one block from Revolution, so have been REALLY looking forward to the opening. And man oh man am I disappointed. First the good: the inside looks amazing. They did a truly great job on the renovating. The bad: Remember about 10-15 years ago, before the brewpub craze had truly kicked off? Back then, a brewpub was just that: a pub that brewed its own beer. Not an extremely pretentious bar run by food/beer snobs like this and 90% of new brewpubs. The best part of Revolution is the menu. The food is quite great, so as a restaurant, I would have rated it higher, but unfortunately, it's not. It's a brewery. The waitstaff is abysmally slow and rude, especially the bartenders, who will stand there at one tap, sloooowly filling one pint or growler, without regard to the line of people waiting for them. Not trying to use two hands. Not trying to multitask and take another order. As for the beer, I've been homebrewing for 10 years and I would say if you have any interest, give it a try and you will easily make better beer than Revolution. Their beer is weak weak weak and EXPENSIVE. Seriously, if you know much about porters, try theirs and you will wonder how they can even call it one. Hardly a dark beer. On one recent trip, the wait was long, so we asked a bartender how much growlers are: "$18. Well, STARTING at $18." "Oh, ok." I was kind of pondering why she said that in a way like she didn't want to sell me one. "Oh, and if you want one, you better hurry up, cause we won't sell you one once it gets busy." That was really the clincher. Just straight-up rude is pretty annoying, but coupled with their pretentious attitude is too much. If you want a better, less douchey bar, go across the street to Cole's for cheaper, better beer, a less pretentious atmosphere, friendly staff, (but no food). I suppose this review is all for naught in the end, since it is destined to be deleted or score-changed by the powers that be.
