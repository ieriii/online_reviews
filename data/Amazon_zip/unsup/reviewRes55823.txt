We've frequented Calo since it's conveniently located right around the block from where we live. I've got to say their bread is phenomenal! Their baby back ribs are oh so yummy!! and their buffalo calamari is exquisite.. Will return again and again for their calamari!!! :D4 Stars due to pricy options for ok food ...
