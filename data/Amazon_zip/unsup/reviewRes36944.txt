This place has become increasingly popular and has expanded to a second store front. I've been coming here since it's opening several years ago when it received rave reviews. Unfortunately, with success, came attitude. As the place becomes more popular, the ego(s) of the the wait staff has increased correspondingly. The "manager," who doubles as the sushi staff member has become increasingly incapable of handling the increased volume. Staff members also can't be bothered to take phone orders or even forward a message to the owner when a long-time faithful customers has concerns about the way business is being handled. Like so many place, this place has become a victim of its own success. Poor service and increasingly indifferent food. It won't surivive long if Edgewater ever acquires some class.
