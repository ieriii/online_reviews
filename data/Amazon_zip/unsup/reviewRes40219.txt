I had a feeling I wasn't going to like this place from the instant we sat down......and by "instant" I mean the 90 mins we waited on a Wednesday night. Upon sitting, an old, fussy couple next to us inquired pompously to their waitress about the difference between "sustainable and organic lettuce." The waitress, albeit with a sort of charming naivete, spent 5 minutiae-laden minutes to explain the difference. After this, I had such an urge to ask if they could make me a garbage salad, but relented, figuring that such a joint already had enough irony. For drinks, my wife's cocktail was decent, but nothing deserving of the mixological hype that this place exudes.....though I do believe I detected a hint of pureed trout anus. When time came to order food, we decided on a couple small plates due to cost of the entrees.....now i understand esoteric descriptions are to upscale restaurants like cop glasses are to the fashion-conscious, cliche' yet irresistible, but these were mostly just frustrating. I would suggest an asterisk or parenthetical translation for us culinary rubes. The tete du cochon was overly greasy with a texture reminiscent of canned deviled ham. In retrospect, I should have had more whiskey. To sum it and this yelp review up, trying too hard is better than not trying at all, but it's still pretty annoying.
