We didn't make reservations, and when we got to this place it was BUTT-CROWDED. The host, who was super nice, took our name and said he'd call us when our table was ready. Being the 3 chatty ladies we are, we decided to go to 'bucks and chat before dinner. The host called, so we headed back to spacca. Although starbucks was a block away, we somehow got lost and went south when we thought we were going north! We called the restaurant to let them know we were lost and still planning on coming. Again, they were SO nice, telling us not to worry about it, etc. We were seated and all of us enjoyed the atmosphere. It was so warm and chill, and although the restaurant was really crowded it didn't feel too loud or intimidating. We started with an excellent salad, I think it was mostly spinach. Then ordered two differnet pizzas, the margherita and one of the buffalo types. Both pizzas were excellent. Perfect thin crust, amazing taste! We stayed there talking for awhile...it was just so cozy and inviting and TASTY. we also ordered drinks and dessert..  I don't recommend the dessert liqueur, but I think it is just not my taste. The tartufo and custard were super tasty! MMMMMM. I can't wait to go back!
