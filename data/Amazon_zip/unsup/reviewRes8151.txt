I followed the crowds to this place on a recent Friday night and waited about 40 minutes with my boyfriend before we got a seat. The waiting space is really cramped but the openness of the restaurant was generally very inviting (we could view the entire kitchen staff preparing pizzas for the oven). The bottom line in Spacca is that it is good for first-time diners newto the uber-thin pizza style. But for those that have had it several times previously, Spacca will certainly underwhelm. Overall, the pizza was just plain boring. Seasoning was amiss. The presentation was a mix of too-toasty ends and too-soggy middles. The appetizers were nice but nothing special. The space itself was inviting: cozy, open, and neighborhood-ly feeling but on the downside also a bit cramped. The wood everywhere (from the oven to the floors) made for a very loud dinner date, too. I think one really once this place DOESN'T SUCCEED is that it just misses the mark on authenticity for almost every dish. I don't think that the fact that owners ARE NOT ITALIAN has anything to do with it but when the recipes are just slightly off across the board you have to wonder...
