I am a Kimpton Hotel in touch member and became one specifically because of the incredible service and LOVE I feel when I travel on business to Chicago. What an incredible property full of architectural beauty and old world charm. But, more important, is concierge level of service you recieve from all of the Burnham staff. From the desk to the doormen to the restaurant everyone makes you feel totally special and at home. And here is the bonus. This is a pet friendly property. Since I cannot travel with my dog when on business I so enjoy seeing other guests pets whenI stay here. AND, there is a wine reception everyday where many guest come to enjoy a nice glass of complimentary wine and bring their dogs for all to enjoy. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place and would recommend it to anyone if they are traveling to Chicago on business or pleasure. Kudo's all around for excellence in hospitality.
