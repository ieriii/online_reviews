Wonderful interpretation of traditional tapas and Catalonian (seemed more like Basque to me) cuisine. Every dish was about two notches away from what we expected--in a very positive way. Patatas bravas, for example, looked liked a strip of neatly-arranged scallops rather than a dish of lumped orange potatoes. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered and are excited to try other areas of the menu next time. Please note that this is NOT a Ba Ba Reba or Iberico-type place. Don't take your party of 30 recent college grads here expecting a table with a jug of cheap sangria in front of every seat. Service, however, was notably off. The server was quite nice, but he just never came around much. We was off folding napkins when we wanted to order more food and another round of drinks. The bill for four of us was only $200--we're used to that for two. This has to be a fluke, and the food was more than good enough for us to give them another shot. Fingers crossed for next time. If the service is what it should be, this will be one of my favorite. Definitely repeat value here. Remember to get your valet ticket validated for a nice little break.
