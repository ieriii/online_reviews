I went here after the great reviews on yelp and the mention on http://Eater.com. I was kind of underwhelmed. The food was fair to fine, but maybe I just didn't order the right things? 1) Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette: The addition of pistachio gave a crunchy texture which enhanced the dish. We appreciated that the serving dish was rubbed with goat cheese, so it was everywhere already and we didn't have to take the time to spread it ourselves. 2) Chorizo Stuffed Olives. I was most excited about these. They were breaded and fried. I have no idea how they get the breading to stick to the olive, but whatever. These were flavorful bites! 3) Pork Neck Bone Rillette & Mostarda. I was mixed on this. There was a LOT of rillette for the serving. I felt bad for wasting it, but we really couldn't eat the whole jar. I appreciated the flake salt and the well toasted bread. It was tasty, but nothing I'd go home dreaming about. 4) Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic. This was very good. The tail meat was very tender and fell off the bone easily. You must love balsamic, though, to handle this dish. We had great service, but I left feeling "meh" about it all. It was good, but not, as my friend would say, "slap your momma good."
