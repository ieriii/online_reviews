Ordered the cuban sandwich and it was good! We also had an order of fries which I enjoyed. Sandwich was tasty, fries had some kind of breading on it and I also loved the plantains. Good stuff. I wish the place was a little bigger, had more places for people to sit. The prices are very reasonable. We ordered 2 sodas, a sandwich, fries and one lechon dinner for $21. A lot of food for what we spent. My boyfriend really didn't enjoy the lechon, it was shredded. We were expecting the Filipino lechon.
