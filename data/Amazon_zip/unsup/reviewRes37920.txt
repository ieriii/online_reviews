Friday Night, 8pm. "Table for 4, please" "That'll be 2 hours" *eeek*. I hate waiting for tables, and two hours??!??! At first I was flabbergasted, but surprisingly the wait wasn't that long at all, with their wide selection of wonderful beers. So finally we got to our table, and the food was awesome. I initially wanted to come here, after finding out about their moules frites (which I loved at Leon's in Paris. I've never been to Belgium, but I'm sure they make some killer moules frites as well). The mussels, were good with a nice white wine base, but their FRIES and AIOLI sauce were amazing. We were contemplating ordering another order of fries, but were already too full by the end of the meal. The Flemish stew was also delicious but the red wine a bit too heavy for my tastes. If you get anything out of this review, get the FRIES. The atmosphere was casual and fun. The beers were great and unique tasting and refreshing. The food was delcious. What more can you ask for?
