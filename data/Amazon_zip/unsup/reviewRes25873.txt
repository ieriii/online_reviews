We were seated promptly in the open-window restaurant. We ordered drinks. The mixed drinks were so-so. Food: Deep Dish sausage, black olive, & giardinera. The red sauce is sweet but tasty. Toppings are fresh and the sausage is awesome. The crust is fluffy and crisp all at the same time. The caramelized crust on the edge is fantastic. We were served by three different people. Servers were friendly and responded to our needs in a timely fashion. I recommend the deep dish here. I am not really a deep dish kind of girl, but this deep dish is a must. Bike parking out front.
