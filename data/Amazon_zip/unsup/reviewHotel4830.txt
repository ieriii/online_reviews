Nice rooms, good staff, outstanding locations. Within easy walk of several site and shopping. And bus stop right outside for using public transportation to get to those places not so close. Hotel bar and restaurant are slightly above average, prices are typical. Only con is parking. Parking in downtown Chicago is a B***h, thanks to Mayor Dayle. Parking is tight and expensive. Got into town later in evening and closes parking I could find was 5 blocks away (this is why valet parking is so expense at all of the downtown hotel). Unless you really need a car its best to leave it at home and use what public transportation is available (bus, taxi, shuttle, etc)
