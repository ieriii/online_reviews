This is a great hotel if you want a small," Boutique Hotel" experience in the Lakeview area with decent staff. This is Not a great hotel if you want a good nights sleep, however. Being near the Belmont red line station, I expected the usual city noise. However, it was the noise from other "guests" that was the problem....Walls very thin....could hear loud voices from across the hall, constant elevator activity, and tv from next room. Unfortunately, it is hard to find a nice hotel in this area, so I think it is worth it to stay downtown, and take the el.
