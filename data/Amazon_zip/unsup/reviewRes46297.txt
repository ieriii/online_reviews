I advise other Yelp reviewers to quit their yappin' about this "Cheesecake Factory Jr." balderdash -- while it's owned by the same and looks a little similar (if you squint) (while drunk), I've never found anything at the Cheesecake Factory I actually liked to eat, whereas I'd eat the Pasta Telephono every day and top it off with the beignets were this an option. It's not brilliant cuisine, but it's got a few damn good highlights. Would go again. Would like friends to stop dragging me to Cheesecake Factory instead.
