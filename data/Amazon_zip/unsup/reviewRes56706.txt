This is way too expensive for eh Italian. My nonna was born in Italy, so I eat more Italian food than I'd care to admit (and my butt shows it)...but I love it more than any other food. The food isn't inedible, but it's not great. Particularly for the price. And the service. On a pretty empty night I waited at the stand for at least 5 minutes, all the while making contact with 2 servers who were stopping to put down his/her glass of water or grab a rag, until someone asked if I'd been helped. The food was not worth the wait. Even the bread was stale.There is a reason this place is always on http://Restaurant.com, TwoBuckDuck, etc. Because it's not a place to seek out.
