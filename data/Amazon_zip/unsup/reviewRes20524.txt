I had no idea this place was so "fancy" until my friend and I walked in for a casual Sunday afternoon lunch and noticed the white tableclothes, tea lights, etc. Lovely atmosphere and decor. The menu had a wide selection and they were still offering the prix-fix menu for restaurant week. The service was great, very friendly and attentive, though we annoyed our waitress by taking too long to pay our bill and she kinda let us know it. I would definitely return to The Gage for dinner. Looks like a great date place or an awesome stop for a drink. As for the food, the fish and chips was yummy but a bit too heavy...I couldn't move after eating!!
