After the gargantuan amounts of hype, the little Chicagoan in me just couldn't resist. So, what's the verdict? Pretty darn good. I ordered the classic Superdawg which includes their famous dog and fries. Now I typically eat my hot dogs plain (absolutely no toppings on it), but just something about their dogs intimidated me so I decided to pile on everything. To my surprise, I actually liked their dogs with everything on it. But for me, I define everything on my dog being excluding ketchup. I have 100% Chicago blood in me. I wouldn't do disservice to my city. And also, how could you not love the place? Very retro. Any minor nitpicks? While the food was great, it's more the lines of a B+ rather than an A like everyone is claiming it is. Also, $5.25 for just a dog and fries? That's a bit on the ridiculous side. All in all, Superdawg is A-OK. Its very atmospheric, friendly, and offers great food. A bit on the pricey side, but not too shabby. My next stop is Gene and Jude's.
