Ok, I went back with some friends and way better! This place is a good brunch place! I love the creativity and the Pork is outstanding! It was mentioned in a local paper that they had great bacon (my secret lover) so I was thrilled! But, they were out of their special Publican bacon so we had to settle for regular old bacon. I was all geared up for the "special" bacon. But, to my amazement, the regular 'ol bacon was phenomenal! I can only dream about how great their Publican bacon must be....I can't wait to go back and give it a try. Everything everyone ordered smelled great and the presentation was impeccable. Way to step up your game! I'm glad I went back!
