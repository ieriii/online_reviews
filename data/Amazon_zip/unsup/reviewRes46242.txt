Ah Grand lux. Once I used to frequent you on a monthly basis. Your tempting Martini's and naughty desserts used to be amazing. I held a party here for a girlfriend who loves grand lux. Our food was oily( egg rolls were fried in oil that was the wrong temprature). And our drinks were weak . I also feel our meal was overpriced. I don't mind spending if I know the chef is using expensive ingrediants but 100.00 for 1 appetizer, 1 burger and one martini is a bit much.
