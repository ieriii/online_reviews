I have mixed feelings about Pequods. Every now and then I have a hankering for the caramelized crust on their pizzas, and that's a high compliment coming from someone who normally dislikes pizza crust. The meats they use are exceptionally spicy. Their pies are very good when they are fresh from the oven, but somehow as they cool down they become kinda dry & doughy in the middle - a bit too bread-y, as Brandon H points out. I generally like leftover pizza almost as much as I like fresh, but have never been terribly happy with re-heated Pequods. I would recommend dine-in over carry out, Pequods' dining space is fairly pleasant, and I've found the carry-out exprience to be a bit messy, last time I ordered out I almost ruined a pair of pants when pizza grease started flowing freely out of the carryout box. Ick.
