Normally I wouldn't review a place that has so many reviews already (especially when everyone basically agrees that Pequod's has the best pizza in chicago), but I'm posting and giving 5 stars anyways just to counteract the two reviews (Michael W and Tina) who gave it 2 and 3 stars, respectively, for being a crummy white sox bar. Um, how do I say this gently, IT'S A PIZZA RESTAURANT, NOT A BAR! Seriously, how stupid do you have to be to think this is a bar? How could you be confused, did you notice that everyone was eating pizza? That every table had pizza menus, shakers, and napkims and forks? That the actual bar has like 5 seats which people only sit at if they're waiting for a table? That the overwhelming smell that hits you when you walk in is PIZZA- not beer? If you're looking for a bar, go to a bar- there's one two doors down. If you want to eat pizza, then go to Pequod's, you'll be happy. Oh, and they happen to have a great, albeit small, beer list too//
