Very pretty and different, but the food was just good Thai/Chinese. The drinks were really expensive, wine was either $40/bottle or over $230 but nothing in between. We went with vodka and can tell you it was not Grey Goose so we switched to Kettle One and although we paid for name brand we were served horrible vodka both times... the duck was over cooked. The Shrimp beignets bland. My three teens liked it though since it was unusual and the service was attentive and nice.
