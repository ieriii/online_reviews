My family and I stayed at the Embassy Downtown for a mini-vaca and we were glad we chose this hotel. I contacted the concierge before arrival to let them know we would be arriving early and to verify that we could store our luggage before we checked in to the room. To my surprise, our room was available upon arrival because of my earlier inquiry. The hotel is located a short walk from the Michigan Ave and State Street shopping districts and is right next to a grocery store that provides any toiletries you may have forgotten. The staff greeted us throughout our stay and were quite helpful navigating the streets. The free breakfast helped us keep our costs down and had many options from muffins to made to order omelets. We swam in the pool a few times and although it is small, it is perfect for young kids and doing laps. The bed was really comfortable and the suite gave us room to spread out and enjoy ourselves. We'll definitely return to the Embassy in the future.
