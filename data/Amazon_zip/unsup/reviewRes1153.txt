You're an idiot if you think 2+2 = 3, but you're even more of an idiot if you don't realize that going to Hot Doug's on a Saturday afternoon will require at least an hour long wait. My friends and I waited 2. Bring a deck of cards and your sudoku along with your cash, because you're going to need it. People will do ridiculous things for encased meats and duck fat fries. This was one of my last meals in Chicago was, and what a way to go. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris. I love foie, truffle and sausage, so this was heaven. obesity heaven, but heaven nonetheless. I tried a friend's Saucisson Alsacienne: Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Montboissie Cheese...normally i don't like blues, and pungent blues at that, but with bacon and caramelized onions, it all went together perfectly. She enjoyed it thoroughly too. On a challenge, my other friend ordered the Mountain Man Sausage (A Damn Tasty Combination of Buffalo, Venison, Elk and Antelope) with Cassis Mayonnaise and Sartori Raspberry Cheese. She loved it and devoured hers first. I can proudly now say i've tried all those game meats. Thanks, Hot Doug's. And the boyfriend ordered up a regular dog and a Fire Dog (Keira Knightley). Boys are so low maintenance... I miss Chicago already. and Hot Doug's in particular. Not the line though. No one misses that line.
