Im a big fan of Kimpton Hotels -- they're always a little funky, quirky, and not to mention comfortable. The Hotel Allegro is really no different. Location is great -- sort of business district I guess, but everything in the city is walkable (granted this is Illinois, and therefore flat. I walked 15 miles in one day w/out really realizing it). Check in was a breeze, staff were friendly and helpful, and made sure I knew about the wine tastings they had available for FREE. That was an awesome extra touch as well. Lobby has trendy oontzy music playing, elevators are quick. Rooms are mod and posh -- though not on the huge side. For one to two people though they are more than fine. There are plenty of extra pillows on a comfy bed (always a bonus for me). Internet access is available for an exorbitant price. Room service, Big tv -- but I didn't use them, and thin as paper walls. I heard my neighbors having a good old time every morning about 6 am and Im sure they heard my late night good times as well. At least we all were enjoying ourselves. Checkout was easy - via the phone. I did however pay extra for a late checkout and the damned cleaning staff kept forgetting and walking in on me while I was packing/getting ready to go. All in all a great centrally located hotel, will def come back when im in the windy city again.
