I have been here 2 times now. I was blown away the first time and had a great meal the second time. We did the 4 course menu both times and it is a BYOB restaurant, Yay!!. Everyone at the table must do the same amount of courses. If you are lucky enough to experience the scallops as one of your courses, clap your hands and jump for joy because they are absolutely amazing. We only had one disappointing course in our two visits, but I forgive them, as they graciously gave us another course. The lamb chop was under par in the opinion of our entire table. It was just a bad cut, very fatty and extremely difficult to cut. They gave us some yellowfin sashimi afterward and it was very good. This time around, dessert was a delicious, warm molten lava spice cake with a pear galette and vanilla ice cream. I will definitely be back for a third time.
