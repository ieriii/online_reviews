Best Al Pastor I've had in a decade. Most meat on a burrito since I don't know when. Delicious, fresh, crisp lard-fried chips. Cool, delicious salsa. I can't wait to go back. (I used to go to this place about 20 years ago, when I last lived in Lincoln Square. Glad to see they're still around. They deserve their success.)
