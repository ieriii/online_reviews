My girlfriend and I just moved in around the corner from this place and we LOVE Thai food. We were really excited but skeptical about Indie, but decided to give it a try because it was so convenient. We were so incredibly pleasantly surprised!!! Any Thai or rice dish you try is delicious - I personally don't like maki but my gf is always impressed with what she orders. Also the lunch specials are a great deal and run throughout the weekend too.  Delivery is fast, service is great and always friendly. Wonderful gem in Edgewater. Definitely a must try. You will be going back for more, again and again and again!  PS Tried Nori a few blocks away b/c my gf had a groupon - food not as great, but the fresh squeezed lemonade is OUTTA THIS WORLD!!!
