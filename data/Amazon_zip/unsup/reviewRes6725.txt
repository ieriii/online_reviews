We had a great experience last night at this restaurant. The menu has a huge variety from pastas to fine cheeses done in a not so fussy way. It was refreshing to see the wine pricing and straight forward corkage fee. The only concern was slow dinner service with half of the table receiving their entrees and the other half waiting about 15 minutes. We were part of a larger group, so this may not be the case with smaller reservations. The food was definitely worth the wait. I would suggest ordering a bunch of starters and sides for the table to get the chance to taste everything!
