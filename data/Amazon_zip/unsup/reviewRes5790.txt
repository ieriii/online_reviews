I'm so glad to hear Karen T. enjoyed her meal here, because I was the fellow vegetarian she spoke of. I had felt bad that they had eaten completely vegetarian, and insisted they get some meat dishes, so I'm overjoyed to hear that she loved it! The meal was amazing, and basically everything Karen T. said. Everything was rich, decadent, and provided a great balance between sweet and savory. The honeycomb/ricotta vasi came highly recommended, and it did not disappoint. It was sweet, creamy and so delicious. I would have eaten the rest with a spoon if our server hadn't brought us more toast. We then split a truffle oil pizza, the truffled egg toast, and the farro. All of the dishes were excellent. The truffle oil pizza was slightly heavy on the truffle oil for my tastes, but still delicious. The farro was my favorite. It had a great balance between savory, sweet, soft and chewy. We ended the meal with the cow cheese focaccia, which was so delicious that we could only eat a little bit of it. Overall, a great meal. I'll definitely return!
