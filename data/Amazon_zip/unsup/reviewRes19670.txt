Mmmmmm.....The Gage....if you were only closer..... Popped in with a group after the fashion show Saturday night to grab some cocktails and bites at the bar and was not disappointed! I loved our bartender.....adorable...check....Irish accent......check.....attentive....check! Seriously....I've married men for less :) Got a nice Sauvignon Blanc.....said by the glass....def more like a glass and 1/2....and in my book.....more wine = more happy! Veggie friends just ordered the Fries w/ Curry Gravy.....fries were good....gravy was okay....I've had the traditional version in an Irish pub before....and I wish the gravy was a tad bit thicker so it clung to the fries or that they would have served it over the fries so they would get all nice and gooj-y and eatable with a fork! My friend and I split the burger....and am so glad I didn't endeavor to eat that monster by myself.....it was big and messy and everything a burger should be! We ordered it medium....and it was perfect! I was still thinking about it the next day....mmmmmm....love me a good burger. I got a side of mayo for my burger and ended up dipping most of my fries in that....so did my Dutch friend : ) Our other friends ordered the Fish and Chips....I tasted.....moist flaky....crunchy....flavor of the fish intact but not over powering....and not oily.....yay to the fish n' chips!! Love this place....all dark and woody and untourist-y....with food that is actually well thought out and delicious.....I wish...I wish...I wish it was closer to my 'hood....I would be a regular!
