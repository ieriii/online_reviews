Ohhhh L&E what oh what do I do with you? Your food is inventive, interesting, and delicious if not a bit on the scant side. On one occasion a salad arrived as just lettuce - where were the ingredients?!?! No real worries, it was brought to a servers attention and another was expedited in the blink of an eye. Their Manhattan is delicious. I would like to spread the acclaim on 3 others but they were out...?!? How do you run out of 3 house cocktails by 7pm? Service can be a mixed bag. Yes your servers are the hippest of the hipsters and depending who brings what you might get a side of attitude with your gnuddi. But you might also forget your jacket and umbrella and have the nicest front of house have it in their graces. Friends happened to be staying at the hotel adjacent to L&E and there are all sorts of perks such as reservations at the restaurant, poker chips in exchange for bourbons. Rooms are nicely appointed while minibar is a little rich. I'd give L&E 5 stars if they could be more consistent and cut the attitude, because really they're pretty genius on the food frontier. Asparagus risotto, gnuddi, cheese plate, compressed melon salad, chocolate trifle, coconut custard are all worth your time and taste buds.....
