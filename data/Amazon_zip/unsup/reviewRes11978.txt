If you are a pancake fan, which I DEFINITELY am, then this is the place for you!! We walked in at prime time- around 10 or so and they told us the wait would be 30-40 min and it only took 15 or so. My friend and I got two plates of pancakes to share. We got the peanut butter banana and then the chocolate pancakes- it's SINFUL how good these things are!!! Portions are huge and you definitely have to have a sweet tooth to really appreciate the food! (they need more seating though!!!)
