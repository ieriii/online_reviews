Good location-right on Michigan Avenue, so there's usually a very long wait for dinner-especially on a weekend night. We usually wait at the bar for a drink or two before we are escorted to a table. Once we waited for an hour, but was given complimentary appetizers for the ridiculously long wait. I always like when we get seated near the window (during the holidays, a window table is a plus).  Food is average-tasting...burger, sandwiches, but lots to choose from.
