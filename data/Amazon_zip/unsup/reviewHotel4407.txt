I was here for a conference and if I had a choice, I would never have come back again. Granted, it had a nice lobby and had a great sense of history to it, but it wasn't worth the 300 a night. I wasn't staying in the lobby, I was staying in some tiny little room that has a television off to the side so you had to strain your neck to watch it. It had only TWO towels per room (what if we want to take more than one shower a day?). The pillows were flat and the walls were incredibly thin. It was hard to fall sleep and stay asleep as the hallways can be really loud. Also, the maid service knocks on your door at exactly 8 in the morning to try to clean your room.  All this might have been forgivable if they didn't try to nickel and dime you every moment. They charged an extra fee for internet service and they charged you 15 dollars to use the gym. They were also undergoing renovations so there was only one entrance from the street. Not the greatest hotel experience, but I guess it was slightly better than motel 6.
