I haven't found better sushi for the price in Chicago. The experience is sometimes hit-or-miss I think it depends on who is preparing the sushi that night and how busy they are. This place gets alot of delivery and carryout so sometimes it's deceiving as to how busy they really are. Sometimes a bit heavy on cream cheese but if that's your thing then it's great. I usually stick away from anything with flavored mayo because that always seems to be a little much for my tastes. They also have an excellent spicy tuna roll which also seems to vary from night to night but is usually outstanding. I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I keep holding out for sushi as good as I had in California... probably wishful thinking while dead center between both coasts.
