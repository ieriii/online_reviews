My in-laws took me here for the first time a few years ago when I think it had first opened and I was impressed then and I'm impressed now. Two weeks ago, a co-worker of mine and I went there for a pre-dinner snack of both cheese and wine. The experience is described below. Walking in, you're not really sure what to expect since the place seems like a wine store and restaurant combined into one. Maybe that's because it's exactly what it is. We sat down at the large bar area that was surrounded by an interesting cast of characters, but most people seemed to be over the age of 30. I'm not sure if that was just the night we were there, but that's ok because I'm over 30 myself and the days are over when I want to be surrounded by 22 year olds. It's a nice airy place with a very modern and minimalist design. It looks like they took care on its design, but didn't pay some mega-expensive interior designer to come in and match every single little thing. The service is also good. The bartender was quite friendly and attentive. So, both of us ordered a flight of wine and a flight of cheese. The wine was all of above average quality and my co-worker, who is a bit of a wine snob, was impressed with the selection available. Where they fell down a bit was the cheese. Out of the 5 or 6 cheeses that were in our flight of cheese, I think only 2 were actually available. Then, we'd say "we'll have this cheese instead" and guess what? They were out of that too. It was almost like they had run out of cheese that night and wanted to sell the dregs of whatever was left. The cheese we ended up with was quite tasty, but c'mon now...this is a restaurant that's supposed to specialize and I didn't get what I wanted. If I wanted to compromise, you just stay home and cook. All in all, a good experience, provided they figure out a way to keep the cheeses they have on the menu in stock.
