Sure - the breakfast is great, the wine selection is among Chicago's best, and the place is lofty-contemporary-cool.... but I'm surprised to see no one has brought up that this is the BEST place to "power lunch" with clients.  Stop in for lunch during the week and you'll notice there are lots of powerpoint decks, briefcases, and plenty of suited ad sales folks.  Why? For starters this place is centrally located in between some of Chicago's largest agencies and publishers... and it's also got a fancy pants feel without being too formal or expensive.  The 36-minute lunch guarantee is something you can't find in most other downtown restaurants (who cater to both Mag Mile tourists and the River North). You'll be served within 36 minutes, leaving plenty of time for discussion with clients about those "best practices", "market opportunities" and "action items".  The waiters are generally pretty hip to the sales / meeting scene and won't rudely interrupt when you are making a pivotal point or trying to "close the deal". The noise level is perfect - it's just loud enough to keep things interesting, but you don't have to worry about shouting over your souffle.  When heading out the door - be sure to stop over at the buffet for some free bottled water or coffee (great if you've thrown back some drinks and need to pull things together before popping back to the office). Or so I've heard....never tried that myself, of course.  There are fancier and more impressive options for really big meetings, but for everyday business lunches - this place can't be beat.
