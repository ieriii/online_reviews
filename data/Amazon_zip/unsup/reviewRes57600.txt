You will not find a better Greek restaurant in Chicago. Its so good i don't even know where to begin. Saganaki Great, Avagalemeno Soup Great, and my favorite the Lamb Chops so amazing and juicy. And if you can make room for dessert try the rice pudding! Last but not least i think their service is almost as good as the food and that's saying a lot. The waiters with their thick Greek accents it just seems like anytime you need them they just are right there, service for sure A+
