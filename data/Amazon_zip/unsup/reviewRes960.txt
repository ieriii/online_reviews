Doug is very nice. The place is a bit out of the way and the wait is decent if you get there before it opens. The Duck Fat Fries were heaven and plentiful while the sausages (I had the bratwurst and Foie Gras) were a bit too rich for my taste. Definitely a place thats worth visiting at least once if you're in the area though.
