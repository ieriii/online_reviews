One of my favorite spots in Chicago, even after I moved out of the neighborhood. Come for the huge and delicious selection of beer, stay for the moules frites.  Hopleaf used to be just a great small bar with an enourmous selection of beer. They expanded the bar to a few years ago to include a restaurant in the back with the intention of serving good Belgian/French influenced food. I remember reading that they wanted to be THE spot for late night diners. Seems they have attracted diners at all hours of the day. It can be hard to find a table here on a busy weekend night, so sample a Kwak (it comes in a large test tube like glass supported by a wooden stand) in the crowded bar area while you wait for a table in the back.
