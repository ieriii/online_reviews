Lately, everything I've tried on the menu is quite good. In particular, they serve up one of the best vegetarian burritos I've had, and the tortilla shell is gently fried and a little crispy. The red sauce is also excellent. I've tried all the tacos as well, which are exceptional as they lightly grill the fresh tortillas. The interior is beautifully decorated, with red walls and paintings and a poster of American soldiers tricking natives with a bottle of coke. The ambience WOULD be nice, but the TV is ALWAYS on full tilt, usually something pretty violent with lots of screaming and sobbing. So I settle for takeout. And please, if you're white and non-Hispanic... this is Logan Square, 65% Hispanic. You can't expect all wait staff to speak English. Try learning a little Spanish.
