India House was very popular with people at work for their buffet. It's a great deal with plenty of variety, and $15 or whatever it is these days probably gets you the best Indian food in downtown Chicago. We've had some pretty amusing incidents with the wait staff at India House over the years. The less said the better, but don't go in with high expectations. Regardless of the service, it loses two stars for its overpriced dinner menu. It just doesn't cut it for dinner - Gaylord India a couple of blocks north is a much better deal (and much better food) after sunset.
