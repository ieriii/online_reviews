Perhaps it was the night or my date (the bf), but I had a really nice dinner here. I was last at The Pig during the late summer and ate outside. We ate at one of the communal tables and while it seems awkward at first, it was fine for the meal. Main advice: Stick to the food here. Beer is served small and expensive. Wine is served the same. I think I would have rather had more tasty food than the alcohol that took up a quarter of our bill. Loved the pate and the pork shoulder. Would definitely have again. All in all, a SOLID choice and a restaurant I'm looking forward to going back to.
