We stayed here on NYE and knew we wanted to see the fireworks at the fountain and go ice skating at Millenium Park so that helped in our decision on where to stay. Also it had the best prices for a hotel in Chicago, on the Magnificent Mile, and on NYE. The hotel was fairly nice and we didn't have any problems. I figured the room would be sort of small but it was a little bigger than I thought. The bathroom could have been a little bigger but we were only staying for one night so I tried not to complain. If you are looking for a cheap hotel on the mag mile I would definately recommend this place!
