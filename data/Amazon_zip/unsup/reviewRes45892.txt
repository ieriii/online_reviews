Grand Lux Cafe is definitely one of my favorite places to eat downtown. However, I happened to be one of the many people rolling in a bit close to closing time. It wasn't very busy, yet, I waited five minutes for a waiter to even come. Also, I had to ask for bread, which was disappointing. What was even MORE disappointing was when I took a bite into one of the pieces of bread--it was cold. I wouldn't recommend being part of the late-night crowd here.
