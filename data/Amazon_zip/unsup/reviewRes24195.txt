Probably the best Greek restaurant around. The Avgolemono soup is great. As are the Dolmades. The Saganaki is great too. The Greek potato-garlic spread, As well as the light red fish spread is another good treat. The Gyros are good too, As well as the Pastachio. The rice pudding, chocolate cake are great dinner completions. The rice & yogurt seemed to be to rich as a dinner entree. Maybe as a dessert it wouldn't be as bad.
