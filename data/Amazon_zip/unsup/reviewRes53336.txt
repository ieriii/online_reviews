My wife and I are from Toronto and came to Chicago for a long weekend. We made our reservations about 8 weeks in advance and had a choice of 5:15 or 9:15. We took the earlier sitting. The room is beautiful, the service was close to perfect and the food was unforgettable. The stand out dishes were the Yuba - (shrimp, miso, togarashi) , Razor Clam - (carrot, soy, daikon), Rabbit rillette, the short rib and the dessert, created on your table ( they put a silicon tablecloth over your table and spread the ingredients across the surface) We selected the vintage wine pairing and I felt pretty good about that decision. Table 52 first night and Alinea on the second was certainly one extreme to the other. If you consider yourself a foodie, Alinea should be on your list of places to go. One caution: it is very expensive
