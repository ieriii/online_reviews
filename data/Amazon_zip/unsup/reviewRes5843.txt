My first visit to Davanti Enoteca two nights ago definitely won't be my last!  With a lot of Italian restaurants in Chicago, you gotta do something to stand out and Davanti does just that. Plates are served as shareable small plates. I love this because it gives you the option to try a lot of things. Service was pretty good. I like that they have daily specials like a daily polenta and daily bruschette.  What we had: Ricotta/honey and bread- Get it! It won't dissapoint.  Polenta of the day - Pork shoulder ragu- This I would compare to crack. I've thought about it every day since! It was really amazingly delicious Truffle Egg Appetizer- The smell of truffle was wafting at us right as this dish came to the table. We ate it up quickly Pizza - Our pizza had different types of soppresata. A great crust too! Cacio e Pepe- Delicious pasta - very fresh Dessert - Gelato and Sorbet I want to go back right now just thinking about this place.
