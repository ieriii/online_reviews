I didn't want to give it all five stars because it is pricey and it is snobbish, but I do love the place and will definitely be going back. I haven't checked out the cafe, just the grocery market, but it has all the hard to find foods I love. I would not, like others, compare it to Whole Foods. The cheese selection is great (although they didn't have what I was looking for: Harzer kse!), lots of really good looking meat and hard to find cooking ingredients. If you want to try your hand at fancier cooking, this would be a good place to go. Pricey, though!
