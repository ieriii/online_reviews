I came, I had a veggie dog, and my life was changed! I have been trying to get to Hot Doug's for months and finally made it. Best veggie dog I've EVER had (topped with mustard and caramelized onions). While most store-bought veggie dogs tend to leave me underwhelmed, the Pete Shelley did me right. Their regular fries are pretty damn good too--the perfect combination of a crispy outside and fluffy inside. Veggie dog, black cherry pop, and fries = $5.25 I'll be baaaack.
