I used to live in Chicago. This is by far my favorite place to eat, and I am not even a pork fanatic. Whenever I come to visit Chicago, stopping here is on the top of my list! First off, all of their dishes are small plates. This is my favorite way to dine. I like to eat a small amount of a lot of things. Every dish is amazing. The braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes is to die for! Comfort food to the max. The prosciutto stuffed deep fried olives are heavenly. The fried pig ear with a fried egg, kale and peppers is also one of my favorites. I never could have imaged pig ear could be so good. I am salivating just thinking about it. The location is very convenient for visitors. It is nearby many nice hotels (Conrad, Embassasy Suites). If you are visiting Chicago this is a must!!!
