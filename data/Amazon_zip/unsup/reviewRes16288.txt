This place is nothing short of AMAZING. The decor is beautiful, the bartenders are hot and the drinks are divine. This is by far my favorite watering hole in Chicago. A few tips: Go early. I hear it really packs up later in the night. They open around 6ish though so it's the perfect pre-dinner cocktail spot. Second, sit at the bar. Third, don't order from the menu. Describe your likes and dislikes to the bartender and get ready to drink the best cocktail you've ever had in your life. They'll make something that is so perfectly you it will knock your socks clean off.
