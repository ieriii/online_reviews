The coconut chicken is so good I want to make a meal of it every time I go there. They have the very best salmon I've ever had there. Get the bbq salmon! They cook it on a plank of cedar and bring it out to you on it! This place is absolutely huge too and the prices are extremely reasonable. A very great place to take guests from out of town!
