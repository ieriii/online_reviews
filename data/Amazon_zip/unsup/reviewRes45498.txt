I had just finished moving into Lakeview (near my step-sister) and my parents decided to take everyone out to dinner. My step-sister recommended this place and I thought it was great! The bar tender produced and awesome French martini, which I enjoyed as I looked over the menu. There were so many comfort food classics such as meat loaf, mac-n-cheese, roasted chicken, but I decided to sink my teeth into the Chicken-Pot-Pie. It was ah-maz-ing! I couldn't have been more happy with the choice, and I made it again when I took my boyfriend to dinner there last week. This time we tried the chicken wings as well, they had a sweet tangy sauce that was complimented by blue cheese dressing.
