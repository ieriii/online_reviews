Over Over Over Over OVERRATED!!!! This place is awful, I serioulsy think you could go across to jewel and make your own hot dog and it would be cheaper and a lot better. I got the the traditional Chicago style hot dog and what made it bad was it's bland taste along with a stale bun and maybe the worst fries I have ever had. The funny thing is that I went there around 12 on a Wednesday with no line at all (funny for such a "highly"rated place). I also realized when I was eating there that everyone in the "dining room" area were tourists. Locals don't go to Superdawgs cause they know it's not very good just tourist. Go to Gene and Judes in River Grove, best hot dogs in the area
