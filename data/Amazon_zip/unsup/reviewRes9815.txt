This review is only for the special event side of the restaurant. The pre-set mandatory menu for a larger party is extremely overpriced. There was not enough food, and you could tell they were trying to get away with cheaper as they brought out much less of the more expensive options that we chose for our pre-fixed menu. I would take a private party elsewhere.
