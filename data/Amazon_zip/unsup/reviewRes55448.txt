Pretty decent food and atmosphere. I went there on a date and it was nice to have a fancy place to get to know someone. The services is really good as well. It is expensive given that it is more of an upscale place and I found the food to be good, but maybe not as good as what I paid for. They have a great wine selection and the bread that you get with dinner was delicious.
