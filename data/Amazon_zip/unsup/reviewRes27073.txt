I don't know how I avoided this place for so many years. My husband made me go after it was highly recommended from his co-workers a few years ago. It was winter and we had the table next to the front door----which made me angry and cold all through my dinner. I don't remember liking anything about Nuevo Leon that day. I know I wasn't the only disappointed one---my husband never wanted to give it another try either. Then, one fine day, my co-workers decided to order lunch from here. I didn't know what poison I wanted to order so I took the longest to decide. I settled for the enchiladas suizas and when I picked up our order, the cashier gave me extra food for free because someone didn't show up for their pick-up order. To my surprise, she gave me an order of nachos and 3 tostadas. My co-workers kept the tostadas but I was stuck with the nachos. A nacho chip with beans, cheese, avocado and sour cream didn't excite me after my first Nuevo Leon experience but once I ate them---I fell in love! My enchildas and double refried beans were delish and the rice was ok. I went home and told my husband he must give it another try. This is very unlike me.. usually I hate something and I hate it forever. We went back and had a little plate of chorizo with beans as the freebie before your meal. The second time we went, we had a chicken soup I wasn't too fond of. Nevertheless, we love their queso con chorizo, fajita dinner, their taco appetizer and, of course, the nachos and enchiladas suizas. I can't remember what we had the first time but we'll try not to order that again!
