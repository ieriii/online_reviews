This is a cute corner storefront with a long entry to the dining area. Walls are loaded with Chicago celebs and politicians posing with the owner. The owner has kind of an "in your face" personality which can be perceived as either charming or a little tiresome. He is clearly in charge greeting diners, checking every table, taking orders, explaining discounts, preparing the bill. The servers are pleasant. Food is ok. The soup and dense bread take the edge off hunger while awaiting entrees.The goulash is a little greasy, and the veal paprikash is overpowered by too much garlic in the accompanying mashed potatoes. Nice touch with the jazz combo. An old brown envelope is included with the bill asking for a per person contribution to the musicians. Never experienced this in a restaurant.
