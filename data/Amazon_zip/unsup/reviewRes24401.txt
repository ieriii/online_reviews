I don't know what it was that I didn't like at Mercat. Maybe it was the limited variety of food. Maybe was the way they served everything family style from a pre-set menu and you had no say in the what you were being fed. Maybe it was because we had to flag down a server more times that we should have had to. Something about our brunch just felt a bit off.  The food was decent and a good value for $25 (plus the bottomless mimosas or bloody mary bar will give you a nice zing were a mere $8 extra), but I really would have liked a few made-to-order options or had some input into what I was being served. This brunch was also heavy on the lunch and light on the breakfast, which was disappointing to me.
