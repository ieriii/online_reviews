i really like beer. i really like mussels. i really like a lot of other things on their menu. i mostly like the staff - they are, by and large, pleasant and friendly. i really like the hopleaf. that said -- don't try and bring a big group in. firstly, it's not a huge place. secondly, if you luck out and get to sit together, if you don't order enough food, they get irritated. if you want to get a seat, you need to want it, esp. on the weekend. come early. now that they have been favorably reviewed by every publication under the sun (including Bon Appetit), they aren't just the cool neighborhood place anymore and you have to plan ahead. don't drive. belgian beers are many things: tasty, interesting, more expensive, super alcoholic in most cases ... all this together means you should either cab it, ride the train, walk, or find someone to see your drunk self home. this is meant to constitute a ringing endorsement. i bring people here that i want to impress, and i go here when i want to give myself a pick me up. which can be anytime.
