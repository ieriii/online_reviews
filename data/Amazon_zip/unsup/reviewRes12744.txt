My son and I were visiting Chicago for his shopping trip. A mother and son bonding time before he goes off to college. We went to Texas de Brazil because we never had Brazilian style steaks. Wow, this place will fill you up. Thank goodness I was with a meat-eater kid. It will not be good if you do not like meat, although they have excellent side dishes too. But the main food is meat. I loved the house special, Picanha, and ram chops. They were excellent!! We must have been seated close to kitchen where they start serving, so all meats were very hot and juicy. I loved their Brazilian sausages. The only regret is that they did not have any pork for some reason. We focused really on the meat but they had really great side dishes and fish. I loved their seared tuna and smoked salmon. Service was great. What was greater was that we got a 15 % discount coupon from a hotel valet. And we were not even staying at this hotel!! (We just asked the direction and he gave a coupon to us! Thank you!) I will definitely visit Texas de Brazil when I visit Chicago next time.
