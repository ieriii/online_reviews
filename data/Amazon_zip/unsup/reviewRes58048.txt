I had lunch there and was excited because of the positive things that I've heard. I asked the waitress for a recommendation...she didn't understand English and offered little help. I decided to order my old stand by...shrimp with lobster sauce. I also ordered egg drop soup, which I thought was pretty good....very flavorful.  The shrimp with lobster sauce had canned peas and carrots, canned mushrooms and canned water chestnuts. I complained and was offered something different. I asked for fried shrimp and spring rolls.  The owner, chef came over and explained that szechuan cuisine doesn't use fresh vegetables, that they always use canned vegetables!!!  I looked at the website, where they boast on their use of fresh vegetables. He went on to say that noone uses fresh vegetables in szechuan recipes, only in cantonese. I was amazed that he would insult me by telling me such nonsense. I told him that I had eaten Chinese food many, many times and that what he said didn't make any sense. At about that time, the check was brought, no other food was ever brought to the table. I paid my tab and left very unhappy.  I will never eat at any of the restaurants in this group again!!
