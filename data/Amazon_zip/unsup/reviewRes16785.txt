I'm a huge lover of Indian food and India House is the best option if you're not able to make a trip out to Devon! This is the best Indian restaurant outside of Devon and I've been there a few times for dinner. All that's left is for me to try the buffet lunch! Service: Wonderful! The waiters are always available and your glass is always filled, empty plates are taken away promptly, and if your candle goes out, no worries! A new one will take it's place before you know it! Atmosphere: I love the ambience! It's great for a date, or for a nicer dinner with a group of friends. There's really nothing to complain about and even when it gets busy, you still have just enough privacy to carry on your private conversation! And most importantly... FOOD: My all time favorite Indian dish is Paneer Makhani. India House's version was very tasty, but could've used a bit more paneer. Then again, what Indian restaurant is going to load your curry with paneer? If you're absolutely famished, go for one of the house special dinners! On my 2nd visit, I ordered the Tandoori Mixed Grill special and it's definitely enough to fill two people! You won't be disappointed with the amount of food! I've been there twice and you will see me frequenting this restaurant again!
