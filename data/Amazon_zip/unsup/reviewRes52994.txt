This place is lucky that the food is awesome, because that's the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. The first time I came here was with my husband and daughter, and we were in absolute awe of the food. Up until then, all we knew about Cuban food was the late Rancho Luna. Yesterday there were about 7 of us there as part of my friend's bachelorette party. Positives: Excellent food, excellent value. Negatives: How can I say this? It would be nice if staff could be a tad more cheerful. Is that too much to ask for on a saturday night? Our waiter was knowledgable, but obviously annoyed and impatient with a couple of the more indecisive guests who were simply unfamiliar with Cuban cuisine through no fault of their own. Eventually, we were asked to leave by the hostess who explained that we were taking up a large table. I agree with reviewer Gabrielle S. -- their avocados are to die for. Other must-tries: toston cups filled with shrimp, bacalao frito, yuca fries, and guava and cheese empanadas. Really there's probably nothing on the menu that isn't spectacular, but I'm a stickler when it comes to customer service and atmosphere, so 90 Miles gets 2 stars off just for not meeting my expectations in those categories. Don't mean to be so hard on them. It's definitely a place I'd recommend for smaller groups, because I know plenty of people who would not have let the waiter's rudeness slide the way I did.
