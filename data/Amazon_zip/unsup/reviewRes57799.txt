Contrary to what some have written, Nana was outstanding. The food, the service, and the prices were all exceptional. Some highlights:Duck and shrimp tostada with some of the most outstanding guac I've had.Spectacular cheese selection.Peach, cherry, habanero cobbler? Yes please!My personal favorite was the blueberry, lavender and basil pesto in the dessert. It was refreshing, yet full-bodied.Not only was the food and service wonderful, but the overall atmosphere of the restaurant makes for a great night to spend with friends.I will be frequenting Nana!
