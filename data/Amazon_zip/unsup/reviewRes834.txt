Duck Foie gras?!? Yeah! Love them to death err well hunger. I have stood in lines in 90 degree scorching sun, pelting rain and jet lag. I go to Chicago just to eat there. I advise strangers I meet on a cross-country trip to please go there. I love Doug and his sense of humor, the decor, the food, the everything about Hot Doug's! Really go there, stand it, it's worth it. Also dress comfy, wear sunscreen and bring water, you will be standing in line for a while.
