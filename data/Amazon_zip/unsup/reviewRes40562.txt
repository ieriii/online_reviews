In the Carne Asada Burrito battle of SoCal vs ChiTown... Chitown, while I like you, I don't love you. SoCal reigns supreme! Here's why::: donde esta mi guacamole?! And $6.50 for a burrito?! This isn't Chipotle! Oh yeah.. and the steak was CHEWY! Is it steak?! My SoCal Robertos, Filibertos and all Ertos, Inc. is bomb! Being closer to the Mexican border does have its benefits. Sorry ChiTown, you were good but not good enough. I mean, I will still come here to get my late night fix. I like the simple menu of 4 things you can order. Make's it easy for me to figure out what combo of meat, beans, rice and cheese I want.
