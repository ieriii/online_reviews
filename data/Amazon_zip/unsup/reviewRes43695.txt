My mom and I went to the Kinzie Chop House on Saturday since we were at the Merchandise Mart and they were running some sort of prix fixe menu. Also it was close and we were starving. Luckily my mom and I have the same brain so when it came to picking an appetizer and entree, we both were torn between the same two choices. Luckily time two, we are smart enough to not order the same thing and split that right down the middle. Yay for smart ladies. For the first course we got the salad with balsamic vinaigrette and the bruschetta... also with balsamic vinaigrette. They love them some balsamic. For a $27.95 prix fixe menu I was expecting approximately one tiny piece of toast with like four cubes of tomato on it but oh lordy no, it was three fist sized pieces of bread with tomatoes exploding out of it. So much goodness. The salad bowl was deceptively deep, we kept eating and it never went anywhere. Double thumbs up for the starters. For entrees, I got the jumbo shrimp with broccoli and mushrooms and my mom got the 8 oz Kinzie cut with rosemary french fries. Steak was cooked perfectly and the butter on it was heavenly. Fries were awesome, crispy and perfectly seasoned. Plus anything with rosemary wins in my book. The shrimp again, perfectly cooked and huge. The veggies were delicious and portions again, pretty amazing. For desserts, she got the chocolate cake because she is a chocolate whore and I got the butter rum cheesecake. I so wanted to eat all of it but I failed. I was so full. In a good way. Both were lovely. The servers were great, the vibe is really old school Chicago steakhouse which I like. Clean decor but still interesting. I like the location, it feels sort of secret since it's dwarfed by the Mart. I wouldn't say it was the best steak I've had in Chicago but it was a damn good meal.
