Meh, I've experienced better. I guess it depends on what you're looking for, the atmosphere, drinks and service was great. But the food fell flat, like really flat. I ordered linguine with shrimp, while I appreciated the quality of the jumbo shrimp, the entree was relatively bland. The mussels we had as an app weren't bad, nothing about the food was great and when I'm going for Italian..it's all about the food.
