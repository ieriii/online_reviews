xoco is super tasty, but it's also super pricey. But they also source super local ingredients so one would assume the cost is higher. I also happen to be one of those people who doesn't balk at a $4 heirloom tomato in spite of my boyfriend giving me the 'you're insane' look, because I'm at the farmer's market, even though I've been burned more times than not...it's good to support the farmer though, right? :) Still, highly recommend, delicious crispy bread, great variety, great concept, amazing churros, guac, house-made salsa, etc. Crazy rich mexican hot chocolate too & great steaming caldos (soups) for a fall night. Rick is one smart cookie, and xoco doesn't disappoint on flavor, or creativity.
