On the way to Lollapalooza last summer, I passed this place and thought, "I'll have to try it one day." In the fall time, I finally got a chance to go and, man, was I satisfied! I've been to Yolk a few times, but I've never actually eaten there; I always get take out because it's so jam-packed and feels really loud. Even so, I have had a GREAT experience with Yolk! First, my food is always ready in a jiffy so I don't have to awkwardly stand around watching people eat while my tummy grumbles for food. Second, they think of everything! You know how sometimes you get take out and you don't have enough condiments? I've never had that problem. Third, the portions are hefty! I'm so tired of paying for food that's overpriced to begin with and getting portions that are too small. I think Yolk got it right because I'm usually full before half my meal! Fourth, it's right off the Roosevelt red line! I give Yolk a big thumb's up for being fast, delicious and a great value! P.S. The zamboni crepe is amazing! I only wish their hours were longer.
