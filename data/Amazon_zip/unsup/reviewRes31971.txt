I've only had Ethiopian food a couple times and really have no idea what I'm even eating but I usually like it. So when friends who love Demera and Ethiopian food wanted to go for a birthday dinner, I was totally down. Figured I could get a crash course in some of the dishes. Unless you know what you're doing when it comes to Ethiopian food, the sampler options are the way to go. For the appetizer I recommend the sambussa sampler. I didn't get to try the spinach but someone who did try it said it was the best. We had a big group of people so for the main meal, we ordered the chef's sampler. I'm not sure what was included in the sampler but I think it was a good amount of the menu. Everything was tasty, but I couldn't necessarily tell what any of it was. Go with a group and dive in! You might not love everything you try but it makes for a great evening out with friends or family.
