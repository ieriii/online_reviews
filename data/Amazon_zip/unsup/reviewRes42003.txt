Gilt bar was in a word: impeccable. From squeezing us in when they were fully booked to the incredible attentiveness of our server, Manny--I wouldn't have changed a single thing. Upon awaiting to dine there for several months we finally picked an evening and went. From our garlic toast with sweet balsamic vinaigrette to the Paris mushroom and truffle pasta to the pork meatballs and cornbread, everything was outstanding. I consider myself a foodie among Chicagoans and even I was thoroughly impressed. On a service note: Manny was incredible, he offered suggestions for wine pairings and cocktails and guided us through the menu with such ease and knowledge. He concluded the evening with recommending the banana split for dessert; we couldn't have dreamed up a better finisher for such an amazing meal. In short, we will be back; many, many times!
