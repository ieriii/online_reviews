Finally went to Carnivale on a Friday night after work - been wanting to try this place for a while. While it is out in a remote location, it's not far from downtown so a great happy hour spot. The food here was as good as I had heard it was going to be, but the margaritas were surprisingly better than expected!  I had the Arrachera skirt steak and it was SO tasty and flavorful, I devoured the whole thing, no problem. The presentation was very nice as well. My friends ordered the chicken empanadas which were good but didn't really look like an empanada at all, more like a slice of thin casserole. Kinda strange. I also tried the Ropa Vieja which is probably one of the most original, yummy latin dishes I have ever had! I LOVED it...this dish will be a must-have at every subsequent visit to Carnivale. I ordered the Cadillac Margarita based on the waiter's recommendation - I asked for the strongest, smoothest, least sweet marg on the menu - and it was FAB. I had 2 and I was a happy camper! Two of my girlfriends had the Carnivale Martini (with pom juice) which they loved but I thought was way too sweet, although potent as well. I don't mind paying $10 for a drink if it has a good amount of alcohol in it (hard to find in this city)!! Our waiter was great, we got seated promptly upon arrival, and the atmosphere is fun and vibrant. I will definitely be back at Carnivale - most likely for the next big get-together I plan as this restaurant is one of the largest I have been to in the city!
