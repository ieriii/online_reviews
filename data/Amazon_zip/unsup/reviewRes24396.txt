Came here for dinner on a first date after being out all day for St. Patty's Day. I was a little drunk to say the least and I lost my credit card while here which was awesome, but it was a nice little restaurant. Definitely a chill atmosphere and there were a lot of couples there too. I'd like to come back and try this place for real but from what I can remember the food was underwhelming. It was hard to cook my meat properly since the bowl cooled off too fast.
