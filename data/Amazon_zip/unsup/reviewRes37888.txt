I love it when a bar has a longer beer menu that food menu - they clearly have their priorities straight. Thus my love of the Map Room, and my slightly less, but still strong love for The Hopleaf. Their beer menu is the stuff dreams are made of - if you can't find a good beer here, you clearly don't like beer. During a recent visit, I tried the Tyranena Rocky's Revenge, but the reason I love this place so much is that it is the ONLY bar I've found in the city of Chicago to offer the Lost Abbey Angel's Share, my absolute favorite beer of all time. That's reason enough to return. When I come back however, I'm probably not going to opt for dinner to accompany my drinking. This place is a bar, and it seems like they're shooting for the stars with a menu that is a bit too grey poupon to match the ambience of the place. While their efforts are well intentioned, the food is mostly subpar. I had the cauliflower salad (pretty good), and the duck (eeeeeehhhh) when I was there. Guess we should have tried the mussels because I'm heard good things, but alas, we did not. It just felt like they were trying too hard - give me some pub food and let me focus on my beer - I don't think that's too much to ask.
