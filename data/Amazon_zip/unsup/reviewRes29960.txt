Gluten-free AND Vegan?? ZOMG. I say that because one of my friends is gluten-free and the other vegan and it's always hard for us to find somewhere to eat that's not Chipotle. So glad we tried this place because it's really good. I'm definitely a meat-eater but I enjoyed the food here. We've been here twice and I've had their sweet-potato burger and dagwood sandwich w/ seitan. The sweet potato burger was good, but a little dry for me. The Dagwood sandwich, on the other hand, was REALLY good! I couldn't believe it's fake meat! The sauce in the sandwich was also really good. The sweet potato fries were crispy and fresh - I like. 5 stars because it accommodates my friends' dietary restrictions, it's cheap and the food is good! PS. My friends swear by their milkshakes - especially the banana chocolate.
