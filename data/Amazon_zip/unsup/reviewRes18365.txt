I loved Caro Mio. It was a small, intimate little place in the middle of nowhere that served up some of the best food I have ever eaten. It may have helped that it was drenched in a cream sauce. I had stuffed gnocchi and a chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella and proscuitto. I ate everything on my plate. My husband and I sat at our little table and enjoyed each other's company, our BYO Chianti, a delicious dinner, and the good tunes playing in the background. It was a fantastic night.
