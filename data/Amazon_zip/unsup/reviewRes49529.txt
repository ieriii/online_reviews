Here's the deal. Not a big fan of this place. Came here for V-day with my sweetheart thinking we would have a nice romantic night sipping some cab and tasting a couple euro cheeses. Not so. We were pressured into getting the steak by the waiter- which turned out to be, and I kid you not, a HUGE hunk of meat. It was a total gut bomb. When that cow arrived on our table I was shocked and embarrassed. I was perplexed the rest of evening that any chef would put that thing on the menu and then have the waiter HIGHLY (as in, this is the best steak you will ever eat) recommended it. The wine recommendations were just as bad. This will definitely as a Valentines day I will not forget...unfortunately. I really wanted to like this place, I really did. You've just been yelped in.
