Came here for brunch with a fellow yelper on a Friday and we both ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon. It was good, and the bacon was delicious, and our waiter referred to it as, "the best bacon in Chicago," though it was tough and hard to cut the sandwich or take a proper bite. The chai tea and hash browns were decent too. Our server was goofy and a little off the wall, but entertaining, I suppose. He cracked some kind of joke any time he came to our table. This place has some overpriced items though... for example, their bagel and lox is $11!
