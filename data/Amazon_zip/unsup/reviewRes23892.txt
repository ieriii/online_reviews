THE BEST Chinese/Sze Chuan food in the city. You won't want to eat Chinese food from anywhere else after you've had the food here. Don't be afraid of the huge menu. Like jesca c. says, order the sole filet with black bean sauce, as well as the string beans, you won't regret it. Possibly the best crab rangoon ever, trust me.
