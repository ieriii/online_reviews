Other than Uno's, this is the best you can get in Chicago. Fabulous yummy Chicaaaago deep dish. Be prepared to wait outside in line during the weekend, but its worth the wait. Place is fun...you can write on the walls and booths...anywhere you can find empty space, and this place was featured on Man Vs. Food so you know if Adam is eating it, its good eats!
