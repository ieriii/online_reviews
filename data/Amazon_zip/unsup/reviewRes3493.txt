You know I like my chicken fried, and after eating here, your pair of jeans will definitely not fit just right. The chicken WANGZ is where its at. Its a full wing, and they are jumbo. You definitely want to load up on the SEOUL SASSY flavor. Just an explosion of ginger, garlic, and salt in my mouth. The BBQ was very sweet and tangy, but most of us preferred our wings SASSY. In one of our orders, they threw in 12 wings instead of 10. Yeahhhh buddy. The Seoul Steak bowl was decent with a lot of rice, but the meat lacked a little flavor. But it did compliment the wings perfectly. Sometimes you need that bit of rice to reset your palate. Be ready to take a long nap after this meal.
