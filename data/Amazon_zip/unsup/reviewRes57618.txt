Fantastic! Make sure to make a reservation and request a booth - they have dividers between them that go up to the ceiling and pulled back curtains on the sides that afford the feeling of privacy that aids in the intimate feel of this place. My husband and I just got the cheese and chocolate and were a little concerned it wouldn't be enough for dinner. Wow, were we wrong! I felt feeling incredibly full and satisfied. It's true it's a little pricey if you want a meat plate, but I'd argue that the smaller options are even better (ok, so I'm biased as a vegetarian) and plenty of food. Definitely worth it for a nice night out.
