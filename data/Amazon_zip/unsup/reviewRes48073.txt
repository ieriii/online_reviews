LOVE The Publican! The ambiance here is wonderful - rustic meets chic, and their food is heavenly. Their brunch menu is TO DIE FOR. Definitely bring out of town guests here for a brunch they won't forget - be sure to get a side of the maple-smoked bacon (it's an inch thick!) and the sticky buns. Their bloody marys are amazing as well, coming with a side of beer (totally perfect for a Sunday morning). I had the red wine poached eggs, which were so pretty I almost (almost!) didn't want to ruin their gorgeous purple color. Dinner here is delish as well, served family style so come prepared to share. The pork belly was good; I think next time I would try some of the oysters because they looked divine. Noise level was a bit much at night but I think it was just because we had a rowdy group sharing our table. Reservations FAR in advance are a must for this place. We've gotten lucky with an hour-wait walk in before, but I wouldn't recommend it. Enjoy!
