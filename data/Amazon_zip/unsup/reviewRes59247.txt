This is one of those places where the customer service makes the otherwise good food taste like a wet sock. Been there twice and, unfortunately, was served by the rudest server (Chuck) both times. The first time we met him, about 10 minutes into eating our food, he asked us if we wanted boxes and kept coming back to ask the same question ... even after we told him that we need time eating since we did order quite a number of dishes. We felt rushed and unnecessarily so,seeing how there was no queue of people waiting for a table. But we laughed it off telling ourselves that he probably used to work at the Container Store and thus is obssessed with boxes/boxing stuff.The second and what will be my last time, we asked for the peking duck and bbq'd chicken but was told that since it's almost closing time, he cannot serve us anything bbq'd. Ok, understood. But after seeing a couple who came in after us being served bbq'd chicken, we asked another server who confirmed that yes that IS bbq'd chicken and yes they are still serving it. When we asked Chuck about it, the two of them talked in Chinese, concluding to the other server retracting his previous statement. We were annoyed but, oh well, wouldn't let him ruin our dinner. My dinner wouldn't have been ruined IF it came, but it did not. I ordered wonton soup and did not get it. After I asked Chuck about it, he said 'oh' and offered me the to-go dish that my friend ordered for her husband. Seriously. To offer me another person's food as a peace offering is just demented, a simple apology and an effort to check kitchen for wonton soup would've been more appropriate. Yes, the food is good. And if you want to go, ask for a table as far away from the entrance as possible (seems to be Chuck's domain). As for me, not going back, ever.
