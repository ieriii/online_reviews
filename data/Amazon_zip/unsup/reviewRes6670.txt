So I lived in Atlanta for a year. And after a year of basking in arguably one of the top BBQ regions in the US ... q came up well short for me. I've heard a lot of great things about q but it was a very forgettable experience from a food standpoint. I got the St. Louis ribs, kobe sliced brisket, and mac and cheese ... I'll go as far as saying it was decent but nothing to rave about. And I'm going to go out on a limb and say the pickles that they give you when you first sit down may have been the best part of the meal ... as I'm still trying to finish my $10 jack and coke cause it's a little too steep to swallow.
