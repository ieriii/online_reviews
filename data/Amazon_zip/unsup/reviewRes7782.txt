I discovered Sapori after I moved out of the neighborhood. Despite living 30 minutes away, I continued to go back to Sapori until I finally left Chicago. The food is amazing (try the fish dishes, the lobster ravioli, and pretty much everything else) and the service is great. Definitely make a reservation for Friday and Saturday nights because there is always a wait but it is worth it.
