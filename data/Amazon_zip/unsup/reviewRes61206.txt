The atmosphere seemed fine, I think my main issue was with the waiter. We had just sat down and he took our drink orders and immediately wanted to take our food order we asked for a few minutes 30 seconds later he was back. My order came out first I asked for mustard apparently there was none to be found in the whole resteraunt so he offered Ketchup, on a chicken sandwich really? then 5 minutes later 2 other sandwiches came out. Then 15 minutes later the 3 pizzas came out 3 of us were done and ready to back to work but we had to wait on the other 3. I believe its normal for everyone to get their food at the same time. We asked to have our bills seperated so he took the total and devided by 6 so I paid part of my coworkers bill. Probably will not go back to this specific Gino's located on Main steet in St. Charles but would try another somewhere else. Adam is rarely wrong Go MAN VS. FOOD
