This was my first experience at The Publican and it went extremely well. This wasn't really "my type of food," but I can certainly appreciate the excellent pairing of flavors and creative dishes. I ate shrimp (with the shell on!) and it was fantastic. They had an incredible selection of beers Our server was very knowledgeable and don't hover or ignore our table. I would certainly go back - but like I said, it's not really my favorite type of food but for meat lovers this place is it.
