Bongo Room is so good, and so dangerous. Thank god I don't live anywhere near this place because I would definitely be a regular patron of their delicious and indulgent menu. I always bring people here when they're visiting from out of town, I woo them with this brunch.   I've been here many times and the food has always been amazing. I've had some of the savory items like the breakfast burrito, croissant sandwich, and one of the best omelettes of my life (muenster, spinach, canadian bacon), but the REAL reason to come here is for their pancake options.  I've had so many different kinds and they have never disappointed. After the first bite of each new plate of pancakes, I do my hand-to-the-mouth-gesture and almost cry with joy. They change them up all the time which is both good (variety) and bad (the amazing dishes can never be ordered again). My favorites have been banana & crunch bar, pumpkin cheesecake, banana/peanut butter/chocolate, and smores. It's also a huge serving and I've never seen anyone finish an entire plate...you will earn my respect if you do.  A few things I don't love about this place: 1. The home fries/hashbrowns are covered with too many spices, I think it's overwhelming 2. There is always a long wait no matter what time you show up, expect at least 20-30 minutes 3. This is their biggest downfall and one of my BIGGEST pet peeves...they push you out before you are done with your meal. Last time we had our waitress come by 3 times in about 15 minutes and replace the check in front of us each time....we get it, you want us to leave so you can serve other people.
