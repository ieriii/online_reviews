Recently, I came here for brunch with a few friends, and I had the best meal I had in a long time. I ordered white corn pancakes that were served with goat cheese and bacon that was marinated in some kind of pepper sauce, I think. They were delicious. The pancakes weren't too sweet, but went nicely with the agave syrup, or the goat cheese, or both. And the bacon was the most delicious bacon I've ever had. Its flavor reminded me of beef jerky, but it was tender, like bacon. Mmmmm... Also, my friend let me try a bit of his tortilla soup which was also delicious. And on top of all this deliciousness, the price wasn't bad either; most brunch entrees are $11-17!
