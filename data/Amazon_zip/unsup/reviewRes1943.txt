We got there around 11 and waited about 45 min, not too bad for the time. I was surprised at how seating just seemed to work out. It flowed well. Once we ordered, the food came out fairly quickly, maybe not even 10 min... we got the game of the week (pheasant and bacon or something) and the foie gras, duck fat fries n cheesy fries. I think I set my expectations too high, cuz I was sort of disappointed. The fries were tasty, but the foie gras was only ok... I think i'd come back to try something new though!
