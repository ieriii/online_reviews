Had dinner here a few nights ago with my wife and an old friend. We scored a very cozy patio table away from the bustle of the interior. We started with some well priced craft beers and took to ordering a pile of food for the evening. Duck rilette, grilled pork cheek, foie gras torchon, wild boar sloppy Joe (beef fat fries!!!), apple salad ad crispy pork belly. All the dishes were well prepared and properly seasoned. The rilette was creamy and classic, pork cheeks tender and flavorful. I only wish the torchon had a textural element to contrast the smoothness of the foie. The sloppy joe was delicious, but by the time I got it the bottom bun was soaked through and it was a fork and knife affair. Toasting that bun could help, but then again, it IS called a sloppy joe and not a tidy joe. The bourbon list is extensive and offers two sizes of pours so you can try multiple bourbons and not break the bank. Ancient ancient age at $6 for 2 ounces is always a welcome sight!! Out server was attentive and knowledgable, I just wish we were given a better description of the more complex dishes when they were delivered. I'll go back for sure!
