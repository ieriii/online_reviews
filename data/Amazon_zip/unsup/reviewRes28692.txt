Two words: Inexpensive goodness!! The spot is cozy and friendly - with waitresses always attentive and nice, but the takeout is perfect...grab your $8 pasta and bread and head home for some spaghetti in your pj's...YUM. Every dish I have tried I enjoyed and the portions are generous. Being connected/co-owned by The Other Side is great for a weeknight pasta dinner/beer special date :) Casual, fun, and highly recommended!
