Ill get the good part out of the way first, because it won't take long. 1. The oxtail skillet was good 2. One member of our party of 6 had her meal comp'd for the ridiculous experience we went through. The bad: 1. Our server did not refill our coffee. Ever. UNLESS I flagged him down and asked for a refill. You are serving brunch, why are you not walking around with a coffee pot? 2. It took an extraordinary amount of time to order our food, and this only happened once we flagged down our waiter. 3. The food took 45 minutes to come out. This happened after the waiter went out of his way to tell us at approx 30 mins that the food would be out in a minute and a half~direct quote. 4. Two ladies ordered the same meal. Both arrived cold. One lady mentioned this to the waiter, and he comped her meal. He didn't have the brain capacity to ask if anyone elses meal was cold...which could have been assumed given that two people ordered the same thing and one was cold. ...all in all, this place is absolutely worthless at being a restaurant.
