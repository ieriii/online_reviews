i've been to glenn's twice, and sadly i won't be back. the first time i went i had dinner. my fish was bland, the potatoes were weird, but it was pretty reasonably priced. my friend bill specifically asked if the fish that he ordered was covered in a sauce. the waiter assured him that it was a small amount. the fish came out swimming in some creamy, overpowering sauce. overall, it was okay, and everyone deserves a second chance. today i went for the second time. there wasn't a long wait but our food took forever as we were the last table seated in that wave of diners. i had the pecan pancakes. again, just okay. they had a weird aftertaste. my friends french toast was pretty mediocre as well. ironically, the fish did look pretty tasty- today-the table next to us ordered scallops and they made me want to rethink being a vegetarian. the worst part is that we were seated in the window. people waiting on the sidewalk kept staring in directly at our table and the sun was so hot it was uncomfortable.
