On my second night in town we ate at The Publican. It is my new favorite restaurant. It is a must try when you are in Chicago and is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. It's meat, shellfish, and beer. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and eat here again. Weihenstephaner Vitus: This was a, weizenbock, a more powerwful and stronger weizen beer. It was good. Burratta and Beet Salad: This salad was made of burratta, beets, walnuts, green olives, and a light dressing. The only way I can describe this salad was smooth. A bit with all the ingredients in it was so smooth it was almost like you didn't eat anything. Pickles: I love pickles. Especially when you have more than just cucumbers. Spicy Pork Rinds: This was my first time eating pork rinds. It's doubtful I will ever have any better. Dungeness Crab: Steamed dungeness crab with potatoes and pesto. The only thing I didn't like about this was sharing it. Kobe Beef: I am pretty sure this was kobe beef. Cooked to a perfect medium rare with some feta cheese and charred lettuce. Wonderful. Pork Belly: Man oh man. Pork belly with little clams and tomato. This dish would have been good as just a piece of cooked pork belly. Definitely something you have to share. Too rich for any one person's blood. Farm Chicken: This was a spicy who chicken served with fries. Oftentimes chicken can be served dry. If chicken is dry it has been ruined. The Publican served a perfectly moist blackened chicken that is too die for. You really need to go to The Publican and try it out for yourself. You won't find many restaurants serving this kind of menu and this good of food in the world.
