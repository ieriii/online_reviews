I went to Glenn's based on Yelp reviews and the raves of my co-workers that live nearby but I just don't understand!  I made reservations a week ahead to take my cousin out for her 8th grade graduation. Reserving a table gets you a nice view of the kitchen while you eat....although they were nice about allowing us to be 15 minutes late after some bad traffic.  The food was nothing special...no vegetarian selection at all. After I told the waitress I wanted the veggie burger, I was told the veggie burger got too many complaints so they took it off the menu....yet there it was, written on the menu?!? Mediocre service, scrambled eggs, a cheeseburger with a small fruit salad and a veggie fritatta for $35 before tip. Not to mention the bathroom looked and smelled disgusting and the drain was flipped over and...there was a paper cup in the drain whole with what looked like a cigarette butt in it. Nice. I was SO disapointed. I have to say I will not be back.
