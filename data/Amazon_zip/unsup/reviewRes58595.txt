I went to Carnivale for the first time a few months ago with my boyfriend. First off, I love the place. I love the area, the decor its so pretty and colorful. Its pretty upscale, and a place to go on a special ocassion. I know Carnivale is Latin American style food, but being mexican, the food was an...interesting..take on the style of food most Latins I know eat. Not saying it was horrible, it was actually pretty good. But definetly a yuppie place.
