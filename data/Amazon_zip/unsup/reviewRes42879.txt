What makes this pizza Brazilian? I don't know, but I do know what makes it a great pizza. Let's start with the crust, thin, chewy but with a slight bit of crisp especially at the outer edge. A sweeter but not too sweet sauce with a lot of flavor, great amount of toppings and a serious amount of different toppings. I stopped in tonight. I was on my way home from work and had heard about this place from a variety of sources, (yes... including yelp), and was quite curious to try it out. I had heard some crazy number of toppings they used and how many pizzas they had, surely it was inaccurate. Um no. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. They had a mind boggling number of ingredients, (let's just say safely over 60), and already well over 50 pizza combinations ready for your approval. I chose two medium, well how nice. Second one is half off. I tried the Chicken Brasil, saucy, lots of pulled chicken and loads of cheese including their homemade catupiry cheese. What it is exactly? I don't know, I do know it was fairly addicting. As in, "you touch that slice I will break your arm, that pizza is mine" addicting. I also got Castel D'Azzano which came with three different mushrooms and a pretty huge amount of them. The nice thing is I got mediums, enough to eat, a good amount to save, plus I got to try two different kinds, only seven trillion to go. The place is small, but with a handful of tables and seats, clean and efficient, they have some pizzas already cut up and ready to get by the slice. The owners were on hand, curious to know how I found them, eager to share about this currently two week old establishment and how they got here. I will say the owners are super friendly, happy to chat and with these certainly more than fair prices you are getting a very good deal for what you get, I can't wait to come back and try this place over and over again. Looks like I will be hitting the treadmill quite often this summer.
