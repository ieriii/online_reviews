Was somewhat disappointed. I always enjoyed Le Colonial in San Francisco but, Le Colonial Chicago was a little to rush street for my taste. There was apparently two couples on either side of us that lived in the neighborhood and all they could talk about was how much money they made, the condo the just bought etc., etc. Not to mention the arrogance upstairs. The food was not up to par for the prices they charge.
