My husband and I had a wonderful time at Geja's. The service was excellent. The waiter and his assistant really made our dinner fantastic. Further, the food was top notch. It was fun to cook with the fondue pots. All of the food was fresh and tasty. Also, I loved the atmosphere-quite romantic. The wine prices were pretty reasonable and the house chardonnay (while basic) was a good deal at only $26 a bottle. While I would consider this a "special occasion" place, given the price point, I will definitely return.
