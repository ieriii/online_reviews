I love this place, and I've been many times.  The food is excellent, the atmosphere is fun and lively yet relaxed and casual. The outdoor patio is wonderful and makes for a great date place. The service has always been great too. Don't go on the weekends, it's way too busy. This is one of those places you should go on a Tuesday night or early Sunday evening when you want great food and in a nice setting (fancier than a dive; more easy going than fine dining). I will definitely be back!
