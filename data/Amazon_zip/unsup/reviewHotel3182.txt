I don't usually like "swanky" type of places, but assuming you get to the upper floor bar early enough in the night to get a table this can actually be a pretty fun time. The staff have always seemed more interested in making us feel welcome than treating us like we were lucky to be allowed in. Prices are high as to be expected with a place like this, but the drinks are generally well made. Worth putting on quality rags to go and visit.
