A great experience overall. My one star off is for the music -- mostly standard issue salsa, etc., that you would expect to hear at any generic latin restaurant. It would be great if Xoco (a unique restaurant that really rocks) would expand its musical selection to include rock and hip-hop en espanol (I'm thinking of artists like Cafe Tacuba and Kinky). The staff really shines. They do a great job of shepherding the hungry masses and preventing Xoco from tipping into chaos.
