In the past year, there's been a few changes to this particular Garcias. Last summer they were closed for an extensive expansion and remodel / change of ownership? Nevertheless, now that the restaurant is cosmetically much better, the food & service has declined, drastically! Granted, they still offer a damn good burrito, but don't even bother with anything else on the menu---NASTY!! Tonight was the final straw for me---I adamantly refuse to EVER dine at Garcias again! After being seated, it took our homely server approximately 15 minutes to acknowledge us. When she did realize that wifey & I were not invisible, she came over and pinched me, winked, and said it'd be a minute or two. Well, 10 minutes later, she arrives and realizes that we were indeed thirsty, and ravenous. Order placed. Tick, tock, blood pressure rising. I wanted to get up and leave, but this would embarrass wifey, so we stayed, Seriously, while watching the dumbass senorita who thought she was too fucking cute to bar tend socialize for 20 fucking minutes, we finally received our margaritas. I asked the server what was with the wait. She didn't respond with words...just a grin, and a shrug of her shoulders. Food arrives, immediately after we received our margaritas that were a challenge for senorita bartender to make. Food as ordered? No, but I didn't say anything, as I didn't want the homely server to spit on my burrito. Check, and to go box, as my meter was about to expire. I gave the homely server a gift card Visa with enough money to cover the tab, and her tip. She came back and said "it declined." Uggghhh, no---she was just too fucking stupid to run the gift card Visa. Tip. Twelve percent was probably too much. In all fairness, the burritos are good---just not AS good as they were before the change of ownership. Margaritas---good, but NOT worth the wait, nor the raise in price! I WILL NOT RETURN!
