Valet parking which was free! We were seated immediatley, and I ordered coffee, while my mom got wine. We started off with Tzatziki and an eggplant spread for our bread...not a big fan of white bread, but if you top this stuff on there...WHEW AWESOME! After that, our waiter (which is all they had, no females), I ordered a "combo" of lamb loin and dark chicken riganati, with vegetables. IT WAS AWESOME! I would def come back here, almost got dessert, but headed out soon! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Will visit the Lombard location soon since I live closer!
