Let me be the first to say it; I'm a little tired of our country's swine obsession. First, The Publican. Then, the Flu. Now, with wine? Well, friends. This restaurant did not make me sick. Indeed, The Purple Pig delivered. I went here with the boytoy, and, dare I say, we pigged out. No, seriously. We ate a shit ton of food. I ate so much food that I got sick, and that never happens! We ordered: Pork Fried Almonds Marinated Olives Salt-Roasted Beets Deviled Egg Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale Brussel Sprouts w/ Thyme and Lemon Jamon Serrano Pork Liver Pat Roasted Bone Marrow Quail with Salsify & Pomegranate The only dish that didn't delight was the quail. It was embarrassingly small. The bone marrow was pretty good, although it didn't have much flavor. Everything else was awesome. I liked the beets and brussel sprouts in particular. As for the wine, we had a half bottle of something that I can't recall. I'm not much of a wine snob, so I can't review their libations in good faith. However, they had a very large selection, and, for many of then, you can opt for half bottles, quarter bottles or by the glass. And... the ambiance and service was also good.
