This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is good, the service is good, the cooks are quick so you're not waiting too long. I definitely recommend making a reservation at least one day in advance if you're planning on going Thursday-Saturday. The dining room is kind of small and moderately loud, but the overall gets a top ranking from me.
