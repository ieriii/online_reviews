Good beer selection and the scotch egg was awesome. How can you not like a hard boiled egg rolled in sausage, battered and deep fried, and served with a good stoneground mustard? Healthy? Hell no. Delicious? Hell yeah. My buddy's lamb sandwich special was good. The fries were good ( skip the curry gravy though...it is very thin and does not go well the fries). A roasted beet soup special was good but I could have made it at home. My chicken and pomegranate salad was pretty good but nothing exceptional. For $45 at lunch, a pretty good experience overall though the Scotch Egg is the only thing I will remember eating. The next time I am in Chicago, I will go again but try something different off of the menu...the egg being the exception.
