Been here twice now for two different experiences - one was a family-style dinner with http://Grubwith.us (as in, random strangers), and the other was hot pot with a couple old friends. Both experiences went pretty well. The food is solid. Not anything I'd consider mind-blowing, but it's definitely good, especially if you go the hot pot route. How can you not love copious amounts of seafood?? (Just avoid the coriander!) Note that since this is a szechuan place, expect a lot of spiciness. Also, have to give some props to the service, something Chinatown's notoriously bad about. Even with a packed house, it's pretty easy to flag someone down if you need something. Sure, it's something that you'd expect from any other restaurant, but it's a stand out attribute on Archer.
