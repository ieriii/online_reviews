The restaurant itself is gorgeous, I'd been here a few times for drinks both at the bar and at a cabana upstairs where I also sampled some great mussels so I was excited when I found out our company dinner was here. The Harvest Table, the salad/pre-meat bar was great, lots of options pre-main event. I was especially a big fan of the lobster bisque, but it had everything you might expect, from cured meats and cheese to nice grilled vegetables. So all was great leading up to the real food..but the wheels fell off a little. So Zed aspires to be a fusion version of a Brazilian steakhouse, meaning they do the whole bit with meat on swords brought around from table to table.  First off, the servers could use a little more training, on a few occasions in one night they almost dropped items as they pushed them off the swords. Then there was the common sense issue; while navigating a big party with many tables, wouldn't it make sense to arrive at a new table with at least half the goods on a sword? If only for appearances, the diner would feel like they are getting fresh wares. Instead a nearly-finished sword makes the majority of the table see food that has no chance of being served - particularly if the table service order is haphazard as it was that evening; there were definitely some promises of coming back that weren't fulfilled, resulting in me not getting any flank or rump roast. Very disappointing. Never get in the way of a man and his meat!
