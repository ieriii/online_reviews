I stayed here and really loved the view of the city from my room! The room was very elegant and was very tasteful.  I enjoyed the huge bathroom with the separate shower and tub...They also had a separate area aside from the whole bathroom where i would do my makeup.The room was extra spacious and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like is the housekeepers weren't up on game and didn't clean up or restock anything? What were they doing picking their damn nose in the hallway or what?
