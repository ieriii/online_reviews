Wilde is having an identity crisis. I went tonight with a client and had blackened tuna with Japanese cold noodles. Can someone please tell me how that is Irish? It was tasty though. I have been here a number of times and I must say my favorite was at brunch. I had a bowl of strawberries and bananas with fresh cream. WOW! That was so good. Then the breakfast burger with egg on it and curry fries on the side. The service is hit or miss. Tonight I had to ask the hostess to stop texting on her cell phone and show me to my table. Unacceptable.
