Everything was amazing, from the parmesean-truffle oil popcorn that begins each meal to our chocolate dessert. We ordered the five-course tasting menu and my only complaint is that the tasting menu does not offer anything that is not on the regular menu so we could have just ordered two first courses, two second courses, and two different desserts and would have had the same amount of food but would have gotten to taste one more dessert for the same price, possibly less. I guess I'd rather have more samplings and smaller portions for a tasting menu but that's an ordering lesson learned for next time. That said, what we got was so good. Every bite. We started with the white tuna sashimi appetizer, two beautiful pieces of fish with spicy avocado mousse, mango puree, cocoa nibs, shaved radish, plantain chips and some citrus oil. Transcendent! Second course was a spring pea bisque with a lavender marshmallow and what tasted like sorrel, but may have been pea shoots. The marshmallow lent a little sweetness, but not a lot, and the lavender was just a hint to let you know its there but not making you see purple. Third was a crispy piece of halibut with a unique smoked eggplant puree, served with Israeli couscous and zucchini, grilled fennel and a tomato marmalade. This was my absolute favorite. I'd never had smoked eggplant and it seems like an odd pairing with fish but it lent an earthy richness that made this the best fish dish I've ever had. Fourth was a beautiful bison skirt steak served in a rich root beer reduction sauce. Last was a cake composed of white and dark chocolates and some frozen concoction. I think what I liked best was that each composition was carefully calibrated as to every ingredient so that the diner tastes every single component, no matter how subtle.
