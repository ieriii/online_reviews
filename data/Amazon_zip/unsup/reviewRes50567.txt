I was so proundly disapointed with Wishbone's alleged Chicken-fried Steak I almost cried. I tried to eat ANYTHING on the plate- greens, mac & cheese but I just left it all there... No doggy-bag. Even my Rottweiller wouldn't tolerate it. It was mediocre. Beyond mediocre... I was reminded of public school junior-high cafeteria meals... I've heated Banquet microwave meals that tasted better! The meat was tougher than shoe leather- and about as flavorful. The breading was sodden. The cream gravy was dissapointing- bland, tasteless and profoundly unappetizing. The highlight of the meal was the apologetic waitress: who seemed stressed-out beyond belief for someone with only three tables... but I might be even more frazzled if i had to choke this down ever again.
