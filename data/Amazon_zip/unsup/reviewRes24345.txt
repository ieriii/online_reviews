Irazu has become a favorite of mine among Chicago restaurants. There are decent vegetarian options among the meat dishes which makes it great for a party of mixed diets. It's also incredibly affordable. I typically order the vegetarian burrito and an oatmeal milkshake (you have to at least try it once!). The sweet plantains and yucca topped with mojo are delicious additional veg options. I can't wait to give the potato tacos and the empanadas a try! It's a small establishment, but it expands in the summer with outdoor seating. BYOB!
