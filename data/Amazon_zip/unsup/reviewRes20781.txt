If you don't mind a little wait (ours was about 45 minutes one evening) this place is worth it. If you are doing take out of course you don't have to contend with the wait for a table. Find a sandwich with some ingredients you like and grab it. I loved mine. And, mixing bacon and ice cream may seem like a bad idea, but at least get one to share. It's done right here. I'm only in Chicago a couple of times a year, but it's a must when I'm there.
