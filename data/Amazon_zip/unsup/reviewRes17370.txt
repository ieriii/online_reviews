I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! Violet Hour is always on my list of lounges to go to every time I'm in Chicago, and I rave about it to all my friends back home in Cali. The bartenders here pour such awesome drinks - mixing to them is definitely a form of art, and it's SO apparent when you watch them! They take their lovely time to make your drink perfect, but it's so worth it! Make sure to try out any drinks with egg white - I know it sounds weird, but it gives the drink a cool frothy taste. The atmosphere here definitely has a mysterious feel to it; dark and lit by candlelight - very romantic spot to bring a date! This is definitely a one of a kind spot to check out in Chicago!
