I went in by myself for lunch one day and really enjoyed it! I work at a Greek Restaurant here in California so I was told by our owners to check this place out when I was in Chicago.... definitely didn't disappoint! excellent saganaki and gyros...tasty pita and dolmas... I stuffed myself silly then laid in pain on my hotel bed...  I noticed all of the servers are male which was interesting... beautiful decor and ambiance, comfortable seating with much room to spare. Will definitely visit again when I am in Chicago!  OPA!!! :D
