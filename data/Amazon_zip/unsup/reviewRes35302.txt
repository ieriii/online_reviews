I have been to Sun Wah Bar-B-Que a number of times and a number of times I have recommended the highly to other friends. Tonight I was a bit disappointed with the food. Yes, it was busy restaurant, but not at the time we were dining there at 4:30. Yes I did do the peking duck dinner reservations, I added an additional guess with us and that was fine. When all of our guest had finally arrived to dinner, we ordred our food and it came out fast. It seems the waiter didn't listen when I ordered " Singapore noodles" I got the ha moon mai fun noodles, no curry colored flavored noodles. I didn't say anything, because I was too hungry to ask about it. We also ordered their roasted pork, and it wasn't great. I use to like it a lot. I the end pieces I believe, because the skin was charred burnt and tasted bitter. I love crispy skin a roasted pork, I didn't get that tonight. We also ordered Steamed Chinese style whife fish, it was a big fish, but it tasted bland, no flavor. At the end of the meal I was hoping after we spent on extra dishesm and got the peking duck dinner we get the usual fruit sorbet at the end of the meal, it didn't happen. Their peking duck is still good, not as great as it has been in the past, but good. Service was quick and easy and all in all we left with full stomachs. Would, I give this place high raiting anymore not until I think they are on the mark with every aspect including atmosphere and food.
