I've been wanting to go to Yolk for a long time (and I've heard very good things about it), so maybe it was hard for Yolk to meet my expectations. I thought it was fine, but not great. I got a steak skillet, and my dining companion got a butcher shop omelet--both were good, but nothing amazing. For brunch mains that are more creative, I recommend Orange. For melt-in-your-mouth pancakes (the chocolate-strawberry pancakes, which I had as a side, were fine, but the chocolate chip dining hall pancakes I had in college were better), try the Original Pancake House in Lincoln Park or Hyde Park. And for a cheaper and largely same-tasting steak skillet, I recommend Mellow Yellow in Hyde Park.
