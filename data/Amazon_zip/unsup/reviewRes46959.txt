My friend Q and I decided to get some carryout from here because we both wanted to be "healthy" after having worked out earlier that day. I was especially excited that they try to use seasonal, local, and organic products. Unfortunately, I was pretty much drawn to everything but the healthy. I was especially smitten by the macaroni and cheese, but it cost $12! That's pretty pricey for macaroni and cheese with nothing else in it but cheese, so I sadly decided to pass on it. Q knew that it had already captured my heart, though, so she forced me to get it. Ha. I love her. When we got home and I opened up my box of mac and cheese, I was horribly disappointed by the most blah looking mac and cheese I have ever seen. I guess I expected something that didn't look like it was made from the contents of a store-bought box of mac and cheese--and a small box at that. I was so disappointed that I didn't even want to taste it. I almost wanted us to drive back to the place and say, "Are you kidding me? Can't you add even a nice garnish or something? Maybe a few pieces of lobster?" Needless to say, I had my first forkful with very low expectations. All that changed, though, after a couple more forkfuls. And, eventually, the plain white box of boring looking macaroni and cheese had completely won me over by the time I got to the bottom. If I had been given the option to buy another $12 box at that very moment . . . I probably would've. Ha. Believe me, the cheese they use in this is exceptional and the high price tag is completely worth it. I will come back, my friends. And I might even try something else. With the mac and cheese, of course.
