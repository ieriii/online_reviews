I Traveled to Chicago during a business trip in September. We decided to eat at Ginos to experience Chicago pizza. WORST DECISION EVER!! 2 of my colleagues and I split the deep dish meat lovers pizza & antipasto salad and we all got food poisoning. I was the worst out of the 3 of us. I was so sick I missed my last day of training and had to change my flight to the following day; spending the last day of my trip deathly ill in a hotel room. It was horrible! DO NOT go to this restaurant!!!
