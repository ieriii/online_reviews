Overall clean, great price, and location. Great views from the workout areas and swimming pool. Very nice having a separate living room. However the parking is crazy for $52/day (park in one of the nearby garages for $26-33 instead) and the hot tub needs cleaning/renovation - lots of black grout. The drop-off area is very congested with taxis.
