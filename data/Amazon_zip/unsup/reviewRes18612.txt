Hmmmm.... what can I say, I just don't get the hype. We came here to celebrate my birthday, with a brilliant bottle of wine that outshone the food 100x - the atmosphere is okay, considering it's a storefront, and the wait staff was friendly... but lobster ravioli was "understated"... nothing special. I would love to gloat over this place, I've had tons of recs and maybe it was just an off night, but considering they boast fresh pasta, ours was of the pastey sort. I hope I get a chance to change this review, but for now, I'm not throwing my arms up for joy, but for "why" on the way to Caro Mio.....
