If I were to yelp this when I first went a few years ago I would have gave it five stars, but I think in these economic hard times they now use cheaper ingredients..and very different dough.  My last visit was extremely dissapointing. My pizza was no longer crispy but more soggy and didn't have that nice crisp like it used to. I thought it was just a rare night, but everyone at the table noticed the difference. On the plus side, they do use fresh ingredients and everything has a great bite to it, but no longer worth the drive or the price. The owner is also real nice and hands out slices in their small waiting area. Expect to wait a bit. The place is small and menu is limited to mainly just pizza. **Previously, i had this review at 3 stars--I have now switched it to 4. The owner had contacted me after placing this review and assured me that they still use fresh ingredients and that sometime it can be difficult to get that crisp feel to the pizza. Like i said before, service has always been excellent. I would definitely go back now b/c of it...GO spacca!!
