MMMMMM Meaty goodness. Love that this place is a BYOB,the chimichurri sauce is fresh not oily, staff is friendly, food is quick and lord did I leave full. You do get a lot food and it is great, I am still debating if the empanadas are really good or great and the plantains are sweet. I will say this, its simple, not dressed up and its damn good, though if you do have apps, (and they are good!), split meals!Perhaps you won't be as stuffed as I was. If you go on the weekends you might want to call ahead, I hear it can get swamped. Great if you want to bring a group of friends or with just one person.
