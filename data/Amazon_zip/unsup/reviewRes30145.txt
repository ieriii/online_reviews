As far as vegetarian/vegan restaurants go, this place is the shit. Not to say that vegetarian restaurants are normally not that great, but this one is just particularly awesome.  Came here last weekend, for an early-ish dinner Saturday night in a party of three. It was maxed out when we got there, we were offered their heated waiting tent behind the restaurant to wait until a table opened up. The tent was not that heated on this cold day, but luckily, just minutes after we got in there, the host was back to get us for a table that had just opened up.  I ordered the meatloaf and potatoes/veggies, which was delicious, flavorful and filling. Very comfort food. My companions ordered an amazing looking veggie burger (made me wish I'd ordered it) with sweet potato fries. And a gluten-free burger of some sort with cooked kale and something else yummy looking.  The portions were large, the food had great flavor, the menu had so many great-sounding options, and the prices were right (not too high). This place will be much appreciated by any vegetarian. But meat-eaters should also try it!
