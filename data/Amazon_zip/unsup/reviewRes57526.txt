this where I come to re-live the 50's and enjoy very good gyro plates. the pita bread is very good too. I also enjoy the lamb specials. the waiters are great here and the host at the door takes your name down on a clipboard if it is so busy that you have to wait. the place is very large so you shouldn't have to wait but sometimes you do. the host kisses the greek people when they leave or come and I have seen amazing looking dishes on plates brought out to special tables here. I wonder what it would like to be greek and always eat such great food. I like the area the restaurant is in too because the people are very clever and make me feel happy to be around them.
