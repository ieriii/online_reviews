I was in Chicago on a business trip and stayed a full week at this hotel. From the moment of my arrival, it was clear that the hotel staff were there to cater to my needs. All staff were polite and extremely helpful. Check-in was easy, the room was not big, but it was clean and very comfortable. The views were amazing! The hotel is on the Magnificent Mile which is central to excellent restaurants, night life, transportation and makes exploring the city on foot very easy. I loved it. I'm definitely returning to this hotel.
