I am an avid fan of vietnamese food, but often cant get up the energy to make the trek all the way up to Uptown. Finding this restaurant with some good reviews I decided to try it as it is close to my house. The service was good, the appetizers great, the main course hit the spot, and the dessert was the highlight of the meal. The only drawbacks were the noise of the room, which as it filled up got extremely loud, and a menu that was missing a couple of my favorite items from Vietnamese cuisine. A final point, the decor and great ambiance makes it a good place to take a date which cant be said for most Vietnamese restaurants. Oh, and its BYOB!
