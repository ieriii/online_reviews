Yeah, everyone already read the 30,000 reviews on OMG ITS A HOT DOG WITH A BUFFALO IN IT. Well, yeah that's great but I am not really impressed. I heard gossip about this place when I lived in Boston 5 years ago, so I eventually went, and waited and waited and eventually got to eat some stupid 9 dollar hot dog. Now, I don't want to be a stick in the mud, nor a sheep in the field so I'm going with 2. If this place had you in and out in 20 minutes, I'd give it 5 damn stars. But, it's a god damn hot dog. A HOT DOG. It'd probably be quicker to fly to NYC and get one off a street vendor that would have just as many mystery meats in it. NahI'msayin? I had some kind of thing with Havartia cheese and some other stuff on it. It was good, but uh, whatever. So is pasta and sauce and I"m not going to wait in line for 2 hours for this. Oh yeah, and the hours are fukken bogus. ALSO Someone started a downtown delivery service of Hot Doug's and it got shut down within a week or two by the owner. MAYBE if your place was EVER open.... oh wait, suckers everywhere love to feel like waiting somehow gets you better food. peace.
