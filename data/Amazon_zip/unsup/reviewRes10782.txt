I've tried practically all the big name brunch places in Chicago, but this is the best place in my opinion. But you would only like if you enjoy sweet breakfast. The red velvet pancakes are to die for! I've been here multiple times and usually try a different pancake each time, and they are all amazing. The syrup and sauce on each is DELICIOUS. My wife usually gets the breakfast burrito and potatoes. I actually really like the potatoes. Whenever we have out of town guests, we always bring them here. There is always a line. We came at 10am and waited an hour for a table of 4. I do wish the place was bigger because the line sucks and it's always packed. But the food is delicious and worth the wait. Everyone we bring here cannot stop raving about it.
