3.5 stars to be exact. Want a place close to Michigan Ave, clean rooms and friendly staff? This is your place. This is not your place if you expect gym access to be included in your $200+ room/night or count on a handful of cool places to eat and drink right around the corner. Sure MIch Ave is right there so not that much of a biggie. You're on business, stay here. Want to explore like a local, try some boutique hotel elsewhere.
