The old man and I came here for my birthday on Friday night. It was an ok experience, but I just couldn't get into it. First, the bartender was awful. He was kind of rude and had this strange attitude when I ordered my drink. I ordered a dirty martini. First he made me feel strange that I asked for grey goose, like that was an unusual request. Then when I said I wanted it to be dry (absence of vermouth) he sat there and explained to me what that meant. Yeah, I know Captain Obvious. Is it me, or is it easier to say "dry" as opposed to "please leave out the vermouth" I felt like I was being judged for not ordering his way. He set the tone, he made the night start off badly, not to mention the fact that he ignored us while he washed dishes. It wasn't that busy. I don't want to talk, I just want a drink. Then when he was shaking a martini for another couple, a bunch of liquid came flying out of the shaker and landed right in front of us. Get over yourself. The complimentary popcorn? Meh? I would have much rather have bread. I know, I am a fat american. Appetizer? We had hushpuppy sweetbreads. They were okay, but they were fried in a hushpuppy batter. Good enough. Dinner we had steak and duck. Everything was good, not mind blowing. Our server was nice and the guy who brought out the food was nice. I just didn't think the food was all that great. I have had so much better....see Twist. Oh well, this was ok, just not everything it was hyped up to be. I probably won't be back.
