I always love walking into a place where English isn't the only language being spoken. On this particular evening, there was live gypsy/jazz music - really great ambience. The Red Sangria was delicious, like I've never had before with spices and vanilla. Salmon and potato latke tapas with capers was flavorful. The tripe soup was savory, lemony, and melt-in-your-mouth. The servings were elegant and tasteful. I think the one thing that stood out most about all the food was the attention to texture in addition to flavor. There was an aura of authenticity, but also freshness. At the end of the night, the owner played a trick on us with a tube and some amazing brandy - hey, most people aren't just handing out alcohol these days and it made us feel like regulars even though it was our first time there. We left with the attention to return again soon! If you like a place that doesn't entirely play it safe, you should go too.
