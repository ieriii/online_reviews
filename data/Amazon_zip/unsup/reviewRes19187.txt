I wish there was something in between the 3star "A-OK" and the 2star "Meh. I've experienced better". Maybe like a... "It was OK but I won't be coming back" 2.5 star. After receiving the "We closed early tonight" news at the Witt, we decided to go to The Gage. We called in and asked what time they close, they said 2am. So we grabbed a cab and got to the place at around 12:14am hoping to finally get some drinks in us. This was my first time here, I liked the dark woods and dim lighting, it seemed like a great place for a glass of beer or wine and a nice chat. We had a party of 8, got seated in a pretty empty bar. The waitress came by with the menu. One of the girls I was with said they have a "great selection of beer and bourbon" I did not find the beer I wanted. At that same point our server announced to us that the last call will be at 12:30am. There was 3 other groups of people in there, not like we were the only ones (although even if we were, we were planning on spending some good money due to one of our friend's birthday) so I do think it was a bit inappropriate for a bar to basically kick people out because not many people were still coming in. A few mean looks were thrown at us within the next 15 minutes We all finished our glasses of wine/beer/whiskey and left around 1am. For a place with so much charm I wish we had the chance to stay longer and enjoy our night. Unfortunately, the staff at The Gage made it impossible to celebrate our friend's birthday. I'm not sure how my other friends feel about going back here, but I know I won't. I can get a better beer selection at a not-so-overrated Fountainhead outside the city.
