I LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel! Found it intriguing while booking a weekend trip for my boyfriend and me. It's a nice location, and walking distance from michigan ave and shopping. We had a corner room which has more windows (floor to ceiling)We loved the happy hour, open bar and appetizers were awesome! Different kinds of cheese, meats, dips, etc.I can't wait to spend another weekend there!
