Hardly being the one to write a 5 star review I sat and thought of ways to take away a star. The only thing I can think of is that the wait for 8 people was an hour during Friday lunch hour. That's not worth a star. This place is simply amazing. I had a chicken pasta dish, a bunch of appetizers, and creme brle (regular and chocolate...yes they give you both). The waiter was informative and nonintrusive, the food came out quickly and hot, the seats were comfortable, the atmosphere was great for conversation. Need I say more? Wonderful.
