I doubt they need anymore good reviews, but I'll throw my opinion in here anyway! I dined here a few weeks ago with my uncle and a friend of his. We came in on a week night around 5:45 and the Oyster Bar was pretty crowded, so we wound up in the dining room. We ordered the oyster sampler and most were delicious! Some were a bit fishy, but overall, I enjoyed it and would order again. I ordered the king crab legs, which came pre cracked with butter. Absolutely delicious and worth every penny! Service was average, but the food was extraordinary. Definitely worth a trip, or 10 back!
