I would have liked it more if the portions weren't so small. My poor boyfriend left hungry after his small bowl of mac n' cheese.  I had the grilled arctic char, which was a decent size and delicious, but I was more excited about and anticipating the gnocchi w/brussel sprouts that it came with.  My poor little heart sank when I saw that I had only 4 brussel sprouts...cut into fours (seriously, I think i'm the only person who actually eats em...but they're so tasty!!!) and 7...counted em...SEVEN...gnocchi! What gives?! Feed your customers! 90% of them look like they could use a sandwich or two as it is... The Tom Waits for nobody martini is WAY too sweet (and I usually like sweet). I mean, how did you envision Tom Waits drinking/representing something like this? He probably "Waits for nobody" because the drink you named after him forced him into diabetic shock and caused him to rush to the hospital *snicker snicker snicker*. The saving grace is that I fell in love with the apple crumb w/salty peanut butter gelato thing. Ammmmaaaaazzzziiiinnnngggggg!!!! Oh, and props for using organic ingredients.  It was all delicious, but just not enough for this hungry girl. I'll go back again though, because 1) I love brussel sprouts and 2) I live a block away.
