dear restaurant week, thank you, or should i say, "merci", for this lovely dining opportunity. fondly, me dear le colonial, thank you for getting everything right. from your interior decor that reminds me of the set of the movie "indochine" to the friendly and attentive staff (host, bartender, server, busboys, all included). thank you for having sancerre by the glass, and for going the extra step to bring out the soup in 2 bowls after hearing that my fellow diner & i would like to split the appetizer. your second floor dining area (near the window) is just right for people-watching, and i also enjoyed your eclectic blend of music in the background. i look forward to returning soon... a bientot!
