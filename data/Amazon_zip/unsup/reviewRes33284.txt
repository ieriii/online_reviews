I recommend the falafel sandwich, which has hummus and jerusalem salad in it. You can order it with hot sauce in it, as well. The sandwich is a good vegetarian option, and I usually order the baba ghanouj w/ pita to round out the meal.  The lines can get pretty long during lunch, and the place is teeming with hipsters, so I usually take my falafel sandwich and baba ghanouj to go. They don't take credit cards, so bring cash. Overall, the food is good. It's also walking distance from the Damen Blue Line stop.
