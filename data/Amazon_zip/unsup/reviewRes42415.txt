Checked out this place after seeing it on Check Please and reading the good reviews on Yelp. Mixed experience. I have to say that the atmosphere was not good. We walked in to loud obnoxious dance music...why?? The place was also sort of hazy (smoke from the kitchen?) and to top it off, the fans were places right under the lights giving me the complete dance club experience with the strobing lights. Seating was semi-communal which I'm not a fan off but it wasn't too bad. The menu is huge! I can't stand fish sauce, so the good news is that immediately 70% of the menu is eliminated. Bad news is that almost everything comes with fish sauce!! We tried some of their spring rolls as appetizers. Good but not spectacular. My wife had a noodle dish which was solid. My brother tried the beef pho which he really enjoyed and I tried. It was better than I would have expected. I had a pork dish that was made with mustard seeds. The sauce was pretty unique and very tasty. The pork meat was sort of fatty and not great, but overall a good dish. I would probably go back sometime to try the pho and hope that they are not playing any music (or at least better music). Really wanted to like this place, but was somewhat disappointed.
