Cash only, friends, but Nuevo Leon is well worth the trouble. This restaurant is inexpensive, always busy, and very very tasty.  My favorite part about going to Nuevo Leon is that before you order anything, there is enough food to cover the table. Sure there is the standard free chips and salsa (not just one salsa, but two salsas that vary depending on the day), but then the waitress brings a free appetizer to each person at the table! The tasty treat varies depending on the day, but I have never been disappointed.  Although this place may not be the most authentic Mexican restaurant in town, it is a bargain for the money. A dinner sized entree can easily be had for under $10 and almost everything on the menu is under $15. The best part? I always leave with enough leftovers for the next day.  The one problem for many people is the crowded quarters in the restaurant. Even though it is a huge restaurant, there are always so many people that it is often elbow-to-elbow. Fortunately, the back room is often much quieter than the front room and for those that don't mind a little extra noise, the plethora of people just add to the ambiance.
