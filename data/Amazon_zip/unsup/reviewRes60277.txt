I won't be going back here ever again. The food is ok, but my biggest complaint is the rude staff that seems to have this perpetual look of disgust on their faces EVERY time I stand in that dumb line to take my order. The prices are a little high, but if my presence is such an inconvenience, why bother? That being said, there was 1 girl that didn't have the sour puss face (tall, skinny, died black hair) was always smiling and pleasant, though haven't seen her in a while. Perhaps she got canned for having a nice personality? The petite girl, brown hair, pretty at the register...the WORST! My friend commented on her as well, so I know it's not just me. Go someplace else where they appreciate your business.
