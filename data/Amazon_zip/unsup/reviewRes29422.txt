Yummy! I went with friends to this place not knowing what to expect. Actually, one of my friends lives in this hood and recommended it. When we arrived, I wasn't expecting much more than I usually get from a thai restaurant.  WHOA! i was wrong. I'm a fan of Rama Chicken, but I like it HOT. Typically, this dish doesn't seem to be served very spicy unless you add your own hot sauce. I told the server to make it "thai hot." Upon taking my first bite, I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. This dish was on fire! And I loved it. I'm not sure I'll eat at any other thai place ever again!
