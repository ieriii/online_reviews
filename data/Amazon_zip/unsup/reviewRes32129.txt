I thought that this place was fantastic and I would definately go back. My friend had a soy pumpkin pie milkshake that was incredible. They have a large menu that thrills vegetarians because they can eat anything they see, and will get even meat eating friends happy and excited to try vegetarian food. This is just a really good place to eat at , though the seating is a bit cramped.
