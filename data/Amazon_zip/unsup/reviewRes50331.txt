Somewhat disappointed Yelperinos! I got the Eggs New Orleans as many had recommended. It was good but not as good as i thought it would be, or as many a reviewers made it seem. Presentation wasn't all that, and i found the portions to be a tad smaller than expected, esp. for the price. My companion got the eggs benedict with fried green tomatoes. Also sub par. I really don't get all the hooplah surrounding fried green tomatoes. They taste like tomatoes. Nothing special about them whatsoever if you ask me. The interior is super cute, love the decorations, wallpaper, lighting fixtures, everything. Probably won't be back - on to the next one!
