Um, how can I say, I love having a Hispanic boyfriend who knew about this place! Unbelievable!  I could sit in front of a bottomless bowl of their complimentary soup for hours!  My all time favorite dish is enchiladas in mole, and I always draw comparisons to my favorite Mexican restaurant which is sadly no longer around. La Choza was the best and so was the owner Sylvestor, and if anyone has fond memories they would like to share, let me know!  That being said, I think Nuevo Leon is the closest thing that I have found. The mole was rich, thick, and delicious. I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed which is always a good sign. I loved the decor, I loved the families that were seated around us, and I loved the food.  This place is a gem and I cannot wait to return with my family, While we may not have our favorite spot anymore, I think new memories are about to be brewed.
