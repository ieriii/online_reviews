Brunch only review. My girlfriend and I went today for the brunch. We sat down, ordered some Mimosas and looked at the menu. After struggling to find something appealing, we both decided to finish the Mimosas and go somewhere else. $18 for two Mimosas and a coffee. Nothing on the menu was particularly appealing and it was all overpriced. Every time I would see something that looked moderately interesting like the pork shank, it would promptly be ruined to my tastes by the inclusion of something like kale or turnips. I suppose this is fabulous for people who really want to be adventurous, but for my tastes it was a disaster. My girlfriend completely agreed. Frankly, not only was the menu unappealing, but the Mimosas at $7 a piece were tiny and not that good. Be warned, I had predicated my visit upon viewing a previous menu that had many things that looked great like the smoked fish with bacon truffle. That sounds cool and different. Sorry, but nothing on the menu now is remotely like that. Everything was ruined by what appeared to be my mother when I was five trying to sneak in things I hated at dinner. Here son, you can eat this awesome steak if you also eat these turnips and beats I snuck in. Um, no thanks. Especially for the premium price. Ended up going to Las Tablas and having an absolutely delicious dinner (brunch had passed us by) of empenadas and other wonderful dishes along with the best Sangria I have ever had. Spent $90 there. No problem spending the money, but make it worth it and don't gauge me.
