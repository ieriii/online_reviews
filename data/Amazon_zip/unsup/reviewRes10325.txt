THis place was fantastic.  Atmosphere: It has an upscale feel to it. Well mixed crowd. The parking lot is full of european luxury cars. The inside is nice, but, as everyone else says, the patio is fantastic and makes the place. You wouldn't even know yuo are in the city with the beautiful foliage all over.  Service: Service was spectacular. We were seated on time. The server was spot on with his timings and provided great recommendations. We never poured a glass of wine through two bottles as the server took care of it for us. Shortly after our entrees came out, it began raining. Sitting under the tree we didn't feel it. An army of servers came out and moved everyone in immediately, getting us under cover just before the downpour.  Food: Most of our orders centered around seafood....and the seafood was great. Calamari was not chewy at all. The tomatos in the salads were as fresh as I've ever tasted. The deserts (hazlenut desert and the panna cotta) were to die for. The hazlenut desert was our favorite by far. The wine selection was very good, with our selection being a crowd pleaser. The only negative thign I experienced was after my wife finished her pasta, I had a couple of bites and felt it was overcooked...maybe that's because it had sat a bit...she never complained.
