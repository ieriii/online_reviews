What a fantastic experience! Perfect combo of "good 'ol" tried and true asian cuisine and new inventive experiments of flavor. Excellent sushi masters prepare the freshest fish, many flown in the same day.  After 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine, 2 main courses, and 1 intermediate course, the bill came to $160.  Would highly recommend for date night.
