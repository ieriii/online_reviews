THE DINERS, DRIVE-INS & DIVES EFFECT? In Chicago we have many effects. The lake effect, the Check Please Effect, and now the Diners, Drive Ins & Dives (D3) effect. I had been meaning to try Glenn's for a while, lured by rumors of a great breakfast and fresh seafood of all things, but was ill-prepared for how packed this place would be apparently due to a recent feature on D3. THE WAIT The Ugg-clad hostess said it would only be about a 10 minute wait. Um...not so much. Try 30 minutes. At first the wait wasn't so bad as she bounced to and fro offering us free cups of coffee. But that good will immediately evaporated when groups that arrived AFTER ours began to get seated BEFORE us. I'm sorry, but I really don't care if it's going to be really hard to seat that group of 6...my group of 3 got there 15 minutes earlier and we should be seated first. End of discussion. THE FOOD Eh. Maybe they excel at seafood, but they don't excel at breakfast. My pancakes were overcooked and rubbery, my eggs were dripping with oil, and my corned beef hash was the dog food stuff you get out of a can and it wasn't even crisp. To top it all off it took our server over 10 minutes to get our drinks to the table and we probably saw her less than a minute during our entire meal. Save yourself the trouble, especially if you're going for breakfast.
