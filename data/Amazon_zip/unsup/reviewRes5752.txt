I love this place. I may be biased because I worked for Lettuce Entertain You for a few years and love their restaurants, but this is by far, one of the best. Good food, good pricing, large menu. It can be hard to get last minute reservations on a Friday or Saturday, so beware, even though the place is huge. Great for all occasions - simple night out to dinner, graduation, birthday, anniversary etc... I love the chicken and steak dishes. The cheesecake is perfect, but the other desserts could use a bit of work. The only knock I have on this place is the service...not the friendliest hosts up front, which is the first impression and should be impeccable every time.
