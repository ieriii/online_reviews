This is a pizza place...and pizzas sound pretty great. Lots of great toppings, a ton of options, and they spell mozzarella in a cute way. So what did I order? Chicken. Why? Money, baby. The pizzas are relatively expensive compared to what I'm used to and the chicken was darn cheap! $11 whole chicken with two sides. The black beans and mashed potatos were great, the chicken tasted pretty good, although they dissect it for you and all the pieces are incredibly boney and the meat was a little dry. The shear cheapness (at least 3 big meals for $11) of the chicken is why I'm giving it four stars, what can I say? I'm broke! Also, I wouldn't recommend eating there.
