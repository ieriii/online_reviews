I asked the doorman at the hotel I was staying at where was the best deep dish in chi-town. He said it was Giordano's.I got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the pizza. It was really heavy. It is truly a pizza pie. The taste was amazing. The best pizza I have ever eaten so far (I have not been to NYC yet). I liked it so much I went back on my last day in the city.The only downside is that it takes 40 minutes for them to make each pizza but its worth the wait.
