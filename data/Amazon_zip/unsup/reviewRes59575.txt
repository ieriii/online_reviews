Whenever I take friends out for Korean, the default restaurant of choice is San Soo Gab San. Granted the atmosphere isn't fancy, but isn't it about the food not the surroundings one is after. If you're going to order pajeon (seafood pancake), make sure you grab the edges first as the middle part is a little soggy. The kalbi is sublime; they're pretty generous with the amount of beef they serve you.Highly recommended!
