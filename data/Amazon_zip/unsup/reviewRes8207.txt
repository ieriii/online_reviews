Yum yum, double yum. Thinking about restaurants like this make me not want to ever move away from my neighborhood! Tucked away on a little corner of ravenswood, I'm lucky to report that Spacca Napoli is only a quick walk from my house. I've been here several times and never been anything but happy with the food and service. I've also recommended friends here several times and I know they've had similar experiences. I think I've always had vegetarian pizzas here, as well as a variety of their salads. Their pizzas are simple but have the highest quality ingredients. I've never felt like I wanted more toppings, in fact I always appreciate the simplicity, as it allows you to focus more on the few essential ingredients like great crust, sauce, and cheese.  I love that they hand you a little cannoli as you walk out the door. A perfect treat to end a delicious meal. Also, it has a great family feel. One night we were the last people in the restaurant and they gave us a bunch of leftover bread from the day, which we took home and ate for days! Love this place.
