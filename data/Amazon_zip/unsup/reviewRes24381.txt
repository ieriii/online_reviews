This is my favorite restaurant in the entire world and my favorite crepe is the Icosium Crepe, which comes with goat cheese, onions, bell peppers, etc. Each savory crepe comes with a bowl of soup, usually a creamy vegetable puree or cream of mushroom. I always get the vegetable, but both are phenomenal. The water comes with a refreshing slice of cucumber. I always indulge in a hot cup of Algerian mint tea with honey. The tea itself, which is served in a fancy silver pot, is reason enough to go try Icosium. The dessert crepes are also delicious and each comes with a scoop of ice cream and a paper umbrella. I have taken almost twenty people here and all have been extremely satisfied. The restaurant is small, but the atmosphere is cozy and exotic and being smack in the middle of trendy Andersonville (you guessed it, my favorite Chicago neighborhood) doesn't hurt. I now live in Ohio and am craving the hell out of these crepes.
