My go-to neighborhood Thai restaurant. 90% of the time after working late I stop in here. In fact, one of the times I picked up food somewhere else our accounting person questioned the charge because it wasn't at my usual place... The Tom Kah Kai soup here is great, and I always order it with a side of rice to mix in. I haven't had a bad meal here, although I've never actually dined in the restaurant.
