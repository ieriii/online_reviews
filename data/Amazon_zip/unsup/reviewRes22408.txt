Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing a 4 star yelp average or maybe they were just having a bad night, but Irazu just didn't do it for me. We tried a lot of different things just to make sure but the result was just the same - meh. There was the tico taco, there was the potato taco, there was vegetarian taco, the vegetarian burrito and even the gallo pinto (extremely dry and bland)...all failed to impress.
