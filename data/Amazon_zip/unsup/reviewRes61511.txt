Went to the grand opening party and sent the letter below the following week. The letter was answered by an irate phone call from Don saying that wasn't him, he never said that although he did remember somebody asking him about t-shirts hmmmm....ya, ok. Seems more like anarchy to me... Dear Josh, Congrats on your new brewery, it's fantastic! I had the pleasure of attending the grand opening and enjoying all the great beers. It was unfortunate they all ran out so quickly but I had a good time nonetheless. However, the evening ended on a very sour note and I'd like to explain... Around 9:30 I bumped into Donn Bichsel Jr, whom I met at Mash-tun the week before at Bridgeport Arts Center. We chatted, exchanged business cards and briefly discussed an off-site meeting/party for work this summer. I mentioned to Donn that the event was great but I bought too many tickets and tried getting a t-shirt at 9:10 pm and they were already closed. His exact verbatim response: "Do I look like Josh? Do I look like I have a handlebar mustache? DO I LOOK LIKE I CARE?!" And he turned abruptly and walked away... Let me tell you, that was the worst ending possible as I stood there, jaw dropped in amazement and shock holding six tickets. I thought to myself you just lost a Revolution fan, a restaurant customer/patron a corporate event and "you don't care." This is a gentleman representing your fine brewery and is the Director of Sales. Not exactly the best sales tactic I've seen.  I will hang on to the great memory of B.A. Baracus stout and the bad taste of Donn Bichsel's attitude in my mind... Best to you and your brewery, LB
