Another stop on Chicago dining tour.  After reading reviews we figured this place would be busy so we got there soon after 11am on a friday. Upon reflection I wish we had gotten breakfast instead of sandwiches but everything was tasty so . . . Had Vegan Reuben. Good sandwich and the "Corned Beef" had good flavor and texture. I would have preferred the sandwich to be grilled on a flattop which would have added some texture and kept the sandwich from quickly turning to mush. It still worked though. My wife got the Steak sandwich. Added mushrooms which really helped kick up the beefy flavor. For sides, the flash "seared" kale was delicious and gingery if not a little undercooked and tepid. Also the sweet potato fries were definitely crispy but for me indistiguishable from most other sweet potato fries that come out fo the freezer and into the fryer. I personally don't get all the fuss. The staff was wonderful and friendly. The other patrons were an eclectic bunch though most tables when we were in there looked like they had just taken their lunch break from an Occupy Wall Street protest. Also quite an interesting neighborhood as the many shopping options include Gaymart and other shops for sex toys and smoking utensils. Another vegan option that we'd love to have closer to home.
