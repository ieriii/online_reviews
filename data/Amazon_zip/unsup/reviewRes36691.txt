First, I want to say this place is generally great. They have lots of options, and the juice list is fantastic. Most people will be able to find something they'll enjoy here. That said, today I ordered the vegan tofu scrambler. It's a pretty uninspired idea for being their only vegan option, but I figured it was a safe bet and hard to mess up. When I received my meal, I realized that this wasn't as much of a scrambler as it was very lightly sauteed vegetables with a few pieces of unseasoned tofu thrown in. What bothered me about this was that the tofu was cold -- not room temperature cold, but just pulled out of the refrigerator cold. The vegetables weren't even enough to warm it up. As you can imagine, taking a bite of warm vegetables with a piece of cold tofu isn't appetizing in the least. When I mentioned this to the server, her response was simply that this is how the dish is always prepared. It's very unfortunate if that's the case, and they must not sell this dish very often. Disappointing.
