Eh...I wasn't that impressed. Then again, I am pretty damn picky. I got the wild mushroom ravioli (why I chose that, I'm not sure) and it was just kind of bland. My fiance got the seitan reuben, which he was pretty happy with but he had been craving a reuben for the three years that he'd been a vegetarian before that. I also got some pomegranate wine which was pretty good. We sat outside which was a little chilly, so I didn't get a good grasp on the inside vibe, but I remember it not being as awesome as I had expected. I like Earwax's food better.
