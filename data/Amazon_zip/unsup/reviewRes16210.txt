Classy and cool...I've been to lots of bars all over the world and this is by far my favorite bar. It's the first place I take anyone visiting from outta town. In summary, the theme is a speakeasy with a twist of Alice in Wonderland. The outside facade is always changing and is quite decieving creating a sense of mystery and secrecy. The inside is quite intimate with dim lighting, elegant interior design, and six foot backs on chairs for an atmosphere conducive to conversation. The marble bar has mixologists, not bartenders, who make the best drinks you'll ever taste - they are quite strong as well. Expect to lounge, talk with your company, and enjoy the atmosphere. All in all, you'll find a very classy, artsy, and sophisticated environment...and if you're lucky, you might see a unicorn....
