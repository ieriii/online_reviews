I liked my pizza a lot. The Chicago style is unique and Giordano's cheese is top quality. Of course, there is a wait, but they tell you that right on the menu. Go when you have time and enjoy the company of friends or family. The wait staff was good. The desserts looked great, but who could possibly think about dessert after a couple slices of that wonderful pizza?
