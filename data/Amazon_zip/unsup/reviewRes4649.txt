To the Purple Pig, "that'll do pig. That'll do." No reservations here so be ready to wait a while. Unless you enjoy late dinners which the gf & I do. Showed up around 10pm and we had our choice of indoor or outdoor seating. Our waitress Jill was just straight up awesome! Really helpful & suggestive and was around enough to make sure we had anything we needed but also not enough to make us think she was our mother. And extremely friendly too! We got the... -Pig's Ear w/ the Fried Egg, Kale & Peppers -Bone Marrow Smear -Milk Braised Pork Shoulder w/ Mashed Potatoes -Octopus w/ Beans & Potatoes -Wagyu Sirloin Tip ALL OF THEM (with the exception of the Bone Marrow Smear) were MUST HAVES! The smear was good but I just didn't think it was great. One last thing if you're driving, they don't valet but they do validate parking for the parking garage at 50 E. Ohio.
