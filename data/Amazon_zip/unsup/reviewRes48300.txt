The Publican is amazing! I went with a friend and when we first arrived we had to wait for a bit, but gladly headed to the bar and had a beer and glass of rose. Delicious! Once we got settled into our seat and spoke with the waitress, we chose to order the Suckling Pig, French Fries and an order of the Pork Rinds. The pork was perfect in every way. Flavorful, moist, tender and the fries were the best I've ever had. I can't wait to try them again. In all honestly I am not a huge fan of Pork Rinds and probably wouldn't order them on my own, but if your a fan or new to eating at The Publican definitely give them a try. Can't wait to go back! Also, if you take a group, make a reservation so you can get a private booth.
