I'm actually not a huge red meat fan but Wildfire might have changed that. I had the Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes on the side and a glass of red wine and it was absolutely fucking amazing. Our waiter was also really nice. I'm into nice people giving me awesome food to eat. I will be eating red meat here again, for sure. My mouth is watering just thinking about that double stuffed potato that the person I went with got.. damn. Amazing. For sure.
