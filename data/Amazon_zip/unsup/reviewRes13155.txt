I just have to give a review for the awesomeness that is Glenn's Diner. Let's Start with the ambiance, there is no place like it. I cannot really put my finger on what it is about it, but it is unequivocally unique. When I walk in, I immediately feel comfortable. There is nothing pretentious, every detail seems to glisten with a realness that makes you feel at home. The cereal boxes behind the bar remind one of their childhood, of the variety of ways to start your day. The myriad of paintings and pictures on the walls reflect memories of the past and bring to light the present. I feel as though I have stepped inside a manifestation of someones life's work, a masterpiece. This is Glenn's Diner, and Glenn is happy to share it with you. This ambiance would not be nearly as effective if it was not accompanied by a staff that seemed to thrive in it. They are downright welcoming and unassuming. Having interacted with most of them on more than one occasion, I can say that they are second to none at what they do and should be proud of the level of service they provide. Furthermore, it should be iterated that the reason being for the impression they make is that every staff member seems to earnestly care and take pride in their work. This, in my experience, has been what is lacking in other sub par dining experiences. Lastly, the food can be summed up in two words, with an emphasis on the second: hearty and DELICIOUS.  Thank You Glenn's.
