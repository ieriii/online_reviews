A solid 3 stars. I loved- The open floor plan guaranteed you did not feel crowded( I have to note that the fact that it was 1pm on a Tuesday certainly didn't hurt). The HUGE menu- so many choices, it was so hard to decide. The fact that my 3 ingredient scrambler was FILLED with ingredients. They did not skimp on my broccoli, feta or tomatoes. The child friendly table we were sat by the host- in the back in a wall, when our resident toddler and newborn started to fuss we did not feel as if we were ruining the meals of the other patrons. Additionally the host gave us crayons and a coloring sheet without having to be asked. The fact that our waitress apologized for our long wait (they had switched sections and there was a misunderstanding). Mistakes happen, but the fact that she acknowledged our long wait made me feel appreciated as a customer I did not love- The fact that my friend who ordered a egg white skillet with onions and mushrooms discovered pieces of HAM in her dish. The multigrain pancakes.....eehhh, they were tough and heavy. My coffee did not hit the spot, it was weaker than I prefer, but I was given milk instead of cream upon request. I have to admit that I am partial to Meli, but Yolk's egg dishes were very good, and the laid back atmosphere, bright decor and prices make it a good place to go for brunch. Perhaps when I get a chance to try more of their menu my rating might improve, I will certainly be back and will be sure to update my review.
