I had high hopes for Xoco, but I was really disappointed in my meal. The setup is weird but the lines worked out and we had a table when our food was ready. However, my food was awful. The quality of the ingredients was great, and the food was well cooked. But everything was so over salted that it was like eating a salt lick. I went with a bunch of friends so I tried a few items. Everything was over salted. My soup was so over salted that I should have sent it back. However, since I'm vegetarian there wasn't even another option for me to replace it with if I did send it back (well, there is a veggie sandwich but we already had one of those). I wouldn't go back again. The churros and classic cocoa were delicious but almendrado was meh.
