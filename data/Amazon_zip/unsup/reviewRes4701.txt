After drinks and a funny time at the Second City, and more drinks and funny artwork at the Old Town Ale House, we were back in the Loop and hankering for a snack (aaaand more drinks). Yelp pulled up the Purple Pig in all its solid 4-star, 1000+ review glory (oh the joys of being a tourist in a time of technology!). It sounds like people are serious about waiting in line for this place earlier in the evening, but since it was closer to midnight when we arrived, we waltzed in easily (oh the joys of still being on Pacific time!). We went for two of the most-mentioned dishes plus a couple more. We started with the shaved brussels sprouts and the choreezo olives (spelling the latter wrong on purpose so it doesn't tally another vote for it) and found both to be a little boring. More stand-outish was the popular bone-marrow (it's like eating expensive, delicious pork grease...) and the foie gras (it was a decadent evening). But maybe I was just drunk by that time (beer + wine + pig = on vacation fer sure). I'd give it a 3.5 for the food itself, bumping it up to 4 stars for great customer service, a nice setup, and a good location. Probably wouldn't wait in line for it, but would possibly drop in on a late weekend night again.
