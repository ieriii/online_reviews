This place currently has a yelp average of 4 stars... Which leads me to believe that either only idiots, or people who don't know what good pizza taste like are reviewing it. Really? Really????????? You people truly believe that this place is what deep dish is about? If I were to Yelp Chicago, you would all lose a star for even having this place open. Basically, if you like large layers of flour encrusted cheese with marinara on top, then I think this is your place. But if you like REAL pizza then please stray far from this tourist trap. I was a tourist coming here... so I should know. Especially after talking to natives who laughed at me for even going to this joke of a pizza place. Anyways... it wasn't the worst pizza ever... but my god... I can't believe they haven't been sued for causing a million heart attacks. And to be honest... i can melt my own cheese in flour with marinara on top. Did I mention that there is usually a 30 minute to hour long wait? And BTW, they are ALL tourists. No true native would ever wait for this shit. And one more thing... I am pretty sure that I will never eat a deep dish pizza again after experiencing this crap. It has ruined me. Wayyyy to heavy, wayyyy to much cheese, and wayyyy lacking on quality. Jesus Christ... you guys are making a killing off of first timers huh? Well... I'll be straight up... your deep dish blows, and your lack of quality in the ingredients shows. On the plus side, the service was pretty good and everyone was nice. The atmosphere is good, and you are obviously staying open for some reason. Anyways, sorry... but you really were the worst ever. Oh and thanks for making me have gas for a week. Yikes.
