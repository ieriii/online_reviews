Great vibe at this place. Relaxed but efficient servers who are obviously confident in their product! It was 3:30 PM and we hadn't eaten all day. Fortunately they had a transition menu (between lunch and dinner) with great choices. We had a premium burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was a thick homemade patty, lots of fresh fixings, and just enough bun to hold it together. The chopped salad had crisp veggies with smoked chicken. The plain old cheesecake with candied (and salted) orange rinds was plain old delicious.We are from the West Coast and felt right at home here.
