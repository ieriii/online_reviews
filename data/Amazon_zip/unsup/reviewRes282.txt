Warning: excessive use of exclamation marks below! I had an evening (it was about 4hrs) at Alinea last night and I woke up dreaming about the food this morning. It was absolutely AMAZING!!! Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was just perfect! Everyone was attentive and very friendly. Felt so comfortable and not at all pretentious. The anticipation of each course was like opening several thoughtful and wonderful gifts. Our server overheard me wishing my sister and bro-in-law a happy birthday and they got a special bday treat/course! So thoughtful!!! They also offered us a kitchen tour after our meal- it was the most impeccable and organized kitchen I had ever seen. There were over 20 chefs in there! Recommendation- do the wine pairing and any extras they offer. I was stuffed by the 15 course, but my taste buds thanked me for going on. When I took my first bite I couldn't help, but audibly say "yum" (several times) and didn't think anything could make it better, but the wine just enhanced the meal. Such unique wines at time, but delicious and luscious all the same. They had an extra course of risotto with shaved truffle- best thing I've ever put into my mouth!!! Did I mention that the night was AMAZING?!?! I will go back again and again and again. Everyone should experience it!
