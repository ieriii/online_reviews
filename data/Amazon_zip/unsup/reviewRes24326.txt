The service is always great here. Very attentive. They also make some unique cocktails!  I think the food is fresh and unique as well. This is the goat cheese and tomato sauce kind of tapas.  I was here the other night and got the chef's tasting. They will accommodate you if you're like me and only eat seafood. I could list out all of the stuff that we eat but there's not enough room! Cheese, salads, lobster, shrimp, bread, potatoes, olives. It never ended!! What I really like about this place is that its open and nice inside without being stuffy, too trendy or too loud. You can come here with a big group and have fun or on a date and feel romantic.
