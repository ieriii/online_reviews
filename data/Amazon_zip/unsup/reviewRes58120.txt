Average food and the waiter, when we could find him, continued to try to sell high-priced items at every turn. Pacing of the arrival of the food was sporadic and not timed to arrival of cocktails. Cold in the restaurant; one friend had to wear her coat. When we asked for more of the bread that is first put on the table, we were charged an additional $1.50. Would not go back.
