I have been here twice and LOVED my food every time. The first, I was able to sit outside due to nice weather and enjoyed the Beet salad and steak which was lovely. The second time I sat inside which has such a wonderful lively environment. Kid friendly. Service was great and fun. Food wonderful. The signature dish of short rib goulash was fantastic! A must all around!
