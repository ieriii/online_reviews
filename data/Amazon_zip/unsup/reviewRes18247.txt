I'm not usually a negative nick, but I paid 10 bucks for a chicken tinga sandwich and it was all dark meat with small bone chips inside. Two different bites hurt . Chips, salsa and guacamole were delicious. Logistics on how to order food and sit down is more difficult than calculus. Popularity will be with this place since the marketing of the owner is genius, but I think more effort needs to be put into logistics and food quality. Very tasty but I can also cover taco bell with caviar and it would taste good (maybe not, but you get my point). Just got my churro with ice cream and the ice cream was in a little bowl, melted and running on the table. Staff is too overwhelmed and may need more help. I will come back and give the place a second chance because everyone I ate with said everything tasted great. I beg to differ. We were even rushed because they were closing in the middle of the afternoon at 3pm, and then to reopen at 5pm. I asked the waitress if I can leave my food on the table and come back at 5 to finish it. She said no. ...oh ya, my friend got salsa spilled by her on the floor and a little Splashed up on her jacket. Staff too rushed! Logistics people, logistics! Oh, by the way, this review was for JULY 2011 - I had never posted the review, and saw it incomplete in my YELP account. Better late than never!
