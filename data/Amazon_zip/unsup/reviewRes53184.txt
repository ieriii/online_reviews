Great spot. Quick, friendly, generous service! food is AMAZING. Four of us the dinner plates with black beans, rice, and plaintains and all of us licked our plates clean! Brought a cubano to go for my husband and he inhaled it...said he wants to go back just for that sandwich. Great addition to the neighborhood...and cute space.
