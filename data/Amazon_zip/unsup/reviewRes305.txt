For her 30th Birthday, I took my girlfriend to Alinea for dinner after a play at Steppenwolf. I was hoping to impress her since I'm of little value otherwise and I think it worked reasonably well.  Easily the most incredible service I've ever experienced. They knew what I was thinking and didn't require me to actually say it. I won't bore you with the effusive praise I've been giving this place every time it's come up in the past few months since I went, but let me tell you, it's fantastic. Yeah, they gave us a menu, but I'm not really sure why. I was getting twelve courses, damnit, and every wine on the suggested pairing wine course, to boot. So, of course, we didn't bother looking over the menu as we much prefer to be surprised.  The meal was a healthy three and half hours long and while each course was small, it was plenty of food (see: 12 courses above). For me, it was the perfect amount of food and alcohol. I was in a blissed out coma by the end. For my ever so petite girlfriend, I think eight to ten might have worked a little better, but you won't see any complaining from me. It was a truly a memorable that I will never forget. Hopefully she'll remember her 30th birthday and smile and hopefully you can experience it for yourself and offer your own "condensed", effusive praise on this very website. Best meal ever.
