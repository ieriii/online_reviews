It is a 3-4. It was hard to decide which. Here are some pros and cons: CONS: -I would have written this review when I was actually there, but the internet situation is terrible. The rooms only have wired and they charge you PER computer. That means that you have to pay to use the one plug and then hand it over to the other person in the room and pay again, even though only ONE computer is online at a time. If you are going to do that, at least have free wireless for guests in the lobby! But, no, you pay for that too! -The phone reception in the lobby is 0. -The people who work there are not super friendly. -The rooms are small -The place doesn't have the best smell PROS: -The place is old and very charming. The lobby is beautiful.  -The rooms were nicely decorated in the modern meets classic kind of way.
