Yum yum! I'm not a seafood eater but the bread (lol, I know) and the spinach salad were really, really good. I also had some guacamole that was very fresh and an artichoke pure that was excellent. Also, the ambiance is quite nice-- large overhead beams, huge booths, cute crab table runners, old-timey feel, and very attentive waitstaff. I'd definitely go again!
