If you're visiting Chicago, Giordano's is the place to go. It is ALWAYS packed, and yes it is touristy, but you're going to love it. I have waited close to 45 minutes for a table pretty much every time, but it's worth it. Pre-order your pizza, wait for your table, and enjoy! Two pieces feel like a million pounds of food, so order smaller accordingly. When you walk into the warm and busy lower lobby and smell the pizza baking you'll know you're in for a treat.
