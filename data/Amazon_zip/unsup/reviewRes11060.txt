Pros: -Great pizza! It tasted like a compromise between thin and thick crust. While it is technically a thin crust, you can really sink your teeth into it. Cons: -Long wait. -Extremely loud music. I know this is also a bar, but it was 7 pm on a Monday and we were surrounded by children. I shouldn't really have to scream to hear my friend sitting across the table. -My friend and I ordered half pepperoni, half mushroom/banana pepper. While the meaty side was heaping with pepperoni, the toppings were a bit sparse on the vegetable side.
