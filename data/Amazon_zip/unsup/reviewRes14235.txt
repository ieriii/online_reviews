Delicious. Go here now. Do not order cereal and milk (where do you think you are?). Turn to look at the specials menu on the wall and choose something from there. I've been here for breakfast and lunch, and while the price is a bit inflated, I'd definitely return, especially for their phenomenal Bloody Marys.
