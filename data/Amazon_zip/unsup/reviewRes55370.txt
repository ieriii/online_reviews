I'm ashamed to admit that I used to think Reza's was the best Persian in the city. My husband heard this place was good and we just moved to the area, so we went a couple nights ago. Wow! Their menu is almost the same as Reza's. But Noon tastes better, and is a little cheaper. And, you know that if you go to a Persian restaurant around sunset during Ramadan, and the place is packed with Muslims, it must be good.When you first sit and they bring the water, they also bring warm fresh pita bread with a plate of onion and feta. We ordered the hummus, which was some of the best hummus we've had. My husband is not really big on hummus but he ate a lot of it. I had the chicken and lamb kebab combo with dill rice, and my husband had the lamb kebab and shrimp combo with dill rice. The rice and the meat were perfectly cooked. They seemed to be pretty busy (Sunday night) but we had no reservations and were seated quickly and service was good. I'm eating my leftovers as I type this but I still can't wait to go back.I kind of wish they had a buffet like Reza's, so I can get a little of all the best dishes, but logistically it wouldn't work as the space inside Noon is smaller. But if it means keeping the food to a high standard, I'll pay a little more to get a large entree and appetizer that taste AWESOME.
