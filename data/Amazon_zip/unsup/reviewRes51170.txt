Tried it again after a 2 year layoff. Still mediocre. I applied the attempt with the menu, but ding the poor execution. Food is a bit pricey and very vanilla for what you get. I wish I could like it more since it's close to home, but I'd rather go to Schuba's or Uncommon Ground (or even one of the Southport bars) before coming back here for brunch.
