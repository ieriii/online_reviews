Delicious! My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary (we were married at Timo last year and wanted to see how Piccolo Sogno compared.) The food was amazing! We ordered the mixed olives, peach arugula salad with goat cheese (my favorite!), raw beef tenderloin, gnocchi, and the Pesce Intero. Really, everything was excellent and flavorful. My only gripe is that despite my husband telling the restaurant we were celebrating our anniversary when he made the reservation, we were seated at a squished table in the middle of the room right next to a large party. I understand that it was crowded inside since the patio was closed due to the rain, but would have greatly appreciated one of the tables off to the side for a little more intimacy.
