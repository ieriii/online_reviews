Not sure what else there is to say that hasn't been said. The meats and cuts are excellent; service is attentive and drink list is extensive. This place is drooooool-worthy. And totally worth every calorie and penny spent. Come hungry and leave VERY satisfied. Oh, and the Brazilian lemonade is a must try, especially if you're a fan of tangy like I am. Definitely my fav of the steakhouses of its kind!!
