Visiting from Toronto and was recommended to come here. We were shocked to see a lineup outside a pizza place and with 10 of us we knew it would be a long wait, but no matter, we knew that once we got in we would be enjoying cheesey goodness. We were shocked yet again when we got seated to find out it would take 45 minutes to get our pizza. Once we did get it it was delicious. An interesting twist is that they put the toppings on in reverse order, with the cheese first and the sauce last. We had both the meat and veggi pies and each were tasty in their own right. I found the outer crust to be a little dry, but was glad that it wasn't dripping grease. Overall I would have given this 5 stars but unfortunately the service was not so great. Once we placed our order we didn't see our server again until he was bringing our food. At which point we needed refills on our drinks which he didn't offer. We had to get his attention as he was walking away. Though later on my trip I realized that this level of service seems to be pretty standard in Chicago.
