Traditional Mexican cuisine and ambiance at a small cost. Family and party friendly.  I couldn't resist the combination plate, which I was thankful actually seemed to have somewhat small versions of the taco, enchilada, tamale, and tostada. The horchata was overly sweet to me and I would recommend both the barbacoa and the carne asada. The prices are all very reasonable (byob!). I would come back.  show less
