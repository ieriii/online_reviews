"My life has forever been changed by encased meats". This was the proclamation one man made as I was walking into Hot Doug's yesterday. After waiting about 25 minutes on a Monday afternoon, I knew that this man had to be right. Once we were inside HD's, Doug was at the counter taking orders. I had scanned the menu and knew what I wanted and Doug was incredibly friendly and efficient. He truly knows how to run a successful business. You are not to sit until after you order-this ensures that you will get a seat no matter what. Because of this my friends and I sat down and were promptly served our food. I ordered the "Celebrity Sausage", which was a shrimp and pork dog topped with grits, grainy mustard and goat cheese. Not only was the sausage uniquely flavored, but the contrast of flavors and textures on this dog were incredible. My mind was blown. We also shared the Chicago Dog which was delicious. And the fries? Ok, I know I didn't come in on a duck fat day but I can only imagine how delicious they must be. These regular fries were just crispy enough and delicious. I would consider myself lucky to have waited less than half an hour to eat at Hot Doug's. I would easily wait another hour to taste this deliciousness again. Upon leaving I was almost moved to make the same proclamation as that man said upon my entrance.
