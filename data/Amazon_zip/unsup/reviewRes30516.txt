We were only in town for the weekend, and so we had to go and try it out. The menu was extensive and dishes we had we tasty and fresh, but the clincher was the raw cheesecake... I have never had anything like it, (and am sceptical of vegan cheesecakes in general) but I loved it!!!! Side note: if you enjoy their burgers, the July/August edition of Vegetarian Times printed the recipe, really easy to make and has great flavour! Enjoy!
