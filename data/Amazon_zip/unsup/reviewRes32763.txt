If you do not like sushi or havent tried it.. SUNDA will make you like sushi. I got the Kolbe Beef specialty sushi along with the specialty Spicy Tuna and they literally melt in your mouth.. But for 4 pieces its $15.00, once you taste it you will forget about the price. Also tried the regular california roll and nothing really distinguished it as better then any other sushi place, which is why I didnt give 5 stars.. but my guess is most people going to Sunda are not going to order california rolls.. Oh and where else can you be eating sushi and in walks Lebron James? Only Sunda. Great place is you have the money to blow!
