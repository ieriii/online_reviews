I love this place! It's huge. There is always a wait, but it's worth it. The portions of food are very big. I always have leftovers. I had some sort of salad with chicken, and it was delicious. Just the right amount of dressing, which can be an issue at a lot of other restaurants. Definitely a nice place to go for a date :)
