Its spot on every time we eat here. The martinis are always superb and more importantly the food is fantastic. We came in for the Restaurant Week but ended up ordering off of the menu. I had the tuna steak and my guest had the porterhouse. Both were cooked perfectly and delicious. The au gratin potatoes are insane. Like mac 'n cheese without the mac. What a great treat!
