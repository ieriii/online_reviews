Well I have been going to the Greek Islands since 1972 or so and have never had a bad meal there-- but last night was the best-- Perfect broiled octopus appetizer,perfect lamb dishes, perfect desserts (baklava of course and galaktoboureko-- smooth as I have every had)...mousaka-- salads-- perfect--- and the great service where food comes quickly but you are not rushed to leave...And the salt is way down from it used to be-- I think that is a great improvement-- I amnot thirsty for the entire night. Oh-- bread terrific as always.
