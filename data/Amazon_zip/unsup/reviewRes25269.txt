Came here because I heard they had amazing desserts. I ended up getting their house soup, which had a wonderful lemon flavor, and one of their pizzas. It was so fresh and vibrantly colorful, with peppers, red onion, olives, tomatoes. Wonderful. The service was kind of slow, and it is very casual, with only cafe-like seating. (No real tables). I ended up buying a bunch of different cookies and little cakes from their bakery and they were all very unique and tasty. They have a huge selection of desserts and pies to choose from. Not the cheapest place to eat, but very good nonetheless.
