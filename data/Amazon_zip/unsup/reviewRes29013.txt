AHH! How could I forget to write about one of my FAVORITE Thai Restaurants! What I particularly like about this area is that there are about 4 - 5 other Thai places all within 100 feet of each other. This one is Amazing! I absolutely love the Pad Thai, Chicken Satay, and the beef Pad See-Iew. Once I got really adventurous and ordered their Fried Catfish, I wouldn't necessarily order that again.  Try this place out! Great food! I love that they have carry-out and delivery.
