I love BYOB. You know what I love even more? BYOB sushi! Sushi X is tiny tiny, so definitely consider giving it a try on an early-in-the-week night. Adore the candlelit tables and the hip silver walls. Music is sort of a clean, subdued house mix, and works with the lounge-inspired space. Staff is knowledgeable, and the rolls are ginormous! My favorites are the inside out "Honey" rolls (white tuna, cucumber & honey sesame mayo with a crunchy tempura outside) and of course, the "Godzilla" rolls. Sushi X is great for carryout (I used to live around the corner, sniff sniff) and they also DELIVER! Did you notice the delish rolls have a vaguely familiar taste? That may be courtesy of the also yummy Sushi Wabi. Word on the street is that 2 former Sushi Wabi chefs started Sushi X.
