The humanized hot dogs atop Superdawg are silly and hilarious. I can't even remember the last drive-in I've been to. Service was slow but pleasant. I ate sloppily in my car, spilling relish and onions all over myself. No shame. I think there's still mustard on the steering wheel. I love the container, though yes, it may smush the Superdawg and the fries. Small detail. After the first bite, I realized, yes, this is extremely delicious. See, I grew up on Nathan's and Gray's Papaya in NY. I just recently visited the Original Nathan's in Coney Island. But this place has those NY establishments beat. Superdawg has shaken my whole foundation about hot dogs. I'll leave it to the locals to debate the best hot dog in Chicago. For me, the only way this could've been better is if those humanized hot dogs atop Superdawg were the ones who delivered the order to my car.
