Me and my friends finally decided to try piece pizza! Keep in mind there was three of us and we eat alot. I thought the reviews on yelp were worth a shot. We went on fathers day and it was pretty crowded but we were seated quickly. Were cheese eaters so we just ordered the four cheese medium pizza I think. It was brought to our table quickly. It was nice, hot, cheesy, and crispy! Great prices too. Not so expensive in my opinion. I'd go back but I'd order it with toppings this time.
