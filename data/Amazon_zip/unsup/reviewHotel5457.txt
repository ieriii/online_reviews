The Sutton Place is absolutely fabulous. My girlfriend and I stayed there for her birthday and for an extended weekend. That was only three weeks ago and we miss it already.  The Sutton Place is in one of the nicest area in Chicago; the Gold Coast. The place was centrally located for everything. The Bellman and front desk was extremely friendly for directions and recommendations. The rooms were clean with comfortable beds. The Electronics were a bit dated with no IPOD connection and the Bathrooms were a little dated but again very clean. I do hope they reinvest for some modern decor and upgrades, but neverless we will stay there again.  The Whiskey Bar and Mexx was a cool place to have drinks with an urban lounge atmosphere. The place is directly across the street from the Frog Bar, Gibson Steakhouse, and Taverns on the Rush. All cool upscale bars and dining. If you want the dive scene, that is only two blocks away.  I recommend this hotel for service, atmosphere, the value ( you will be suprised with other hotels in the same price range), and the location. You can't go wrong with this place. I am planning on going back with the girl real soon, and we will be staying there.
