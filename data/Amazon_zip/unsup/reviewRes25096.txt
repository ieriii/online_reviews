If you go to Geja's and don't get laid afterward - you are doing something wrong! This place is uber romantic, complete with flamenco guitar players, walls made of empty wine bottles, and private little booths (which you should try t request if you do go, the tables are pretty small). Although the options on the menu are limited compared to other places (the Melting Pot), the two are really not comparable. The experience here is everything, and the ambiance only adds to the great food. Portions are huge, and each dinner includes salad, cheese fondue, and chocolate fondue. I love the beef, chicken, shrimp combo - but the magic is in the dipping sauces. Also, try the red wine sangria. I usually don't like the red version, but here it is just delicious and very fruity, goes well with the cheese course. Tip: go to their website and sign up for the mailing list, they mail $25 off coupons for your birthday (they come in really handy!)
