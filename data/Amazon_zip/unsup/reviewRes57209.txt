I took a date here and had a great experience.Firstly, I had no idea how huge it was! Also i was under the impression it was less casual than it is, I really liked the interior. Food was excellent, and well timed. The wine was affordable and they ad a surprisingly large selection from what I remember, we had a great time at the front bar area also, margaritas and mojitos were excellent.
