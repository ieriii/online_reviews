Went here based on a google search of top "new" restaurants. Turns out it's really not that new, but glad we went anyway. Our server was very sweet and helpful. We started with a couple cheeses and a meat - all were ok. A bit bland, but it probably has to do with the fact that I don't know how to pick out cheeses. Anyway, comparable at best to any other places with cheese and meat offerings. Next we had the ricotta and honeycomb with toast, which was surely yummy. The homemade bread was delicious and I haven't eaten honey since I was a kid at McD's with my chicken mcnuggets, so it was a welcomed change of pace and flavor. Finally, we had a pizza, which was my biggest regret. I thought based on all the tables around us that the pizza would be a highlight, but it was kind of boring. We asked for a side of marinara to dip it in given there wasn't much on it and that was what saved it. Their marinara is fantastic. As for the atmosphere, it was loud. Annoyingly loud at times, even though it didn't seem that crowded. And I get the attempt at making the place look rustic to go along with the food, but it just seemed forced. But still, it was warm and comfortable. I'd recommend it if you're in the area, but not sure we will treck back out here for seconds (despite it being only a $10 cab ride).
