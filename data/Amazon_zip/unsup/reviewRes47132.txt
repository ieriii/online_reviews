I love Uncommon Ground, everything is always guaranteed to be fresh and delicious! They grow their own products and in the Summer time there is outdoor seating in their parking lot and they are dog friendly! You can't really go wrong with any of their menu items. They change their menus seasonally and I look forward to it constantly! I recommend their: hot apple cider, sweet potato fries, dietzler farm burger, black bean enchiladas, winter scramble, smore pie, grown up gilled cheese, pepper corn bacon, chilaquiles, Hot chocolate, etc. Every time you go here you're bound to leave full and happy!
