THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD!!! I've always wanted to visit Chicago for many reasons - but none bigger than to try their famous deep dish pizza. My friend and I made a trip there in June and tried out a couple of their famous pizza joints, and Giordano's was by far my absolutely FAVORITE. We ordered the stuffed crust mushroom and sausage pizza - I guess it wasn't actually legit deep dish pizza because the crust was fairly thin, but the way they piled on the mounds of toppings and cheese made it as deep as an actual deep dish pizza. The thin crust was stacked with a generous layer of the very flavorful sausage and fresh mushrooms, followed by the ooziest/yummiest/thickest layer of SOOOOO MUCH CHEESE, followed by another generous layer of toppings, and finally covered in a layer of marinara sauce. Honestly, I don't think I could eat a more delicious pizza in my life - and am (somewhat) seriously contemplating paying $60 to have some authentic Giordano's shipped to me... :)
