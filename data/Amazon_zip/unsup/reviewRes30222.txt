Love the seafood curry and the spicy tuna on crispy rice. Service can be spotty here, but the food is always quality. The restaurant itself is gorgeous too! I think their sushi in general is quality, but the combination of flavors is never really amazing to me. It will definitely satisfy a sushi craving though!
