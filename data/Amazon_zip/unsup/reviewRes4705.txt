WHOA. Four letters can encapsulate your entire experience at most restaurants across the city, however at Purple Pig those 4 letters happen to be W-H-O-A. Having been a two-time reject at Purple Pig (not by their decree) by my own impatience, I couldn't handle a 45-minute and 2-hour long wait. This time we did the thing right and sent out a scouting group to wait in line while our party of 11 headed on over 45 minutes later. The resulting introduction led us to outdoor patio seating right next to the Chicago River and enjoying the cool breeze on an unseasonably warm March afternoon. Water quickly flowed into glasses on the tables, menus already distributed and the server quickly took down our order. The drink list was deep in libations but light on beer. Beers ranged from $6-$12 and I stuck with an $8 Scottish stout Belhaven which did the trick. At Purple Pig it will take a few plates to get full and all of the dishes are served tapas style and everyone shared. We all took effort to call for something and when the somethings came we passed it all around the table. I had a Meatball Slider, some tender Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kabobs, JLT, Turkey Leg Confit, Octopus, and Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli. Every meat is tender with the richness that only pig can offer and the food will knock your socks off. Despite all of the heavenly pig that we ate, along with a giant plate of cured meats and cheeses, by far my favorite dish in Purple Pig was the Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli. This scallop by far exceeded all my expectations not only of scallop by of Purple Pig. Never had scallop ever tasted so good with a slight crispiness on the exterior and tenderness on the interior with flavor coming with every bite and flick of the tongue. It was good, it was the best and that's what Purple Pig is in a nutshell. Bon Appetit.
