Came here and as soon as you walk in you're greeted with a nice atmosphere. The hostess was polite and got us ready to be served in a timely manner but we did make a reservation which probably contributed to the small wait. The salad bar was pretty good with their selection however when it came to the meat I was a little disappointed. The meat was good however to my taste there wasn't too much variety as after a while all the meat began to taste the same. It is a good restaurant for people who are going to a brazilian steakhouse for their first time however for those who are really picky about their meat I would consider another place such as Fogo de Chao around the Chicago area as that is still my favorite place for this kind of food.
