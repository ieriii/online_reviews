In the past, I've enjoyed several good meals at Frontera Grill & Topolobampo. XOCO is a welcome addition to the Rick Bayless empire. There are plenty of other reviews to read here, so I will keep this short. It is good. Get there 15 minutes before the lunch shift to ensure that you'll get a spot right away. Everything was excellent, but the stand out to me was the dumpling squash soup (soup of the day). The only thing that I question is that Rick chooses baguettes for his torta bread. Not sure if I am 100% in agreement with that, but everything else makes up for this. Definitely stop in. Can't wait to go back after 3pm for the big soup bowls sometime. :-)
