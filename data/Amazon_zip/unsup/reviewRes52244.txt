I tried the original style deep dish pizza. It came with a whole flat patty of sausage. It was basically the whole diameter of the pizza with cheese under and sauce on top. Good, but gross when I think about it. This Gino's has a lot of foot traffic from Mag Mile so there is always a huge line outside. We ended up just asking to sit at the bar and that was about a 15 minute wait too. The bartenders/servers were alright, but not great. The graffiti over everything was kind of tacky to me. Even when there were signs saying "no graffiti in the bathroom", the dumb illiterate customers still decided to write in the bathrooms still. I didn't bother to read the millions of scribbles over the walls.
