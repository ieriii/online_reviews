I can't believe I haven't reviewed Coast yet! This is one of my favorite sushi places in Chicago, and it was pretty much the first NICE byob place I tried when I moved here... which got me hooked. The ambiance here is fantastic, it's always crowded, and the location (on Damen in Wicker Park) is very convenient to a number of bars to visit after dinner. There's no corkage fee here, and they'll even help you out with a corkscrew and glasses so you can start drinking while you wait for a table. And yes, you'll probably have to wait. They take limited reservations, so it's usually easiest to just walk in. The good news is that the wait is usually not terrible and since you're able to sit on the couches in the entry and enjoy your wine, it's no bother at all. The food here is also really excellent, and the service has always been great. If I hadn't fallen in love with my local byob sushi restaurant (Shiso in Old Town), I'd probably be here every weekend.
