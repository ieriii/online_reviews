I have been coming to this place since their opening. I have spread the word around my foodie friends in hopes for greater success for this small place. Naturally their recent public praise in time out and food network has little to do with mua, but ill go out on a limb and say i had a helping hand. I recently went in and brought several friends and was pleasantly surprised with their ever-evolving menu. ALL positive additions (french toast , scrambles, greek yogurt etc) , and except for their breakfast potatoes, very delicious. They've expanded to dinner and a really nice drink menu. My only sad regret is their service. When i first started going here, the waitresses were attentive, friendly, and personable. Val was my favorite, cause she treated you like a friend and made a regular out of me. Now, the staff seems to be replaced with hipsters who seem lazy , uninterested and a little gross for my likes (sorry,...if u are a hairy guy, please button up or roll ur sleeves down. The thought of chest hair falling in my food is frightening). I use to be greeted with a smile, now ive been getting servers who are slow, confused by the menu, and very serious and looking bored. I would give this place a higher rating cause im crazy about the food, but the owners are missing the mark on their new staff as this place continues to grow. I hope this gets corrected. Just to be clear.. the server assistants are not a problem..they at least stay busy and are on top of their game.
