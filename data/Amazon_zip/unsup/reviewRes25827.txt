Well, I FINALLY made it to this Vietnamese spot on Lincoln Avenue, and was not disappointed!  The lunch special (offered Tue through Sun) was one of the best deals I have seen in years.  For around $8, you get homemade soup, a tasty real salad, homemade limeade (with free refills), a HUGE entree, and two big pieces of ripe cantaloupe for dessert.  Crazy cheap!  The food was excellent and extremely authentic. I got the marinated Lemongrass beef dish, and it was served over rice noodles, an egg roll, lettuce, cucumbers, sprouts, and this very tasty fish sauce. They have an extensive selection of fresh smoothies and juices as well. Service was prompt and attentive, and the manager personally came to see that we were doing well, and familiar with the menu items offered. He couldn't have been nicer.  Really! If you're in the neighborhood, don't miss this gem of a place!
