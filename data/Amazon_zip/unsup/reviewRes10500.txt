Wow what pastas! The lasagna is ensconced in a light bechamel sauce which creates a heavenly melt in your mouth experience. You can also Oder pastas in appetizer size portions. Salmon is fresh and tasty served with roasted potatoes. Great wine list with Italian offerings in the $28-35 range. The panna cotta and ricotta chesecake make great desserts along with deep rich coffee from Seattle. Busy bustling place on the weekend with young trendy crowd. Nice outdoor patio.
