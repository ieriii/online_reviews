A three dollar whiskey shot menu and delicious food is a match made in heaven; Longman and Eagle is Saint Peter. I knew this place was going to be good when right as we sat down our server offered us a complimentary spoonful of some kind of mystery squash and pork puree -- it was one of tastiest spoonfuls of anything I have ever driven down the ole throat hole. That's how you start a meal. For an entree I had the Steak and Eggs -- the steak was perfectly cooked and the mushroom salad on top was spectacular. Though the ravioli with an egg inside is a cool way to eat pasta and eggs, I felt that the seasoning was a little on the bland side and the pasta was a little undercooked. My girlfriend had the Pork Confit -- this was amazing. The pork was perfectly seared, was extremely flavorful, and the risotto beneath it was hands-down the best risotto I have ever eaten. Really I can't imagine rice ever tasting better than that cheesy concoction. The cornbread desert was out of this world -- homemade thick (but still spongy) cornbread served with fresh blackberry jam and olive oil ice cream. OLIVE. OIL. ICE CREAM. What!? It was in the top 5 ice creams I have ever tried, and I consider myself a connoisseur. Really good. Also they have fried Buffalo Sweetbreads with a really, really, good house-made ranch sauce. Word. Booze-wise the drinks were good but not quite on par with some of my favorite mixology-crazy joints in Chicago (cough, cough, Violet Hour, cough). For a place that specializes in whiskey I was hoping for a little more extensive whiskey drink menu, and less on the sweet side. I like to feel Charles Bronson manly when I'm downing my whiskey, and I didn't get that with the drinks here. The 3 dollar whiskey shots certainly took care of that though.
