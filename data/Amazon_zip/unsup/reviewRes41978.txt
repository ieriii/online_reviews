After searching for a great place to take my boyfriend for his Birthday dinner, I was SO disappointed with my fellow Yelpers recommendations to go here. We did go downstairs to Curio for a drink beforehand and it did not at all live up to the hype. The drinks were severely overpriced (which I expected and was OK with since it was a special occasion), but I was at least hoping for an awesome drink. That was not the case. I could have made one just as good with vodka and sprite at home, as long as I filled it to the brim with ice first. We got the steak tartar for an appetizer which was actually really good... but again for $20 for an appetizer, I'd expect it to be. I got one of the pasta dishes and my boyfriend got the sausage dinner (odd choice but it was good). The food was good, but for the price, it should be REALLY GOOD. The service was bizarre. Our waiter was so weird. He forgot what we ordered for an app. Then I told him it was my boyfriend's Birthday... and at the end of the dinner he didn't even offer dessert, brought the bill and barely said a word. For a swanky, expensive restaurant downtown that costs as much as our January heating bill, I expect WAY more. See ya never, Gilt Bar.
