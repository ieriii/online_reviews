My wife and I stayed at the James hotel to celebrate our anniversary. All the hype is true. The service was phenomenal, the hotel room was beautiful, the view was magnificent, and the room service was delicious. I arranged ahead of time for my wife to receive an in-room deep tissue massage from an on-site massage therapist. The massage therapist arrived on time, was incredibly personable and polite, and had my wife glowing by the end of the massage. This was an excellent point-earner. My wife and I are also a bit crazy when it comes to room temperature. We like it cold. So when we got into the room and it was at 72*F we were a bit uncomfortable. But you get complete control of the temperature. We were able to put on the air conditioning in the middle of January and get it to the 65*F we like. We were tickled. I have seen in many of the reviews that everyone raves about the beds. If you were reading this review to hear otherwise, you are out of luck. My wife and I have a terrible time sleeping in any bed besides our own, but after a long day of shopping and shows, we fell asleep quickly and easily. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and comforter soft and warm. I have never slept in another unfamiliar bed so easily. The room was cleaned twice a day as well. This was an excellent treat. We would leave to go shopping and come back to an immaculate room once again. Finally, there is a Trader Joe's right across the street. So if you ever feel the need to get groceries it could not be more convenient. All in all it was a majestic stay.
