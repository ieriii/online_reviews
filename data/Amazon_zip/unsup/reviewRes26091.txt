I've been here a couple of times now and am finally getting around to reviewing it. My first impression is that is a fine place. Aesthetically speaking there's nothing phenomenal about it. It's a quaint exposed brick pizza / sports bar. We ordered salad, hot wings, garlic bread and a few different pan pizzas. I can't say I have anything bad to say about the food, accommodations or service, however nothing really jumped out as fantastic. The wings were by far the best thing I ate there. The pizza was far from unique and lacking in bold flavor. I was drawn to add several condiments to each slice to bring out the flavor a bit. Not bad just not great. I'd go back if a group decided on the place but I can't see myself choosing this place for myself. Again, I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 because I realize how wide the range of pizza appreciation spans.
