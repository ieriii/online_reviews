Though off the beaten track, this IS the place to go for very authentic Chinese food (tending on the spicy side -- which is good by me). Probably the best dishes are the "soups" or actually broth-based Chinese-style fondu, where you boil various meats and vegetables in broths and suaces. Lots to eat at very reasonable prices.
