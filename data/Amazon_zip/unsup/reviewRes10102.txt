My first intro to Piece a couple of months ago was via delivery. We ordered a red thin crust sausage and cheese. It was very good, but I knew I would have to have an actual in restaurant experience. Decided to stop in a couple of weeks ago as I was in the area. It was crowded as hell in this joint! My party of 3 was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait..we were seated in 5 mins. We ordered a red thin cheese and pepperoni which was very good. They have a very good beer selection as I went with the camel's toe (for obvious reasons...lol) which was a pretty good beer. Sad I am just now checking this joint out as I once lived nearby. Good stuff here and will pay more visits.
