Absolutely amazing experience. The service can be a little bit slow but only because the food is that good and the waiters and waitresses are that friendly. Really have no complaints. I would suggest ordering Messob for two (or more people) and going nuts with all the options - Lamb, Shrimp, Chicken, Veggies (especially beet root). I will be going back shortly...
