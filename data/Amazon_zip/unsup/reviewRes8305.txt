This place came very highly recommended from several people. I went there with my wife on a nice summer night and ate outside. We were placed next to a table in the corner with two people that were evidently "VIPs", and the owner came out and spent a lot of time talking to them. It seemed that the waitstaff stayed out of the way because of it, so our service was initially not very attentive. The server (who turned out to be the daughter of the owner) made up for it later. She was very friendly and helpful. Nice recovery! She made some great recommendations on wine, as well as on italian beer that I was unfamiliar with. Food was ok. I had the "Zucchine Alla Scapece" for an appetizer. I didn't expect it to be cold, which was a bit disappointing, but it was very tasty. The pizza was probably below average for a coal/wood fired oven pizza in the city. The toppings were fresh and excellent, but the crust had way too much chew, and there was so much char on the bottom that it was overly bitter. I never went inside, so I can't comment on the cleanliness. Prices were high for what you get. I likely won't be returning. We may have just been there on a bad night, and if their prices were more reasonable I'd probably give it another shot, but there are a lot of other options for coal/wood fired pizza in the city at a much more reasonable price.
