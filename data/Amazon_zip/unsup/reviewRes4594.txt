Amazing! Food highlight of our Chicago trip. We were looking for a place to eat on Sunday night and this place came highly recommended on our Lonely Planet Guide.  It's literally hidden, tucked away beside Nordstrom's huge building on North Michigan Ave's Magnificent Mile. I literally walked right past, retraced my steps and found it. Tip: If you see Michael Jordans Steakhouse on Michigan, skip that place and look directly across the street and you'll find the Purple Pig. Popped in shortly after 6:00, left my name with the host table, then cheated a bit:. Rather than stick around at the bar, I walked back to our hotel @ 10 mins away to pick up my wife.  We both arrived just before 7:00 and they seated us right away at a patio table.  Food was awesomely different. Beets with goat cheese and pistachios was amazing. Greek salad very nice. Pigs ears, an unusual choice, very nicely complimented by a loosely cooked fried egg that our server recommended to stir into the crispy bits. Very interesting taste, I'd describe as a chewy pork crackling for my British friends. Milk-braised pork shoulder to die for. Very simple dish, super tender, nice use of (mild) spice.  Turkey leg confit: amazing taste, HUGE portion. Overall very nice! Not super-pricey, either. Left completely stuffed, bottle of nice Valpolicela, desserts, meal for two and total bill was $120 + tip.
