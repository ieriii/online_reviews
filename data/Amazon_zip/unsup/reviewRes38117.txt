One of the best beer selections in the city, if not THE best, especially when it comes to Belgian beers. There are around forty beers on tap, a select grouping of wine and mead, and a litany of bottled beers split into three sections: Belgium, North America, and Europe. The food is surprisingly good as long as you enjoy heavy, generally meat or cheese centered, comfort foods (which I often do). My only complaint is that it can get rather crowded on Friday and Saturday nights (a testament to their popularity). So if you want a table, get there early or visit during off-peak hours.
