love this place! i always look forward to coming here. i've only been for breakfast and desperately need to try their lunch. i haven't had anything that i didn't like. the inside is warm and cozy and everyone is friendly. i couldn't believe how reasonably priced it was. i can always count on great food, whether it's a large breakfast or a croissant on the go. delicious!
