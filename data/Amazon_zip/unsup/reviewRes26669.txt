First of all, I went in there STARVING. There was absolutely nowhere to sit or even stand really. I think the place was just packed and people were willing to wait it out, and after I had the pizza I knew why. It was outstanding. I don't usually like deep dish because the crust can be disgusting on the inside, but this deep dish was perfectly cooked all the way through. The thin crust was just as good. I have seen people complain about the appetizers, but how can you bitch about fried vegetables and ranch dressing? Even the garlic cheese bread was awesome. 8 of us shared three pies, two app. platters, two orders of bread, and at least 4 pitchers of beer. The total with tax came out to around $18 a person. AMAZING PRICE. The service was great, once we were seated after a 45 minute wait- brilliantly the staff suggests ordering your pizza while you wait so that it will be ready when you get your table. I am already planning when to return.
