Maybe I went here on a bad night, but I thought this was one of the most overrated and over-hyped restaurants in Chicago. The meat was okay, but nothing to write home about. My favorite parts of the meal were actually the salad bar and the drinks.  Maybe I had the wrong mentality when I went in this place. I don't normally go into restaurants with the assumption that I will be bursting at the seams when I leave. I wasn't bursting, so maybe that is why I felt like I had been ripped off.  I have spent 50 dollars a person on a meal before, but usually when I do, I actually expect to receive really good food. I think that this restaurant probably best illustrates the quality vs. quantity debate. In my mind, the former should never be forgotten in pursuit of the latter.
