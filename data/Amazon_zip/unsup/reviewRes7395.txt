A few weeks later, I got a nice surprise in the mail from the chef/owner himself thanking us for visiting the restaurant and a discount for our next visit there. I don't think I've ever gotten a handwritten thank you note from the chef/owner so I'm a HUGE fan of this place! I would have gone back even without the incentive, but this restaurant is on my favorites list for the food, atmosphere, and the personal touch made by the chef/owner.
