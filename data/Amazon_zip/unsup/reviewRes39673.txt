Maybe if I was still the drinker I was 5 years ago, I'd be falling over myself to rave about this place. But, I'm not 21 anymore, and I left my plaid shirt and skinny jeans at home, so I can't love it as much as some others. The space is very nice. It's packing in SUPER close for seating, but I guess that's necessary to try to keep the wait down. However, it does make for your conversation to be your neighbors as well, and if you like to sit more than 2 inches for the table, you're going to bump the person behind you. The service was really very good. Probably the best aspect of L&E. The burger was good. And the mountain of fries was much appreciated. The pork belly something-something was obviously not terribly memorable, and left me feeling very ambivalent toward their entrees.
