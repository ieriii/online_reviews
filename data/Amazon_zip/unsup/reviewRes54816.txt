One of the greatest beer selections on Chicago's north side. Seriously, you can have as much fun trying the beer as you will trying to walk home after. And they're cheap! Okay, maybe not cheap, but they are well priced. So, beer good.Food good too! Actually, they have great food. I recommend starting with some appetizers because they are tasty, and you don't want to mess with your drinking schedule.Downside - the service. It can be slow, especially when they get crowded. And they do get crowded on the weekends. But get there earlyish and you'll get a table. After that, who cares, you're drinking beer!
