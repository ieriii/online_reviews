First, this place serves delish food! Second, it is cash only so make sure your friend has cash and you have only credit cards to get a free din like I did. (smile) This is a great place for vegetarians and vegans. Tons o' options! My friend and I split a cheese empanada to start. Yum. I can't remember what my friend had (and enjoyed) because I was way too absorbed in my chile relleno. We both "upgraded" to the costa rican rice. It is like a dollar more so go for it. The garnish-y food is all good as well: fried plantains, cucumber, beets, radishes. Oh, for the chips and salsa free starter, the salsa is super spicy! I love the spice and caution those who don't take spicy food too well or too often. It is really spicy. I know for next time that this place is BYOB with no corkage fee. (Most excellent.)
