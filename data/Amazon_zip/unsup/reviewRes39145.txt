Went there tonight for my first time and was genuinely impressed. Service was spot-on and the drinks were near perfection. We started with the bone marrow appetizer which was absolutely perfect. Then moved onto entrees - I had the jumbo prawns and tilefish while my girlfriend had the pork belly on butternut risotto and squash. Her meal was an absolute 10 - perfect in every way and possibly the best entree I've ever had. My meal, on the other hand, was pretty flawed. My prawns tasted frozen in the worst way - nearly plastic. The fish had a great, crispy skin but didn't have much flavor and couldn't make up for the prawns. I will absolutely go back and would recommend this place to anyone. That being said, don't order the prawns.
