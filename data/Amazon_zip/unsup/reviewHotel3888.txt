What.A.Shit.Hole. Note to self: Make sure you reserve your own hotel on trips! I don't know if this place was "haunted", but it was disturbingly disgusting. The rooms are dark, dingy, smelly and just plain gross. The beds give you the creeps because of the recent bed bugs out break. I literally changed clothes in this room and that was it. I actually slept at a friends neighboring hotel. The service was also sub-par. Just an all around epic failure! Oh, and who doesn't have free wi-fi in a hotel???
