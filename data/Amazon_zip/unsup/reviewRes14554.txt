A hidden gem. I found free parking on Wolcott. When we arrived, the server asked us if we had reservations. We were the only ones there surrounded by empty tables. Well, it was Tuesday and it was all-u-can-eat Alaskan King Crab Legs. Not intersted in this particular deal, we wanted the Best Catch of the Day but theyt only offered trout and catfish. I'm pretty sure those two choices would have been delicious, but we didn't take the bait. So my brother chose the Scottish Salmon and I opted for the Seafood Bisque Fettuccine. The salmon looked like it was at least 3 in thick. It sat on a bed of suateed vegetables and potatoes. It was cooked perfectly. Moist on the inside. My pasta dish was chock-full of seafood. The sea scallops and shrimp were huge and plentiful. There were also bits of fresh clams. It was like having a bowl of soup and finding noodles accompanying it. Too bad we didn't have room for dessert because they featured Hoosier Mama pies. Mmm! (That's a different review.) The service was friendly. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was quaint and quirky. Glenn's diner was definitely the best catch of the day for me. I will be a repeat guest.
