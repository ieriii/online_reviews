I absolutely love the food here. It is consistently great in terms of taste and appearance. It is hard to get insanely good vegetarian dishes anywhere, but here, there's always something marvelous. I had the vegetable gratin, and the flavors were robust and tasty. I also recommend their breakfast items, such as the french toast. I had some great brunches here, not one person didn't like their food, in fact everyone raved about their own dish! Their service was good, however, every time I went they were on the busy side, but it figures since the food is yummy. The menu is on the pricey side, but it is well worth it, and plus you get free parking.Try it out! It won't disappoint.
