Let's express some thoughts about the current owner.... But beforehand, let me explain: I used to be a regular here, used to go here once, if not twice a day for years. The place has gone through different owners, and I always kept coming back because I loved the place. I refused to buy a coffee maker because I enjoyed starting the day here with my cup of Joe. I appreciated the down-to-earth, front-of-house employees, became best friends with two of them (who no longer work at the place). Sometimes the pastries were a little dry, but it didn't matter, because it always felt good to come here. For me, and for many others I knew, it was the bakery where everybody knew your name. And then the new owner. When he came on board, prices increased quite a bit, the coffee starting tasting not so good (What happened? Why does it taste burnt and bad, why?), the walls of the place were now hung with the owner's framed medals he'd received from pastry contests, framed articles about him, etc. All over the place. It's too much, really... I wish he'd check his ego at the door and take down some of those awards. And start improving the taste of the coffee. Because it doesn't taste good. It should be about the coffee, dude, not about you.   Oops, well, I was hoping to say that in a nicer way, in case he reads his Yelp reviews, because I still have hope for Alliance, but I guess I can't help but be sad and frustrated about the way Alliance is now, and the way it used to be. While it was never perfect, it did used to have good-tasting coffee, employees who were super nice to me, and ambiance that wasn't decked-out in a tribute to the owner's life's accomplishments. Anyway, needless to say, I went out and bought a coffee maker.
