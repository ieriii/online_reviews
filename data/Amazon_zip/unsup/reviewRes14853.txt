The food was exceptional and the prices were reasonable. You can tell that this place is nothing short of wonderful when you have to make reservations otherwise the wait is 1-2 hours. Best of all, the night we went we ran accross Rahm Emanual. The guy was super down to earth. The service is also phenomenal. Our waitress Eileen, was super nice and gave excellent recommendations. I had the rack of lamb and I loved it. Can't wait to go back for more. Although this place is a little hidden, it is worth the trip. You will not only have a great dining experience but you might also run into some local celebrities. What more can you ask for?
