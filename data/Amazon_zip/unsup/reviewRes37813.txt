I once gave Hopleaf four stars for their great selection of beers. After eating there on Wednesday I have to upgrade that rating to a full five stars. The CB&J is one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Don't stop into Hopleaf without ordering it. Seriously. I've also had the Duck Reuben there which too is good. My previous suggestion stands however: please, PLEASE try at least one beer each time you stop in. Go out on a limb! If you are unsure, ask for a taste before you order, the folks there are really nice.
