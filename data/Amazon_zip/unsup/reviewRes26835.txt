(we totally think you're awesome) The above was written on our "experience" menu which is the 10-course tasting at Graham Elliot. While I was researching restaurants in Chicago I wanted to try, I realized I wouldn't be able to eat everywhere. I was on a few waiting lists but managed to get a reservation for Graham Elliot. The day of my reservation, I was trying to contact one of the restaurants for it seemed something had become available. But no one was answering their phone and their voice mail was full. I was distressed. I didn't know what to do. So I tweeted it. Chef Bowles told me not to come in. He rather the reservation go to someone else who really wanted to go. Well, who said I didn't really want to go? I just had 3 nights. I had to make the most of it. And after a somewhat disjointed meal at Moto, I was ready to see why people are talking about this resto. And why President Obama made it his restaurant of choice when celebrating one of his birthdays. I just hope I think they're as awesome as they think I am (cough). My dining companion wanted to do a tasting menu. I wasn't keen on the 5-course so we went with the 10-course. Our server was very enthusiastic. We admired the single diner next to us for dining alone and doing the wine pairings. How wonderful. When we got a course, she got a course. The kitchen seemed to be working well but then it got a bit tangled up at the end and it took a while for our beef to reach us. Earlier in the night, I had enjoyed hanging out at the bar. My cocktail was delicious. I didn't think the music was too loud which seemed to be the complaint about restaurant. Service was quite friendly and most of the dishes worked for me. Now would I be joining Chef Bowles again? It's hard to say. After all, I don't live in Chicago and there are a bazillion restaurants I want to try. He's just going to have to deal with that. But I do think he's awesome, too.
