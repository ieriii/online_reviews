After reciently moving to the Divsion/Damen hood I fially got to try this place. I herd great things, and they were right. I stopped by with a buddy just to grab a drink and catch up. The place was busy but we got lucky and got a few bar seats right away. The bartender was a super cute girl who was really nice and attentive, even though she was alone, and we weren't regulars. After a few sodas we felt the need to look at the menu. Since niether of us were starving we wanted something to split. Didnt have to. Our bartender pointed out the sliders and also recomended the mac and cheese, as a side. Most places want you to spend money on too much food. We each had a slider, one was an angus burger(buddy said it was good, and not over cooked), I had the crab cake slider. Totaly different than any slider I have had, and it was worth the risk. Mac was above average and not runny like other places ive tried(im a mac addict). All in all it was a good time and we stayed longer than we should have. But good beer and good grub will do that to a guy. Cant wait to find more hidden jems in the hood but so far so good.
