Been here twice and it's either a hit or miss; so I'll give you 3 stars for now Tank... The first time I was here, I wasn't that hungry, so while everyone else ordered Pho, I ordered spring rolls and a dessert. The spring rolls has some nasty tasting bean sprouts in them! It tasted like they cooked it in toilet water (though I've never licked my toilet before). The dessert was alright. The second time I was here, I was HUNGGGGGGRY. Ordered my favorite food of all time - Bun Bo Hue. I told them no coagulated pigs blood, but they put it in my bowl anyway. Not a big deal since a friend at the table ate it for me. It wasn't spicy enough, so they did bring out a huge dollop of hot chili oil for me. It was alright, I like the Bun Bo Hue at Cafe Hoang better, but it was solid and I was starving. Everyone else seems to love this place, but I'm probably biased since I grew up eating Viet food.
