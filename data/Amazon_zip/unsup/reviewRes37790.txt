I had high expectations for this place, however the deep dish from my local Pizzeria Uno's chain made by unskilled teenagers turned out to be better than Giordano's! The crust was rubbery, the sauce tasteless and thin, and the cheese tasted very low quality. Sorry, I just don't get the big deal about this place. To be fair, this review is based on one visit and maybe they were having an off day. Next time I'm in Chicago though I will stick with Lou Malnati's or Uno's.
