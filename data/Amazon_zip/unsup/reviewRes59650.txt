Notice how most all the reviews from california are 2's and 3's?Notice how most of the 4's 5's are from chicago and suburbs? While a few people from Chicago also bring in the 2's and 3's and some really horrible ones that saw a rat or cock roach. They aren't just saying that to be mean...I take it those few DO know what good mexican tastes like, and this like many others I have seen on yelp is NOT good. Is it called mexican? Sure. Is it pretty cheap? Yes... Is it *good* mexican? no way!!The more and more I look on yelp, I keep getting the feeling looking at this review, and several others, that people here just don't know what good mexican food tastes like! That or they are always drunk when they go to eat it. Now Chicago of course has some amazing food, but the taquerias I have found are less than stellar, way more "misses" than "hits". Again, just being honest.And like one person said...this would just be a run of the mill extremely average taqueria in California, possibly even going out of business.Meat has no flavor and I highly doubt that is a real carne asada cut of meat, cilantro is pretty bland, tortillas are not good. I tried out 2 of the 3 locations, 2 on west side of Ashland.Now I see why people here like Chipotle so much, with places like this. PS Chipotle is not that good either.So here is another 2.
