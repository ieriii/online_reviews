I'll admit, this was my first Ethiopian dining experience, so without a basis for comparison, I'll just let my taste buds take it from here. Taste buds? Never mind, they're still recovering from last night's extravaganza. The highlights were: the vegertarian sambussas, the split yellow, the spinach, and the doro wat. The sauce on the doro wat was excellent, reminded me of mole sauce, but with different spicing and much much hotter. And I know the bread is meant to replace utensils and scoop up the food, but it really is the bitterest stuff alive. I don't think I could stomach it by itself - the acidity would overwhelm eventually, but it complemented the food well enough. My boyfriend also tried an Ethiopian beer, which tasted an awful lot like honey water, but my South African wine was quite nice. Endless water refills were greatly appreciated.
