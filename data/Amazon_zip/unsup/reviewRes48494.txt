Dear Publican Hostesses on the night of 6/23 (one of you is named Sarah, I know that much), In our long tenure (our = fiance and me) in the food service industry, we have never EVER been told when the next booking was so that we could get out "in time." We've worked at upscale restaurants. We know how to cultivate a feeling of warm exclusivity. It would behoove both of you snots to learn. Perhaps 24 hours in advance isn't enough notice to alert you that a member of our 7 top wouldn't be coming. However, it was the time frame I was given on the phone by a much more polite woman a week earlier when I first made the reservation. Perhaps it's because we were 10 minutes late, although calling you 1/2 hour beforehand seemed like it would mitigate the piss poor attitude we got. You assured me that everything was fine. I don't know what happened really, except that we showed up, you looked me square cold in the eye and breezily uttered "The next seating is at 8:30. Your party should have *plenty* of time before giving up the table."  Screw you. Even in the lowest ice cream stores in the Midwestern burbs, employees are fired for comments that boil down to "hurry up and get out." Yet there you are like the Queen of Siam or some shit working upscale. A-frikin'-mazing. Since future-hubby loves pork so much and I have a massive hard-on for oysters, Publican hasn't been totally written off our list. If nothing else, we're kinda sad about the whole thing. Everything else is so lovely there, although I did notice a distinctly more...hipster look to the wait staff, which rarely bodes well for attitude adjustments. However, it may be time to start playing the field for other candidates a bit.  Just letting you know, so you can, like, get out in time. Ciao, A P.S. Please tell your ancillary waitstaff to not be so quick about clearing glasses with scotch in them. That's been stuck in the Man's craw a bit too.
