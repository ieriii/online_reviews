The only reason I didnt give Sunda a better review is because of the atmosphere. I went there with one other person and we were seated at a very small table at the end of the row next to the bar. The place was so crowded there wasn't enough room for people who were waiting for a table to wait at the bar, so they spilled over into the restaurant area. I didn't enjoy having dinner with people standing over us breathing down into our plates.
