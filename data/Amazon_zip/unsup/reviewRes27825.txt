Rick Bayless does it right. I visited Chicago for a mini vacay, and there was not a trace of food left on our plates. Look at the b4 and after pics I posted. Completely worth the 45 minute wait! Drink: I got the classic and the champagne margarita, and they were the perfect ratio of tequila to sweet stuff.  Appetizer: Trio Trio Trio! My favorite of the three samplings was the tuna. All three samplings were fresh, and had a unique and tasty flavor.  Entree: My friend got the: Enchiladas de Coloradito: homemde tortillas rolled around Maple Creek Farm braised pork shoulder and bacon, doused with classic mole coloradito (ancho chile, sweet spices). I took that straight from the menu. Had a little spice, and more earthy flavor.  I got the special which was lamb and 'mexican squash' cooked in parchment paper. Served with greens, a lime, and corn tortillas. I love lamb, and this was one of the most memorable lamb dishes i've ever had.  Dessert: Chocolate cake w/passion fruit ice cream. It was more like a tan looking cake & passion fruit ice cream w/chocolate drizzled on top. But who cares what it's called. The cake had a perfect contrasting not-too-sweet flavor, especially compared to the ice cream.  You can't go wrong here. i'm sure I could have closed my eyes and picked out a delicious meal. I'm jealous of those who live in Chicago and can eat here often.
