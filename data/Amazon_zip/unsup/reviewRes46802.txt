My girlfriend and I just enjoyed a meal here on Memorial Day. First, let me point out that they need to update their online menu so its in accordance with the restaurant menu. Nothing like being bummed out that their goat cheese pesto dip isn't available (beer on tap is different too). Second, why did it take 20 minutes to seat us when more than half of the dining area was empty? Strange. We'll enjoy a beer at the bar anyhoot. Lastly, our meal was good, but service was bad. Service was bad with a restaurant that was half full. Surprisingly. But the food made up for it. Our plates were on fire (heat lamp). Maybe 3.5 stars?... However, The Q7 burger is delicious and the black beans tacos were pretty good. The salad dressing is void of flavor. Needs work. We'll be back. Nothing here to die for. U.C. just needs to work on their service and menu. I think it's great that they're all about sustainability and what not. There's no need to stick your pretentious nose in the air about it though, especially with such a mediocre experience. Otherwise, a pleasant dining experience.
