I like this place very much but I've only been here twice because it's always really crowded and it's also expensive. The pizza is great and they seem to have a good revolving specials menu with new items to try, but each pizza is in the $14-$17 range (most with anything other than cheese or basil topping at the higher end). You really should allocate one pizza per person, even if you're sharing amongst a group. It's gourmet (and delicious) pizza for sure but at the same time... I have to really go out of my way to want to spend $17 per person for a (delicious) pizza. They have a cute outdoor area as well. Oh, I also have never tried an appetizer because there are about 12 of them listed and there are no descriptions, just their names in Italian. There's no way I'm stopping my waitress and making her explain to me what all 12 are (twice, probably, because I can't remember so good) before choosing.
