I have no idea if I'm rating the correct one of the 3 La Pasadita's on the street, and didn't bother going into the one with an explanation on why. We had three kinds of tacos (carne asada, barbacoa and lingua) and I found the carne asada amazing, whereas the barbacoa was somewhat bland and I didn't actually try the lingua. There may have been another flavor, but I'm pretty sure we would've ordered it. The horchata was somewhat bland, but maybe I'm just confused as to what it's supposed to taste like. The bathroom what you might expect at a place like this. I can't imagine making the trip just for the place, but it's simple, authentic tacos done well. I bet they're better after drinking...
