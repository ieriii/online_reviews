The place is beautiful and the coffee is great. I like the organic factor, especially the eggs and the fresh fruit. However, I'm not overly wowed by Nana. The menu is not very diverse, and they were out of a basic staple, oatmeal. The waiter was not sure of several things we asked him, and the OJ, while freshly-squeezed, was way overpriced. Finally, our bill was weird and hard to decipher, listing things under other names and vague in spots.
