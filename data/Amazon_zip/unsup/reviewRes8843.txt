This is the best and most authentic Persian restaurant in the Chicagoland area hands down. My family and I have been eating here for years. Everything is freshly prepared, juicy, and delicious. And they have managed to keep their prices reasonable while still serving great quality food. I've had just about everything on the menu and here are some of the dishes I would highly recommend: aash (traditional Persian soup with spinach, cilantro, lentils, and noodles) kash ke bademjoon (eggplant with mint and onions), koubideh (ground beef skewer) with dill rice, barg (marinated filet mignon), lamb shank (which absolutely melts in your mouth), joujeh (boneless chicken breast skewers), and bomieh for dessert (kind of like fried dough dipped in honey syrup). They also have some great combination plates so you can try two different things. Portions are generous. The service here may be more or less attentive at times but that is because this is a mom and pop shop, not a chain restaurant, and they do the best they can. Also, I'm really disappointed by some of the negative reviews on here because if you don't like a place, you should be able to articulate why you didn't like it and those reviewers have not. And if you look at the number of reviews they have, you can clearly tell that those are bogus reviews. I'm Persian and I know what good Persian food tastes like. If you want a delicious and authentic meal, definitely stop in for a visit.
