I decided to have a group dinner here. They made us wait almost 3 hours and then sat us all seperatly. Furthermore, while we were waiting they would not serve us drinks or anything. When we went to order they were out of half the things on the menu. Then I went to order the ravioli, which might I add is just frozen with bottle sauce, and they said that they could not seperate the apples from the onions eventhough I am allergic to the apples. Their excuse was that the onions are pre-cooked. Well is anything there cooked fresh? Apparently not. And the waiters are very rude. It was such a disappointment, I will not be going back there.
