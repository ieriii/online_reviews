I think the pizza here is fantastic. We have only tried the deep dish. We have eaten in and had it delivered. The restaurant itself is NOT fancy. Expect McDonald's style pizza. Great for families. Highly recommend. If you order the deep dish and want to eat in, I suggest ordering in advance. It takes 45 min to cook.
