XOCO brought me back to Yelp! I haven't been yelping a lot lately because time is precious and I haven't been going out much lately. I guess having a kid will change your life like that. This evening wifey, the kid and I stopped by XOCO on a whim and I find myself drawn back to Yelp to let others know what a great place this is. I can't say enough great things about Rick Bayless, his restaurants, his TV show, his cookbooks, they're all topnotch. Definitely give XOCO a try if you haven't been there yet. If you're visiting Chicago you should make it a point to dine at Frontera, Topolobampo or XOCO.
