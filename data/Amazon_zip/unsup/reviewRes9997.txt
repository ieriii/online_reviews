HI KIDS! I'm back up in the cut! Piccolo Sogno was like the Piccolo without the Sogno, if that makes sense to any of you. Things were just ok fellas. The parking was easier than a Easy-Bake Oven, so that was nice. Our waiter was pretty awesome, he was so into his job. It's like he was getting paid to serve us or something, really on top of things. So the bread and Olive Oil situation is always what i look forward to. I like to call it "THE MIXTURE". Again things were just ok. Bread was your standard bread. I was really hoping to sit in the main dining room where all the hustle & bustle was. I like eating in the packed room to soak up the atmosphere and make fun of everyone sitting around me. But my Feline & I were seated in the 2nd smaller colder dining room where we didn't have that many targets to easy drop on. I had some raviolo and my gf had the Orange Chicken with Fried Rice. Both were again just ok. I'd eat there again if i happen to be around the area attending a Volleyball Serving class or something. Or let's say if my 6 year old cousin wanted to go to the new Tractor exhibit nearby. Actually he doesn't like Tractors that much, so that last sentence would never happen. He is more of a firetruck kind of kid. He likes the horns and the hose and all jive. My cousin is a great fella. VIVO is still my favorite I-talian joint in this city we call Chicago folks.
