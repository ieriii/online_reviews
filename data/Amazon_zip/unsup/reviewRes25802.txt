Honestly, I expected much more! We had reservations and got sat right away. But then the wait began.  We waitied forever to order drinks, then we waited even longer to get the pitcher of sangria. We ordered four items immediately but the first, a cheese plate took 25 minutes to come out. We had that for roughly twenty minutes with nothing else coming. Then we got our lamb dish, two bites apiece later that was gone and we waited for more. We decided we had better order everything else at once. So we ordered a few more tapas and entrees. For the quality and quantity it was overpriced, either the server or the kitchen took way too long, I'm talking over an hour to get three out of four tapas out. the braised pork was WAY too sweet, and the apple truffle cole slaw with it tasted like wet truffled cabbaged...the lamb was pretty good, the flatbread with pork and horseradish was mediocre at best, as was everything else. Jose needs to get back in there.
