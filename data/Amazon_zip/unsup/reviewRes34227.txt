Food is ok. The mussels are great, but the pasta dishes are pretty boring. You wont get a terrible meal, but you wont be that excited either way. The service is average, and the atmosphere is obnoxious. They just try to cram as many people as possible into the uncomfortable tables. I would only go here on a weeknight.
