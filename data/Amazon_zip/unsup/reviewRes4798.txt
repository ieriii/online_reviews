This place was incredible. The feel is friendly and communal. My wife and I sat at the bar to wait for a table and we ended up meeting different people, visiting with bar tender and just ate at the bar. Everything was unique and delicious. The bar tenders are more than willing to let you sample wines to find the wine you're looking for to go with your swine. I go to Chicago a few times a year and this will be one of my regular stops when I am visiting. I highly recommend it
