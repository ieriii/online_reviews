Piece is delicious. If you have never been here, I feel sorry for you. It's a great place to go for a casual dinner, to watch a game or to enjoy some live band karaoke ... but be prepared to wait a while for a table, because everyone else already knows how great it is too. My favorite combo? A white pizza with chicken, mushroom and spinach. YUM.
