My wife found 2 hairs in her sandwich, we informed the staff and because she pulled them out of her mouth and dropped them on the floor, they basically accused us of lying about it. I would have given the place the benefit of the doubt if it was just bad service from a waiter as glen's was highly reccommended by our friends, but this was the owner that was treating us this way. We told our friends who had suggested the place to us and we all agreed to cross Glen's Diner off our lists for good! I WILL NOT BE BACK!
