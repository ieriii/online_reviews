Decent Vietnamese fare at a reasonable price.The Pho with meat balls was pretty good, just a tad bit on the greasy side.The Vietnamese pancake was just so so , Ive had much better.The bubble teas were absolutely amazing and I would go back for that reason. The place was packed but Im not sure what all the hype was about.
