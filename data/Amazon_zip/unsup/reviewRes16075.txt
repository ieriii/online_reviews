Fantastic. Colorful. Tasty. Walking into the dining room really feels like a breath of fresh air. the vaulted ceilings are so high that you could stack up Lebron, Chris Bosh, and d wade on each other's shoulders and they would still need dwight howard and at least three more seven footers to touch the ceiling or win a championship for that matter. Anyhow, the tasty variety filled menu will have your tastes buds jumping up and down, like little kids that hear the word McDonalds out of no where. The fusion of South American & Asian influenced dishes are exquisite. You will enjoy this dining experience.
