Ok, I've only been to the soft-opening, so I don't know the prices yet, but I was compelled to write this anyway. In sum total, it was THE best restaurant opening I've ever had the pleasure to be invited to. Aside from the fact that it was free (!), guests were provided with THE best lobster, crab legs, crab claws, ahi tuna, and steak I've ever had in my life!....and that's ASIDE from the fact that it was free. Oh yeah...superb wine, desserts (warm butter cake!), service, and overall ambiance as well. Did I mention that the soft opening was all you can eat? Yowzer!! I cannot wait to try this place again, with REAL money on the line. If it's even 75% as good as it was last night, it will easily surpass my expectations. Simply put, I think it may turn out to be the best that Chicago has to offer....in my humble, yet correct opinion. :DFunny aside: A guy in his late 20's was standing in the lobster line ahead of me, and flippantly said that he'd been to Mastro's in Vegas, and that it was the best restaurant he'd ever been to in his life. Of course, I promptly gave him my best yeah, whatever look of condescension. Turns out the joke was on me, since it really was that good. Look out Gibson's....there's a new sheriff in town!*Somebody mentioned the dark lighting. I'd have to agree that it is indeed a teeny tiny bit too dark, but definitely not a deal killer. It's part of the overall ambiance, although one shouldn't need a flashlight to read the menu.
