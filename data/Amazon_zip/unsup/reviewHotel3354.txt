I always laugh when people choose to stay at the cheapest hotel in a given part of a major city and then write a terrible review when it's not as nice as the other, more expensive hotels. Do you really think it's cheaper because the owner of the Essex Inn is just a really nice person who doesn't want to make as much money as everyone else? To be frank, the Essex is not terrible, nor is it fantastic. My room was clean, but small. If you require a safe place to sleep, the Essex will work. If you need much more than that, think about spending a little bit more money and finding a different hotel.
