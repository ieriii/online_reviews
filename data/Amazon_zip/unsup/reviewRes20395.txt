I like this place. My husband finds the yuppy clientele annoying, but when someplace is penned as a "gastopub", what do you expect? The food is lovely, the drinks are nice as well, though overpriced, and I've always had really nice service when I've been. Regardless of my seating arrangements. The bar, if you can find a seat, is comfortable and quick. The dining room is casual, yet you could easily take a business peer or a date here and have a first rate, quality dining experience. I also like the fact that they try to find local/regional ingredients for their dishes.
