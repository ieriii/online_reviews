I really enjoyed my meal here. Perhaps some of it was due to the company I was with and part was due to the delicious food. Pretty much everything we tried was at least pretty good. Unfortunately they were out of the deviled eggs so we didn't get a chance to try it out. Among three people, we shared a half bottle of wine (slightly more than 1 glass each) and had: Fried Brussel Sprouts: Tasty and somewhat crunchy sprout leaves. Pretty good but it definitely didn't blow me away. I don't think this is a very good place to go if you want to fill up on veges. Roasted Bone Marrow: Man I love me some bone marrow. This did not disappoint. Spread it on the toast, add a little bit of herbs and salt and enjoy the mouth-watering party in your mouth. Octopus with green beans, potatoes, and salsa: This was actually really really delicious. The octopus pieces were fried up and the whole combination was very tasty. Pig's Ear: This was alright. It was crispy but slightly too oily for me. Kind of like eating pork rinds. Pork Liver Pate: This was some really good pate! Creamy and rich... Same as the marrow, spread it on the toast, and let your taste buds enjoy the ride. There was one other dish and I think it was some sort of pasta/vege type of dish. I recall it being just "ok". Probably why I can't remember what it was! All of that food and drink cost us about $100 and we all left feeling pleasantly full. So how was the service and atmosphere? We walked in and ended up having to wait about 20 minutes for a seat. This place is a lot smaller than I expected. They really need a larger space for this place! It's so crowded that they have a covered outside seating area with heat lamps. We were placed at the end of a communal table in the outside tent. Luckily the table was large enough that the party next to us wasn't really a distraction at all. The waiter was somewhat attentive throughout the night.
