Is there a Doug or is it just, like, the fancy French pronunciation of dog? Either way, doesn't matter. Had this Catalanian pork sausage with this cheesy sauce on top AND the Paul Kelly AND my friends and I split cheese fries. What the hell were we thinking. It was too much. But in the immortal words of Mae West, too much of a good thing can be wonderful. And in this case, it was.
