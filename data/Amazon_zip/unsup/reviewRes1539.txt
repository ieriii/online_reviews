"It is like an orgasm in your mouth!" - Quote from a guy in line...What the hell?!? I finally took the plunge and waited in line one early winter Saturday morning with my buddy. He was telling me how good the Duck Dog was (aka Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel). I was sold, but then this dude in front of us overhears the Duck Dog comment and says, "It is like an orgasm in your mouth!" No joke. I think he realized what he just said, and then it got really awkward and quiet. Even with that weird comment at my first Hot Doug's experience, I was hooked. The Duck Dog is my favorite food in the city! I have to balance it with another specialty dog...any of them will do, they are all fantastic. Eating just the Duck is so rich and delicious, you just have to have another dog. Doug is great, sometimes a little too chatty when you're freezing outside and waiting to step through the doors. But I thank him for this great place. I crave Doug's once a month, and have gone at least a dozen times since that first awkward experience! If I could only fix the waiting in line part! The best time to go is on a Tuesday/Wednesday around 11 AM. No line, just bliss.
