I love the fact that GE offers fancy food in a casual atmosphere. The servers wear brown shirts (a coincidence that that is my favorite color methinks no) with matching belt buckles and jeans. It is nice to feel relaxed when you are about to break trail on a fantastic gastronomic journey. The libations sadly were not as good as what I have experienced at the Bristol but 'Ruby Slippers' is worth trying. 'Some Like It Hot' ehhh not so much. To begin we tried the beet salad -- super yum and I don't really like the root. We had the cheddar cheese risotto -- tasty, the apples really made this interesting. For entrees my dad had the Beef Stroganoff -- that was a loin of kobe cooked to perfection. His dish was an 'A' in my book. My mom had the Colorado lamb with smoked tomatoes. She was a little disappointed in how smoky the tomatoes were -- she gave it a 'C' in comparison to the rest but I reserve the right to grade her dish at a 'B+'. I had the Pumpernickel Sturgeon. I told the server that it was the fanciest reuben I have had in my life. That's what it reminded me of...caraway seeds, sauerkraut jus. Grade: out of this world!! Skip some grades Graham Elliot, you graduated early! I loved the individual french presses for coffee complete with a sand 'minute glass' timer. Awesome experience on my gastronomic escapade!
