I'm a fan. A big one. Another lovely Yelper and I came here before going onwards to a show. I was a Sultan's virgin and, like a virgin, I had to rely on Yelper Pal to guide my gaping hole towards the perfect first experience. You are all a bunch of perverts... ANYWAY....it was delicious. I had a chicken schwarma which was not only delightful but huge (gaping hole...huge..yeah) and a beautifully flavored lentil soup. I also tried a bit of Yelper Pal's falafel. Also phenomenal. Don't know why it took me so long to go here (oh right, I live in Pilsen) but I am terribly happy I finally made it. Next time I am anywhere nearby I will be indulging myself in schawerma-y goodness.
