Of course for my first time visiting Chicago, I had to try some authentic deep dish pizza. This was a bit of a task given that I much prefer New York style (thin crust). I received a couple of recommendations to try Gino's East and I'm so glad I did.  We arrived around 5:30 on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Our server, Tracy, was excellent. She swayed us from ordering a medium pizza, promising that the small would be plenty for two people. She also advised the wait would be about 45 minutes for the pizza, in case we wanted to order an appetizer. The pizza arrived in about 30 minutes & was AMAZING! I've never had deep dish pizza with such crispy crust.  The ambience in Gino's East is also very unique. You can leave your mark on the walls in white out or marker, which is very cool. I would definitely recommend Gino's East for any tourist looking for an authentic deep dish pizza. I've only been back from Chicago for 3 days and I'm already craving the pizza again!
