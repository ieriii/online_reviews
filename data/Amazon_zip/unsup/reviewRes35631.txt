I really wanted to like this pace some more because the food was so good but the service was still so lousy that I couldn't stand it. My friend's family always comes here as a holiday tradition-they get the roast duck, asparagus and the oysters as well as their individual meals. I got the duck/pork combo plate which was still good but we waited for the whole duck, and waited...and waited we had to track down our waiter who gave the excuse that they had run out of duck and was waiting on it to be ready. He held back the oysters because he thought we wanted that with the duck. I guess that made sense but he didn't even tell us of course unless confronted and then gave us a pretty lame excuse. The duck eventually did come out and it was chopped right in front of us with all the accouterments and we went through it all aaaaannd no oysters. We waited about another 10 minutes for that to come out-so his waiting for all the food to be ready to be lame excuse turned out to a lame lie. I don't think the food here is worth all the BS.
