I've dined here many times and only once did I have a problem with services when I was pregnant and hungry (no water, barely served, waiter with poor attitude). Aside from this, I rarely leave disappointed with the friendly services, food, or too long of a wait. We like a variety of their vegan meals such as the Philly Steak sandwich, veggie meatloaf with gravy, amongst other selections. My family love it, including the cookie dough shakes, which I'm craving right now. Then if you get their early enough, they have parking along the side of the restaurant. Other wise, be expected to pay the meters and look for street parking.
