This is a solid breakfast/brunch spot. I will admit, the first time I walked in I was not convinced. I walked in, saw the line, the decorations, the food, and walked out saying, "Ummm, no." We returned to try Yolk out last weekend because the Bongo Room closed at 2pm... I could have sworn it used to be 3pm... We like to sleep off our Saturday morning hangovers, ya know. Environment At 2pm this place had no wait, which was refreshing... I expected it to be packed, not the case. On second review the decoration and atmosphere is pretty nice. Modern, yet relaxed. Very clean and bright. Our server was top notch, albeit a little coffee-refill happy. (I later wish I let him fill my coffee more, that bitch was $2.50!) Food My boyfriend had an omelet with fruit instead of potatoes and a side of whole grain strawberry/banana pancakes. The pancakes were really, really good. I assume they were healthier then regular pancakes, but who knows... They were damn good. The omelet was good as was the fruit. I have a huge chicken walnut salad. The salad was great. It had avocado, romaine, chicken, walnuts, mango with a raspberry dressing. No cheese though... I guess it's more healthy that way. Drinks So, generally, I am opposed to paying insane amounts of money for juice. (See review of Orange.) The 6 ounces of fresh squeezed strawberry orange juice was heavenly... for a mere $3! It was worth it. The coffee is waaaay to expensive, and just okay... who knows what brand it was. Overall, I liked this place for its brunch options. Its a nice change of pace and not much more expensive then some of my other favorites breakfast/brunch spots. PS - apparently Urlacher eats here, maybe you can try to tackle him...
