The service at Bongo Room is excellent. The food? Mediocre and overpriced. I got pumpkin spice pancakes and the only thing that I could think of was "man, Golden Nugget's are better." Anyways, the atmosphere of Bongo Room is pretty cool, and literally, since it's in the middle of Hipster Central, you can just sit there, indefinitely, and drink coffee just chilling out.
