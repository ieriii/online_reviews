I know the best people. Why? because they tell me about things such as the soft opening of Sprout's F-bomb brunch aka kid-free zone. My first visit and definitely in my back pocket for a future visit. The curry shrimp and grits was my selection of choice. I loved it! you can definitely taste the curry so keep that in mind if you're not a fan. I also sipped on the spiked lemonade and I must say that while it was not a combo I would have ever put together myself (truffle syrup mixed in) it definitely worked. We were seated in what reminds me of a plant atrium. It was a very rainy day so the rain on the roof was kind of calming (or was that the spiked lemonade?). Staff was pleasant and I was happy to see that Sprout didn't completely book the brunch and overwhelm them. Sprout seems to be the kind of place that puts thought into the menu items and the end product is successful. This, my friends, is not simply hype...it's good food. And in case you missed it this brunch is also sans kiddies. You raging stroller-diaper bag-carseat-tickle-me-Elmo hating psychos can rejoice ;)
