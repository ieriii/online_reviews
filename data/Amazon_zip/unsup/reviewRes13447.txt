I went for brunch (the stuff on the walls isn't available at brunch) and had lake trout and potato hash with poached eggs. Unbelievably good! It was an explosion of all kinds of interesting flavors. The fish was incredible and the eggs were perfect. The service was great. The location is super accessible. The atmosphere was lively. It was very crowded, definitely a popular spot! I feel weird rating a "mere" diner with 5 stars but I just can't imagine what they could have done better. They're worth it! I look forward to going back there often for lunch since it is a block from my office.
