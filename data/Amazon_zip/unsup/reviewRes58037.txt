Our party of four visited Chinatown-Chicago on Labor Day, 2012, and choose to dine at Lao Sze Chuan based on reviews of best Chinese in Chicago.    BAD DECISION !!!!We waited for a table for 45 minutes, were seated and waited another 10 minutes for a waiter to come and take our drink orders. Then another 10 minutes before he came back with the drinks, and took our dinner orders. He was not hospitable at all and seemed to be irritated with questions about menu items. It was then another 20 minutes before any appetizers and soup were brought to (and tossed on) the table. When the main dishes began to appear two of us in the party were served, one of the appetizers finally came out for another in the party and the fourth person (my wife) had to wait another 20 minutes before her main dish was served....and then only after I questioned another waiter where her dinner was. The food was lukewarm and not very good - a major disappointment for all of us on our maiden voyage to Chinatown. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who desires a decent Chinese dinner. Our local Chinese restaurant beats this establishment hands down, and is a lot less expensive.  AND, on this 90 degree day, where we were seated on the second floor, there was no air conditioning or fans. NOT a pleasant experience at all!!!
