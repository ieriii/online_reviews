Piece is a great location for good pizza. They offer plenty of options for pizza - red or white sauce and many toppings including mashed potatoes and clams. Yes, mashed potatoes and clams... although I haven't been adventurous to try either on my pizza. Piece also makes a pretty good salad. If you are going with a group, their large salad is big enough for 4-5 people and are pretty tasty! We had the mixed salad and it had tomato, cucumber, onion, and walnuts with the lettuce.  A nice start before starting on the pizza. We ordered a large red, green pepper, spinach and mushroom pizza. The pizza's are quite large and between the 4 of us we still left with a couple of pieces. This was honestly the greenest pizza I've ever eaten and it was delicious! Piece has a good beer selection. They have plenty of craft beers with different tastes and flavors for you to try. I've had a different beer each visit. The only downsides about Piece is the typical wait for a table at popular dinner times on the weekends (we went at 7 on a Friday night) and the noise in the restaurant. It's pretty difficult at times to maintain a conversation as the vaulted ceilings just echo the noise. Combine that with a full restaurant with loud rock music and then you have to shout to hear somebody talk. Despite this, the pizza is the star of the night and having to talk louder for a bit is well worth it.
