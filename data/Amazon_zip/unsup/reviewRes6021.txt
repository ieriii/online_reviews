This place serves large portions of normal food. There's a good variety of meat dishes so it's easy to find something for everyone as long as no one's vegetarian. I didn't really see too many vegetarian items on the menu though I'm sure they exist. The chopped salad was the best dish of the night. Lots of ingredients in a very tasty dressing. The prime rib, macadamia-crusted halibut, and burger were all decent. My cedar plank salmon subpar, overcooked and dry. This was disappointing considering how eager I was to try something from their wood-burning oven. We split an apple pie for dessert. It was the second best thing of the night, and large enough for the four of us to share. Prices are decent and servers are friendly. I recommend making reservations as it can get very crowded!
