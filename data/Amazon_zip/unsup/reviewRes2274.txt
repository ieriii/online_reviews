I have now taken over 20 out of town people here and they just love the place. Retro feel and a menu board that I get excited for every time I visit. I think the bacon sausage is the best I have tried thus far, however the corn dog is also the best I have had in the city. They changed the cheese sauce for a bit so those fries were off, but they are back to the original blend. Doug reminds me of Elvis Costello and is king and genuine in the way where you wish you could hang out with him in an everyday setting... and without feeling guilty for making the 50 people behind you wait a minute longer.
