I was just here for the first time last Saturday following a great dinner at Mado just a few blocks over. I was worried that we would have to wait for a seat, but after standing inside the first set of curtains, the host told us it would be about at ten minute wait for a table. I really like the "old-fashioned" feel of the place from the seating to the cocktails to the music. The only downside to this place is that it is really difficult to read the menu with the extremely dim lighting. I was tempted to break out my keychain flashlight, but ended up swiping another candle from the next table instead. The host also seated us in an area that was right next to another couple's table, which was okay for us, but the closeness of my friend to the other couple's girlfriend clearly made them a little uncomfortable. I had the Pimm's Cup, which was our server's favorite and my new fave drink as well. My friends' drinks were all well mixed and really good without any indication of being watered down or lacking enough alcohol. This is a great post-dinner place and definitely romantic for anyone who likes that kind of thing =)
