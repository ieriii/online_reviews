This is one of my favorite places to eat pizza. You'll be shocked how good a burnt crust tastes. We order the double pepperoni, deep disk.  I would stay away from too many vegetables at this place. They fight the essence of the pizza. If you love pizza and have tried lots of different pizza Pequod's will be a nice treat for you. I love the name too.
