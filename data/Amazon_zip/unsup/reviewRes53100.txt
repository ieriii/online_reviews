90 Miles is amazing! The food is fantastic and the ambiance just adds more of that feeling you're on vacation somewhere. If you've never had Cuban food then 90 Miles is the place...you receive incredible service and food without breaking the bank but feeling as though you're at a top of the line restaurant. I can't get enough of this place, so it's become a habit that I stop there every week. If you haven't had it...you're missing out so you need to make a trip to 90 Miles! Simply delicious ~
