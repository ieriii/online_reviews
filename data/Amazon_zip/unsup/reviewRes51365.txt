Health nazi's can sit this one out. For the rest of us who enjoy a guilt free serving of old fashioned "greasy spoon" cookery, I hope you brought your appetite.  Nothing fancy about the food here. Its just uncomplicated and satisfying Mexican diner food that just happens to come in big portions. How big? My girlfriend and I usually eat half for lunch, then doggy-bag it and eat half for supper. Nothing fancy about the atmosphere either. Unpretentious, bustling, sometimes loud, but cozy in the manner of family restaraunts of old. The staff seem happy to see you, which is always a plus. Last, but not least, is the price point. Beer for two, meal for two (which lasted two meals each!), plus tip came out to about 14 or $15... or half the cost of an entre at De La Costa. [smirk] Garcia's loses 1 star for using fake quacamole, which is shamefull for a Mexican restaraunt.
