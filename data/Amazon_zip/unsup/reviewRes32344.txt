The decor at Sunda is let's say intriguing. I enjoyed the food and the variety of 'spins' they offered on Asian dishes. One of the friends in our party had gluten free dietary needs and they offered dishes to accommodate. We ordered a large variety of entres and apps to share family style so I was able to try quite a variety of dishes. I will say I like 8 out of 10 that we ordered.  I would probably go back in this lifetime, but I don't think Sunda is as great as the hype would suggest.
