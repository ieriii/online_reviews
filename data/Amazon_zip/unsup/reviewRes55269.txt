If you want to impress a date and make your money worth while AND you love STEAK. FOGO de CHAO is the spot baby. This is the best steak house in town with a Brazilian concept which I prefer since you could taste variety of Steaks. I have been here numerous times. WARNING! Do not bring a Vegan here; they will be traumatized.
