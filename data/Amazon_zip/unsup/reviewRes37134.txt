Really enjoy this market even though the premium priced products are beyond my budget for everyday cooking. I have been to their cafe for brunch a number of times over the years, and recently stopped by to discover their brown box "to go" options. A tasty bagel egg/bacon sandwich was available in this format for $5.99 - not a bad deal in this area.
