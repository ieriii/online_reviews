Food was good. Service not so much. We had great cocktails (I had "The Boulevardier." Can't remember the name of my wife's drink but it was good too.) We sat outside and shared a few things and I think the server wasn't that pleased and made it evident. Screw him. It was very early on a weeknight and there were only two other couples on the chilly patio. We had a cheese plate, the rabbit small plate, some braised pork shank special, and several drinks. Everything was great, especially the pork shank which was phenomenal. One of the bus boys kept handling his long hair and one long curly black hair floated over and landed on our cheese plate. Awesome. I also found a hair in my drink, albeit of a different type. We were sitting outside and it was breezy, so stuff happens, but it was gross. And service personnel shouldn't handle their hair. Also, there were other annoying things. People kept trying to take our plates away when there was food still on there. They kept saying "take your time," but then they'd do it the next course. I get it, you're trying to hustle us out. I've been a server for fourteen years. It was irritating. Another cardinal sin, the server took FOREVER to serve our drinks. You want to keep people happy? Keep a drink in front of them. We were halfway through the entree before my wife's beer showed up. I'm giving more stars than our experience warranted because the food and beverage menu looked great, the food we had was delicious, and I loved the decor. Maybe our waiter was grouchy that night or whatever. If I lived close, I'd give it another shot. But it goes to show that most of the time, you only get one chance. Tell the bus boy to leave his hair alone.
