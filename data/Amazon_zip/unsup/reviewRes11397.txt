The pizza with white sauce is amazing here!! Def one of the best thin pizzas i've ever had. I am def recommending their white garlic sauce pizza!!! I didn't get a chance to try their beer though....sad.....I guess it gives me another excuse to come here again and eat their pizza = ) But the service sucks.....
