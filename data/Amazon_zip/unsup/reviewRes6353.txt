After leaving Chicago, I miss Wildfire the most (out of all franchises). Wildfire has dependable menu and service. We first went to Wildfire to celebrate a special occasion and have been back since. Like all Lettuce restaurants, expect a full breadbasket. Like all Lettuce restaurants, expect great service. If you receive less than great service, someone should know. I take family and friends to Wildfire because I know what to expect and everyone leaves happy and full.
