During my visited in ChiGO Friend of mine took me to this restaurant The location is good, is in Greektown, so I guess that's why a Greek restaurant. lol They're 2 Greek restaurants next to each other, the other one just behind the Greek Islands, but my friend told me this one is better, so we going for the food, the other one look more nicer inside, but we not eating nicer, we are there for the food, so we picked the Greek Islands. First impression when I walked in, actually I never been to Greece before, but inside this restaurant I felt like I am in Greece, just the set up makes me felt that way It was on week night, the place don't seem to be too busy, that was around 8pm Soonest we sat down, a waiter stopped by asked what we like to drink, we ordered and he walked away, 20 second later, another waiter stopped by asked us the same question "what we would like to drink", we told them we already ordered. For the appetizer I ordered the Shrimp Tourkolimano, and the entree I ordered the Lamb The Shrimp was really good, specially the sauce, use the bread and deep into the sauce. Hm......yum yum. lol The Lamb is huge, I can't even finish it, and I eat a lot, so make sure when you place your order, maybe you should think of "sharing" Service is really good, here, my glass never once gone empty and if you read my other reviews, that's always upset me when the server don't take care of their own table Actually the server here was so good keeping my glass of water full, I actually once felt bad for him thinking "Oh boy, I'm drinking my water now, and he have to fill it up again for the 10 times" lol Overall, great experience, if you travel to Chicago and feel like want to try something different, I suggest you give them a try One more thing I would like share with you all, while we were waiting for our food, I believe is the owner of the restaurant stopped by our table and checked on us, which I think is great and very unusual, make me (as a customer) feel special that he do care for his customers Also, this is a huge place, they divided different sections and rooms, I think it will be great for a large parties I wonder if you book a party here, they will allow you to throw your plates on the floor after you finish, that will be cool. lol
