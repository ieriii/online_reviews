Very fun hotel. The room was incredibly comfortable and the service was exceptional. The balcony was a nice touch - I was able to look out over the touristy restaurants west of State. Bed was incredibly comfortable and the rain shower was a fun little addition. The morning breakfast that is (sort of) included along with the room is great as long as you have time. I wish they would provide more of a "to-go" menu for those on the go. I wasn't able to try the breakfast as a result. Overall, a great experience.
