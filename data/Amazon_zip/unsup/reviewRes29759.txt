Great spot. Breakfast especially. Onnacounta their BACON. Thick applewood bacon. I think, at times I've requested it well done. I have to do that more. Last time there, I indulged with a Grilled cheese with (ready?) BACON. Yup. Good times USA. However, on second thought (having just eaten there) I'm gonna hafta dock 'em a star - just because it's so expensive. I had just a basic omelet, toast, fruit deal, BACON a la carte and a cuppa jo, and it costs like 18 bones before tip.
