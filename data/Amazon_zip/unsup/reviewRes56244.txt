Four years ago my hairdresser recommended this place for a first date and I have become a regular since then. Once a month I'm in here eating Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) and lemon grass beef. The owner Tuang and his staff are incredibly attentive. The portions are perfect and I cannot stress enough how fresh the ingredients are. I enjoy the BYOB option and while they are super busy on Saturday nights the service never suffers. There is free parking at oz park which is half a block away.....I love simply it place so much I told you my secret parking spot so you can try it out. It's my favorite restaurant in Chicago.
