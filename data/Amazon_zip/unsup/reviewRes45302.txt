Service was terrible. We were there for really early dinner, and there weren't more than 10 tables seated. There were tons of servers inside, but they were more interested in having a meeting than their customers. 10 minutes to get a beer is unacceptable. It doesn't take 15 minutes to run a credit card either. Food was ok, but not the kind of food I'd wait around for.
