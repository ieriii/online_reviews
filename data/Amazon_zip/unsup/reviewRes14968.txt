Finally made it over to Revolution Brewing Co this weekend. Been wanting to for awhile mostly based on all the great Yelp reviews, which I will now contribute to. Tried the popcorn like you all suggested. I couldn't see how it would be bad, and I was right. Also tried the pulled pork pizza which was pretty good although nothing I would order again. The 2 revolution brews I tried were delicious, especially the hot shot one. Can't wait to go back.
