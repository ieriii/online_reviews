This was literally the best meal of my life (surpassing my previous best at Daniel in NYC). And yes, I literally flew to Chicago to eat here on the recommendation from my parents. I think the highlight for me was how interesting the food was. I was very anxious for each course to continue to come out so I could see what it would be. I was also a huge fan of the bite-sized nature of many of the courses- most degustations leave me feeling completely stuffed and struggling to try things. Alinea left me feeling pleasantly full, even though I got to try everything. As far as specific dishes go- I loved the black truffle explosion. I also thought the course with several different types of seafood on drift wood was well done, and I definitely couldn't get over harvesting my own table centerpiece garden during dinner. I'll leave it at that. I suppose the lowest point for me was one of the traditional lamb dishes- I just wasn't in love with it. It wasn't bad, I'm just not a huge lamb person. Seriously, if you're in Chicago, go here. If you aren't in Chicago, consider going to go Chicago so you can go here. And yes, it's expensive. But you knew that already.
