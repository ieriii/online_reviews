Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!! I've been to Ruths Chris a few times and I must say it will always be one of my favorite places to eat. The great thing about it is they serve some of the best escargot in the city, something I dont seem to find often. The fillet mignon is amazing!If you have not eaten at ruths chris, you've been missing out!!!-Anthony
