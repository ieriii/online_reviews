Don't let the aging cakes in the windows fool you, this place has the freshest deserts, the best tasting coffee, friendliest staff, and awesome free Wi-Fi. Not to mention they have a nice outside patio seating option (though Division St is Loud) and an adjacent coffee lounge indoors with lots of comfy chairs. I love Alliance!
