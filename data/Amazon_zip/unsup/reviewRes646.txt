I don't know if I can do justice to the experience (not just the food experience) that occurred the night we went, so I'm not going to try. Although, there was this one dish that I particularly want to emphasize: The second course of the evening came with a "thai distillation" that the kitchen distilled itself from lemongrass, thai chilies, and fish sauce. I caught a whiff and almost shed a tear because I could not believe just how much it smelled of home. It was the perfect encapsulation of everything beautiful about Thailand - in liquid form. A perfectly clear liquid so smooth and packed with so much memory-conjuring emotion. My fellow diner took a whiff and nodded his head urgently in agreement. If someone asked me to describe why Thailand is so amazing, I would simply hand them a shot of that distillation. It brought me home, tickled my amygdala in the brain that controls emotions and activated an undeniable homesickness that I have never experienced in food. I would strongly suggest, like other reviewers, to go with the "tasting" menu for your first time...it really is A LOT of food especially with the wine pairings. The dinner was such an experience it was worth every. single. penny.
