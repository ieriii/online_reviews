Crisp, when translated from Koren, means yay. At least, that's how I feel after each time I have a meal here.  I was so excited when I discovered Crisp since Koreans are known in Asia for their fried chicken but it's not common knowledge in this country yet. I have my brother to thank for introducing me. I started going to Crisp when it first opened and the owner was still working the counter. He truly listens to his customers because I asked him why he wasn't carrying Milkies (which happens to be one of my favourite Korean beverages). Soon after, it appeared in their beverage coolers. The others who have since joined the Crisp team are stellar and I've enjoyed getting to know them as well.I have taken a tour around their menu and I cannot get past the Seoul Sassy wings and the Buddha bowl aka bi bim bop. Every time I introduce a new friend to Crisp, they are delighted. One of my best friends from NYC came to visit me soon after I had moved here from the City and I brought him to Crisp. He said that he had tried a sauce similar when he was in Miami and has been searching for that same type of taste ever since. It was here in Chicago when he was able to do so again. This friend happens to be someone I have had hundreds of meals with and never a bad one; his high praise echoed my sentiments. I cannot say enough how much I love Crisp. Try this place. I'm serious.
