Great spot for a night out with friends as the menu and King Kong sized portions lend themselves to family style dining so don't take anyone who's going to freak if you ask to sample something from their dish! Starters: Bacon Cheddar Puppies - not bad, but think they're better sans sauce as I found it a bit overwhelming. Mains: St. Louis Style Ribs - very tender and fell right off the bone. I really like how you had the option of this style or the leaner Baby Back ribs. Pulled Pork - holy pile of meat!! You get a ton of it and its superb. All meats are accompanied by a selection of 4 sauces which is a novel idea, but I wish the meat itself had a little more flavor to stand on its own. Sides: Had the asparagus and mac and cheese which were both excellent. Orderer beware - there's really enough to feed 4 people with a side!! Drinks: I was pleasantly surprised to see two of my favorite regional breweries represented - Capitol and Founders - and went with the Capitol Supper Club which is excellent. Wine and cocktail selection was also well represented. Ambiance: Cool space, felt like I slid into a Pottery Barn dining room for a bite to eat. It is a bit loud, though, and, after being here a couple times, I would recommend trying to get a booth as it seems to cut down on some of the noise. Service: Server was super nice and was knowledgeable about the menu. Only knock was that she claimed the hush puppies were 'AMAZING', which I found unsubstantiated (see above). Overall: Having lived in Nashville for a number of years, I've eaten a fair amount of barbecue throughout the south. While I can't say Chicago q lives up to the better joints down that way, it is good enough to keep on our 'playlist' of restaurants, so we'll be back when the mood strikes for some ribs!
