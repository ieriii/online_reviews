This was my first experience with real Chicago deep dish pizza and it was seriously good. This place opened my eyes to what "good" Chicago deep dish pizza actually tastes like. I tried the Gino's East Supreme deep dish with sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers and mushrooms. The crust was crunchy with good flavor and the toppings are seriously packed on. I didn't realize how thick these Chicago deep dish pizza's are. Now I know why it takes about 45 minutes for your order to arrive, however, its worth the wait. The restaurant has got a cool vibe and you can write all over the walls. There are two floors with the restrooms upstairs. If you plan to walk around town for a while just to let you know some of the parking garage rates are about $46 for a few hours.
