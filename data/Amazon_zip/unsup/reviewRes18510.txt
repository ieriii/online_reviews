Hands down the best churros con chocolate I've ever had (beats Madrid's infamous Chocolateria)! The churros come crispy with the best cinnamon sugar and the chocolate is divine! My friend and I also shared a torta-of-the-day and it was delicious! The limonada is a little sour for my taste, but definitely worth trying. The mexican hot chocolate were delicious as well! We tasted the Aztec (chile and chocolate) and Almondrado, and both were smooth and delicious.  We went in around 4p-5p and there was no line. The service was fast and they were friendly about seating us in the right location.
