I love Graham Elliott as a chef. He's experimental and has a unique approach to everything. However, at his eponymous restaurant, he's trying a bit too hard. The food is good. It's just not GREAT, which is what one would expect for a place of this repute. I had the sweetbreads to start and the crispy pork as my main course, only to find a bit too soft in texture (I'm reluctant to blame the fat ratio). Both were brilliant concepts, just not executed the way one would hope. Even the garlic topped popcorn served table-side (no bread here) was stale, which just seems lazy. Still, there's a cool ambiance with good service, and hopefully it'll reach its huge potential once it has some time to settle down.
