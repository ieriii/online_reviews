This place is great! I love going when they have live music. The food is good and the servers have always been friendly. I like the environment. I've had several things off their menu, and it has always been good. It's not the best food I've ever had, but with the environment and staff, it's a good experience overall. I would go there for drinks and music or food and drinks.
