VERY GOOD. I always have to stop in here when I crave quality Mexican food. It's the little touches that make this place stand out- the bowl of spicy peppers and carrots they serve on the table. The soup they give you while you wait for your meal.The quality of the enchiladas is very good. The sauces are delicious. All around, a very good spot to eat. The ambiance is also very pleasant, they have carefully decorated the interior, it is NOT TACKY and it is very clean (unlike some other restaurants down the street).
