My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night. We had high expectations, and Graham Elliot did not disappoint. The garlic popcorn was great. We enjoyed a bottle of Pinot Noir with our dinner, which started with the caesar salad and risotto for appetizers, then the scallops and swordfish. Finished off with the Snickers bar. Service was very attentive, food was great.
