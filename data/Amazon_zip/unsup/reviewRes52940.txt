After watching Hungry Hound on Channel 7, I decided to check this place out. The sandwiches here are absolutely heavenly... **sends chills down my spine** I ordered the 'Guajirito' - Green plantain, steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, swiss cheese. Delicious. Reminded me alot of the Jibarito. My friend ordered the Bistec dinner - Steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, shoestring potatoes. She loved it. Everything was great but something was still bugging us.. that garlic sauce. Its was soo good that we had to ask the waiter how they made it cause neither of us could figure it out. To our disappointed he didn't know and the chef wouldn't release that secret to him either! My friend said she's gonna replicate that sauce no matter what. I would like to taste that.....
