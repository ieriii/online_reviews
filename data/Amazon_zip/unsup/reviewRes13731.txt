Being my first foray into Cuban food, I can say without reservation, I will be back. Inexpensive, hearty, and filling. Three of us shared several menu items, including a traditional cuban sandwich, avocado salad (whole avocados!!), a special of the day with spanish chorizo, a ropa vieja empenada, and some sweet plantains. We sat outside on the patio despite the looming storm (we made it out just in time). THe patio area was great, the neighborhood is fun. We were able to walk from my bestie's new digs, so I think we'll be making 90 miles a regular spot. And props for the clever name.
