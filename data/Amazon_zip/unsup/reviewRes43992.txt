I've eaten here several times for lunch, since I work nearby, and I think it's a solid special-occasion lunch spot. I'd be interested in coming for dinner, as the food is pretty good. I've had the Wild Mushroom & Gorgonzola Cheese Tart (very good), Herbed Baked Goat Cheese Salad (very good), Kinzie Burger (very good), and today the Meatloaf Sandwich (good). Everytime I go I forget that I don't like their iced tea, which has a strange, fruity flavor. Service is very good, atmosphere is nice - pretty standard steakhouse vibe. Perhaps someday I'll try dinner, and their steaks.
