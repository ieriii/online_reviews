3.5 stars. A very trendy, but pricey Mexican restaurant. The decor is really nice - this is a good place to go if you are in the mood for good Mexican food and drinks with friends. Probably more suited to a younger crowd. The food was good - I had the flank steak with rice and beans and chimmichuri sauce.  The main drawback was the price - most of the entrees here were at least $25 and ranging up to $35. A large guacamole was $15 (also good, but not great). The ceviche was decent. No complementary salsa and chips though (always perplexed when Mexican restaurants don't offer this). This place is very comparable to Frontera Grill.  Probably would have given it four stars, but the place just ran slowly. We had reservations for 8 people and didn't get seated till about 20 minutes after our arranged time. Also, our wait staff seemed to be very busy running from table to table, so dinner took forever. All in all, this took away from the overall dining experience.
