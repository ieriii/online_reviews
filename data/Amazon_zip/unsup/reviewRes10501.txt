Piece's pizza is perhaps one of the worst I've ever had. The sauce drools of the pizza and it has enough garlic to ward off a pack vampires. It was not even real garlic but powder...Yuk The place is very loud and the service is marginal. Overall the whole experience was less that satisfactory. There is not reason to have bad pizza in Chicago. So ...so long Piece Pizza...
