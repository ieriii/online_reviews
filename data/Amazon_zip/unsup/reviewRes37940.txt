This place is busy! Busy at lunch! So get there early or later. The pizza is good, but I like Lou Malnati's better. the service here is rushed and the place is perhaps a little too touristy. Despite that, it's worth a stop if you're in the neighborhood. The pizza is filling, so you will have some left over! And the place is pretty inexpensive for a family, considering Chicago prices.
