I have recently fallen in love, and it is with Artopolis. To be fair, I have only tried three things so far: the frappe, the chicken soup, and the baklava. If I never tried any other item there, I would continue to come back just for these items. It's a little pricey, which is the only reason I didn't give that last star, but to me, it's worth it. I've also found the staff there to be extremely pleasant, but perhaps that's because I've only gone in there when they are very not busy. And the dine-in area up front is one of my favorite things. I've only sat in the lower portion, but it's such an incredibly relaxing atmosphere that lets you drink in the beauty of a nice day without actually having to sit outside on the curb. I love it here.
