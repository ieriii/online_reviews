I've come here many times growing up but I just came back for the first time in a while. This is also the scene of the infamous saganaki with the lemon juice squeezed into my eye. That might be why I avoided this place for a while. It was a Saturday night and after the hubs came home from grad school, I was in the mood for Greek food. We arrived around 6pm and had to wait for about 20 minutes! Free valet is so lovely. We got a table in the bar area and had a great dinner. The avoglemono was delicious but not the best I've had. We ended up ordering the saganaki and I wasn't nailed in the eye with the lemon. Bonus. I ordered the lamb with artichokes and it was perfect and warmed me up on the cold night. The husband got his normal gyros sandwich. The service was great, not rushed and just overall a pleasant meal. I don't go to Greektown often enough but I'm definitely going to start making my rounds!
