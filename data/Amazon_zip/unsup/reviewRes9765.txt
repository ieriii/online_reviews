I love vietnamese food and I always think that is very hard to find a good example of how delicious vietnamese food can be in argyle. Thus, I was very excited when we went to Le Colonial for dinner. The ambiance is really nice and romantic and the service is great. However the food was just ok, nothing special and I dont think the price was justified. Overall it was a lovely evening, but only because of the company and the ambiance, the food should have been better!
