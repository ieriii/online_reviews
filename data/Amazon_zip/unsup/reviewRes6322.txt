We went on a Sunday afternoon and so avoided the madness that happens during the evenings - the last time we'd tried was a Friday night and there was a two hour wait. :-O We got: truffle egg toast - this was just okay, the bread was really good but the cheese overpowered the other flavors crispy pork belly - tasty and a good combination with the apple crostada but overcooked rissotto carbonara - great, though it did remind me a little of Rice-a-Roni Davanti burger - nothing amazing despite it's many toppings ricotta + honeycomb - my favorite dish! great combination. Just don't take their advice and drop the honeycomb in the ricotta, mix it on your piece of bread. =) All in all, it was a decent meal but none of the dishes wowed us and nothing else looked so appetizing that we had to come back. And my manhattan didn't have enough vermouth (that also brings up an annoyance, they have their cocktails and wine by the bottle on a giant wine bottle ... comes across as something that Chili's would do). :-|
