The Mayan Palace is your middle of the road Mexican joint. Nothing fancy, but good Mexican food. The place is set up really nice and decorated tastefully. The staff is really friendly and makes you feel welcome. The food is good and there is lots of it. It's not the best Mexican place in the world, but it's good for a nice casual meal.
