You can't speak about Greek food without mentioning this wonderful classic. It is fun to go to..lots of rooms (you think you are in another world), paintings on walls are fun to see. Bar is supurb. Gyros are the best in the city...and they are home-made. Most places buy from the one or two vendors around.  Fish is great and fresh. Waiters are a delight. It is like being at a carnivale. Tarmasalata is yummy. We always take an order home...call it Greek Lox and bread.
