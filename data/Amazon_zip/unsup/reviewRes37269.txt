Sweet potato fries - awesome, crispy and sweet. 5 stars Hot cocoa - syrupy sweet and almost undrinkable. Go get a Starbuck's signature hot chocolate instead--it's worth the extra dollar. 1 star Salmon burger - a cheat! instead of a whole piece of salmon, it's a salmon patty of mushed together salmon pieces. 2 stars Lobster club - another cheat. the lobster salad consists of mostly claw meat, which is the mushy, funny-tasting part. 2 stars
