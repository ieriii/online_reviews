Awesome approach. Really creative food and not just to be so, the quality and attention to detail you really want to see seemed to be there in pretty much everything. I tried a few bites of some of the other dishes at the table and everything seemed to be very thought out and executed well. I'm now going to let you in on the only thing you should order if nothing else at Revolution. The applewood smoked hot wings. Jesus fucking christ. Being a bit of a self proclaimed wing connoisseur, I like to think this means a lot from me but hands down best wings I've had in Chicago and prob top 3 ever, really. The beer is all really great. I didn't try any of the lighter stuff but the IPA and the "double" IPA I had were both great.  These guys are not messing around.
