This was the first stop after our flight, we didn't even stop at our hotel (but then again we did arrive around 11 and check-in wasn't until 3). The line didn't look too bad at first glance and it did move fairly steadily... we were in within 40 minutes of waiting. There were 4 of us, so we ordered the following and shared it all: From the regular menu: The Dog -- Chicago-Style Hot Dog with all the trimmings (fried) The Marty Allen -- beef, pork and garlic Duck Fat Fries From the specials menu: Antelope Sausage with Roasted Yellow Pepper Cream Sauce and Chevre du Poitou Cheese Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Black Mountain Garlic-White Wine Cheese I absolutely HATED the antelope. It was gamey and just left a really "stinky" after taste in my mouth... and the cheese?! How can you put something so gross on an already disgusting meat, ugh. Thinking about it makes me want to vomit. The duck and foie gras was soooooo good. If I had to choose one to get seconds, I'd totally choose this one. Although a little too abundant on the foie gras (but who can complain?) I totally enjoyed the savory taste of the duck. All the others were just okay... especially the Chicago dog. I was NOT impressed. I will take Nathan's from Coney Island over a Chicago dog anyday, hands down! Hot Doug's is located in a somewhat shady neighborhood, so I wouldn't feel safe walking around here late at night... although that could just be my cautious New Yorker instincts taking over. There is parking and also a bus on the corner that will take you directly to the CTA.
