I went here for Sunday brunch. Our friends really built it up as an amazing brunch experience, so I had lofty expectations going in. I had no idea what the restaurant was about and I wanted to keep it that way. Once I walked in and saw the giant pig-themed decor, I knew I was in for something special. The menu was small but intriguing. There were few interesting drink options. I went with the Publican "Mimosa", which uses a beer rather than champagne. It was a really nice change of pace and a great way to start off brunch. I ordered the sausage dish with a side of the honey-glazed bacon. I expected a giant portion, but was pleased to see that it was much more reasonable than expected. My biggest gripe about the experience would center around the service. Sitting at the cafeteria style communal table, we felt we were largely ignored by our waitress that focused more on the "pen" booths. We had to constantly flag her down to get some service and we also had issues when it was time for the bill. However, the coffee replenishing was top notch. Overall, the food was tasty and different enough from the standard brunch fare to warrant a visit. It's not TOO overpriced and the ambiance provides a unique experience. They need to work on their service a bit.
