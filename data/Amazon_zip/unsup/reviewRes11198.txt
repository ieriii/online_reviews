I've now been here on my last 4 trips to chicago. Every time, I get on the Blue line from O'Hare (stop at Damen!) and get some great pizza and better brews before heading further east to my hotel. And even though I have to lug my luggage (is that why they call it that?!?) down the platform stairs and a couple blocks, I've not yet been disappointed. The pizza is thin crust--counter to what one expects in Chitown. And that suits me just fine as I'm not a big fan of the knee-deep style (sorry Chicagoans!). Importantly, the thin crust also delivers on crispiness. While that might be expected, not all thin crust pizzas succeed in this! Now on to the beer. Yum. These guys and/or girls get it. They have about 6-7 on tap of their own as well as a broad range of styles that aren't their. If you like beer, you'll be happy at minimum. My only complaint (suggestion?) is that they offer an 'extra small' size pie. I likes me some grub, but I've yet to finish a small pie by myself. But hey, that probably doesn't matter because either a) you're in town on biz like me--thus expensing it and not worried about 'value,' b) local and thus either a1) with others who can help you kill it all or b1) solo and able to take the leftovers home. Have at it.
