This used to be my favorite restaurant ever, but has gone so far downhill, I tell everyone I know to do themselves a huge favor and stay away. Rick Bayless used to care about building a reputation and serving quality food and drinks, but it is so evident now that he cares only about making tons of money. I've taken visitors who were dying to eat at Frontera, early, before it gets busy, and late, after the crowds thin out, and the experiences have been consistently bad.The food is incredibly salty. The margarita proportions are off: where is that great older gentleman bartender? He was the only one who knew how to make a margarita and talk to customers. The bartenders there don't have the technique down, or they have switched to cheaper tequila, or something...but the drinks are not good. Ther service is impatient and rude. When you are paying $375 for Mexican food for four, is it wrong to expect a bit more? The Frontera Grill is just another overpriced tourist trap with bad food, drinks and service.
