I personally am not a fan of sushi, so I will not rate their sushi. It wouldn't be fair. Everyone at the table seemed happy with their sushi, although some commented they have had better for cheaper or the same price (and I was with a world-traveled group who were all very familiar with Chicago). Overall, I'm sure their sushi is fine and you won't be disappointed, as other yelpers have said. However, the staff was not friendly. Ok, whatever, you're a tiny place, so go for it; make or break yourself. But seriously, we had a somewhat large group coming, but it was early on a week night (and we gave PLENTY of advanced warning). Despite the warning and timing, they were queens about arranging tables. I never knew it was so hard to push three tables together and count chairs. Also, most of the menus showed water damage. They're just folded pieces of paper, so the restaurant should print out fresh copies to disperse instead of re-using old crinkled stained menus. Basically, if I'm going to drop $60+ on a meal, I'd like to have decent accommodations. I've had better service at Wendy's.
