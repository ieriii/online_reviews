I give the food a 2 and the atmosphere a 4. It's a wonderful space to dine in, and the waiter we had was very friendly and personable. I think the restaurant needs to kick the menu up a notch to match the quality of the dinning environment. I'm not saying the food was bad, but it could have had a little more...something to it. Kick? Spice? Flair? I'm not sure what the word is. I do know I'd be happy to go back for another visit to see how the place evolves.
