Food was good, but a little pricey. Bruschetta app was tasty, but disappointing, especially when they brought it out with complimentary bread... seemingly the same bread they use for the bruschetta. The dining room is nice, but seemed sparse. They seemed slightly understaffed and the service was fairly slow even though we were only one of two tables eating at the time. The owner was friendly. Would recommended if you are looking for this type of food or are looking to try something different.
