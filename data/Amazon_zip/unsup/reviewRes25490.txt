When you sit at a table at Pequod's, you're almost trembling with excitement because you know what's coming. And what's coming is the best pizza I have ever had in all my days. Ever. Best. Pizza. Sure, you can argue that NY pizza is good and it is. RI grilled pizza is freaking awesome and that's no lie. And Chicago pizza is truly spectacular. But Pequod's isn't your average Chicago pizza. It transcends all pizzas everywhere and makes them look...well...stupid. Cheesy, meaty, saucy, caramelized crust...I have a hard time even talking about it without getting mad that I'm not in Chicago right now to go get some. I'm actually glad that I don't live there because I'd eat it every damn day and then none of my clothes would fit. On our most recent trip, Mr. H and I ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra sauce. F&^$ yes. We drank some beer and watched some basketball while we waited and when our masterpiece was served, we stopped talking and just ate. It was so good, I'm a little misty-eyed as I remember it. The slices are huge and filling, so prepare yourself. Please just do yourself a favor and go. Just go.
