holy menu options - these are the kind of options i like...and then sometimes it's hard to make a decision (salty or sweet? pancakes or eggs?)...well you can get both here (with eggs they give you a choice of toast, potatoes or pancakes - upgrade to one of their signature pancakes and it's only $1.95 more) i got the daily candy announcing yolk's opening (about a year or less ago?) and i figured by it's address that it was smack dab in the loop and more for business peeps on weekdays...but now that i have been there (there is street parking nearby and a parking garage next door), i will be coming back to yolk for brunch. beyond the many breakfast options there are some good lunch options (sandwiches, salads, wraps) and come cheap dessert crepe options (nutella & banana "oh yeaaaa") for about $3.95. i ordered the traditional chicago breakfast staple - the skillet - but here's why i love this place - it was a "make your own" skillet and since i love to cook and concoct things, this made me happy. i ordered: mushrooms onions tomatoes ricotta cheese 2 eggs over-hard on top all on top of their red potatoes it was phenom. my boyf got a balsamic chicken wrap and loved it. everyone else raved about their pancakes, french toast and omelettes. it was busy as hell, food was great for brunch, service was pretty good, it was very reasonable for brunch ($15/person) and we only waited about 20 for a table - not bad for coming at 12:30 on a Sunday. ++they do take reservations for parties over 6, so that was a plus for us. ++it is also pretty large for a brunch spot - most are so tight, but this one can handle large parties easily.
