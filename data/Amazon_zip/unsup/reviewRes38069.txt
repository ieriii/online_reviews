Pizza was awesome!! I'm a St. Louis girl and a HUGE fan of St. Louis style pizza, but I have to say this pizza was fantastic!! I had a Raspberry Rush cocktail as well, and it was very good. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that our server was not nearly attentive enough and left us with nothing to drink a couple of times.
