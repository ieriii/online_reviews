I've been to Chicago sooo many times, and this was my first time to Gino's. I ordered the small cheese and sausage (loaf sausage). The guy said it would take about 45 minutes to cook. No problem! I got myself a beer and watched some sports! The small pizza is enough for two. If you haven't had the pizza and think I'm wrong, then maybe order one or two of their appetizers as well. I think a medium for two people is way to much! Anyway, got the pizza and the bartender served it on my plate. Gino's layers their pizzas with the crust first, then the cheese, fillings and tops it off with sauce. The pizza was pretty good and I love sausage, so the loaf sausage was an extra treat! lol Although the pizza tasted good, it wasn't far ahead compared to a frozen pizza. I think the two most important parts to a deep dish pizza is the dough and the sauce. I didn't think the dough had anything special to it. (I had Pequod's during my last trip and the caramelized crust was sooooo delicious!) The pizza was definitely saucy, but it could have used some additional herbs/spices. I do love deep dish! I probably won't go to a Gino's establishment again. I didn't have a horrible experience, but the deep dish didn't satisfy my deep dish craving as much as Pequod's did.  So two stars knocked off for the dough and sauce.
