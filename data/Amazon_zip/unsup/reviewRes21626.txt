Terrific iced tea. Awesome service. The best sign ever. Yummy fries. (a little soggy because everything was shoved in a little box) Superdawg was pretty good. I grew up next to a Dog n Suds... This was similar, but not the same... Lots and lots of hype for the Superdawg... I'll give it a 3 star hype, I mean, the iced tea was the first thing I remember :)
