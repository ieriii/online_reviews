I suppose I should update my review, considering I've been here more often in the past month or so than I had since it opened. While the cauliflower dish is no longer on the menu, the waiter graciously offered the chef's skills to make me a special vegan dish last night. I thought it was great, and even my non-veg companion said it was delicious! It consisted of white beans, carrots, turnips, brussels sprouts, huckleberries and (I think) mango, along with layers of herbs and spices. I've also had the salad with the lemon dressing and house potatoes made with veggie oil - yum! Some of the servers and bartenders are more outgoing than others. Make some friends at the bar, and they'll treat you well. Cheers!
