Am I eating pizza or am I eating a hunk of cheese? Okay, maybe I just don't like deep dish pizza at all. But I've tried Uno's, Gino's, Connie's, etc. and I'd have to rank Giordano's the lowest. It's impressive when you see it in front of you and you'll be impressed/shocked when it comes out the other end. Everything in between is a bad experience. It's just too much cheese with no flavor in it. If you like Giordano's, why not just buy a pie crust, throw a block of cheese in it and put it in the oven? Certainly better than spending $20+ for a small pizza. Oh, and a small doesn't serve 1-2 to two people in reality. It serves 3-4. I guess that's value in that perspective.
