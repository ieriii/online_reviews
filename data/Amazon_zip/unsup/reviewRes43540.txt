If I lived in Chicago I'd be here all the time! It almost deserves 5 stars, but it was really busy, and the waitstaff seemed kind of pissed while taking our orders.  Other than that... their smoked salmon bagel is my new favorite breakfast! Why I haven't tried this delicious combination yet, I don't know, but theirs was especially good. Complete with dill cream cheese, capers, red onions, and tomatoes, this was a bagel sandwich not to forget. Quality smoked salmon too. I really want to re-create this one at home when I get the chance.
