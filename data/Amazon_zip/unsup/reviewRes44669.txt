GREAT pizza. Such a massive pie it's incredible. Having just moved to Chicago from PA I didn't know many places but I had pizza from Giordano's my last time here. I sort of forget sizing and decided my hungry self could handle a medium. FALSE. I had two slices and I was struggling. To my East Coast friends, please know pie is literal. It is a huge pie of delicious flaky dough, sweet tomato sauce, delightfully stringy cheese, and for my hearty susage. It all combines for a great stuffed pizza. I'm new here and I know some people might say there are better places, but I'm ok with here. (for now)
