Very prompt and courteous service. This is a family joint (as noted by the description in the menu.) The restaurant is lit with lots of indirect sunlight and modestly decorated. The restrooms are large and clean. The food came promptly and was very fresh and pleasing to the eye. We ordered the lunch specials (12-3pm) which came with rice, a simple (tasty) salad, soup, eggroll, ginger tea, and fresh fruit desert. for under $10 a person. I had the pork ribs. Very well seasoned and prepared. It wasn't an insane amount of food but both of us were full and satisfied... especially when the bill came. My friend had the calamari which I tasted and it was delicious. Very tender and seasoned perfectly with a light, well balanced sauce. I highly recommend this place for their lunch specials. They also have a Tuesday and Wednesday dinner combo for two for $20. We will definitely be back very soon.
