With over 500 reviews already, I can't imagine Geja's Cafe needs my input as well, but here we go...I'm a big fan. This is a unique and romantic restaurant that is a great place for a celebration, a date, or a birthday/anniversary. Their salad is "eh," but everything else is delicious. Their cheese fondue is mild but tasty, and their chocolate fondue is so delicious. Be sure to allow at least 2 hours to eat here. Your clothes will smell like oil when you're done. However, it's worth it.
