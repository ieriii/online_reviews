6.30pm on Friday, and no wait for a table, which was a nice surprise as I was prepared for a 1-2 hour wait based on some of the reviews here. To start, the Warm Cheese Gougeres, filled with Dunbarton Blue Mornay Sauce (no, I don't have that good of a memory or love for capitalization, I'm copy-and-pasting from their website). These were fantastic: two large cheesy popovers injected with a very mild and light blue cheese sauce. As an entree, I had the venison leg, cooked to perfect medium rare, served with a fancy variety of brussels whose name I forget, a grain I'd never heard of before, and huckleberries. This doesn't appear on their online menu, which I gather is updated very frequently. I had a cocktail containing rum and tiki bitters, and a mild ale, also neither of which appear on the website's menu. The three lessons I learned from this meal are: 1. Don't have your heart set on eating something specific from the online menu. 2. Don't worry about it, because it's all amazing anyway. 3. Don't be put off by the prospect of a long wait, because you might be seated immediately.
