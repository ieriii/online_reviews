There simply is no better steak that I have found in the city of Chicago, and I have tried many. Their cowboy cut ribeye is beyond fantastic and their lobster bisque is off the charts. Everything is top notch and this includes their servers. Some of the best service you will ever receive. If you are looking for a wonderful steak dinner and you don't mind paying for it (they are not cheap), then look no further!
