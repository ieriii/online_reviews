Giordanos has a special place in my heart since it was my first deep dish pizza experience. This place has a lot of character and is a must stop for authentic Chicago style pizza. The crust is so yummy and the slices are super filling. The place can get crowded as it's a must stop for Chi-town tourists like myself but it's definitely worth the stop.
