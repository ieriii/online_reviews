I can't think of a better restaurant in Chicago.  I used to live in Logan Square, just a few blocks from this place. Now I make the trip all the way from Pilsen. For good reason. This place is hipster and serves gourmet food, but manages not to be pretentious. And the menu is full of fresh, creative dishes. At some places, you pay for a lavish ambience and extravagant dinnerware, exceedingly formal service, etc. Here, the costs aren't artificially inflated. You sit down in a smart, spare almost industrial space with exposed duct work and pay for nothing more than flat-out amazing food. Also, they have a superb drink menu. I would go there just to drink. (Man...I SHOULD go here just to drink.) And the drink prices are pretty consistent with what you'd find at a run of the mill neighborhood bar on the north side. If you haven't been, you need to go.
