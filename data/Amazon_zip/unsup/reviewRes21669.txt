OMG, Rick Bayless you are truly a cooking god. So I know you won Top Chef Masters, but after going to Xoco twice, I am convinced you make the best sandwiches, hot chocolate, and soft serve in all of Chicago (and maybe the U.S.) The Cubana torta is just amazing. I'd have to say it might be the best sandwich I've ever had. Pork, avocado, bacon, black beans, cheese, all grilled on wonderfull bread....you must try this sandwich. I've also tried the Almendrado hot chocolate and it was soo good. You can definetely taste that the chocolate is ground in-house. The churros are also great, though I have had better. My second time at Xoco I had the new vanilla soft-serve with maple-caramel-bacon topping. Wow, just wow is all I can say. I am a huge ice cream fan and this was just so creamy and smooth with a great vanilla flavor, complemented by the salty-sweet bacon caramel (though you can't really taste the bacon, it's just a great caramel topping). After all of the hype and talk of 3 hour waits for Xoco I was definetely skeptical, but let me tell you-it definetely lives up to the hype. Now I just have to try out the amazing breakfasts there....
