The new incarnation of Sun Wah is a pretty decent Hong Kong style barbecue house. However, I do miss the original Sun Wah, or rather, the food that the Argyle shop offered. For example, pea pod tips were on the menu (although not always available), and the Hong Kong pork came with almost 1/4 inch of actual fat and rind. The menu of the new location is somewhat less varied than that of the old location. In particular, the seafood selections are a little bit diminished. The Argyle shop had lobster, crab and snails, as well as various fishes, shellfish and so on. This restaurant on Broadway is quite good. The menu selections are augmented by a dozen or so daily specials. As at any barbecue house, you can order carry-out meat directly at the grilling station where it is cut to your order. Presumably the intestines, ears, kidneys and other pig parts are available there too. Service is very good, far beyond competent. The serving staff cooperate, and look after each others' tables. The manager is always walking the floor and double checking what's going on. Every now and again, the manager serves, or helps serve. When we ate there one time, our order was primarily meat, vegetables and soup (our decision). A busboy later dropped off a small bowl of rice, gratis, and right he was. A little bit of rice complemented our meal very well. How did he know? The staff --- all of the staff --- is paying attention to the customers. The dining area is relatively new. The skylight gives it nice light. The Broadway store has a larger, cleaner, brighter and less cluttered dining area than did the Argyle store. Price. Prices are very reasonable, almost inexpensive. Summary: I recommend Sun Wah on Broadway. It is a restaurant with good food and excellent service. BYOB with corkage charge.
