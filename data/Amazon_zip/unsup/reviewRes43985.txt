Very solid steak place in Chicago. Typical a-la-carte menu that you would find at most high-end steak places. Prices were what you'd expect at a high steak joint. I had the New York strip, which was cooked perfectly, and the overall taste was good. Side dishes were good as well. Small bar area is nice, and the bartenders on staff that night were very friendly and knowledgeable. Only negative think to say was the place was small, and the seating a bit cramped, but overall I would eat there again.
