I know some people reserve 5 stars for fancy restaurants, but I must say this place is awesome for a finger licking Friday night. Some might argue about the most delicious sauce...I am true to the Seoul Sassy, but my boyfriend is obsessed with the BBQ....either way - it will become an addiction. Try it for a concert in the park or Ravinia - they have a whole chicken meal for like $20. It's delicious - you will not be disappointed. At worst you will regret reading this review because it will lead to a new addiction. We knew it was bad when we had worked out for 2 hours one night and still ended up with a whole fried chicken...
