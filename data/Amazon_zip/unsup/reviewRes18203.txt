Beer, beer, beer, oh yea, and more beer. Granted, I've heard how good their burgers are, but that wasn't what was going on this night. They have a real quality draft selection right off the bat. I was having fun just looking at the different beers on draft. Granted, half acre was right down the street, but I had already done daisy cutter twice on the night and it would seem to be a shame to have some here. So, instead I had to get myself some allagash. It was as good as it always is, but the real fun was getting a saison that was a collaboration between a pennsylvania brewer and a belgian brewery. I'm not gonna even attempt to write it down as there are more i's and j's in the name than I'd care to attempt at. There was also a very good crowd here. I know this area doesn't always get really packed bars (mostly due to there being a ton of bars on lincoln), but this had a good crowd for a late thursday night. The bartenders were great as well and though the bar itself was filled, it wasn't a problem in the slightest getting a beer from the bartender. Now all I need to do is come back and eat some burgers here. With this beer list, it won't be a problem getting me to come back on repeat occasions
