I'm probably one of the few people who doesn't love this place.  I agree with others, definitely overcapacity in the main dining room. The kitchen was slow, but they were very busy that night and I would expect this to have improved by now. Pretty good food, but being a pescetarian, there were no options for me besides the cauliflower entree I got. It was okay, but kind of boring. Good beer selection and cocktails. I'd go back for drinks.
