So it was my birthday weekend and settled for Calo. A friend of mine told me about this place and raved they had really good italian food. My party got there around 9ish and had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Which was good for me because I found out they served DT( delirium tremens). God I love that stuff! Once seated, I looked over the menu and wanted so badly to try the ROTOLO DI MELANZANA but once I saw veal on the menu i shifted my focus on that dish. I ordered the VITELLO CARCIOFI which was veal medallions sauted with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tomatoes and onions in a white wine sauce. Obviously bread is given first which I think was the best part of my entire meal. That Focaccia bread was insanely good. I must of had 6 large pieces of this God given bread. Moving on with my meal, I went with the clam chowder which is what I always pick as a soup because im obsessed with it. Ever since going to Fisherman's Wharf in SF, I have been trying to find a place that could compare. But that's a whole other story. Calo was good but lacked the spice I was looking for. I asked for cayenne but gave me Tabasco instead. Made it a little better but not the taste I was going for. On to my entree, veal was overdone. Not crazy overdone but was probably left in the pan just a little longer than it should be. Artichoke hearts were good, sauce was ok but on the buttery side. At the end they had brought out a birthday tiramisu cake which was damn good. Thanks to the Calo and my friends for that one. Over all my meal was good, but i would definitely give this place another try. 3 stars seems a little low for all the great reviews I had read about this place but that's my two cents. I will come back and re-review this place.
