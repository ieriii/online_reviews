Was a fan of this place for years prior to the revamp.. I have to say, for the food- I've never found another Italian place better than Calo. Fantastic pastas and the pan pizza is on par with Malnati's. In fact, after Malnati's, Calo is my favorite in town. I'm gonna have to give Calo a 3 star rating at this point though.. they used to greet you like you were family. I really don't visit as often nowadays just because they really don't seem interested AT ALL when you walk in. Very impersonal, I've felt more like I was being pushed through. Sorry guys.. maybe you need to address this issue.
