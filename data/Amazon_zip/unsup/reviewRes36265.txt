My first time at Indie Cafe won't be my last. It took all my curry courage not to order one of the Thai Curry specials, because I do love a good curry, and Indie Cafe's looked amazing on paper. But a friend and I were on a sushi/maki Mission from God, and I'm that happy we were. While Indie used to be BYOB, now they offer a nice variety of wines, a few beers (Sapporo, please!), and mixed drinks. Start with the crab rangoon, because it's the best ever. Presentation at Indie is a strong point, and the crab rangoon is done in what looks like little money bag pouches, and you can taste the excellent crab. Heavenly. I ordered the special Je T'aime Maki rolls with blue crab, avocado, crispy seaweed, and many other things. While it was very fresh and tasty, it was overshadowed by the Godzilla Baba, a complex maki with excellent colorful, sexy, presentation. It was amazing, and it's fun to say! Indie Cafe really has something for everyone with curries, rice dishes, sushi, maki, noodes and fried rice, and unique seafood specials. The atmosphere is nice but relaxed, and service attentive.
