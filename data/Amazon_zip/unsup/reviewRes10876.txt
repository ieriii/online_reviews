This one will be quick as this is my third review of Piece. I returned yet again last night with my boyfriend. He had never heard of the place, let alone come in for the pizza. So, being the good girlfriend that I am, I took him here to share one of Chicago's best pizza experiences wtih him. And really, this place is more of a food experience than just a greasy pizza. We waited about 45 minutes for a table and the entire time we were there, even when we were walking out the door at the end of our meal, people were still streaming in. They do a good business. We ordered 2 small pizzas. It was def more food than two normal sized people could finish, but I insisted we have one "exotic" pie and one "fall back" pie with easy ingredients we both knew we'd like. The fall back pizza was red sauce with pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms. And it was fantastic! It really was. My boyfriend LOVED it!  The exotic pizza was the white sauce with the clams and bacon. Yes- I've done the clams and white sauce before. But last time I didn't get the bacon on the thing. And the bacon was fantastic! Additionally, they put a TON of clams on the pizza which was wonderful! Nothing worse than being jipped on something like that. The clam pizza was almost more of a gourmet garlic bread than a pizza. But it was magical I tell you!  All in all, boyfriend LOVED his pizza, I LOVED my pizza and our waitress (I can't remember her name but she was a tiny little redhead) was great- especially considering the giant crowd of people she had to contend with. Thank you Piece for winning me back. Now that you have me, what are you going to do with me?
