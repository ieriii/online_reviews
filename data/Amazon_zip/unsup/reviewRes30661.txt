I have never had vegan food before and since i love the show Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins on the Food Network i thought i would try this place out with some friends. The show suggested the California Reuben so i was determined to test it out. My friends and I ordered the hummus for an appetizer which was good then we ordered our entrees. I order the Reuben of course with the sweet potato french fries. AMAZING!!! it taste like a REAL Reuben and i was very surprised. if someone brought me here and didn't tell me it was vegan i would have not be able to tell the difference. My friends ordered the gyro and Reuben and were equally impressed with their meals. for desert we ordered the vegan no bake cheesecake, a raw cheesecake, and a chocolate chip cake. all three were great but the chocolate chip cake was wonderful! i did no care for the raw cheesecake that much but it was good. This is a good place to try whether one is vegan or not because the food is great!
