I normally wouldn't add a review to a place with 400+ reviews already, but I had such a great experience there yesterday I wanted to share. A large group of us got together on Sunday around 1pm and decided we wanted to go to Piece for lunch, but knew that getting a table with 2 hours notice for 10+ would be a challenge. We called to try to get a last minute reservation for 3pm, and as expected, we were told that they couldn't reserve something so soon. Of course this was understandable and we just figured we would try to go anyway and split up into several tables if needed. Well, we showed up at 3 and they had managed to put something together for us anyway - we hadn't even left a name when we called earlier. It was such a pleasant surprise! As for the meal, the pizza was good, of course. The beer was excellent. I was also struck by how great the service was. I know how awful waiting on large groups can be, but our server was great! She was super friendly and really patient, even though our table had some major ADD. Thanks, Piece! I will be back - but in a smaller group, I promise.
