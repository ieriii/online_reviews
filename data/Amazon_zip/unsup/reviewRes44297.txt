I have always had good experiences here, I have probably been about 10 times since it opened. The Mexican Maki roll is YUMMY! I crave this roll on a weekly basis. The jalapeno miso soup is also a nice twist to the regular miso.   The only thing that annoys me is they are stingy on their ginger and will charge $1for extra. Other than that it is always fresh and delish!
