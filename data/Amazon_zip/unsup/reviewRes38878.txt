I have driven past this "joint" hundreds of times, and just kept on driving. A few weeks ago, my wife chose it for date night. I was skeptical walking in, and half-expected Frank Sinatra's ghost to be singing in the corner. But, looks are deceiving. We've now been there once a week for dinner for the past three weeks. Service: It's like your grandmother or aunt is serving you. The waitresses go out of their way to make you comfortable, and make recommendations. Also, we've gotten a coupon for a free appetizer or carafe of wine every time we've gone there. Atmosphere: OK, you don't necessary go to La Villa for the atmosphere. But, the 1970's wood-panelled walls, and friendly service do make it feel warm and cozy. Value: Seriously, this is the best deal in town. Their thin crust pizza is one of the best in Chicago, and only $12 for a large. We took a group of 8 there last week, and with appetizers, soups, salad bars, entrees, and several carafes of wine only cost us $180.  Bottom line: Next time you drive past this place, STOP. You will not regret it!
