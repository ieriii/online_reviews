Possibly the best meal I've ever had. Ever. Sorry, mom. Look at the menu. Amazing! Try a few! Doug is a culinary genius! He has truly improved on an American Classic. I, unofficially, give him the title of "Best Hot Dog in the World." WARNING: Go at an off hour to minimize the line waiting. Cash only. Bring a friend you like to talk to.
