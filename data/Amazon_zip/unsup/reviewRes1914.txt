What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?? Hot Doug's is DELICIOUS. I've been wanting to go for pretty much forever, and since I had nothing else going on, today was the day! We arrived at 11, and the line was already curved around the building. We waited for 47 minutes, which isn't so bad, especially on duck fat fry fridays. We got to the front of the line and the super friendly server took our order-- alligator sausage, game sausage of the week (venison, Antelope, Buffalo and Elk), 1 order of duck fat fries, and 2 cokes. Within minutes our food arrived, and we were in sausage heaven. It was definitely one of those meals where we were too busy eating to talk. The fries were PERFECT, and the sausages crispy and delicious. The unlimited coke was a nice touch, too, esp since the gator was a little spicy. Just a few things to keep in mind: like everyone says, the line takes forever. no good way to take a train. cash only. And this isn't really fast food, it's gourmet food masquerading as junk, so be prepared to be in a full-on food coma at the end of the meal. Lucky for us grad students, a long nap was in our future, where we dreamed of our next meal at hot dougs. mmmm.
