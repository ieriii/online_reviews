ah, this is the first beer bar i fell in love with before moving to chicago. pretty big place, 2 floors, outside area in the summer, and most importantly: TONS OF DELICIOUS AMAZING BEERS. never ate here, but i hear the food is great. crowd is kinda mixed in terms of age, but overall fine. gets kinda busy on the weekends and seating gets weird if you have more than a couple people. but overall: great.
