I have been here several times, but not in the last year or so. On a recent spring day several of us went for lunch. The guacamole continues to be outstanding. However, my chicken tacos - always excellent - were just average. Disappointingly, they were not warm either. The server was congenial but either spread too thin among the tables, or inattentive. There were long waits to order, for dessert, and for taking an extra place setting off the table and clearing dishes. (We were invisible to the staff on this.) The other entrees were good, but surely not great. The dessert was overpriced and not that tasty. To be generous, I will stick with three stars. Overall, not as good as I remembered but the prices were higher of course,
