This place might as well be called the Hedonistic Meat Palace. It's all about meat. Beef, lamb, pork and chicken, you will be offered more of it than you can possibly consume. All of which was quite good. They also offer a self-serve salad component, but outside of a few highlights was kind of weak. I recommend seeking out the sauted mushrooms, tabouleh and seared tuna. For the uninitiated to the Brazilian steakhouse concept as I was prior to this visit, the staff doesn't do a particularly good job of explaining the program, whether on the phone or at your table side. Luckily for me I was dining with a fan of the style. If you call for information keep the words to a minimum because Dorothy confuses easily. Their cocktails come out on the weak side, but if you ask them to kick it up a notch they will. If you seek a carnivorous gluttoning; this is where you want to be. Warning: Meat induced coma may result.
