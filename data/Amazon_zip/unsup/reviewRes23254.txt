I have been here more than a couple of times previously and the food has been great. Unfortunately I went back this morning for lunch and I'm basically just rating the service which was terrible! The food is still great but waiting an hour just to get a drink was just wrong. I think much of our experience had to do with our terrible waitress. She didn't seem to care and for this bad experience I will not be going out of my way to go back. I just hope they can take of this problem because I do really love the food.
