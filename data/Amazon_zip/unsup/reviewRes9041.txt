I found this place when looking for something new for delivery on GrubHub. What a great find! Usually at places like this, I find the kabobs to be dry and overcooked. Not here. The chicken and steak kabobs were so very tender and full of juicy goodness. The rice had an essence of citrus to it that just made me gobble it up plain. The green lamb dish (the name escapes me) was pretty good, but could have been a little more spicy. The hummus was great, but needed a pinch of salt to add a bit of kick. I ordered extra pita and wow, did they come through! An entire styrofoam take-out box full of warm... yes, STILL warm bread. The best part of it all? THEY DELIVER! WOOT!
