All I can say I was disappointed with my lunch, however, 2 things, first I never weight take out as much as dine in so know this was take out. Second, know that the owner of the restaurant tracked me down disappointed about his staffs performance and personally came to my office and apologized, he also gave us a $100 gift certificate. I look forward to sitting in the dining room for a better gauge of their food. Hopefully it will warrant a full rewrite of this. It was delivery, not in the restaurant to be frank. The soup called Aash, poorly seasoned regardless of where you eating. Liked the hummus. The Baba Gannouj was ok. The Kash Ke Bademjan was intriguing a different combination of flavors than I have had in middle eastern food anytime recently, I liked. Here is where the major problem came in. Over and 1 hour 30 minutes for delivery. Sending dinner portions instead of the lunch special portions and not bothering to ask after dropping off the lunch special menu at our office. Lunch for 2 $34.
