I've been going to Bongo Room since it first opened in a small space underneath the Damen blue line stop... so I'd guess I'd be considered a loyal customer. However, gotta tell you... despite the relatively innovative brunch menu (e.g., banana oreo pancakes, smoked duck breast benedict), the food tastes lousy. I had the chorizo omelet on Monday and it was bland with a huge chunk of meat in the middle of eggs, with a too large portion of potatoes on the side. Boring... Also, there's always a wait on the weekend. When the space on Milwaukee opened the interior build out was cutting edge... not it just looks dated.One strong positive: my server Jennifer. She was friendly, timely and responsive.If you're OK with a relatively unique menu with food that tastes bland, but you get huge portions of it, and you're willing to wait in line to eat it, then perhaps Bongo Room is for you. Otherwise, I'd suggest passing.
