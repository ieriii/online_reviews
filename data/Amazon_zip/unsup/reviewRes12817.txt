I came here because I was looking for Cuban food, but their fare was less than authentic (in my eyes). However, the food came out tasting great otherwise. I ordered the Jalapeno porkchops and out came to HUGE porkchops sitting on top of sweet potatoes in this brown and sugary sauce. I liked it very much, the porkchop came out just perfect, not dry at all. Just go with the chef's recco of medium. I tried my date's salmon and it was just as good. We also shared the a puff-pastry on top of an ice cream that I can't quite remember the name of, but it was great! The place filled up pretty quickly (we had an early dinner) so I imagine the wait can be quite long. Street parking.
