You can't ask for more: delicious sushi and phenomenal vibe. Every visit to Chicago, I make sure I come here.  I'm hooked on the Sunrise and White Dragon. The sushi never stays on my plate for more than 5 minutes. This sushi is THAT GOOD! I absolutely love the vibe in this place. Large groups, dates, solo artists, everyone was having a great time. The chefs are very friendly. Sitting at the sushi bar you can engage in good conversation with the chefs or even fellow diners beside you. I wish there was something like this back in CA.
