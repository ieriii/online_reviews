We were dying to try a real Chicago style deep dish pizza. So after reading tons of review on yelp, we finalized on going to Art of Pizza. We ordered a combination deep dish cheese-stuffed crust. There were only 2 of us, but my husband insisted on ordering a whole pizza instead of the slices. The slices are all ready to be eaten, but the whole one takes around 45-60 minutes. But they don't tell you about the long wait. After seeing all the other diners eat their food & chasing my daughter everywhere, I couldn't take it anymore. Luckily, there is a big dining area but I was hungry & irritated. It's almost an hour & I'm sick of sipping on my diet coke. We were ready to go and my husband complained to the manager. They gave us $10 in cash back & our pizza came right out.  The pizza was excellent! It was saucy with the right amount of sausage. The crust was buttery & flaky. The wait was worth it. But be prepared next time you order a whole pizza.
