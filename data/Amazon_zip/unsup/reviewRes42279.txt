Delicious! Thanks Yelp for this awesome spot! Seriously though - this is the best food I've had in a long time. We started the evening with some cocktails (we'll get wine next time) and the burrata with a fresh pea puree. The burrata was served with toasted ciabatta, and it was so good we had to restrain ourselves from licking the plate. It was perfectly fresh and creamy, and we even ordered extra ciabatta for the rest of our meal. After the amazing burrata, it took 30-45 minutes for our next two courses to come, which strangely came together even though they didn't both fit on the table at once.... The ribbon pasta with mushrooms and truffle oil was delicious, and the texture was great. I'm pretty sure they make the pasta themselves. We also ordered a rib eye steak, which was good but I would probably skip next time because so many other things on the menu looked better. Minus one star for the pacing and timing on the dishes - they definitely didn't seem to have that down - and the fact that we had a hard time getting the attention of our waitress, even though she was good if we could catch her eye. That being said, I'll definitely be back and can't wait to try Curio Bar in the basement, too.
