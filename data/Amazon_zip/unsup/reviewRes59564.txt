I went to San Soo Gab San last Tuesday. When we just get in the restaurant, there are only less people there but they give us a table which is so close to the door, and it's so cold that day. I don't know if we are not Korean, so the waitress becomes so rude. They were never come back after they gave us the food. I need to say the foods are really good and they have a lot of sides.
