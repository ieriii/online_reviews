I had a really amazing experience at GE. The food was incredible and beautiful. We did the full tasting menu. Do no go expecting free popcorn or a la cart. Have an open mind. This place is doing something different than before, so try not to go in with certain expectations (if you've been before), and I think you will be happy.
