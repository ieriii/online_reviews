I went to Uncommon Ground for brunch on a Sunday after deciding NOT to endure the 45min wait for M Henry. I was NOT AT ALL disappointed. There was no wait. The waitress was excellent and friendly. The food was amazing. My dining companion had the best graham cracker latte thing in the world. I had pecan crusted brioche french toast, which was just the right amount of sweet and wonderful. I, of course, also ordered side potatoes & bacon which were both great as well. On my second visit I had a skillet of cheese grits with pulled pork that was absolutely to die for. I accompanied it with a Black Eyed Dog which was lovely. (Vodka with blackberry/cardamom syrup). I can't wait to come back...I loved brunch but I really want to come for dinner, especially since their beer menu is so good!
