DELICIOUS! They change their menu all the time and I've never had the same thing twice (in probably 15 visits). Everything I've had has been incredible. If I could afford it, I'd eat here once or twice a week. The salads are nothing special - save your appetite for the entrees. Wine is always great. Dessert is fantastic. Deifnitely need a reservation most nights of the week and it can get loud in there.
