Oh Chicago Diner how much do I love you? Let me count the ways...... 1. Service is great 2. Prices are reasonable 3. Portions so big, I always have a doggie bag 4. The shakes ( non dairy) ROCK!! 5. Breakfast bowl is awesome!!! and so are the gyros! 6. Even if you are the #1 meat lover, you'll find something on the menu to eat The only downside is that its so far away from my home.( I live in Bridgeport) If I lived in the same neighborhood, I would eat here every day!! Love it!! I make it a point to eat here as often as I can and always order another entree to take home with me.
