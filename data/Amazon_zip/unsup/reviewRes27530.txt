Had an outstanding dining experience here last night. Between my wife and I, we tried the Bisque, Macaroni, Risotto, Scallops, Beef, Chocolate, and Pear. The Risotto was just OK, but everything else was so delicious. The vibe of the place is very cool and they had some outstanding local craft beers as well as good cocktails. Yes, the portions were somewhat small, but the prices didn't seem all too high. Some of the dishes seemed to be on a completely different level of complexity from anything I had had before. The pear dessert kind of scared us at first because it was served and there were two pieces of blue cheese gelato, some pear slices, and a bunch of lettuce. Each on their own, they were a terrible dessert. Yet somehow when you put them all together they tasted awesome and ran through multiple flavors lingering in your mouth. It was amazing. I usually hate mushrooms, but the macaroni had them in it and it tasted great. The beef was so tender you could cut it with a fork. For 3 starters, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 3 cocktails, and 2 beers, it was about $205 with tax and tip. We heard the spring menu would be debuting soon and want to go back already! I also read that GEB is opening up a sandwich shop sometime in spring so that sounds exciting as well. Great experience.
