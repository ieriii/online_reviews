Falafel: nothing special, though the jerusalem salad is a nice touch. Lentil soup: probably the best lentil soup I've ever had, excluding the kind my grandma makes. Hummus: wow, their hummus on its own is pretty terrible. Everything else: ehhhhh. I find myself stopping here more often than I'd like, mostly because it's cheap and in a convenient location. I do like the staff, but the food is just average and the seating is pretty uncomfortable. I guess.
