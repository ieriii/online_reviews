I really wanted to like this place, but I've definitely had better experiences and better food.  First off the cook or chef who was sitting with his friends at the table next to us was ridiculously loud and annoying. I came close to taking him to the bathroom for a swirlie and introduce him to respect for food and patrons.  The seating in the place is awkward with benches bolted to the floor. Totally uncomfortable tables to sit it because it's like one of those Old School McDonald's seats where the chair is tied to the table and you can't adjust or move anything.  We ordered burgers and fries and cheese curds. The cheese curds were underdone and had a crappy batter which is amplified when things aren't cooked at the proper temperature.  I mean, how do you screw up fried cheese? Secondly, I could tell by looking at the fries that the grease needed to be changed which was confirmed with the first bite.  My burger was undercooked and it came on a Jewel like bun. Who the heck creates a $12 burger, or whatever the price was, and then sticks it on a bun from Jewel? My girlfriend's burger was not to her liking at all, she wasn't happy with the fries either. How do you screw up cheese curds, fries and a burger all in the same meal? Maybe if the cook actually spent time in the kitchen instead of at a table with his friends I might have gotten what I paid for, instead Chef Boy R Dee left me holding the bag on this one. I'm not even remotely impressed.  The beer selection was deep and the only reason this place gets two stars. This place is no Kuma's Corner as far as the food goes.
