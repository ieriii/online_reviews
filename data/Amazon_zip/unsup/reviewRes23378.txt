This is the third day in a row that I have eaten the Ma Po Tofu from Lao Sze Chaun. That's right, the portions are so big at this place that you can get three solid meals out of it for a mere $8.95 (plus $1 extra for rice). The menu is ginormous and overwhelming and there's a good mix of traditional Chinese fare, vegetarian options, and basic dishes you see at most places (ie: sweet and sour chicken). I definitely made a good choice in ordering the Ma Po Tofu. It's spicy and full of flavor. My friends and I also had the spicy cabbage appetizer which is officially addictive. Bonus points for the cute panda photography on the walls, and maybe minus some points for the contempo-plastic chairs.
