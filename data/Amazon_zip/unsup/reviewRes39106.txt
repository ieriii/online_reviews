This review is primarily regarding their breakfast/brunch options; the place is a real doozie for early morning eating extravaganza's. I'm like a crotchety old man, I can't wait until noon to have brunch like a normal person. Being an early riser, I like to be standing in front of the place 5 minutes before it opens. Not sure what Longman's advertised hours are, but they open at 8:00AM: FULL BAR as well. I love, love their breakfast. My favorite item is the duck hash -- few eggs, potatoes, chunks of duck and an enormous amount of truffle/truffle oil. Seriously, I tastes truffles for the entire day, which was awesome. Their sausage is made in-house, so you should get a side of that. Bacon is generally not cooked firm, so ask for that if you'd like it crispy. Ah, breakfast drinks -- get the Negroni do Aquila or the Old Fashioned. I read in Chicago Magazine that longman makes te best Tom Collins in the City. Well, I didn't know that anyone drank those, but heck, get one and let me know. Bartenders are chatty in the morning, as long as you don't take up space at the bar and order water. They know a ton about whiskey, in particular, they know all about Buffalo Trace and Pappy. Solid. I come here at least once a week -- you can have breakfast, a drink and a smile for under $20. Highly recommend. If you come after 10:00am, you'll probably need to wait.
