OK, I know it's a Chicago "must go", but I've had better. And a pizza takes 45 minutes. In the middle of the afternoon! We had an outdoor table, and they did switch us when the sun got hot. And the wait staff was attentive, but the pizza was not worth the wait....much too heavy. We ordered a small, and between the two of us we only ate three and a half pieces.
