This place has made it to the favorite restaurant list. I didnt think anything could outshine the Woodland Mushroom Torta, but the shrimp torta special was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I cant explain the flavors of the lime mayo, spices, pickled veggies and grilled shrimp. It was heaven on a plate. HEAVEN!! Rick Bayless raises the bar with his ingenious menu and specials. Absolutely delicioso!!
