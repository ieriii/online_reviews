To say it's the best hot dog place in town is a little unfair to this place because they do so much more than that. Their hot dogs are good I'm sure but their specialty sausages are just amazing. They're creative and work wonderfully with the toppings they come with. I'm not a fan of the duck fat fries they have on Fridays and Saturdays but their regular fries are really good. You will almost certainly have to wait in line but it's really not terrible if the weather's half decent. If you're from Chicago you have to go once but once you do that you'll want to keep going. The hard thing about that is it's tricky to get to since it's not terribly close to public transit. You could take the Addison or Belmont bus to Sacramento but buses can be a bit unreliable so driving/taxing/biking is the preferred method.
