Four of us were looking for a good place to go, and decided on Italian. Choose this place via Yelp, and wasn't disappointed. It's old school Italian; you have the feeling that Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack could have hung out there. At first, it seemed like service was going to be slow. Then everything picked up and we got fantastic service. The food was incredible. I'm not usually a fan of Italian, but I got the gnocchi. It was marvelous! I ate way more of it than I was intending. This place might be pricey, but you get 2 meals for the price of 1. Almost everyone at our table had leftovers.
