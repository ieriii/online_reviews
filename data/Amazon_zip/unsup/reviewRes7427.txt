Amazing food and great service. We had reservations and were seated immediately. We ate the Kobe brisket, pulled pork, st louis ribs, and baby back ribs among the 4 of us. All of it was delicious. There was a mishap where they brought out the full dinner item instead of a sandwich but the waiter immediately recognized the mistake and brought out the sandwich and wrapped up the dinner item for us to take home free of charge. I will definitely go back.
