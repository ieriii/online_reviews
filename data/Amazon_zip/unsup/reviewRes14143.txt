On a chilly, slushy Chicago evening, this little joint was an oasis of warmth and good food. I had the Timba sandwich, filled with swiss cheese and guava. The sweetness of the fruit combined with the salty, savory cheese was incredible. I love that there are two other vegetarian sandwiches on the menu--thank you! My companion had the Lechon (roast pork) and declared it delicious. The papas fritas were crispy and very hot, tender and soft inside. Yum! My cafe con leche was perfect--naturally milky sweet, strong but not bitter. I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. As other yelpers have said, the owner is friendly, attentive and casual. Loved the decor and Cuban music, too. When you need an escape from Chicago winter, come to 90 Miles Cafe!
