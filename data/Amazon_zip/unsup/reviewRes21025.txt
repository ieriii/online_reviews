third time's a charm, apparently. outing #1 - with a friend, looking for a cozy, friendly bar where we could enjoy a happy hour drink, and relax. opinion? this is not the place for us. we're the type that enjoy a more personal, casual experience (chat up the other patrons, and the bartender, listen to a juke box, maybe eat some tater tots) and it was a bit too froofy, expensive, and impersonal for what we were looking for that night. outing #2 - with a first date, post-"late night at the art institute" for a drink. opinion? decent spot. interesting menu options to spur conversation, nice drink menu, dim cozy lighting... all appreciated during this round. sadly, the guy didn't work out so i was left with a ho-hum feeling about the restaurant, soely by association outing #3 - with a group of former colleagues (all in the hospitality industry) who wanted to have a drink, some nibbles, and a good atmosphere to play "catch up". opinion? most wonderful! intimate seating allowed for great conversation, menu design allowed us to select a variety of dishes and share, and the overall upscale but not pretentious atmosphere left us feeling like we had enjoyed a "special treat".
