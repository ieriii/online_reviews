My first Wilde night was by chance. I was looking for a decently nice place with visiting friends to grab a Saturday night dinner. We walked up and only had 15-20 minute wait for a 4-top. Yay! I really like the decor---classy, but still has flat-screens for sports. Good for those that want to watch a game, but don't want to deal with the typical frat-boy sports bars. I love the lush greenery out front in the summer. It's such a pretty spot. Okay, now for my favorite part---the Blue on Blue Burger. Oh. my. god. It's so good. I crave it now. It's the only thing I've tried because if I'm at Wilde, I'm wanting it.  It's got blue cheese dressing and crispy onion strings. (Crap, now my mouth is watering.)  I've always heard positive things from my friends about their meals, but I've got tunnel vision here. Prices are fairly reasonable for dinner in Lakeview and frankly, the food is good enough to warrant it. Thumbs up!
