I struggled with the 4-star rating because there were 1-2 items that were just "ok" but overall the experience was really good at Purple Pig. Some must-trys: Milk-braised Pork Shoulder - EVERYONE should order this. It is melt in your mouth delicious, uniquely flavorful, delicious Pig Tail - I've had pig tail at Bristol that was too much to handle. This was the perfect amount and extremely savory. Podda - Reco'd by the server, some of the best Gouda I've ever had Dessert - Panino!! Banana, Marshmallow, Nutella deliciousness!!! Who wouldn't love this :) Other good things to try - Pork Neck Gravy (really just a tomato sauce spread, great with red wine!) What was just OK to me Fried Pig Ear - a little to much picked pepper but the egg was perfect on top. I wish the ear wasn't fried, though, it could have been anything that was fried. Fava Beans - a little too salty, but I really liked the leek, mint, flavor mix I can't wait to come back to try the many other things on the list I wanted to try!
