Went here yesterday and have heard about it for quite some time and read all the yelps. Tad disappointing. Spring rolls were aight. I work near Pho Ha in Glendale Heights and the spring rolls at Tank made me more grateful for the ones at Pho Ha, they kick ASS! Pho was good, I don't know that I was blown away, the waiter was a bit impatient and didn't give a shit. I would go back, maybe try the non Pho items and the fried seafood cake appetizer this guy at another table got, we asked the bus man (he was like 72 and a 1/2 and I dont feel right calling him bus boy) what it was and he pointed it out on the menu...guo com? Maybe not, but either way I am looking forward to trying other items or maybe just see how pho 777 is, the other place I was debating on trying.... Pho season is just around the corner!
