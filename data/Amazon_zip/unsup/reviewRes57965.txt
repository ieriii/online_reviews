Went there on a Sunday night and truly enjoyed their new pig roast entree, it was very flavorful with crispy skin. My husband had veal praprikash and it's always good. Last time he had goulash and he always loved it since he's Hungarian. We also had the sausage appetizer and it's grilled to perfect, if you don't mind the strong garlic taste. The accompanied polenta and salad were also very tasteful. We went to this restaurant over 20+ years since they were on Belmont and the food remained very good, but it's getting pricy without a coupon, also it'll be nice if small soup or salad is included with entrees.
