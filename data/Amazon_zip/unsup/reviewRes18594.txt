A coworker recommended Caro Mio as a quiet, romantic neighborhood spot, and I've been back several times under many different circumstances. I've never been impressed with any of the chicken or fish dishes, but the pasta here is phenomenal: homemade and perfect, filled with amazing, covered in unbelievable. Get any pasta with mushrooms: you won't regret it. I can't account for their desserts because I don't usually have room after their massive entrees, and I don't like tiramisu at all. I don't think they take reservations, and they won't seat you until your entire party is there--sometimes you luck out with the wait, and other times you're stuck in the tiny waiting area drooling over the nearest table's gnocchi (which I've heard is great, although I can't personally testify). Service otherwise is pretty good. You might wait a bit for your food (especially for big groups), but this has been one of those places where, thanks to the food, I'm willing to forgive slow service. Price is okay: entrees are a bit on the expensive side, but since it's BYOB, it balances out.
