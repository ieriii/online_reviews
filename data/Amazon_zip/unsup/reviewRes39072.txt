I love brunch at L&E! This time I strayed to the lunch-ish half of the menu and ordered the beluga lentils with roasted cauliflower, golden raisins, pickled mango and cucumber raita. SO GOOD. I had a great cocktail with Aperol (the name escapes me). The bite of my friend's mac and cheese that I had was amazing. Our server was so nice, made some recs for us and didn't get pissy when my two girlfriends and I were totally indecisive and took forever to order and then later took forever to pay our check. Thanks for not rushing us, dude!
