I LOVE this place! If you want to get out and go to a fun place with good food, Carnivale is the place for you!  The atmosphere is loud and screams fun, fun, fun. This is probably not where you want to take your date and have a romantic evening. It's great for groups, friends, etc! The food is really good. I've tried multiple items on the menu and haven't yet been disappointed. The waitstaff is really good. They're knowledgeable, inviting and attentive. This is one of my faves! Price is a bit...high, so beware.
