Yay - good indian buffet! I work right around the corner and consider myself lucky enough to be able to afford to treat myself to lunch here once a week. Yeah it ain't cheap, but you get a skillet of tandori chicken, a basket of nan, and the choice of 10+ other dishes. Their menu doesn't change as much as I'd like - their standard dishes are a chic pea dish, lentil dish, and chicken tikka masala. They usually have a lamb and fish dish to go along with the chicken, and then mix up the other veggie dishes. Try their aloo gobi and that corn dish ... I have no idea what it's called. It's not too spicy, but a little thin for my tastes. Good stuff!
