We liked our busser Jesse and our server Meg very much. Jesse offered to show us the smoker and was very knowledgeable about all the areas of the kitchen and man that smoker is huge and needs a name! Meg knew so much about the beer and her suggestion of the Pranqster was great! The baby back ribs were great too! I like a place like this where the busser is not just the one picking up our dirty dishes but engaging us in conversation as he offers to do so!
