This place has really good food and service they need to work on a few things though. First there lobster tails are not 7oz like they said there more like 4oz so I was real mad about that and communication is a problem when u say you'll b back in a minute to take your order and come back in 9min that's not cool..but in the end the waiter comped desert for everyone
