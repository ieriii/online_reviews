Wanted to see what the buzz was about. I was enthusiastic and ready for some great food.Only to be disappointed at every aspect . First waited in line for 40 minutes, kept reminding them only to hear that they forgot about my party as i stood in front of the host stand with frequent reminders.Chaotic host stand, chaotic service, was told only 3 wait staff for over 200 seats????? Pretty insane, especially if they moved from one location to another, without thought of service needs.i wanted to like this place and help out our restauranteurs in this economy.Service was not to be seen, and when present, they looked under the tables for seating numbers for identification, trying to figure out where to bring food. Chaos.Duck looked good, and am sure was good, however, hard for me to return.Food was otherwise mediocre, too much gravy in most dishes.
