Rewind the clock about 6 years and I would have given the Hopleaf 4-Stars... but I am so put-off by the hordes of quasi-yuppies, pseudo-intellectuals and overall drones that frequent this place in recent years, that I just cannot bring myself to give them a positive review these days. Plus, it is way too crowded for its own good, especially on the weekends... not surprisingly. The Hopleaf does have an amazingly broad-spectrum beer selection and they tend to rotate in new selections periodically... which is awesome. But the prices here have steadily been on the incline... and the people that frequent it have gotten steadily more and more undesirable from the viewpoint of a non-trendy, non-elitist. I have gotten into too many philosophical discussions in which people quote some obscure literary reference and act all haughty that they "won" the argument. To be fair, I should be giving this place a 3-Star rating, but I'm a bastard... so they get 2-Stars. When I go to a bar, it is to have a good time and get warm and fuzzy drunk... not to be forced into pseudo-intellectual waxing-philosophical gobbledegook. Give me bourbon or give me death. Wokka wokka...
