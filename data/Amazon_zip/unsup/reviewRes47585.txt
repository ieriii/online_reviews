Came here for brunch with a few girlfriends. Overall, I thought the food was really good. I have to say that, even though everything was really tasty, I am not a huge fan of buffets for brunch. The cheese selection was awesome though! The good stuff: the cinnamon rolls, the hash, the cheese selection, the ranch-marinated beef, the turkey and a few of the salads. The eh: the salmon (VERY fishy), the buffalo chicken and waffles (good separately, not so much together) and the frittata. The service was not very good. The place wasn't crowded and we either served ourselves or had the guys with the meat service slicing things for us. Not sure why it took our waiter 20 minutes to bring coffee, more mimosas, etc. every time we requested something.
