Went here again last night and I was reminded of why I love this place so much! The food is incredible. My favorites are the beets with whipped goat cheese (a MUST try), pork neck bone gravy with ricotta, chicken kebobs, and the friend brussel sprouts. I also obsess over the Sicilian Iris dessert (tastes like the most delicious undercooked donut you have ever eaten), but I think you either love that dessert or hate it. Whenever the Sicilian Iris is ordered with a group, there are always split reactions. The only thing lacking is the noise level (which I guess is to be expected, but it is REALLY hard to carry on a converstaion),and the service isn't ever super friendly.
