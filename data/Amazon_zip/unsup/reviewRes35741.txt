Man, so they moved, and the new place is nice.  But the service was terrible. We made a reservation and it took forever to get the duck. I understand they are busier now and it was a Saturday night but they need to be figure out a better system. The problem is they don't have anyone dedicated to specific tables or zones (as far as I could tell). I asked someone for some more bread and it took about 20 minutes. Had to ask 2 separate people for it. Water took forever to refill. The food was still pretty good, but I don't know if I can handle the rudeness of one of the main waitresses and the slow service. I would probably go again and give it another shot, but I am afraid to recommend it to people now. :(
