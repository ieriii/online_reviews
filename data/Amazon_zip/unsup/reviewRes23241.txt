For an entire year, I lived just around the corner from Icosium Kafe, and not once did I venture inside. Not once. I was totally put off by the outside decor and assumed that it was "just another crepe place". Now that I live considerably further away, I have discovered the terrible error of my ways. Delicious, delicious, delicious. This Algerian crepe place is unlike anything I could have expected. The savoury crepes are amazing, the sweeter crepes are perfect, and the desert crepes... well, I've never tried them, seeing as I stuff myself with the other crepes and never leave room for desert, but I'm sure they are excellent. And the coffee? Dark and thick and strong as you want it. Service is always great, and there's never a wait (though with food this good, there should be!) My only complaint is that is that now I have to take a bus to get there, but I guess I'll deal with it.
