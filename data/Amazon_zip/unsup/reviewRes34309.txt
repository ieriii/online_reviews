Since we were going there for the first time, we decided to make a reservation. Had no trouble doing that, and we were seated promptly and given a good table once we got there. My husband and I loved our Caesar salads, the veggies were just so fresh! He had the tilapia and really liked it. I found my pasta with multiple veggies very tasty, and was very impressed by the dessert--a chocolate tart with peanut butter filling and whipped cream. We didn't make that good a choice from the very extensive wine list, though. The place was a bit noisy, and the service could've been a bit more prompt, but it was overall a good experience, and not too expensive.
