A few co-workers had invited me and a friend out to Calo dinner. I had never been there or even heard of this place. I am a chef wanna be and specialize in Italian. I'm a believer of you can judge a restaurant (Italian) by their calamari and veal parmigiana. I couldn't find the veal on the menu!!! I asked our server and was told they do have it. WHEW! I ordered the calamari both ways. Oh my god it was fantastic! I would say the best I have ever had. Tender and flavorful to say the least. With very high expectations, I was waiting for the veal to arrive. When I cut into it and took my first bite, I was in Italian heaven. It too was the best I have ever had! I told the server it was amazing, the best. She smiled and said I knew you would love it The only downside of the whole experience is that I'm 43 and never been here before! I wish I had known about Calo many years ago. The owner/chef came to our table and asked how everything was. I was very impressed by the whole thing. The staff was 2nd to none. The place was jammed and you would never know it because they were on top of it like Ive never seen before. As far as pricing for what you get, HUGE portions for little $. I would have paid more with a smile. I gave it to the server, she was great. I truly wish there were more than 5 stars to give. in short, AMAZING! I will be a regular from this point forward.
