My buddies P and O took me to their fave restaurant downtown, Fogo de Chao (and can you believe I've had this place bookmarked for exactly 2 years?)! The best Brazilian churrascaria lunch ($32.50, served only on weekdays) experience ever summarized in quotes: "They're like little puffs of cloud!" - P, on the delectable (and bottomless!) bread that's served to each table. Completely agree! "Enjoy it!" - what I was told on my way to the bathroom. And yes, it is a nice bathroom. "Don't worry about it; I used to work at Disney World. I've seen way worse" - the eagled eyed waiter, picking up the fallen meat that somehow escaped P's fork midmeal "$10 isn't bad" - O, in reference to the cost of valet, though we easily found street parking right across the street. "You have to ask for it, and they'll bring it out" - O, on the rice and beans side (the others being plantains, polenta, and mashed potatoes) "I've never seen veggies so plump!" - me, on the fattest, juiciest, most mutant-like-in-a-good-way asparagus, tomatoes, and mushrooms from the salad bar. I also enjoyed the basil sauce served by the dressings. "We'll have one, and start the meal all over again" - us, upon ordering FDC's signature dessert, papaya cream, which is fresh papaya blended with vanilla ice cream and finished with creme de cassis liqueur tableside. Papaya has enzymes in it that help you digest. I say it works because I was ready to bust out of my tights right after lunch, but within an hour, I was ready to devour me some Sprinkles cupcakes. :o) "They don't miss anything, yet they're not overbearing" - P, on the impeccable service "So tendeeeeerrrrr" - me, practically speechless, as I consumed the beef ribs, my favorite meat, along with the bottom sirloin (fraldinha) Impressive salad bar, delicious caipirinhas (traditional Brazilian cocktail), excellent meats, outstanding service, and worth every penny! Dinner's the same routine, but pricier.
