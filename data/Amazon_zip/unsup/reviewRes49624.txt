I really enjoy coming to Bin 36. Its definitely a unique space and for a wine lover like myself, you can't go wrong with the wine and cheese flights and the pizzas are good as well. I can see how people would call it pretentious - ive seen a number of interesting characters and it can be fun to people watch, but its a fun place to try out.
