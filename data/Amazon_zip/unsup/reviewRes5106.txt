Being from out of state I was eager to find a "Chicago" restaurant. When a friend suggested Purple Pig I was intrigued. After following the large purple sign we entered through a misguiding door into the restaurant. We arrived at 7pm and were told a 15-20 minute wait. The two of us were put at a small table by the window and given menus. If our waitstaff hadn't explained the menu we'd have been lost. The menu items didn't have descriptions, which led us to use our phones to look items up. Both us are adventurous eaters and decided to start off with the stuffed olives...amazing!!! We then ordered Pork Liver Pat which came out in a large square bowl served with fruit sauce, sea salt, and toasted bread. This was one of the best things I've ever had. The pate was creamy and flavorful. Lastly we tried the Prairie Breeze which came out wedge style with crackers. Both of us agreed it was not our favorite. After finishing and getting our bill it only came out to $18 for two people. We were both stuffed and went away with a good deal and great food. I can't wait to go back to Chicago!
