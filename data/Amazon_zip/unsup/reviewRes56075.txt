SuperDawg Drive-In, which my mother has been eating at since 1954, makes the greatest hotdog on the entire planet. I am a hotdog connossieur and have eaten ballpark dogs, and movie theater dogs, and hotdogs in many U.S. cities. Superdawg is the best in the world hands down. The address listed here is INCORRECT. It's at the corner of Milwaukee and Devon. You can't miss the giant HotDog statues on the roof. In addition to the best food ever, it's a drive-in and they bring the hotdogs to your car and clip the tray to your window. It's like being transported into the past.
