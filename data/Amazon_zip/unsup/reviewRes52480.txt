It was fun to watch the gauchos in gauchos, but this place was only so-so. Service got a little overwhelming at times--if they asked us if we wanted another drink or dessert one more time I was going to lasso them. A couple of the dishes, esp the garlic beef and the chicken wrapped in bacon, were good (how can anything wrapped in bacon NOT be yummy?), but overall I would say the food is incredibly mediocre. Yes, it was all you can eat, but not much thrilled me into wanting more. Luckily, I had a 2 for 1 coupon, because I don't think I could have eaten $49 worth. They did have the coolest wine decanter I have ever seen in my life though--a conical glass suspended on a wood holder, which dispensed through the bottom. I want one! Gauchos could have been cuter too :(
