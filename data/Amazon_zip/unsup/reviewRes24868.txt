GREAT Restaurant and coffeehouse, within walking distance of Union Station, and my office. I literally had to be dragged here, but by the end of the meal, I was a believer. The food is great (they have a lot more on the menu than just Greek food), the staff was cheerful and friendly, and the prices weren't at all what I expected.
