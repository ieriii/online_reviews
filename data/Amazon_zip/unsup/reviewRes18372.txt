When I landed back at O'Hare airport after spending a lovely week in Puerto Vallarta, I took a cab home, and after staring at my bare refrigerator for about five minutes, I decided I needed to go somewhere to eat stat. The Bad Apple has been sitting on my bookmarks for quite sometime now, so I decided to pay them a visit and try one of their tasty burgers I keep hearing so much about. "Damn, that's one tasty burger!" I said after wolfing down one of their signature burgers called "The Frenchie." Said burger was an all beef patty cooked medium well, slathered with brie cheese, spinach leaves, truffle, and frizzle fried red onion, all squashed between a toasted pretzle bun that made me say "yummmmm!" Their fries were pretty tasty too. Seasoned and not too crunchy nor too soggy. Pair that with New Belgium's Lips Of Faith Series: Dark Heather Saison and you have a combination worth remembering. Next time my refrigerator is empty, Bad Apple, I'll return to you when that burger craving strikes.
