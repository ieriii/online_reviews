It's one of the only places my mom loves so I always get stuck taking her here. It's pretty good but with Anteprima down the block, why go here? Well it's great if you are in the over 50 crowd who demands soup or salad come with your entree, this place rocks. The pizza bread they give you in the bread plate is great too. Pastas are all pretty good and have had some OK fish dishes. My mom raves about the ribs but I think they are aweful. I gotta say they make a great tiramisu. Better up my review to 3.5 stars.
