This is top top hot dog place in the city. Even calling it a hot dog place is being unfair--Doug cranks out some seriously gourmet creations.  The usual fare (hot dogs, polish dogs, brats) is great, but where this place really shines is the specials. The game of the week ranges from ostrich to alligator to rattlesnake and everything in between. The best part is that Hot Doug's doesn't use exotic meat for the weirdness factor: the dogs themselves are incredibly delicious. Doug's $8.00 game specials have ingredients that wouldn't be out of place in a michelin-rated restaurant. If I have one complaint, it's that the sauces he uses on the special dogs are often a little rich with butter, which can drown out the taste of the sausage. That is just quibbling, though. The bottom line is that Hot Doug's is the most innovate hot dog place I've ever seen. There is a reason people wait in line for an hour for these dogs.
