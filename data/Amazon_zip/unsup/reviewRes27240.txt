So some disclaimers before I begin: 1) This is my first yelp! review and I'm opinionated (so that says something, right?) 2) My siblings and I are foodies, but agree that food does not make the meal. 3) Yes, I am one of those starstruck Top Chef Masters want-to-try-them-all people. Soooooo.... What to say about Graham Elliot? There was not much say beyond: we loved every minute of it! From the first step in, it was apparent that this was our "type" of place - from the casual but fun staff to the loud (maybe mom and dad wouldn't appreciate it -that- much) and Lolla-like music, we knew we were in for an experience of the write-home kind! Now we're foodies, yes. And we usually set high expectations for the food on a menu like this, so we were quite impressed that our waiter, Clint, not only sold us on the tasting menu, but also encouraged us to let him drive the "wine" pairing (which he amended with the addition of some mighty fine white beer). We also "added" lobster corny dogs and  may have depleted of GE's amazing truffle oil and pepper popcorn baskets several times over. Delish! The tasting menu (detailed in much better fashion than I could do justice in many reviews before and after mine) is very hearty and for $75, a more than a deal! My personal favorite was the cole slaw on the root beer bbq steak - so much so I grabbed GE as he was headed back to the kitchen to tell him he had stolen this Texas girl's heart with a piece of home. And, to add icing to a decadent cake, GE stopped and chatted with us for several minutes (priceless!). So, this may not be the place to celebrate your grandmother's 90th birthday, but if you're looking for a fun and lively dinner with some darn tasty and innovative food - don't think twice. And GE and family - I'll be back!
