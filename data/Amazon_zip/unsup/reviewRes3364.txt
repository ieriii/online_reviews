I absolutely love this place. When I used to live in Lakeview I saw this little place magically pop up out of nowhere. I would walk past it a couple of times a week but never stopped in because at the time I was BROKE and thought that $6 for chicken was crazy..... That is until the first time I actually ate there. I asked the guy at the front if I could try a couple of different flavors for my 5 wings. He said, "Sure." I had the Seoul Sassy and the Spicy BBQ. The minute I took a bite of that Seoul Sassy wing, I was hooked for life. The Seoul Sassy, IMO, is the best sauce of all of them. It's sweet and sticky and covered in green onions(yummy!!) And the Buddha bowls are PHENOMENAL! They come in 3 different sizes, but all of the sizes are sufficient, with the biggest being enough to probably share amongst 3 people. Also the fries are so light and crispy. Always hot and fresh. You can add a drink and fries to your meal as well. They have one of my favorite pops of all time there, Tahitian Treat, which got them that last star. ^_^ Nowadays, the place packed all of the time. So expect to way anywhere from 10 minutes around lunch time when it's not so busy, to as much as an hour on weekend dinners. Parking in the area is crazy, if you've been to Lakeview you know that. You'll be lucky to find anything close. Seating in the place is super cool. It's got group style seating with large picnic style tables in the middle of the room. Counter style stools in the windows and along the wall work great if it's busy or if you're alone. Oh yeah and best part about this place, aside from the food of course, is it's BYOB. So if you and your friends are dying for some bomb-a$$ food and wanna make it a party, Crisp is the place to be.
