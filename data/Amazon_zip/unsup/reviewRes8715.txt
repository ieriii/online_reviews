if you have yet to go here... you need to go at least once. it is meat heaven. i went for lunch with reservations because i went with a group of people. i called ahead about a week in advance to make sure i can get seats. they are very polite on the phone. when we get there we just smell the wonderful smell of roasting meat wafting in the air outside. when we step in we get nothing but great service right when we walk in. the staff was wonderful. more than i could expect. very friendly and happy. i would so recommend this place to all my friends. i couldn't ask for anything more. small tip..
