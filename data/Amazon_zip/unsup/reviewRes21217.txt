Everyone who knows me knows that when I want carne asada, I head to Cesar's (home of the "Killer Margarita") on Clark. My absolute favorite. And yes, their margaritas are killer because they are fueled by what you put in your gas tank. And they taste that way, too, which is why I always I opt for a low-cal alternative, the pina colada. But this is a review for Mayan Palace--which is giving Cesar's a run for its money with their carne asada. And the margaritas are absolutely EXCELLENT. I only tried their basic house margarita, so no fancy flavorings or top-shelf tequila. But whatever they do to it, they do it just right. I don't drink margaritas often, because, often, they are mediocre. If this is your gripe, or if you are tired of settling for less-than-the-best, go to Mayan Palace. You will not be disappointed. Have it with a steak--it comes w/grilled onions and guacamole. What more do you need?
