Bayless is an amazing chef and has groomed numerous other now amazing Mexican chefs who've worked for him over the years in Chicago. Frontera Grill has been open since 1987 yet every night you walk in and it has all the buzz of a hyped up place on it's grand opening night, and also all the friendliness, cleanliness and style of a new place. Seems that he knows how to treat his staff as I'd guess 90% of them are still happy working there for the entire 6 years that I've been visiting. You truly cannot go wrong on the menu here, but I often order simple classics like tamales, chicken with mole, or tacos al carbon just to remind myself how wonderfully flavorful Rick's team can execute creation of such seemingly simple things.  Don't go here with an expectation or plan of eating quickly. You'll likely wait in line for a table even if you show up at their 5pm opening time. Eating here IS a privilege and when the food finally comes to your table, you'll want to stay longer and spend time appreciating it.  I'm pretty sure he's not of Mexican decent but Rick has perhaps studied more about Mexican culture and spent more time in Mexico than many Mexican Americans. I understand that he closes his adjoining restaurants Topolobompo/Frontera Grill in Chicago for at least an entire week each year in order to fly every one of his restaurant staff members to Mexico for an expense paid vacation/cultural immersion and food exploration. The service people here are so knowledgeable and professional, they make every visit great even when it's too crowded to walk to the bar. I can't wait to visit Chicago once again just to dine at Frontera Grill. Rick please open 1 more restaurant in northern California for those of us now living on the west coast!
