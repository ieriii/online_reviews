Great service. Great Coffee. Great place. GREAT corner-view people watching. Huge portions: beware!! They messed up my order twice but somehow I didn't mind at all... and even found it oddly charming- "Aw shucks!" If you get a chance, check out the men's bathroom: the eight proper (and illustrated!!) steps of hand washing are posted above the sink. Hilarious!
