I was visiting my cousin on a trip to Chicago last week. Some work friends recommended going to Piece for beers since they're a brewery. Got a Full Frontal and a personal pizza for lunch--happiness. The goat cheese I got just made it. And then I went back for dinner with my cousin. The service is slightly aloof--I get they're hipsters, but this is Chicago! Everyone is nice! Not like I'm not used to it--I'm from Boston. Even so, this wouldn't stop me from going back.
