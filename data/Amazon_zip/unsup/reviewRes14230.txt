Okay - with 500 plus reviews so far I am not sure mine will stand out but I felt compelled to share our last experience at Glen's. It lasted one minute. Walked in the door and saw the dining room almost full. Asked "how long would it be for a table for two?" Tall young waitress/hostess replies that she can seat us at the bar in ten minutes or outside immediately (it is raining). I ask again "how long for a table for two?" We have gladly grabbed a drink at Scot's across the street and waited for a call on our cell on a few occasions - so waiting 20 minutes 30 minutes or whatever...no problem. Watiress/hostess response "that is impossible." Really? Impossible? I have seen this place much busier and have never been told that it was impossible to get a table. I don't think any restaurant owner or manager would want the word impossible to be used when a customer is willing to wait for their table and simply wants to know how long. Very rude. We left - just like the couple in front of us. Too bad really - because we always enjoy the food here.
