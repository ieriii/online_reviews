Oh. My. God.  We went here for our first anniversary on the recommendation of a colleague. We'd never been there before and were instantly impressed with the atmosphere and the restaurant itself. I had called ahead to get a customized menu made up to celebrate our special day and they had it ready to go! The food was A-FREAKING-MAZING. I've never asked to speak to the chef before, but I felt compelled to here. Portions are large, food is incredible, and prices are reasonable.  EAT HERE!!!!!
