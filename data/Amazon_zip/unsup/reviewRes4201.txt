Incredibly inventive food which is so interesting. The experience is great. But I can't give 5 stars for a few reasons: 1) 9 courses was just too much for my date and I. By the 7th course, we were pretty much full; 2) the food was fascinating and well prepared, but not always to my liking. I realize that this happens in pre-fixe meals, but I just didn't get into the smores and a couple of other dishes either; 3) they blasted Biggie Smalls from the stereo, which is cool, but it was so loud that I wasn't able to hear from the "high as a kite" waiter what it was that I was actually eating; 4) the meal was more expensive than it should be; although, it must be said that it was cool to see how damn hard the chefs were working behind the scenes; and, 5) the reservation process is obnoxious. Overall, the meal was good, but I just had the feeling that the chef and his posse felt like they were way too cool for us. This restaurant is very good, but not as good as Bon Soiree'. B.S. is the same idea, it's a little cheaper, it's food is better, and you don't have to jump through hoops to get a reservation. I very much miss Savoy Truffle which used to be in the same location as Schwa - now that was a place that rocked!
