OOH that carmelized cheese. The elusive 5 star pizza award is once again handed out to Pequods. 2 locations to serve you, one in morton grove for the nw people and one in the city on webster. quality and continuity is the same at each location so feel free to go wherever is closest. IF you do not like deep dish pizza, keep moving, this is their specialty. lets look at the pizza, shall we? First thing you notice is that like true deep dish pizza (ala uno/due) it is served at your table in the pan it was cooked in, this is very important as the hot pan continues to crisp the pizza as you wait for your next slice (pinoccio's in niles could take this lesson) so your za never gets soggy. Second, it looks like it should, lots of oh so good carmelized cheese on the edge of each slice. Thirdly, toppings are GENEROUS and excellent. Truly a sausage lovers dream, but the other toppings are just as good, just not as stand out. I am pretty big pizza eater, but 2 slices of pequods and I'm done. I'd reccommend sizing your pizza with a 2-3 slice expectancy. Also, pequods pizza has a great ability to be reheated and lose very little of it's original flavor. I attribute this to the low moisture content of the dough after it cooks, but who knows for sure. morton grove is a small place, but you can call ahead before you get there to get the pizza going. Chicago is a larger operation, but parking can suck. I know chicago will deliver, not sure about morton grove. Waitstaff in MG is very freindly. If you have out of town guests who are dying for unos/due's but you hate going downtown, feel confident with this fine representation of Chicago's Classic Deep Dish.
