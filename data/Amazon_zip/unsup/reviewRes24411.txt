Okay, I admit it, I'm a fan of the Food Network (despite the evilness of Brooke Johnson that Tony Bordain has so eloquently documented), and Jose Garces really seems like a likable fellow. But the best part? He runs a great restaurant!  This is our third visit to Mercat a la Planxa (it's become a part of our ritual when visiting Chicago). Can't think of a single tapa that we have had that wasn't good here.  Some suggestions: - The pulpo con patatas (octopus with potatoes) is one of the best renditions we have ever experienced, the octopus succulent and tender, almost melts in your mouth - The pimentos de padron are lovely, grilled just a tad and dressed with some olive oil and coarse salt - You simply can't have tapas in my book without jamon iberico de bellotas (the REALLY good stuff), and the plate here is very generously covered with those ethereal little slices of piggie goodness - $25 may seem like a lot but when you consider what this stuff costs retail, even in Spain, it's actually good value for your money - The dates with almonds are a very nice version of this dish, with the unusual twist of a silky cheese sauce drizzled over the top - Make sure to ask for some of the tomato bread, not the classic pan tumuca, but an interesting variation using bread similar to foccocia There is also a very good wine selection with some excellent and not frequently seen selections from a wide variety of Spanish wine regions, and a reasonably intriguing list of cocktails and specialty drinks. We've never made it past the tapas menu, so can't comment on the main menu dishes, but if they are anything like the quality and brilliance of the tapas, this is a real winner!
