I used to go to the Garcia's in Lincoln Square before they closed for remodeling and then found this, smaller sister restaurant just down the street in Ravenswood. I'm sticking with this one because you get the same meal for the same price but it has a cozier atmosphere that includes a bar. The chips and salsa (the saving or sinking grace of any Mexican restaurant) are very passable. And as far as appetizers go, the spinach and cheese quesadillas are absolutely delicious. Now, I always get the pollo (chicken) burrito with added avocado, onions, tomato, and sour cream. The thing is absolutely huge and easily good for a whole 'nother leftover meal. Not only that but it's cheap ($5 without the extras) and the chicken is seasoned just right and juicy. No neighborhood is complete without a cheap, authentic Mexican establishment that offers generous services. Garcia's is that establishment for Uptown/Ravenswood
