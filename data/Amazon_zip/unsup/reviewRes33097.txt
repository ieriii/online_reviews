Line can be a little long, but i think thats a good sign. Good crowd especially on saturdays. If you're looking for breakfast food at 2pm. Perfect spot, the crowd is damn near absent and they close at 3pm, so even better.. The food is on point and not too commercialized (yet) as they open more and more locations....Price is on point. You'll enjoy breakfast here...
