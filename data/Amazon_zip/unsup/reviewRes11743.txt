I had a pretty good experience at this pizzeria/micro brewery while I was visiting some friends back in Chicago. I used to be a huge fan of the Chicago style, deep dish pizza, but the pizza at this place is nothing like that - i.e. not any worse or better but just different. It's definitely thinner, and it seems they make it from scratch, comes in square shapes, on these hot sheets right out fo the oven? Good variety of fresh ingredients - you can definitely get creative here. We also tried a couple of different beers they make; I forget their names but they were all good.
