I have been going to Nuevo Leon for about a year now. Cheap, ok food... but here's the deal killer. I long thought that it might be the case that they reused the salsa and the jalapenos/carrots on the table. The other day, I witnessed a busboy clean the table off with a rag. Then he picked up the used salsa, wiped the inner rim WITH HIS FINGER, and delivered it straight to a table that just sat down. Not kidding. Stuck his hand in the USED salsa, brought it to the new customers. So gross.
