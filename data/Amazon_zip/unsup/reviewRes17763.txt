Mmm-kay, I'll keep it simple. Put this on your 'must go to' list. My wife and I were visiting from CA and were brought here by my sister. You'd never know it from the outside (a theme of restaurants & bars in Chicago it seems), but the inside is unbelievable...so are the drinks. What I like best: once the seats are sat in, no more folks allowed...until a seat is vacated...so get there early.
