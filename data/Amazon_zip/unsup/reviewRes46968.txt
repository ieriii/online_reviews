to my dismay... 114 reviews... thought the secret wasn't out about this chicago fave spot's rogers park location :( THE best bloody marys in this town and very accomodating service. they took a reservation for a 7-top for sunday morning brunch 30 mins before we showed up! i can't name one other place in the city that would honor that.  my only "semi" complaint is i wish the menu was more descriptive as far as accompaniments. (i would've loved to sub my potatoes for something else!)
