Just go if you can. Our friends had to wait a year for the reservations so I can't comment on that.  After reading about the chef in GQ, having Michael Carlson serve me my food, drop the F-bomb at our table, and call me homie made the night.  Food was damn great except one part of one course of the nine course meal.  It's a reason for me to come back. Apple Pie Soup and the Marshmallow Dragon Fish were the highlights. FYI, he said they swap out menus every season.
