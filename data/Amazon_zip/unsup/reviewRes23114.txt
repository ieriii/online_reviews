A friend kept raving about Irazu so I gave in and decided to try it. It's BYOB and conveniently located right next to a wine shop. I can't vouch for all of the food but I can provide my testament regarding the potato tacos. Here it is: If I had to choose a last meal on earth, those tacos would be in the running. Those sweet sweet potato tacos with the crunchy fried outside and light and fluffy inside. They also came with a cabbage salad that had a delicious, tangy vinegar dressing. I seriously considered bringing my plate into the bathroom so I could lick it clean without anyone seeing me. (That could have been the wine thinking for me though...) P.S. No corking fee and my whole meal was just $10 (plus tip).
