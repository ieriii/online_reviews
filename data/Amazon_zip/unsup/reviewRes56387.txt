This is one of the nicer family owned restaurants in Lincoln Park. I've been hitting up and down the street with lots of great food but this is the one place that just stuck to me!It's a very nice cozy small place that is run by a very nice man out front. We came in a saturday night that was busy booked with reservations. While we waited for our table we were given mini eggrolls to eat. It was sooo delicious. We were finally seated and I must say it was absolutely worth every minute of that wait. The appetizersof shrimp tempura and avocado wontons were scrumptious. My main course of the Simply It's beef was absolutely the most tender fillet mignon I've ever tried.To top it off, little rice cookies and oranges were given to me at the end of my meal. It doesn't get any better than this in Lincoln Park. I gotta come back for more!
