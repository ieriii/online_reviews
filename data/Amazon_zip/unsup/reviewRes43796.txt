This place kind of gets lost in the shadows of Morton's, Gibson's and even the Chicago Chop House, but I think it's pretty much in the same league as far as steakhouses go. We had a GREAT meal here to celebrate the fact that I'm finally employed again. Started off with drinks ... the cocktails are really well done here. Score! Shrimp cocktail appetizer was next, which includes four pieces of fresh, perfectly chilled shrimp. For dinner, I got the 8 oz. filet, which was really, really good. So tender, it dissolved in my mouth. My boyfriend got the portobello ravioli, which I loved as well. Awesome flavors. We shared the sauteed spinach and baked potato sides, both very good, and got the chocolate terrine, which was a delicious ending to an amazing meal. In comparison to my fav steakhouse in Chicago (David Burke's), my filet here lacked some of the flavor that the DBs filet had. And my potato could have had some more flavor as well. Overall, though, Kinzie shouldn't be forgotten when you're making dinner plans. Impeccable service. Really. Really great food and a great ambiance. I loved it here. And they don't overcharge you for your food, which is a HUGE bonus.
