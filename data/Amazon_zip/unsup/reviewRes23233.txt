Lao Sze Chuan, you are the winner of the best Chinese restaurant in Chicago. You are the best in your class. You're clean, you're authentic, and you have class. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge Chinese food fan, so I won't be one your regulars. I'll probably stop by once a year. If I had to pick one dish to recommend all my fellow Yelpers, I would say the Orange Beef Tenderloin is my #1 choice. ~$12, but it's a good split between 4 people.
