I saw a listing in one of the Chicago tourism magazines for this restaurant and I expected really good things. However, I was a little disappointed. The staff was friendly and they were all decked out in their comfortable clothes with bandanas in their hair. Good look. The place was very relaxing and it had a good aura. I had the pastrami on rye today. I have to say, I was not impressed. The bread was burnt and crunchy. Also, the pastrami was really fatty and it didn't appear to be cooked all the way through. I had to pick off the fatty part of the individual strips of pastrami in order to eat the rest of the sandwich. Gross, yes. But, it had to be done. I'm giving this place two stars because of the sandwich. The environment was nice but I don't see myself going back anytime soon.
