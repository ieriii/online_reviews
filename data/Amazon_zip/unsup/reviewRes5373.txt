I stopped by over the weekend after a nice long bike ride on the lake path so I was pretty hungry by the time we ordered. I tried out the Chicken Thigh Kebabs. They were not good.... Chewy, no real flavor to speak of. Normally even a bad kebab can be made edible by dousing it in tzatziki but even their sauce was weak and not very tasty. The only stars earned were based upon the following; I did like the decor and layout of the place and the staff was very friendly.  Seems like yelp loves the place so who knows, I may give it a second chance at some point but I am not in a big rush to do so.
