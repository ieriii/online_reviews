Little Bucharest is fantastic. I have to say I was teetering between a 4 and 5 star but the service was so great that the 5 star wins out. Seriously, I've never been treated so well in all of my dining experiences, from inexpensive local places to Charlie Trotters, this was service. On top of that, the food was great, and the atmosphere was some fine line between stark eastern Europe and oddly cozy. Loved it.
