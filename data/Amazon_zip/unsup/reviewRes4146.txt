The food is the best that you will ever have. I am not going to insult anybody by trying to wrap my English around it. As a former restaruant critic and a sociopath, I can attest that you won't find anything better in Chicago...that's not why I am writing today. I am writing to pay homage to the Brothers Carlson...two of the coolest cats that I have come across in all of my travels. There are ballads, myths and legends circulated about men less than you. Thanks again for Saturday night. Michael and Seth, you define "good people".
