Crisp is delish! The wings are massive and amazing and the budda bowls are yummy! I've never had a burrito so I can't comment. The restaurant is BYOB which is great. Parking is street parking on busy Broadway so that can be tricky. Seating for groups can be difficult if going during peak hours of lunch or dinner - picnic table style. It's not fancy but it's great food!
