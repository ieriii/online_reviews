I've been to a Brazilian joint for brunch in the past, but this time I went for the full-blown dinner experience. The "salad" bar consisted of vegetables, an array of seafood, meatballs, and deli meats - all of them fantastic. Although I found it odd to find Japanese rolls at the bar, I got my roll fix anyway. The mushroom risotto was amazing but I didn't want to stuff myself before the meat parade arrived. After our salad bar trip, we were served three small dishes - spinach, mashed potatoes and fried bananas. The mashed potatoes were deliciously creamy! Then came the meat parade! Excellent pork tenderloin. I can't say that I remember all of the meat that I got, but all I can say is: go medium rare! That's when they are at their most tender and delicious. We also got a Brazilian ginger ale that had a hint of cherry, which we both enjoyed. The bill came to around $120. A bit too high for me to return on a regular basis, but every once in a while it's totally worth it.
