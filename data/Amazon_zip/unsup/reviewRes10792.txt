Delicious pancakes! Every bite of the white chocolate 4 berry pancakes made our eyes roll back into our heads. Loved the medley of berries and the luscious white chocolate sauce on top. I was worried the pancakes might be supersweet but they were the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  The portions were huge too. The two of us shared the pancakes and still had some left doggie bag. So why the 3 stars for the Bongo Room? Their pancakes are no doubt amazing but as a breakfast/brunch place, I felt the rest of their food was lacking. The spinach, smoked gouda, and roasted pepper omelette was pretty bland and the potatoes/hash browns served on the side were barely edible. We ended up pushing it aside after a few bites and returning to the pancakes. Prices are fairly reasonable and if you can manage to go on a weekday, you'll avoid the crowds and long wait. I'll definitely be back but next time it will be for pancakes only.
