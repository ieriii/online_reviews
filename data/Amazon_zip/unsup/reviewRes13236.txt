Love this place. The beer selection is fantastic. Not only that, but the beer itself is excellent. My husband belongs to the Mug Club because he loved their beer so much. He's really hoping that the new brewery expands their distribution to the West eventually since we are moving soon. In addition to good beer, the hosts and waitstaff are really friendly and usually efficient. About half the time that we have been, we are in larger groups (6 or more). Even with the challenge of multiple orders and us having a baby to accommodate, they have been precise and never once balked at splitting a check. The food is great. I first visited Revolution Brewery for Brunch. It's a small menu, but everything we've had from it is really good. We've returned countless times for brunch, lunch and dinner. I absolutely love that you can get a salad for no extra charge with your burger. And it's a GOOD salad - made with all spinach leaves. Yum. The one gripe I would share is not relevant to me, but to my husband. He has twice purchased growlers. The first time, we lost half of the beer on the backseat floorboard because we didn't realize that it had tipped over. The plastic shrink wrap around the screwcap did not get the job done with sealing it. Lesson learned. The next time he got a growler, I held it between my feet in the car for the whole car ride home. When he went to get a drink from it later that evening, it was flat. He ended up pouring the whole thing out. So, that has been disappointing. I'm not counting that in my review, because it doesn't pertain to the restaurant. However, I wanted to share our cautionary tale to help others and perhaps spur the folks at Revolution Brewery to examine the growler concept and see if they can make it better.
