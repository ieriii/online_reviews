I made reservations at q for a Saturday night when my parents were in town, knowing my dad would love the BBQ and my mom would enjoy the southern-style food. My friend also joined us for the evening. We had hoped for a booth, but the atmosphere felt just as cozy at our table, despite the fact that we were seated in the center of the dining room. I had heard going things about the Pimm's Cup - so my friend and I decided to go for it. My parents both opted for wine. Apparently the "good" aspects of the Pimm's Cup referred to its potency...which I can't complain about. It was bit stiff for my first drink of the night, but we were able to down them by the end of the meal. We were also given complimentary chips, bread and pickles - I hate pickles, yet couldn't stop eating these. Go figure. We started with the Hominy, Smoked Corn and Black Beans Salad, which was delicious and very fresh. In retrospect, we really didn't need it considering the amount of food that came with our meals, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. We all ordered the pulled pork shoulder except my mom, who ordered the pulled pork sandwich. The pork itself was delicious, as were the sauce options that come with it. I'm a major sauce person, as is my dad - four sauces is a big deal. The North Carolina Vinegar and South Carolina Mustard were my favorites, though you can't go wrong with any of them. I'm fairly certain we managed to order almost every side among the four of us, but I only remember mine. I chose the bruleed mac and cheese and seasonal vegetables - both were wonderful. As others have mentioned, the service was great and very attentive (without being overbearing) throughout the meal; no complaints there. Overall, an excellent meal and first experience at q - I'll definitely be back. Bonus points for the location...I'm always a fan of a great restaurant nearby in the Gold Coast :)
