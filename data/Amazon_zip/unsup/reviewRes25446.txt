I went today with a coworker to have pizza for lunch. We were both in the mood for pizza and we decided to come to Pequods for their lunch special. When we got there the place was EMPTY and this made us happy because it meant that we were not going to have to wait as long. 35 minutes pass by and nothing. No pizza, the server didn't come once to refill our drinks. We decided to leave, we had to be at work in 5 mins and it took us 20 minutes to get there because of traffic. So my advice is if you don't have more than an hour to waste then don't go here apparently it takes the same time to prepare a 7' pizza than it does a 12' deep dish. Pizza is great don't get me wrong it among my favorites, this review is for the service we received.
