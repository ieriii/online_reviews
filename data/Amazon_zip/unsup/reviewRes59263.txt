If you're looking for real Chinese food - not American "Chinese" takeout food - this is where to find it. I'm not Chinese but I've spent a lot of time in China, so I know what I'm talking about. The majority of customers were Chinese when I went - that's how you know it's good. There were a number of non-Chinese people there too though - it's sure to please no matter what your background is.It is quite big and can be somewhat crowded. Tables and chairs are nothing fancy; it's very typical of the average place you'd walk into off the street in China. If you insist on a quiet or more upscale ambiance - or if you're going on a first date and don't know your date's preferences - I'd look elsewhere. But if it's high food quality and affordable price you're looking for, this place can't be beat.
