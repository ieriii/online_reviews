THE REVIEW First, I love Chicago in the summertime! I've been exploring my River North neighborhood in flip flops. Every Saturday I notice a huge line outside Rick Bayless' eponymous Chicago restaurant. So I finally checked it out with the gf. We had a great time. You have to get lucky. Most of the patrons are walk-ins. We scored a table just as we walked in. The seating gods were kind to us. The service is no-frills which perfectly suits the casual vibe. The prices are very reasonable considering the brand name locale and chef. I recommend ordering 2 dishes at a time. The portions are small and so the food gets cold very quickly. Just chill and have some beer at a leisurely pace. The menu changes to reflect the seasons. We ordered: Flautas de Puerco- Maple Creek Farms pork, pea tendrils, and cascabel-tomatillo sauce. Yummy! Enchiladas Gratinadas- homemade tortillas with chipotle braised beef. So good, but you have to eat it quickly while it stays hot. Tamal Churriqueso- a corn masa tamal with hoemmade chorizo, avocado, queso cheese. This was a soft and creamy tamal. The flavors were sweet and delicate which was nice bc the other dishes are bolder. Queso Fundido de Milanesa- All I can say is that I like fried breaded crispy pork in cheese! It comes in cute iron skillet with fresh tortillas and two kinds of hot sauces (red and green). Very rich, but dee-lish. Grass-Fed Organic Grilled Ribeye Steak- This was sooo good! The grill really imparted a nice smoked flavor that complimented the spices in the sauce. It came with plantains and black beans. Beers are $4-$5. Cheap for River North. I am definitely coming back.
