In a city like Chicago with an abundance of delicious restaurants it's hard to pick a favorite. But I will say the Chicago Diner is one of my favorite places. I am beyond obsessed. It's a diner, which normally is not the kind of place I would ever want to go to, but this place is an exception. I've never been into traditional "diner" food. I grew up vegetarian, so the idea of a burger and fries is NOT appetizing. However, the menu here is entirely vegetarian and/or vegan. I have tried 90% of the food on the menu and everything is bursting with flavor. They have a fab selection of local beers too. One of the most popular sandwiches, and my personal favorite, is the Reuben. Growing up without meat, I have never eaten a real Reuben, so this was a totally new experience for me! WOW! It's huge and has delicious soy meat that is flavored to perfection. I don't know what they do to this sandwich and I don't really care, its sooo f-ing good! I have taken tons of friends and all my family members to Chicago Diner and it is unanimously one of our fav places. The staff is always friendly, and helpful. The "milkshake" there is pure blissful heaven. I can't say enough good things! Every time I go in, I beg the staff to open one in LA. A girl can dream! Warning, during peak hours this place can get slammed, and I've had to wait over 45 mins... but it's SO worth it! Whether or not you are Veg/ or Vegan or a meat lover, this place rocks! Keep up the good work Chicago Diner!
