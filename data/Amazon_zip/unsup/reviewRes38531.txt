Enough said here. I'm from Milwaukee and moved a couple blocks away from Hopleaf. It was recomended to me from an ex-Hopleaf-Bartender who owns (now 2) great beer bars in Milwaukee that emulate Hopleaf in their extensive, massive selection (Palm Tavern and Maple Sugar). Needless to say, if you love beer in a laid back atmosphere, go to Hopleaf. Yeah, if you go on Saturday or Friday, plan to spend an hour or two sampling beer and waiting for your table (you can order apps at the bar). The food is EXCELLENT and a perfect complement to thier beer. Mussels (get the beer ones), stew, rabbit, charcuterie, sandwichs, everything is top notch.
