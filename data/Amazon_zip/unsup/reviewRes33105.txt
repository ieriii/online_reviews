we walked into a completely empty restuarnat on a sunday night with a party of 8. interestingly decorated place that is HUGE with romantic lighting. We ordered roasted beet carpaccio - YUM, never thought that beets are so good by themselves! eggplant spread - good, flavorful house smoked salmon - very good saganaki - ok sausage stuffed chicken thigh - good, very tender braised short rib goulash - very tender, YUM chicken schnitzel - good vegetarian goulash - better than the beef. wow. stuffed cabbage - good. the owner was gracious and gave us free romanian beers and the food was filling and good. The service was prompt and courteous.
