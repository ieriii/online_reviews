We got the absolute RED CARPET treatment here. We stayed at the Hampton Inn which is connected to Ruth's Chris. Since we were here for New Years, it was FREEZING outside and we loved the idea of not having to go outside or wear a coat. The host met us at the connection, and walked us downstairs to a lovely booth by a window. After ordering our dirty martinis and a bottle of wine, we got the attention of the host again to see if the chef would specially make an appetizer for us. He was so very accommodating and was very happy to help meet our needs. I ordered the sizzling filet and have the video to prove it! I don't really remember what else we had to eat but I just know everything was delicious and amazing. We really couldn't have asked for a better way to end our trip. This Ruth's Chris left a lasting impression on us and I would go back if I go back to Chicago.
