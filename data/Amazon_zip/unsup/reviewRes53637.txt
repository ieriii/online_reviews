I've only had the wings, which were very good. I mean these are the best wings I have ever eaten. But there were a lot of cons....1) Parking is hard to find2) It's pretty expensive. The chicken is superior to brands like KFC and Popeyes, but in terms of price and quality combined, I will go for the competitors.3) On a very busy night expect to wait a long time. This is a small complaint, but at least there's other stores around so you can walk around while you wait.4) This is my biggest complaint. The guy behind the counter has an attitude problem. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but if I had to try to explain it, it's like OK your done, get the f out of here now. Who's next? Given all these cons, I won't mind going back, since the chicken was good, but I won't go on a regular basis.
