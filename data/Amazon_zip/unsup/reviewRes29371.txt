I'm torn about Opart Thai House. I've lived nearby for almost a year, and the other day I decided to try it for the first time. We called for delivery and were very surprised to learn that they would not deliver to our house! We live only 1.3 miles from the restaurant, and apparently we are two houses away from the edge of their delivery zone. (As a comparison, we also live two houses out of delivery zone of Sticky Rice, which is more than 2 miles away, and they still deliver to us!!) Additionally, the server speaking to me on the phone was very rude when I tried to confirm the order. But okay, fine, we'll go pick up the food. We left the house right away, and the food was ready as soon as we arrived. Very quick! We went straight home, got plates out, and immediately noticed that the food was all cold. Considering we live so close to the restaurant (and we were driving, not walking), that seems really fast for the food to be cold. Everything had to be re-heated. That being said, I really liked what we had. The pad thai was pretty good, although not my favorite. But it was a big helping with plenty of chicken. The pad kratiam prik thai (beef in a white pepper garlic sauce) was absolutely delicious! And the fried wonton appetizer was also very good. Maybe this is a better restaurant for eating in?
