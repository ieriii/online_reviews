This place is GROSS.I talked to my server and she said that they don't even make their pizzas there! They get their dough frozen from some secret Giodannos factory and they thaw it and then bake it. When have you had great frozen food? Sorry to burst the legend bubble, but this place is definitely NOT THE REAL DEAL!
