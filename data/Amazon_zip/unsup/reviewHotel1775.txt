i can't attest to the sleeping rooms, but i can as far as meeting planning goes!  we held a corporate meeting for about 350 in their ballroom today, and minus a few AV hiccups (our own fault), it went without a hitch. their meeting space is nicely updated, affordable and convenient for loop offices via a short walk.  AV and catering sales staff were very responsive, friendly and attentive. i'll definitely use them again if i can!
