Sure, the service is a little on the abrasively indifferent side: They aren't timely with our orders or keen on checking up on us. And when they come around, they just plop stuff down on our table. My diabetic friend needed a sugary drink STAT and while they acknowledged her urgent request, they went back to counting their cash-- leaving the frantic busboy to deal with her order a few minutes later. And sure, the whole place is an asthmatic's worst nightmare: Even though they have these huge vents over the grills, you feel like you've walked into an choking, billowy charcoal cloud. My lungs and my coat didn't stand a chance. And I left the place smelling like a grill, feeling like my lungs took a beating. BUT THE FOOD IS WORTH ALL OF THAT! Shortly after we ordered, one of the ladies came by and dropped off 30 banchan dishes, along with a personal bowl of rice and soup. Then came our seafood pancake and an array of meats (from varieties of beef, chicken, and squid). We FEASTED with shots of soju. My favorites of the evening were the bulgogi and spicy squid. I love variety and family style meals, hence this was a meal of epic proportions. Other things of note: No BYOB, NO BYOB!
