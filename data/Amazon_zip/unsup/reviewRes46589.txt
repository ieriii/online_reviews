Okay - this is the best burger joint I've been to in quite some time, it is seriously amazing. Our waiter was extremely nice and helpful with the overpowering menu. I got the bacon cheddar cheeseburger and it was about a 15 out of 10, literally couldn't have been better. They have a huge salad bar, apparenty it was the first salad bar in Chicago. R.J's also has a lot of character, I loved the environment and the music was great. At the end of our dinner the waiter brought a hot chocolate chip cookie and ice cream covered in chocolate since it was our first time visiting the restaurant so I would recommend mentioning it if it is your first time. Only downside, I dropped $50 for two burgers and 3 drinks... Great place.
