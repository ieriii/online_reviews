coast is the most delicious, fresh tasting sushi in the city in my opinion. i can handle its swanky vibes, slightly higher than average prices and witnessing plenty of 30-somethings on first dates because the food is just so tasty. i always get: the crunchy spicy tuna roll - oh my gosh. the tuna melts in your mouth! no joke. if you love sushi like i do, this place won't disappoint.
