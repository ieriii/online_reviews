Once again, the service was below par here. Although the bus boy filled our waters and cleared the empty dishes, the waitress couldn't be bothered to change the grill or check up on us. Actually, their usual apathy was nice when the meal was over because we weren't rushed out when the check was due. As in like it took like 15 minutes to wait for the check and pay. Otherwise the appetizers were their usual random goodness and I have nobody to blame for overlooked beef but myself. Be sure to "remind" them about soup if your meal is supposed to come with it, as they tend to forget it when focusing on ignoring your table. You know how the hot girl always goes back to the douchebag? That's us consistently returning here to be blighted in exchange for the opportunity to cook our own food when dining out.
