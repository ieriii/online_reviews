Went here about 8 weeks ago on a Friday night. It had a huge line with all tables taken. I had the Gunthorp Chicken and my friend had the Woodland Mushroom. My friend loved it. Me on the other hand, not so much. The chicken was tasteless and they used too much lemon on it, thus drowning the taste of the entire sub. The point of a chicken-based sandwich is to taste the chicken, and I did not get any taste from it. They could've put turkey or duck in there and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference because of the overpowering lemon. Maybe they screwed up that time and would love to hear other comments on the Gunthorp Chicken. Now the Bean Hot Chocolate...OMG! Fresh is just amazing! It is unlike any hot chocolate you've ever had. It's like an entirely different taste, but something about it makes love with your tongue :D This is a drink only for those prepared to taste what REAL Chocolate tastes like. It's more bitter and less sugary, which is the opposite of store-bought chocolate mix. You have been Warned! :D :D Dunno if I'll go there again without another opinion. That chicken was just a disappointment. Should've stuck with the veggie options. PS: Parking sucks and almost lost where my car was parked. My bad I guess. They need to get a bigger space for both restaurants :D
