As a local come here often; a bit pricey but good mussels and overall good wholesome food. Love it in the winter with the cozy library fireplace area, tin ceilings and festive holiday. Bar areas ( there are two!) are well stocked with beers on tap and Morris, one of the bar tenders, is wonderful!Definitely check it out but remember the tab will be a bit high. Oh on sundays they have bloody marys with beer backs...
