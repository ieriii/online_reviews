You know.. just another saturday brunch w. Rahm Emanuel... Yea that right I saw the mayor here. Anyways... food was good. I had the huevos rancheros, and boy oh boy does Nana have a way with making amazing taco meat. It was super flavorful. The Bloody Mary was a lil blah & service was off, but I'll blame the Mayor for that one.  I plan on returning, we sat next to the kitchen and everything coming out looked amazing. Def check it out, maybe you'll be so lucky to dine near the King of Chicago.
