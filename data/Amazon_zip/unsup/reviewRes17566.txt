Was very excited to try the Indian food in Chicago. Called CEO delivery to get take out from India house. We ordered the new Delhi vegetable dish with rotis, vegetable biryani and the raita. The vegetable and rotis were great but the biryani was not even close. I have had biryani and this was simply steamed rice with some veggies thrown in along with the coloring; the raita was sour. I was really looking forward to a good biryani in the cold Chicago winter, but was very disappointed.
