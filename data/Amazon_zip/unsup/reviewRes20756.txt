the gage is a perfect after work spot. it has a large bar area so it's not too hard to get seated. you can eat at the bar if you get hungry after a drink or two. i've been trying to find a place like this. the bartenders were really friendly. it has an interesting atmosphere. there were so many interesting options that you don't see on most menus which is such a breath of fresh air. i ate the rabbit salad on a whim and it was pretty tasty. a little heavy on the horseradish or was it the garlic (?), but the rabbit was cooked well and it was a unique concept. my coworker ate the fish and chips and said they were delicious. yay for the gage! good to eat: braised rabbit salad
