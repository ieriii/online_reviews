Zed is a fancier more gourmet fogo de chao. Great for out of town guests and special occasions. I LOVED the ginger bourbon lemonade, but only get it if you really like ginger. The food is tasty and they have a vast variety. The space is beautiful. High ceilings and very spacious. Feels like a modern lodge with zen garden accents. Also the rooftop and bar is great to just get a drink. I think the roof will be very popular during the summer. Love the rocks in the "zen garden"! :) One star off because it's kind of pricey.
