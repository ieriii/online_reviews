I am going with 12 stars on my experience today. Had: - Ahodaga: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. - Lemonade - Chocolate Milk : Ultra : chocolate shot + whole milk  - Churros The Ahodaga is INSANE - I had to stop after the first bite and catch my breathe - I got it HOT - how I like it - and it was the most perfect "heat/spice" - period. I may never try anything else on the menu ever again - its one of those things - if you know what I mean. Pure LOVE
