Great selection--healthy and yummy in some cases, and I enjoyed the efficiency of ordering and paying and having someone bring it out to you. If you get here before 10 on the weekends, you should be good to go. The OJ is great and I love that they have Pelligrino. I agree with the posters that commended the oatmeal. The bagel sandwich is also delicious and could feed two people. I am not a huge fans of such close quarters, but it works here. Don't talk about anything juicy--or anything you don't want others to hear!
