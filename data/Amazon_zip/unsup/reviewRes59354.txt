I was pretty excited to score a Groupon to Fox & Obel because I knew my foodie husband would LOVE it. Sadly, F & O just isn't what it used to be. Once upon a time, they were the only gourmet food show in town, but now there is just too much competition and the folks at F & O just don't seem to care a whit.We came to buy 'picnic' food for a family outing to Lincoln Park Zoo and were really happy with our purchases: Olive ciabatta rolls, roasted turkey breast, gypsy salami, gruyere, rosemary and olive oil chips, cookies and drinks... yep, for $50.00. The service was mixed - the young African-American man at the deli was rude and acted like we were inconveniencing him by ordering. Sorry for asking you to do your job, pal. None of the random store employees in the near empty store greeted us or asked us if we could use any help - we could have, by the way. The cashier, a lovely African-American college student was the highlight of our visit with her winning smile and great attitude. She gets the third star.So, the food was great and our picnic was a huge success. Would I ever go back? No. There are just too many other great gourmet grocers with nice staff, awesome products and better accessibility.
