I ate here a few weeks ago while visiting from California. l close my eyes and dream about this place. I plan to attempt to recreate the amazing blueberry shake I had there so I can enjoy a little bit of heaven in San Diego. I had the Radical Reuben with the perfectly prepared sweet potato fries. Ahhh...writing this is making me hungry. Can someone reading this in Chicago mail me one? Pure deliciousness.
