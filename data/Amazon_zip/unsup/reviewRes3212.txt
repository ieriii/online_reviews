Went in here with my roomie today looking for a place to eat, and boy was I happy we found Crisp! She had mentioned it before, but I had no idea what I was in for! Seoul Sassy wings are the BEST wings I've ever had in my life!! They are so delicious, they don't even need dipping sauce! A little pricy (5 wings for 9 bucks), but for the size of the wings, it's totally worth it! I will definitely be visiting Crisp again to try more options!
