Close down the kitchen and leave the bar open, cause the pizza sucks and the beer kicks ass!Seriously, if you like pizza steer clear because this place makes me never want to even head to the east coast simply out of fear of the pizza. But that cannot be true... I hear that New England pizza is amazing. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't and if it is this place may destroy the reputation that is New England Style Pizza.More Beer! More Beer! -Fear
