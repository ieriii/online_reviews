Loved the food! Great service and excellent food. Ordered steak tacos and tostadas and both were super fresh! My friend had the cheese enchiladas and the sauce was amazing! Also the chips that they serve with the salsa is served warm (fresh!). Prices are also fairly reasonable for tacos, would definitely return there again!
