I'm no expert, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a hotdog joint as good as Hot Doug's.The flavor combinations are inspired and like nothing I've tasted before. I had the Irish Banger with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese and my friend had the Red Wine and Demi-Glace Venison Sausage with Fig Goat's Butter and Raclette CheeseBoth were mouth-wateringly delicious, especially as we were so hungry from waiting over 2 hours (that's right - 2 hours - but so worth it). I personally preffered mine, but only by a fraction because I found the sauce on the Venison hotdog a little sweet. The venison itself was delicious, as was the raclette cheese.The Irish banger was also good, and the mustard was the perfect spiceyness with just the right amount of beer flavour. The rich cheddar topped it off magnificently.We also tried the duck fat fries which were as excellent as everyone says. However, if they don't interest you, I'd advise avoiding Fridays and Saturdays (the only time the duck fat fries are available), as hear the wait is much shorter on weekdays. But personally I think the fries are worth the extra time.I definitely will go again if I have the chance, and highly recommend it to any hotdog fan.
