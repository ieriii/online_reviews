Despite its small portions and probably too high prices, I really like this gem in Edgewater. It's home to many culinary brilliant dishes that have never failed to disappoint me. Highlights of my career have been the pumpkin ravioli and sweet potato fries. Double my salary and I'd eat here at least once a week.
