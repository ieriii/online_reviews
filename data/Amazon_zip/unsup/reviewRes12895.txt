We went to Texas de Brazil for my birthday this year, and what a feast! We had a great server, the meat was sublime and I'm still kind of stuffed! TdB is a place to go when you have a good appetite because the gauchos will come by as long as your tab is flipped over to green for "yes, more meat plz". The filet mignon was like butter, the bacon wrapped filet was excellent. We missed the lamb chops this time, but there's always the next time. If you want desert, just plan to take it to go. The white Sangria was perfect and the salad bar is more than enough to please even the pickiest vegetarian. Vegans may not find it quite as appealing. Depending on your budget, a great place for a special occasion, anniversary or date night. Join their e-club for deals via email, especially the birthday coupon for B1G1 free with a dinner purchase.
