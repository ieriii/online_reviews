I was a deep dish virgin until Gino's. We went with a local that strongly recommended another deep dish pizza place over this one---but were already hungry and given that it takes 45-60 minutes for a pizza (?!) , this was closer so we chose Gino's. There was a huge line outside---so at first glance this looks like an omen for good food (popular, rave reviews, long line/must be worth waiting for...etc) , but not a good thing for hungry people. The plus side in the long line scenario: the weather was nice and we could break apart from our small group and head into the bar to grab a drink to bring outside while waiting. The drinks we had: Their sangria is "meh" and the margarita made me want to walk back to the bartender and say, "dude, where's my tequila?!"---weak and NOT worth $8. My idea of a salad is real, mixed greens---not iceberg lettuce with some black olives, onion slices and half-ripe tomatoes. The main course hadn't arrived and this far into the meal not a Gino's believer---but kept an open mind regarding the pizza. The crust is more of a vehicle for quality toppings in my vision of a perfect pizza. Bottom line on the pizza at Gino's East is this: (I know the fans won't like this, sorry) the crust tasted like my grade school cafeteria pizza---a little uncooked, a little burnt and bland. Too much tomato sauce and not enough mushroom in the mushroom and cheese pizza. Our server was nice, he was busy but pleasant. Would maybe give another try (if I wasn't really hungry and had loads of time) in case they were having an off night-but would keep the expectations low.
