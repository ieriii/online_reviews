We made the trek from HydePark all the way to Boystown just to go to this diner. It was well worth the journey! I got the Titanic Burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I appreciated the details, fake bacon on my seitan burger made me feel like I was getting the full diner experience vegan style. Would love to try the desserts sometime but was too full from chowing my whole meal!
