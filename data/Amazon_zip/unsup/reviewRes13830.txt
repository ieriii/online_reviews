Originally had every intention to fill a burger craving at Kuma's tonight...but was rejected and Revolution Brewing Co. was tonight's "sloppy second". Only it wasn't sloppy. No where near it. You know that feeling you get when you pass by the kitchen with leftover chocolate cake that screams... "EAT ME." This place was like that, only it whispered "COME INSIDE" with class and a line of must-try beer. Windows wide open with an exquisite selection of beers on a fabulous Spring evening... WHY THE HELL NOT?! Poison? Coup d'tat (dry, spicy French-style saison abundantly dry-hopped with Spalt hops)...even if I couldn't pronounce it for the life of me, 7.5% ABV for $6/tulip. Also got a chance to taste the Iron Fist Pale Ale (Dry-hopped American ale featuring Centennial, Cascade, Chinook and Amarillo hop varieties) for $5/pint. Also, BACON POPCORN. And don't bother eating it with a fork. Burgers were average so I would really just come back for the beer and bacon popcorn!!!
