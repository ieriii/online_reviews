My boyfriend and I have started going to Nana's for brunch nearly every time I am in town. We are bordering on obsessed. The service is great - friendly and attentive servers, and someone always refills your coffee just when you think you'd like some more. And the food ... I've yet to be disappointed after four or five visits. Among my favorites have been the chef skillet, huevos rancheros, and the homemade English muffin breakfast. When they say homemade, they really mean it - the English muffin came out warm, fresh, and delicious. Pay attention to whatever the specials are that day - I've pumpkin pancakes and beignettes that were to die for. Also, it looks like they've now gotten their liquor license, and still do BYOB for free on Wednesdays. PLUS - they are all organic and local. Go to Nana's!! We love them!
