Among all the Brazilian Restaurants downtown, this is my favorite! In their salad bar you can find the most awesome risotto I've ever tasted! They have a lot of meat selection and just like what they say in the rest of the reviews here...they really excel when it comes to the service, ambiance and of course the food. That's why whenever we have special celebrations in our family...we like going here! The only thing that kept me from giving them five stars is their parking. I know parking is discounted but, it still a lot!Anyway, try this place and for sure...you will come home happy and full!
