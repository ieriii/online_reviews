One word - YUMMM. Not sure that's a word, but I'll go on... The only reason for four stars and not five is that I felt it was a touch pricey for a "local neighborhood" spot with very little ambiance. This is a great spot for a date, a group of girlfriends or parents in town (I came with two of my gal pals). The crowd is boisterous and you are immediately welcomed with big smiles when you walk in, even if you are 10 minutes late (as I was). I had one or three delicious martinis. The dinner menu options are incredibly hard to choose from but I landed on the pumpkin ravioli. I was not disappointed. The dish was filling and very, very flavorful, leaving me excited for the next time I venture out of the Gold Coast to Sapori. And not to be outdone by the food but the service was wonderful as well.
