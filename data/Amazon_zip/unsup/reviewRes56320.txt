Yay for my first Yelp review ever~! I had to just write a review for Simply It because it's simply amazing. I've been here at least ten times already ever since I discovered it last summer, and the food, service, and atmosphere has consistently been very good. Being away from home (VA), it makes me really miss Vietnamese food. Now, I know that Argyle is much closer to me, yet I still venture out to this place all the time despite the 7..8 minute walk from the El. Why? Not only is the food really good, but I was greeted with such warmness that it made me feel so homey. Cau Tuan, the owner is such a nice man. He treated me like I was part of his family and that's what I appreciate most. And his staff is very hospitable as well. The service is wonderful; very attentive and quick. I always get the Banh Xeo, Avocado Wontons as appetizers. I usually don't really like getting Banh Xeo at other restaurants, but their version is actually really good, and the portion is big too. Other good ones include the Seafood Eggrolls and Calamari Salad. I've tried a variety of their entrees. I like the Pineapple Calamari a lot along with the King Crab Pasta, and Seafood Noodles. Though they don't have a dessert menu, we are always given a small treat at the end of our meal whether it is rice cakes, fruit, or even fried banana! Also try the bubble tea! It's amazingly good!!The place is so good, that we keep coming back with friends. In fact, we're going tonight! :)
