I had a harder time than I thought walking out on Piece. The past three times I've eaten here, twice delivery and once in house, I was disappointed. The in house experience was lame. We got lucky and it was not even close to busy. But our pizza crust was so thin that the toppings didn't stay on, and the crust was soggy. Lame. Delivery tonight took forever, sure snowpocalypse and all, but still. The pizza arrived as if it had been made yesterday, and lacking the basil we ordered. In the past 3 or 4 months, I've started to make my own pizza. White pizza, like piece, and I must say that I can make a pizza just as good as they can. Maybe that's why I'm less and less impressed with piece as time goes by. I'd like to find a delicious thin crust pizza with a sauce. I've never liked Piece's red pizzas.
