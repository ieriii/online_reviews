I've never had the food, but I hear it's good. My favorite time to go to The Bad Apple is late at night. It's nice to finish off the night with a treat, and they have most any drink you could want. It's a big place, and the staff is helpful and friendly. I don't go there often, mostly because I don't identify with the crowd, but they're interesting to watch, especially at around closing time when the young bachelors in the room start making more and more desperate moves.
