finally made it here for the first time last night. it was very good, but nothing really stood out. and nothing i had made me want to go back. we had a very enjoyable meal, don't get me wrong. and nothing was bad. it's just that nothing was amazing either. we had a reservation for four at 730. when we arrived, we were seated right in front of the door. i mean, seriously, right it front. they say restaurants are not supposed to have tables that are clearly worse than others, but this one was bad, really bad. i did ask if there was possibly another table we could have further from the door. but the hostess informed me they were full. it wasn't a huge deal, but maybe our experience would have been slightly better if we didn't feel like we were sitting with the valet guy. the food was good. we had the stuffed mozzarella with prosciutto for an app. it was one of the best things we had. highly recommend trying it. for entrees, between the four of us, we tried the noodles with a veal ragu, the artichoke tortellini with peas, the scallop appetizer, and the shellfish stew. all of them were good. but nothing was particularly amazing. i'd say the noodles with the veal ragu was probably my favorite. it also happens to be what the server recommended we try. so thumbs up there. service was great. very nice and attentive. so, overall i'd say if you really wanna try it, go for it. but don't go out of your way if you're on the fence. i also heard their outside area is amazing in the summer. so maybe i'll go back then.
