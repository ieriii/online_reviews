I did enjoy my pizza at Spacca Napoli, it was the price that didn't thrill me.  I joined a few friends from work here last Sunday. I strated out with the Melanzane (Fried eggplant simmered with Italian imported tomatoes, basil and garlic) which was much different than I had expected. It was served cold, and quite mushy. It had an interesting taste, but wasnt my favorite (I probably wouldn't order the Melanzane again).  For my entree I ordered the Funghi pizza, which was actually just a cheese pizza with mushrooms. It was tasty. I wasn't blown away by the food, but it was good. I am still having a hard time justifying the price of everything on the menu. My meal alone was about $30, more than I usually spend on lunch for myself. I am not trying to be cheap, but I think the ingredients to make my food couldn't have cost more than $5 total... that is a CRAZY mark up. I wont make arrangements to go back to Spacca Napoli, but if someone invited me I would probably go.
