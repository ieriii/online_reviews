Went to this place last night for dinner and what a treat!!! When I first walked in, the aroma caught my attention immediately, and I knew it was going to be good, and it was.  We had the sampler, and 6 meat dishes (I don't how know to pronounce them); but everything was delicious! You eat the meat/veggies with a sponge like bread, almost looks like a tortilla, but spongy and grey-colored. It was good!! I will definitely be coming back here. 12/10 for sure! Ethiopian food = YUM! Prices are not too shabby either, and service was wonderful!
