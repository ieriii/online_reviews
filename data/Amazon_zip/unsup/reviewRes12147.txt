Went there for the first time and I was impressed with how sincere & friendly the staff is. Server/service great. Had the red single size pizza with spinach, goat cheese, & sauteed mushrooms. The pizza was topped with fresh ingredients though I wish crust was crispier. Maybe the toppings I choose made it rather soggy. Ice tea was terrible -tasted like instant. They need 2 get better ice tea. Split cheese cake with friend & it had a after taste that reminded me of diet soda. Would go again but I will make sure I am not driving so I can have a beer. Forget the cheesecake.
