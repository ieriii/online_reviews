Its simple, this place is fantastic. Publican brings the Belgian beer hall to Chicago and continues the Paul Kahan juggernaut in the city. Publican is about three things; pork, oysters & beer. From the list of hundreds of beer choices you will be able to find one that matches whatever you order. We were there this past week for brunch and tried the saurbraten sandwich and the ham and eggs. The ham was a huge slab of pork the Publican brines in the restaruant and was served with perfectly cooked eggs. The saurbraten sandwich was not whatever you had at the last German restaurant you went to but was a rich marinated piece of moist pork on a fresh roll served with Belgian style fries (no Belgian style mayo though). You have to order the side of bacon which is closer to looking like shortribs than what you may think of as bacon but was so rich and flavorful we were talking about it days later. They also make fresh cooked pork rinds, aged hams, rilletes and charcuterie none of which you can go wrong with. We have been there for dinner and its also amazing. Make reservations and be prepared for communal tables but go for the amazing pork and beer combinations that you can get nowhere else in Chicago.
