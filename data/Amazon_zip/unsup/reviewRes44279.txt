This place was pretty good. My favorite is the Gorilla roll...yummy. Next fav was the Hotel California roll. **Update** Got takeout from here. Bento boxes were good. I got a few other rolls that I hadn't tried before, and they were all good...although asparagus in a roll wasn't tasty. Pick it out and we're all good. oooh and they give u these containers for the soy sauce that are sweet. I dunno, it made my day. Yes, I'm easily fascinated sometimes.
