I cannot understand how anyone can praise this place. Friends from out of town wanted to go here for dinner and drinks. We went and had the worst time ever. The owner was so pushy and in your face every five minutes that I was getting sick of seeing him. What a major blowhard. It is one thing to brag about food if it is good, another to brag over lousy over cooked and salt laden mush. Yelpers have raved about the stuffed cabbage and the polenta so I tried them both. Huge error on my part. Tasteless boiled to death cabbage and overly salty polenta. Our friends had the goulash and said it was just okay, nothing to write home about or ever order again. In fact they felt the food was not worth the price we paid. If you love blowhards with heavy accents and lousy food, this is the place for you! For me and mine, our $$$ will be spent elsewhere.
