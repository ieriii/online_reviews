BYOB! I had to get that out so you'd read that part first. I'm a fan of BYOB's every once in a while, and someone's Yelp review saved me before heading to Coast. I wanted a little drinky with my Teriyaki Chicken and would have been sorely disappointed. Yes, I'm lame and don't eat sushi. But, I went to Coast last Sunday night for a birthday dinner and the other 9 people loved it. So, if fairly priced sushi is for you, try Coast. Oh, the Teriyaki Chicken was pretty good if you're lame like me.
