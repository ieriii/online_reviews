I had Spacca for the second time this weekend, and it was simply delicious. What is it about the pizza??? The dough is so good, and the ingredients are fresh and in perfect proportion. I went with a simple margherita, and it just blew me away. I like that the pizza is small enough for one person....I certainly didn't feel like sharing! The wine selection is quite Italian, and I like the robust red the hostess helped me pick out. My friend and I wrapped up our lovely al fresco experience with a slice of terramisu, and all I can say is YUM!
