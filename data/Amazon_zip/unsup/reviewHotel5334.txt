Beware of the $1 sale! They don't say anything until after you've booked your room but whoever makes the reservation has to be the one to check in to the room with a valid ID no ifs, ands, or buts! Ufortunately they wouldn't even budge when I was going to be arriving extremely late, around 11pm and would not let my guest check in for us. Very tricky stipulation that they don't advertise until after you make reservation and in very very small print.
