Huge fan of this hotel!! Does it have the biggest and best rooms I've ever stayed in? No. But what it does have is the best staff ever!! Tom at the front desk was awesome! I booked the hotel through Hotwire but because I am a Holiday Inn rewards member I got 2 upgrades...yes, that's right...2.  Parking is high but that goes with the territory. Awesome location, we walked to Mag Mile and to dinner each night. I personally loved the decor, although I know it's not for everyone. Shower had good pressure. Beds were comfortable.  Will stay here again in a heartbeat!
