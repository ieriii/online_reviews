Damn this place is good. I've walked by Wakamono almost every day for the last year and a half and finally had the chance to go in. Nice atmosphere, excellent fresh sushi, and even a cute Chinese waitress who didn't understand my friend's order for a gin and tonic until he said "gin tonic" without the "and". Cheaper than New Tokyo for roughly the same amount of sushi (Wakamono's is better) plus drinks. I know this because we went to New Tokyo the night before and BYOB'd. I hope to find an excuse to come back soon.
