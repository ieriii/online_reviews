Everything I had here was great. There was a group of us so we ordered a lot too! Even the pickled prune drink that I got! (yeah I know...I was feeling adventurous and I can't describe it as anything other than the perfect blend of salty and sweet.) I can't wait to go back. The massive bowls of Pho ensure you can even make a few meals of it later. man!
