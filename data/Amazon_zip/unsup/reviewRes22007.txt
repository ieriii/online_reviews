Coming from a true Greek, I'm not quite sure why people are giving this restaurant so many high ratings. Not only is the food not up to par but this restaurant caters to the masses, it's very touristy and considering there are 10 other Greek restaurants in a 3 block radius, I suggest choosing another option before coming here. I have been twice, leaving both times unsatisfied. If you are looking for mainstream Greek food that fulfills the sterotype, to be shuttled in and out, go here. Otherwise, choose one of the many other options available.
