Great food, friendly service.  What more can a person ask? In this day of snotty waitstaff and poorly seasoned, overpriced food, it is refreshing to find a place where the owners and staff really seem to care that you enjoy yourself. I have enjoyed the empanadas, just enough "bite" to the crust to contrast wonderfully with the perfectly seasoned stuffing inside. The green and sweet plantain make me think of my Aunt's wonderful cooking. The chicken sandwich, the shakes, my mouth is watering just thinking of it. And, by the way, what is up with the "hater" profanely talking about the sign up front?  Great food and friendly people!!!  That is what this should be about.
