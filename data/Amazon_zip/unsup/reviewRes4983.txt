My review is a bit mixed, but there is a good reason that the Purple Pig gets 5 stars. Most of the dishes we tried were truly amazing (salt-roasted beets, asparagus salad, deviled egg, feta smear, lemon panna cotta) and they put a big smile on my face. On the other hand, we also tried the olive-oil tuna, the tuna was fresh and perfectly mild, but the fava beans were a bit on the salty side. Speaking of salty, we also ordered the charred green onions, which were so heavily salted that we could not eat them. This would normally knock a star off the rating but when we informed our waitress, she insured the matter was handled very professionally and we even got an apology from the chef. I understand that things happen, and a really fantastic restaurant can not be perfect all the time, but the rating is a combination of service, ambiance, and food. I think the Purple Pig is a great combination of all things good. Go, you won't regret it.
