The salt/pepper squid came out kinda grayish and soggy. We sampled a few pieces and agreed they used old oil to fry it up in and it could have been crispier. I asked Feng our server if he could take it back and exchange it for some noodles or something. He said no, you guys ate half of it already. Sorry. Fine Feng. So we stiffed him with a $2 tip on a $50 tab. We "made" our own refund or exchange depending how you want to look at it. Hey Feng, I hope you're reading this and learning. The customer is always right and if you don't go to bat for us, be ready to take the hit yourself!
