Stop Changing the menu! The BBQ shrimp you used to serve came with awesome mashed potatoes and dry rubbed Cajun.. Now they swim in a mild Cajun sauce with not mashed potatoes?? What gives. Major thumbs up for the new menu items. The Crabtini, The Osso Buco raviolis!! DAM Scrappy! The steaks.... OF Course! Sizzling in butta! YUM! Don't leave without getting the fresh seasonal berries in cream. It's all GOOD!
