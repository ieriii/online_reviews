A friend from Florida brought me here. The stamp of approval from the Floridian (well acquainted with good Costa Rican food, of course) got my hopes up, and I was not at all let down with the results. Upon recommendations from some 'other' restaurant review site, I tried the casado with chicken, and it was filling and deeelicious. My friend's veggie burrito was pretty good too. I would like to come back here soon.
