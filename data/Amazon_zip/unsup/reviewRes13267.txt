A very cool brewpub with some very good food including a great burger.  Their in-house pretzel was delicious, served warm and also came with a nice mustard and cheddar dip. The Hombre Burger was exceptionally good, absolutely massive patty with tons of flavor and great spicy condiments on top. The prices are solid and the service was quite good, I would look forward to coming back and trying some of their beers.
