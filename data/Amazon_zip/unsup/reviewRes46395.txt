Went here for a friends birthday. The wait was very long but it was the weekend and the same day of the Magnificent Mile light festival so it's understandable. My food was delicious and the portions are HUGE! (and I'm the type who usually cleans the plate) and had more than half of my entree left, wait staff was friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant was nice. Overall a nice restaurant! I would like to go back when it's less crowded and maybe get a table overlooking Michigan Ave.
