Cute little place - love the handwritten menu that changes frequently. Had gnocchi (of course) with a bottle of Zinfandel. Compared to SF, the prices were awesome, but I figure I'll be in sticker shock for a while after leaving that city. Loved that the sauces they used are not too heavy and very flavorful. Great service too. Will come back when I move to the area!
