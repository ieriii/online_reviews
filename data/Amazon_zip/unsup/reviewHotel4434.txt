This is a gorgeous old hotel. The rooms are somewhat drafty in the winter, and a little less modern and large compared to buildings put up more recently, but you can feel the tradition. The rooms are also a bit smaller, but I think they're fine. The lower floors have some of the standard amenities, pool, hot tub, etc., and good dining. The decor is beautiful. I guess it comes down to the choice between memorable, world-renown, elegant and classic, versus modern and slightly more comfortable.
