Ahh India House... Good for the soul, not so good for the veneers. This a decent restaurant with a hidden section up the stairs. I would say that the buffet is not exactly the best touch for this type of locale but it does serve up some decent curry. This is a great place for vegetarians as I'm sure all of you know Indian food is very vegetarian friendly. I would not bring a date in here since there are much nicer places around the way.
