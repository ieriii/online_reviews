Update: The luch buffet can not be beat. They put out an amazing spread of appetizers, entrees and desserts. The food is very good and the atmosphere feels exotic. I love that they give you naan and tomato sauce before the meal to munch on. Chicken tikka masala is a little too tomatoey for my taste. Prices are a little high although the quality is definitely very good.
