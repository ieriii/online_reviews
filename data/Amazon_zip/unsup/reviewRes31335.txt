Holy goodness that is Nana. This place is amazing! The first time I went my sister and I split the Stuffed French Toast (to die for) and the Nanadict (insanely amazing) and I left wanting to go back the next day. Although the service wasnt the best, the food made up for it. I went again, this past weekend, and again, fell in love with their food. The service was MUCH better, the food was still amazing, and the atmosphere is wonderful. Its not too loud, not too crowded, friendly, homey, comfortable. Dont believe those 1 or 2 star ratings, go to Nana and experience it for yourself. You wont regret it. Also, a huge plus, you can find free parking!! What's better than that?!?! Very few things.
