Yolk was totally egg-cellent. Don't worry, the rest of the review will more than make up for that joke, so keep reading. We came on a busy Sunday lunch, but were seated after 5 min. I ordered the Veggie Skillet, which consisted of perfectly cooked asparagus, zucchini, peppers, etc., AS WELL AS 3 fluffy pancakes. All for $10 - say what?! The dutiful (and gorgeous) waitress filled our coffee and water far more frequently than I expected, and with a smile to boot. Cool decor, hip, happening - a nice South Loop joint. Go to Yolk. Go often.
