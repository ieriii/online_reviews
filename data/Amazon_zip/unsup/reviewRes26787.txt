Everyone that is writing reviews for this place is bitching about the lines, well I've been going here since I was old enough to walk and yes there is always a line, but you are seated pretty quickly and never really wait longer than 5 or 10 mins at the very most. This is a very busy authentic Mexican restaurant, not a Chipotle on Ohio street so its not going to be pristine and perfect, it's like going to your Tia Maria's house to eat dinner. You will leave full and satisfied. There is nothing fancy about the place but you will love everything about its authenticity. If you are cold, than bring a sweater for god sakes, it is Chicago!!! Very, very reasonable prices and generous portion sizes and BYOB. All Latinos of Pilsen patronize this place and if the locals love it, that says alot.
