I came here for brunch with some girlfriends this weekend and we had a wonderful time. They have a really nice little seating area outside so we were able to sit out and enjoy the weather. We had the soup dumplings to start. They were pretty tasty. I love soup dumplings and have had some amazing ones in Taiwan, and I was worried that these would disappoint, but I was pleasantly surprised. They actually were great. I had the chop chop chicken salad. The portion was very large and the dressing was delicious. I really loved this salad. I could see myself coming back and eating this salad often. To end our brunch, we had the chocolate cake. It was rich and decadent and everything a molten chocolate cake should be. I will be back to try dinner!! Thanks Sunda. We had a great time!
