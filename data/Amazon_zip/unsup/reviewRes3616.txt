So after reading lots of good reviews, I decided to check this place out. I was starving and craving chicken and veggies after a long day and I thought Crisp would fit the bill. The Baby budda bowl was tasty and satisfying, though I still should have gotten the regular size. I also got the super strips which I was pretty excited to dig into. The strips were a bit disappointing, dry, and way too salty. It seemed like I got the ones that had been sitting around for awhile. The other thing that threw me off was, other than the menu items there is nothing Korean about the space. Normally I'm all about mashing up different cultures, America is a melting pot right? They were blasting Sublime and Bob Marley, which I love, but it just felt out of place here. The staff didn't seem to enthused to be there either, and I got the vibe that they could have just as easily been working in a pizza or sandwich joint and not noticed a difference in their surroundings.
