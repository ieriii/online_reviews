I was a little skeptical of this place when we got there. From the outside it really seemed to be this "ho-hum" type of place that is all over Chicago and only place open in the hood - so that was why it was packed? I was definitely proven wrong when I looked at the menu and realized what a little gem this place is. The breakfast portions of huge and you can really taste how fresh everything is. The use of organic eggs is a double bonus brownie point that you can definitely taste. Cubed potatoes done just right and all ingredients freshly prepared. Lots of dishes have spinach and feta, and interesting specials like the Andouille omlette! Really like how cosy it is too, tables a tad close together, but definitely adds to the atmosphere of it. Highly recommended!
