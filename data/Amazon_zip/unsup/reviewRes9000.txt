This is the second time I've visited Le Colonial in Chicago. Additionally, I have eaten at their location in San Francisco and New York City.  As usual, the setting is beautiful. Very French colonial. I love the attention to detail that the place in their establishment. Great wine/cocktail menu. Share your food here. That's the best way to tackle the menu. Once again, I was not disappointed. Coming from someone who grew up eating authentic Vietnamese food...I would say I'm always pleased with the clean/fresh interpretations of some of my favorites/classics.  Food highlights: 1. Cha gio 2. Goi nho sen (lotus root salad) 3. Grilled trout in banana leaf
