I have only been here a few times for a cocktail and snacks in their bar area, so I can't comment on their full dinner. But the drinks and bites that I have had have been very good, so I will most certainly be back in the future. The last time I was there it was a really hot day, so I had a passion fruit frozen margarita that really hit the spot. Passion fruit is one of my favorite flavors so I am very picky about it and easily disappointed. I thought that their margarita had terrific passion fruit flavor--probably from concentrate, but who cares--it was good. We tried 3 of the ceviches--the Skuna Bay salmon one was the standout this time. We also had a shrimp-squash blossom-cheese tortilla creation that was very tasty. The cocktails are priced reasonably, considering what other places in the neighborhood typically charge. The cocktails are a little less sophisticated than the top places too, but they're good. The servers have always been friendly and attentive, though we tend to go at off times (my favorite time to go anywhere in the city). All in all, a great place to stop for a refreshment with friends!
