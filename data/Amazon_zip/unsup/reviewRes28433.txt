The food is absolutely amazing. Graham Elliot is a truly talented chef. I haven't tasted food so good and interesting in Chicago, probably ever. A very unique menu, will keep you discussing every flavor and ingredient you can identify in the dishes. Hands down, delicious, exquisite food. BUT... The menu online is not very clear, so let me explain what the waiter or waitress will tell you when you sit down. We were told that each person should order 3-5 dishes to create a full, balanced meal. The portions are very small. The whole dining experience only makes sense if you order several things from the menu (a hot and cold appetizer, and a main dish). Don't expect to share 1 or 2 appetizers for the whole table, as they are barely big enough for 2 people. So, needless to say, it adds up.  Although the dishes were delicious, I wasn't really full after dinner. It's definitely worth a try for the unique and high quality of the food, but beware of the small portions and the price tag that really adds up.
