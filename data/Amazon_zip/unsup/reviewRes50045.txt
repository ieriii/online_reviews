So I found this place on yelp and thought I would check it out.  My first impression was the layout was very interesting. The place appears narrow when you walk in. You have a main level with tons of flat screen tvs. You look up and there are more tables. In my quest to find the other bathroom I walk down the steps and see a larger room with another bar. I thought it was pretty cool. I sat at the bar and ordered the buffalo boneless wings. These were the biggest boneless wings I have ever seen in my life! The bartenders were cool and laid back.  After 10 they move the tables on the main level and it gets crowded. Great spot to hang out for the night or as a stop before you go to your next place.
