So I am here right now. I had a layover in O'Hare and my flight was cancelled. So i'm staying in Chicago for a night. The hotel is nice.  Service: Well, the only thing that kinda bugged is the fact that the girl who checked me in, gave me a room that someone else had. How ackward. So I had to go downstairs and get a new room.  Rooms: The room gave me a funky vibe at first. I went in and turned on all of the lights and the television. But i'm in here now and I'm okay.  Amenities: One main reason why i stay at Westin hotels is for the heavenly bed and the heavenly shower. I've always been a big fan and I can't wait to go to sleep.
