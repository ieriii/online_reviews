This place is so authentic you have to dial 011 to get out. Looking around at everyone's food, I definitely have a lot I need to come back and try (especially the hot pot); the menu has to have like 150+ items. This is definitely a popular place, so be mindful if you are going on a peak day at a peak time. When I went, there was a line out the door but it didn't take more than 20 minutes to get a table.
