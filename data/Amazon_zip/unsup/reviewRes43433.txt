Best stuffed pizza i have ever had. The sauce and crust were perfect. Some other Chicago deep dish / stuffed pizzas have a sweet sauce. The Art of Pizza has a tangy sauce and nice buttery crust. Delivery was 45 minutes - not bad for a stuffed pizza. I threw away all other pizza fliers and will get this from here on.
