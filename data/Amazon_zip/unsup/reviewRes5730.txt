This place really surprised me. The prices are very reasonable - but this is definitely not the place to "chow down." The place is small and it's communal dining for the most part - which isn't so bad. We ordered a bottle of the bordeaux wine and ate: the clams w/ rice (which were eh), fried prosciutto bread balls (good), delice de bourgogne (we asked our server for a creamy cheese, and this was delicious and came with a fig jam), roasted bone marrow w/ herbs (this was really good - but since we've made this at home before, not as great as we expected), pig's ear with fried kale and fried egg (omg - the best thing we had. crispy, salty, a little soggy w/ the yolk.. we could eat this forever), the milk braised pork shoulder (the heartiest of our selections, this was delicious), and for dessert, we had the ricotta and chocolate fried beignet/donut, which was really, really good good. The atmosphere was pretty chill, and overall, I had a great time. The only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I found this place to be a bit pretentious . There is an attitude where they expect you to know what you want... our server was nice and all, but there really was no real help unless you sought it out. Even Alinea was kind enough to explain what to expect. But regardless, I liked this place, will be going back, and would definitely recommend it to everyone.
