Was super stoked to come here after hearing raves and was disappointed. Our food was soaked in grease, so much so that after eating one taco I was full. Which is unheard of, I can destroy me some tacos. I won't be back because there are so many other excellent Mexican restaurants in Pilsen, let alone Chicago.
