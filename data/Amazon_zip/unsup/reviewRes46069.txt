Owned by Cheesecake factory, built and decorated like Cheesecake factory, serviced like Cheesecake factory, is supposed to be an "Upgrade" to Cheesecake factory. But unfortunately, this is more like a Downgrade. My advice: Skip the food and go straight for the dessert. The dessert is the only thing worthwhile at Grand Lux. In fact, the dessert is sooo good that I wish they served this AT Cheesecake so it's more readily available throughout the country. Hands down this place has the absolute BEST chocolate chip cookies in the country. There is nothing that can compare to a box of warm freshly baked Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies that just melt in your mouth making you wish you could savor every last morsel for eternity. The Beignets and Molten Chocolate Cake are equally rich and decadent and treat your taste buds with proper respect and dignity. Unfortunately this is where the happy story ends. Their menu - a fusion of world flavors and styles - is just average at best. When you think of the clich 'jack of all trades master of none', this is the only way you could define Grand Lux. All dishes from their pastas, to seafood, to asian fusion are just mediocre at best. There's no grandeur you would expect; in fact I find Cheesecake dishes to be more refined because in certain respect less is more. Grand Lux is trying too hard to mix all different flavors into something that may really dazzle you but ultimately only fizzes into a concoction your taste buds simply do not agree with. All that said and done, could someone please send me a box of their cookies to help revive my taste buds?
