I wholeheartedly agree, The hotel has become a sad case, Ever since the strike. Cold bathrooms, cold bar, You could LITERALLY feel a draft from the cold air. Went in March. 2005. It's certainly a classic, But NEEDS to be taken over by a different outfit. The ambience is pretty cold too. One of the things I actually liked about the place is it's large classic neon sign, That's practically about it..........And it being an old chestnut............
