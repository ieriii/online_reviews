Yeah, so we went for the first time about a month ago and have talked about going back every few days since. We ordered three pizzas between the three of us. Two small and one medium. Way too much food, but that just means more leftovers for me. We tried the red sauce with sausage and basil. Great crust, good ingredients. Really, really good. Our second pizza was a white pizza with clams and bacon. Yum. The bacon overpowered the clams a bit, but it was tasty. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. The last was my favorite. The plain sauce with meatballs and ricotta. If you like garlic, you'll like this sauce. All the pizza's had a great crust and I went back and forth a few times on which I liked best. We went on a Sunday night and had to wait about fifteen minutes. Well worth it. We plan on going back repeatedly. Currently, our favorite thin crust in the city..
