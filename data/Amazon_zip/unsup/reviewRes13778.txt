I brought my Havana born mother to this spot in Logan Square. It was one of the last Cuban restaurants in Chicago we needed to check off our list. She got the Lechon dinner plate and I got the croqueta sandwich, both of which were delightful. My girlfriend got the chicken dinner and it was finely seasoned. My mom was completely stoked you could order her favorite soda, Iron Beer!! 90 Miles is BYOB which also makes it a great spot however since we were seeing The Dark Knight Rises afterwards we opted against drinking. We did see a table with their very own mojitos that looked amazing; all they had to do is bring the rum and 90 Miles made the rest of the mixture. Lastly, the outdoor seating is wonderful and we sat outside as it was a gorgeous Chicago evening.
