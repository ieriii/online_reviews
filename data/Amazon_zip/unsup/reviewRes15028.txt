So I have been here many times in the course of my life since many of my family members enjoy having parties in their upstairs party room. If you are having a get together and need a space in the city it tends to be nice. Overall though as far as Italian food in the city I have had way better. Saying that I would also like to say that the wait staff there has always been top notch. They are friendly and helpful and I have never had an issue with them. I love Italian food and do not buy pasta because I prefer to make my own. That said I had a lemon chicken which I felt was a bit dry. With that came the ice berg lettuce salad (I really feel that no comment for the salad....ice berrrgggg...) and I got the mostacolli side. I love mostacolli. I do not like theirs you can tell theirs came out of box and the sauce taste like it came out of a jar. Yes it is very time consuming to make your own fresh pasta but if you are going to operate an Italian restaurant I feel you should by a higher quality pasta. This place is truly old Chicago.
