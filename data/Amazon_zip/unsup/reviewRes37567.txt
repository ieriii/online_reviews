From a grocery perspective this place is good. From the cafe's perspective the food is ok but terribly overpriced. The dessert's for the most part are 4-5 stars. The bread pudding is awesome, and the red velvet cupcakes are about 4 stars. The prepared foods are shaky at best. My hubby and I hade the cole slaw and the french potato salad and it was not a good experience. The french potato salad was basically just potatoes, green beans, and tomatoes. I don't know if there should have been some mayo, vinaigrette, or sauce in there and it was forgotten but it was almost inedible. The cole slaw did have mayo but other than that was flavorless. Some people have mentioned having bad customer service here, I would disagree on that point. I have always had excellent customer service at F&O.
