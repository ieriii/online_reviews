First time here and was really impressed. Great atmosphere, well lit, good space, and it had a really relaxed feel, but decor gave it a upscale feel. Right off the bat the hostess/waitress, was friendly and helpful. Made us want to spend more money. So we did, had the Shrimp and Chenjeh, my friends had the Chenjeh Barg combo, and the Chenjeh and Koubideh, respectively. The meat was very good, the shrimp not so much, a bit over cooked, but the rest of the plate, especially the dill rice, was great. Big portions, normal people would probably be wise to split. Hummus appetizer must be mentioned, and we also capped it all off with Baklava, Bomieh and tea. Great tasting, great service, decent prices.
