Ack! Another girl, another highly mediocre vegetarian restaurant. And like the other old standbys, I live in hope that, in the past 40 years or whatever, they managed to find a recipe or two that doesn't taste like sawdust. Alas, wrong again.Look, there are going to be people who find a restaurant that suits their minority and say let's support Restaurant X because it 's [vegetarian|Kosher|West African|whatever] and I think that's great. But shouldn't the restaurant be _good_ too? I mean, shouldn't they at least _try_ not to suck? Well, they sure make their money, so maybe they found a business model that works for them... mediocre food, lousy service, atmosphere that shows that they just don't care, and, they're making moolah hand-over-fist. An American success story.Success or not, they're still getting what they deserve from me. So, sorry, Chicago Diner... until you have decent food *or* service *or* atmosphere *or* prices, you get one star from me. Unfortunately that does *not* mean you won't keep seeing me... as I am fated to date people who like sucky restaurants... but, good lord, get your act together!
