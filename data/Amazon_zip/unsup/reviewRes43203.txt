They make a great drink called the Corpse Reviver II but careful, it is strong! I would have given four stars but my last visit was a bit of a let down service wise. The pork belly is still amazing as are most of the dishes. It was Friday night and we sat in the lounge area. First there was a lot of debate about where they could seat us (the place was empty). Then the hostess kept coming over to move our bags or else tell us we had to sit in a certain space or some other annoying request to prepare for some onslaught of patrons they were expecting. Well, we stayed for a few hours and these hordes never appeared. She was nice and just doing what management told her to do but management should realize that hassling the guests who are there in anticipation of guests who are not and did not arrive, is just stupid. The pork belly will bring me back, maybe.
