This is my absolute favorite Thai restaurant ever... period. In a two-block radius, I can list at least 6 other Thai places which I've visited, but Opart kills all the competition! For the longest time I stuck with the Peanut Sauce Lover, I would just crave it each time I went. I finally learned to go beyond, and explore the menu, and have not been disappointed. Highly recommended dishes include Khao Soy, Pad Kratiam Prik Thai, and their curries are all great.  Watch out for the spice level. Here, hot means hot!!!
