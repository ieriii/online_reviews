I'm happy to tell everybody that we dine at " Sabatino's Restaurant & Lounge." I had the filet mignon and my husband had the Chicken Cacciatore. We enjoyed our meals along with soup and salad, then their famous " Banana Frosters!" We can't wait to dine there again, and next time we want to bring the kids.
