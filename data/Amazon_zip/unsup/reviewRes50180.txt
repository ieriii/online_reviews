'They' say, you are what you eat, and I ate the O burger. 'They' were right; it was orgasmic. I went with a couple friends of mine who live local to the area, and based on the greeting they received on entry I could tell they were frequent diners (that's always a good sign). This burger had something I had never experienced before, a waffle made of mac 'n' cheese on the actual burger. Phenomenal. That and it came with Merkt's Cheddar, and pulled pork, all on a pretzel bun (I'm a sucker for a pretzel bun). There beer selection was good, nothing incredible, but still a good selection. I got a Dogfish Head 90min.  Why the 4 stars instead of 5 you ask... I don't know. I just feel like there is some spark it is missing. I will definitely be back, and perhaps then I will find that missing star.
