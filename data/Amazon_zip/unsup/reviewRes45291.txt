Nice decor, very irish. Went there for lunch and had the chicken chopped salad. Reasonably priced and generous portion. But, the gluten-free menu is a little misleading. For the chopped salad, I thought they used gluten-free dressing, etc. but it was actually removing the croutons that makes it gluten-free. For an additional $2.00! Really? I could order the regular salad and remove the croutons myself!  Disclaimer: Not gluten-sensitive but, I try to minimize gluten whenever possible.
