Nice little place with some character, tucked away in the midst of the tourist hell that is Michigan Ave. Here are some points of interest. * old world art deco ambiance, without being old world falling apart * accommodating server had the kitchen prepare an heirloom tomato salad for wife just because she likes heirloom tomatoes (item was not on menu) * split the fish and chips, and the large portion came out on two perfectly sized plates without asking * potato soup was a bit salty (too much bacon), but flavorful * refills were a plenty and we never had to ask * a little spendy for lunch fare (though exotic), but typical of the area
