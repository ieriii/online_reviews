Really romantic ambience. Dim lights, fresh interesting cocktails, and nearby tables with attractive hipsters make for a great date night or post-dinner cocktails with a few girlfriends. Limited seating reminds me of speakeasies in California, but the furnishing is more modern and upscale. One gripe is the line -- having to wait outside in the cold sucks-- but definitely worth trying at least once.
