I was in Chicago for a few days and decided to check out Fox & Obel since it was just 1 mile away from my hotel. And, boy oh boy, I certainly agree with one of the other reviews that this place is sorta like heaven, for a foodie ;-). It's like Whole Foods on steroids! They've got a very large selection of foreign chocolates, biscuits and crackers. All things I like, unfortunately, hehe. I didn't have a car, thankfully, so I had to watch what I bought. I left with over $50 worth of gourmet chocolates. Very very happy!
