I went here for dinner with all of my co-workers one night, not knowing anything about the restaurant. I was very pleased with our experience and will be heading back on my own very soon.  We were a little worried when we made our reservation, as we were going to be a very large group, but they were happy to accommodate us. Several of us arrived a little early, and we only had to wait a short while before we were seated. BYOB is always nice, and our server didn't even blink when we produced multiple bags filled with wine bottles (the collection of empty bottles at the end of the night was impressive). Once we had all arrived, bottles were opened, and we began perusing the menu. Although service was a little on the slow side, especially as the restaurant started to fill up, our server was incredibly helpful and patient, especially considering that we had a lot of indecisive folks in our group. She was able to help us navigate the menu, explained many of the different dishes, and made some fantastic recommendations. The food was incredible, and everyone raved about their meals. My Ropa Vieja was delicious and flavorful, and the portions were large enough to provide me with lunch the next day. Of course, we all had to sample everyone's dishes, and I think the whole table agreed that the Puerca Rostizado (pig roast infused with guayaba, pan fried with grilled onions, and served with black beans, white rice, and maduros) was the real winner of the night, and it is what I will be ordering the next time I visit. The crowd was an eclectic mix of folks with a few obvious regulars sprinkled in, and tables quickly filled up after we arrived. The restaurant gets very loud very quickly, and, as I already noted, service was a little on the slow side, but the food more than makes up for these minor annoyances.
