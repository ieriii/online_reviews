Bonsoiree is fabulous! We had the 8 course menu last weekend. The interior is beautiful. Tealights in little glass jars on wood tables. I like a nice looking restaurant bathroom as well. Each presentation was lovely, starting with the quail lollipop and ending with chocolate 8 ways. (Reverse cheese and crackers? Yes please!) I am ecstatic this place is BYOB. I hope it stays this way. Unfortunately it completely slipped our minds to order duck duck goose, but by the looks of the table next to us that did, it looked delicious! (But wait, was it served in a plexi-glass box?) Explanation of each dish and which utensil to use was so helpful. I thought the service was great, our server was nice, and weaved in and out checking on us, not impeding at all. I will definitely be back.
