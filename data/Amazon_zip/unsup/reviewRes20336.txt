By far my favorite sushi restaurant! Great sushi and the fact that is is BYOB clinch it! It is a great date spot and one you can also hang with your friends. There isn't anything on the menu I don't like. Their specialty rolls are top notch... and if you don't see exactly what you like, make up your own! Service is always great! Make a reservation on the weekends because it gets really crowded! The great thing is that if you're waiting for a table you can head to the bar around the corner and tell the bartender that you're waiting for a table and Coast will call when your table is ready!
