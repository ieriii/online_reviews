I haven't been to a weekend brunch in a while. My friends and I are on the hunt for an ugly Christmas sweater for an ugly sweater party. We wanted to pig out before taking on such a daunting task. I suggested Uncommon Ground since we were in the area. There was a short wait on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Our short 15 minute wait was well worth it! There is a large seating area near the bar with comfy chairs around the fireplace. I had the prairie pure macaroni & cheese: prairie pure butterkase, cedar grove white cheddar, swiss, apple-celeraic slaw. It was beyond amazing. I ate every last bite. My friends also dipped into my noodles before they ate their breakfast. I was the only one that didn't get breakfast food and I'm glad I splurged and had the mac & cheese. My friends had the brioche French toast and the huevos uncommon. Both breakfasts looked amazing and everyone left a happy camper. Uncommon Ground also grows their own herbs and vegetables in the back of the restaurant and on the roof. Everything is so fresh and flavorful. I cannot wait to return, this place is just amazing!
