A short review from a big fan of this place: loved the ahogada torta. Tender, rich pork, superb, crisp-crusted bread submerged in a wonderful spicy chili sauce is a winner! So is their guacamole and chips, among the very best I have ever had. The melon liquada was so refreshing I would have ordered another if the line hadn't grown so long. Went back for breakfast the next day of my visit and had a superb breakfast sandwich, stellar, cinnamony churros and decadent Mexican hot chocolate. I wish I had regular access to this place. It is simply wonderful.
