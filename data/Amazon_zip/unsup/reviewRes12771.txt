I had an excellent dinner with my parents here this past Saturday. It's a comfortable restaurant with lots to offer. The service was good; our waiter gave us his honest opinions on the dinner entrees and his recommendations were great! The jalapeno honey pork chop was very good. I'd recommend that dish for sure. I liked the skirt steak alot as well. The marinade was especially tasty. We also had a moderately priced bottle of Malbec which we all enjoyed. I liked their coffee drinks as well. The dessert selection is large. We went with the lemon tart which was pretty tart. I'd probably prefer the gelato or chocolate cake. I'll definitely return and recommend it to others.
