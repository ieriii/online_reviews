I love Sunda. I would go as far as to say it's my new favorite Chicago restaurant. The problem is, it's hard to choose a favorite of anything. The decor, drinks, food were all REALLY great. Starting out with cocktails, we tried the lychee martini, the kung pao mango, the pear sake and the wasabi h20, they were all well made and amazing. I will come back to the bar just for a drink for happy hour. On to the food, our group shared 4 rolls and a bunch of appetizers. Everything was insane. Again,cant choose a favorite. Very tasty and different, not your typical Asian fare at all. The toast and jam was really good, and all of the sushi we had was top. We also sat at a great table away from the rest of the restaurant sort of "In" the sushi bar.  For dessert we split the "Ridiculous," it is its name, just get it. We met the head chef and head sushi chef, both very talented and the nicest guys ever. The only thing that failed was our server. He seemed like he didnt really know what he was doing and we barely saw him throughout the meal. Then, at the end of the meal, he overcharged out credit card by $15 each and lost one of the credit cards in our group. Not a fun way to end the meal. Another note, it's PRICEY. Our was $80 a head for 6 people. But overall, SO good, will return. 6-24 Im editing this because Ive been back to Sunda 3 or 4 times since my last review. It's not the best, it's just ok. Still a fun scene.
