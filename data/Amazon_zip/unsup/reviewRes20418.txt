Wow, I never thought I'd spend $40 on lunch and walk away thinking it's totally worth it.  My mom was visiting from Denver and Friday we had lunch at Xoco - the line wasn't as long as I'd expected and the food was more than worth the 20-minute wait. We had: House made chips and Guac- good and totally standard. Ahodaga: Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. This was my favorite of the two sandwiches we ordered. I love my food wet and the tomato broth mentioned here was a served in a bowl, and the sandwich was served in the broth- it was perfect for dipping! The sauce was lip-burning spicy, but not so much so that the flavor was obscured, in fact the heat focused the flavors, and the pickled onions provided the perfect amount of relief and contrast to the spicy sauce. Pepito: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos. We almost didn't order this sandwich because I'd made short-ribs for the dinner the night before, but I'm glad we did. This was my mom's favorite, while she found the ahogada a bit too spicy, this was perfect for her. Moist and tender- the cheese really held the sandwich together- both physically and with respect to flavor. Normally neither of us would order dessert at lunch, but something about "vacation" makes you just go for it. We shared a sweet, rich and slightly spicy Aztec chocolate and an order of churros. Definitely worth the calories.
