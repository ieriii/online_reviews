Mastro's original location in Beverly Hills is my all-time favorite steakhouse, and I have also enjoyed another location (the more seafood oriented Ocean Club in Orange County), so I was fired up when I got invited to a business dinner here. The place is actually very similar to the LA location - dark but classy and a real scene. Mastro's made the piano bar cool again, and you can see they are pulling it off in Chicago as well. There is a great bar scene here, and I imagine it would be fun to go here for drinks as well. We had a private room upstairs (I was a little disappointed to be led off, since all the action was at ground level), but the room was nice and better for conversation. The food is outstanding. We started with a seafood tower and some Americanized sushi. To be honest, this wiped my appetite out for the rest of the meal, but it was worth it. The presentation of the tower with crab, shrimp, lobster and shellfish over smoking dry ice is memorable, as was the freshness of the fish. I went with the simply grilled halibut for dinner, although others opted for the steaks and were not disappointed. Obviously, the bone-in fillet is the center attraction here. I would certainly come back to the Chicago outpost. Having seen new locations pop up here and in Vegas, I do start to wonder about chain proliferation, however.
