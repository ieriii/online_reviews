This past Saturday was my first ever visit to Carnivale. Now, I've been a Yelp member for a while now, however, I tend to lurk in the shadows. My experience was so out of this world that it left me compelled to comment. Yes, this restaurant is stealing my reviewing virginity. We were sat in the bar area (the white table cloths were not flattering) which kind of put a damper on my expectations. you think bar = drinks and apps/get in get out sort of thing right? wrong.The food was awesome. I order the NY which was intimidating but delicious and my date ordered some sort of tenderloin with cheesy mash. The cocktails were great, heavy on the tequila which I loooooved. Mojitos=good. Tequila flights=amazing. Service was outstanding. Our waitress (all smiles) was sassy and sweet as all hell. The only downfall to our evening was a group of obnoxious bar guests.
