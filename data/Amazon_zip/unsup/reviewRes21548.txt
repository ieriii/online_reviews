I recently went to Chicago for the "first" time. I stayed with a friend from Chicago who was showing me around. We met up with a few other friends and was told we HAVE to go to Superdawg. The name sounded vaguely familiar so I said sure and off we went. Once we arrived I instantly knew those two big hotdogs on top of the building! I had watched an episode on food network that mentioned Superdawg. Unfortunately it was freezing outside so we had to order and go. I decided to be adventurous and try the superdawg with everything and the onion fries. It came in the cutest little box overfilling with sweet smelling fries. Not being from Chicago I now know what I have been missing! I've always been told a good hotdog should "snap" when you bite into it. I kept thinking you're all crazy! When I bit down there was a perfect snap..oh my gosh! I will never eat another soggy Michigan hotdog. Now and forever Superdawg is my hotdog paradise.
