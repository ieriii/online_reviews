Hot Doug's is my favorite hot dog place. The restaurant is nice and colorful, complete with many hot dog and hot dog related pictures and the menu is very creative. My favorite thing to get there is the andouille sausage, who's name varies from time to time, but is formerly named the Madonna. All fountain drinks have free refills. The most amazing things on the menu are the duck fat fries, available only on the weekends, that are extremely fatty and delicious and best covered in hot cheese. It's some good shit. :)
