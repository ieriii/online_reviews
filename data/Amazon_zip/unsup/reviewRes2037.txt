Went with friends. On a Friday afternoon which led to a 1:30 wait but we waited it out and ordered a couple elvis's (polish sausage) and Paul kelly (brats) and some hot dogs. Also order the duck fat fries and the foie gras dog. The Foie gras was very rich and a very unique tasting dog. The polish was great and had a ton of flavor (had it char-grilled) brats where the least favorite of the group.  Would go back but would def. not want to wait 1:30 again.. also keep in mind it is only open 11am-4pm
