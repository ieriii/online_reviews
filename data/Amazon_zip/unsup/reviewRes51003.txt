My first experience with Wishbone was walking by on the way to the Paulina station and seeing a motley crew of Chicagoans sitting in a circle playing with CREEPY puppets.  There's a point to this... Wishbone attracts an interesting mix of people. The environment is bright, energizing, and comforting all at the same time (must be the snarling poodle). This is a satisfying choice for a weekend brunch although I wouldn't say the food is stellar.
