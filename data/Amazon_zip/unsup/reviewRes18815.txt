Had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally had the chance. I was pleasantly surprised. The space was bigger than it looked from the outside. the front half is more bar-like and the rear is more of a sit-down place. Huge beer list! There were a lot of interesting burgers on the menu. Went with the slow burn and have to say It was good. It wasn't great, but then again it wasn't a $13 burger like at Kuma's. Prices are reasonable, good atmosphere, good service, interesting menu. Will definitely be back.
