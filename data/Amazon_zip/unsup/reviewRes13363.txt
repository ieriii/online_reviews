It was fist time that we had dinner here.  The menu is the big issue.. The server said, dinner menu is ON THE BOARD ONLY! ....We have to look on the board. Don't you think its weird that customer have to look on the board only??/??  Unfortunately we could not see it well. The servers weren't helpful at all. We tried to figured out what good on the menu... and we were disappointed when we left. BTW We not gonna come back for dinner again.
