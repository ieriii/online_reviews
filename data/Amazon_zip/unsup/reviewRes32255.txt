I'm not a veggie at all (full blown carnivore here), but my friend promised I'd find something I'd like at brunch. Indeed, I had a cage-free omelette which was quite good. The orange juice and coffee were good too, and I loved the homestyle potatos. The raw vegan "cheesecake" was great as well. It was a bit pricey, but not too bad. All in all - a good place even for carnivores.
