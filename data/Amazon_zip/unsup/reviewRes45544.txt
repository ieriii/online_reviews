Gorgeous.  The place is much bigger and prettier than I imagined it would be. It's friggin beautiful. We got a table right away at about 6PM, but the place filled up fast. Sounded like there was an hour wait on Friday night.  Lot's of Irish Pub grub and comfort food options fancied up. We got some mac and cheese with caramelized onions on top and some kind of crust on top. It was delicious. They serve it as a meal, but would make more sense as a side dish in my mind. Had a steak sandwich which was plenty good as well.  Kinda pricey I guess. Especially since they are open for lunch, but they don't have a cheaper "lunch menu". But it was a great meal, and we'll keep coming back.
