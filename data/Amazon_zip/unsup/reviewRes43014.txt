I've only been here once but I enjoyed my experience. Nothing too memorable and it won't become my go to pizza place (for typical Friday night pizza order). The deep dish was very tasty and I especially loved the sauce. Price for size was comparable to other places in the area.  I'll be back again to try the stuffed pizza (it looked much tastier!). I wish it was closer to my work so I could stop in for a lunch time slice because it seems like such a great deal!
