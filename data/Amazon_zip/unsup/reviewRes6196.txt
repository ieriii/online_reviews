My date and I came here early to avoid the long wait, but still had to wait a good 40 minutes. And now that I've seen the crowd that gathers, 40 minutes seems like almost nothing. It went from a slightly full restaurant to jam packed within 30 minutes. As we sat at the bar enjoying our beer and each other's company, the bartender came around with a mushroom pizza for everyone to try. First bite you could really taste the truffle oil. I love truffle oil (try it on fries!). It was amazing, I would seriously go back just to order 5 of those to-go, then store them in my fridge and munch on them throughout the week. When you first visit Davanti, keep in mind that the portions are small. As our waitress stated, "it's like tapas" so order a couple to share. For 2 of us, we ordered the Risotto Carbonara, the Swordfish and Linguine w/ Sea Urchin + Crab. The risotto, although very tasty, felt like it need a little bit more cook time. The swordfish was amazing and its bed of vegetables were the best complement. And (saving the best for last) the linguine was top notch. I love sea urchin and this is the first time I've had it served other than raw at a sushi restaurant. You could taste that it was fresh and brought a creaminess to the pasta that no other ingredient could do. If you're new to sea urchin, this is the dish to try. It was my favorite of the night. I just wish we had more time to stick around and actually try some appetizers and desserts but we were in a rush. I'll be back though!
