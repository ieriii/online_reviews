This is my updated review of Kinzie Chop House. Gave it a 3 as of last but figured I would give it the benefit of the doubt and no surprise that it was as bad as last visit. Once again I went with several other people and not one person enjoyed their meal (from the bread to soup, salads and entrees). Nothing terrible, but the level of mediocrity was alarming considering the price and prestige of the restaurant. Our waiter, while nice, was terribly pushy to the table to up-sell. I assure you this will be our last visit.
