Hubby and I first visited The Purple Pig last October for a lunch enjoyed outdoors on an unseasonably warm day. We enjoyed the fried almonds and bone neck gravy smeared on bread ... the few other dishes we had were too forgettable to remember now. But it was interesting enough, and open late enough, to make a second visit this week. We checked in to the hotel across the street around 10 pm after a long work day and 3.5 hour drive from Indianapolis. It was so easy to just go across the street, and we were looking forward to a tasty and relaxing dinner as we started our mid-week Chicago getaway. Unfortunately, the servers were super-rushed and really took the fun out of the visit. There were no suggestions about how many plates we should order, or what wine might go best with our order ... even as we pointed to several wine bottles in the $75-100 range ... no help from the server.  Having made our selections, the food started to arrive. When they bring it to the table, watch out. A runner would literally run to the table, push our wine glasses and silverware out of the way to make room for the plate, and dash off again. A butter knife landed in my lap, and I'm still surprised the wine glass didn't shatter. As new plates came out, they just kept pushing them onto the table, and only when we asked did the runner clear away the empty plates.  Regardless of the crappy service, hubby and I managed to enjoy ourselves, thanks to an excellent Syrah and pretty good food. We again enjoyed the almonds and the pork neck gravy, and also liked the chicken thigh kabobs in tzatziki sauce. However, the wagyu beef sirloin tip was bland and no more tender than any regular sirloin I've had. Several desserts looked good, but by that time we were sick of the service, so we went back to the InterContinental hotel and finished the night at Eno where we enjoyed lovely flights of wine, chocolate and cheese.
