I've been back a few times since my 1st review and have to say that a booth, or a long table at front with several others is the way to go. Really no fan of the tables in the middle of the floor plan. Food's still good and a bit more than I wanna pay, and the staff is appreciated. The blueberry margaritas were a part of the two better experiences for me there!
