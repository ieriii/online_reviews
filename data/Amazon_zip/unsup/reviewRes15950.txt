Alright, I've never actually dined at the restaurant (thus the 4 stars instead of five) but I constantly order out from Calo's and the delivery service is fantastic even on a busy Friday night. My favorite is the thin crust pizza, it's perfect. Lots of combos to try and always good. The ribs at Calo's are also great. It's worth checking out, if you like good pizza and fast delivery.
