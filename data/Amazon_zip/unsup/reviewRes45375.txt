I loved the coziness of Wilde Bar and Restaurant. Red walls, dark woods and low lighting is what makes Wilde Bar a great place for a romantic setting. They have a couple of fireplaces and an area that is set up to look like a library with comfy leather chairs and coffee tables. The bathrooms carry the theme of the restaurant with the dark woods and low lighting, terra cotta tiles and I loved the sinks. Music could have been a bit more fitting of the restaurant and maybe just a tad bit lower to fit the mood the restaurant was trying to portray. On the other hand the food was just okay. The curry chips were a very welcome treat and a great start to the meal. I ordered the Bangers and Mash and the sausages were very good but the mash on the other hand would have been basically flavorless if not for the gravy. My husband ordered the Fish and Chips and the breading on the fish was just too doughy for my liking. It reminded me of either Long John Silvers or the breaded fish fillets you get in the frozen section of your supermarket...can't put my finger on which one exactly as I try to stay clear of both. My friend ordered the ceasar salad with steak. The steak was pink and cut very thin and looked delicious but it actually tasted flavorless and very tough. The service was okay but could have been better. I finished my wine about half way through dinner but the waiter didn't come back over to see if I wanted another glass until our plates were already cleared from the table. I'm all about being asked if I want another glass...I'm just funny that way I guess. All in all I give Wilde Bar and Restaurant 3 stars for their opening weekend. I do plan on going back eventually and will hopefully be able to boost the review up another star or two.
