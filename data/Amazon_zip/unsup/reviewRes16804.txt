The place executes it's genre modestly well, but doesn't kill it in any category. If you want a place with good cocktails that feels 'cool' then check this out (there's likely to be a line, but it's not too bad). Inside the unmarked door and heavily-curtained hallway is a room and a half of tall booths. The place was surprisingly quiet on a Friday night, and could have used some music. Staff were as friendly as you can expect in a place bent on being exclusive as this. They asked to 'shuffle us around' to fit a bigger party at our table, but offered to compensate with some shots. Upon inquiry they don't really have many shots (understandable), so offered us chartreuse - it was best described as taking a shot of Echinacea = stay away. $12 cocktails are acceptable, but somewhat high for Chicago, and the 2 whiskey ones I tried were good. Not overly impressive, cool place though, check it out.
