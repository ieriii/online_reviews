Wife and I shared an order of 5 Wings (w/Crisp BBQ) and a Baby Buddha bowl. Both were extremely flavorful and the BBQ had just enough spice to satisfy myself, but not enough to overwhelm my more sensitive better half. A decent value since we ended up with leftovers, but I promptly ate those two hours later because I was craving more. Definitely worth adding to the regular rotation...
