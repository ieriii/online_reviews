Super yummy but super expensive. Perfect if.... SOMEONE ELSE IS PAYING. Service is attentive but you can tell there is a snob-ish air to the place. Don't misunderstand, the waiter was friendly and helpful but in that fake-I'm-reading-off-my-bs-spiel-to-you-kind of way. I was with a group of people in our mid-twenties and I could tell the waiter was hoping not to get my table b/c he thought we would not be spending the $$$. Lucky for him (and me) SOMEONE ELSE WAS PAYING.  I had one of the "specials" with beef steak tips (I forgot the exact cut of meat), stuffed rock shrimp, and risotto. Steak and risotto were glorious. Melted in my mouth. I crave it. Not a big fan of the crab-stuffed shrimp. I am a seafood enthusiast and the description of the shrimp enticed me to order the dish. Sadly I found them rather salty and the crab flavor overpowered the shrimp. They tasted like some bulk frozen appetizer shrimp you buy at Sam's Club. That was the only taste disappointment. Complementary bread rolls were not super but who needs extra carbs anyway? :) Wine selection was great and a must with the steak. Only reason why I am only giving it 3-stars is because of the pretentious-ness and the price (if you have to pay yourself). I'm sure there are steakhouses not as expensive but just as good. Would be great for a date if you want to impress. Definitely make a reservation and order the risotto.
