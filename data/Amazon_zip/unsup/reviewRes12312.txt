I Love Piece. I recommend the pie and brew to all I meet, my family and friends!  I have one request though: Please come up with a better system for growler re-filling. No one likes the little bit of wash water that inevitably remains when the returned growler is rinsed. Sure, I wash the growler out at home and should maybe let you know it's clean and I just need it filled, but...Knowing that I was getting a dry, sanitized bottle to start my next growler adventure would be awesome...oh and Harvard-Yale?
