Oh it hurts so good! I no longer live in the Chicago area, and I am so homesick for Lao Sze Chuan! If you like spicy food, you will love it! When I am feeling down, I just close my eyes and think of the MaPo Tofu, and it replaces the frown on my face with a smile. But then I remember that I am in New York and cannot have it and my smile is replaced with an angry grimace. The Lao Sze Chuan Noodles (that's the name of the dish) is a spicy dry sauce noodle dish and Lordy mercy, it is absolutely delicious! Order it extra spicy and feel the wonderful burning in your mouth. The great thing about it is that even though it can be very spicy, the flavor is excellent. I hate it when food is spicy but the taste is nasty- like Tabasco Sauce, for instance. It's such a waste of delicious pain when that happens! Another note about the Lao Sze Chuan Noodle dish, you can now order it without the meat and seafood! If you aren't down with tear-jerkingly spicy food, don't worry because their non-spicy dishes are fabulous as well. I recommend ordering a few dishes and sharing family style with your dining companions. There is such a vast range of flavors and dishes here, so having a few options in front of you will help you figure out what you like, and you won't have to be stuck with one dish that's not to your liking. This restaurant is great for large groups. The service is probably not the best, especially if you have a lot of questions about the menu (unless you speak Mandarin, of course!) but whatever! The food is so amazing!!!
