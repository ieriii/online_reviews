The hotel opened in the fall of 2011. It's very modern, yet warm and inviting. We found the staff to be consistently welcoming and helpful. There is an outdoor running track, indoor and outdoor pools, a huge workout room, and more. Our room was quiet and comfortable with many touches of beauty. The concierge arrange deep tissue massages that were world class. The hotel is a block from Millenium Park and within walking distance of Navy Pier and many other attractions. Filini restaurant is in the hotel and we found it quite enjoyable. We can't wait to go back!
