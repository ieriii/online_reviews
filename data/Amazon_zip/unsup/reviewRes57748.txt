The 3rd Coast Cafe is a simple, but elegant Gold Coast coffee/wine bar without the stuffiness of the Gold Coast. From the hummos dish to the turkey club and crab cakes benedict, they serve delicious plates all-around. The staff is quite friendly too. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner to dine and unwind.
