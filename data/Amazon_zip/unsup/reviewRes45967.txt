There are only two things I don't like about Grand Lux: the large crowds and the tourists (often one in the same). However, I really enjoy their food so I have to deal with the wait time and the annoying people that are there. This is also a great place to bring my very picky aunt and grandma because they can find something they like on the menu, and my mom and I can find great veggie options as well. My all time favorite is the mushroom burger. It's incredible. All different types of mushrooms lumped together with a blend of seasonings that makes it one of the best veggie "burgers" around. They serve a basil aioli on the side which is delish with the mushrooms & garlic. The fries are delicious too. And you can't not order dessert at Grand Lux. The cheesecakes are so large you definitely need to share with someone, but don't pass them up. And cookies are a must to-go item.
