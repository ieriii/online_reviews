Color me slightly underwhelmed. I've been meaning to come into this place for about 2 years now, but every time I find myself in the area, it's after their lame 9pm closing time. 9pm, seriously?  I do like the quietness. In any case, the baked good I had (a danish-type concoction) was decent, though dry and the Intelligensia was also passable. Strong stuff, but not much flavor - and no non to-go cups. Maybe they're taking a page from Starbucks.  Speaking of which, this place is strikes me a little as a bakery-intensive Starbucks for people that don't like Starbucks. I liked the Bowie's "Starman" and Dylan's "Rainy Day Women", but Dave Matthews Band? My iPod comes up with some embarrassing choices sometimes, but at no time ever should DMB be playing in any coffee shop, unless you are, in fact, at Starbucks. Don't get me wrong though, a free wi-fi, free refills, douchebag-free scene is totally my thing. I am definitely going to try some of those other treats - a cilantro-infused cake? Yes.  I won't travel across town for Alliance, but I wish I had one near me - since I'm one of those people that don't like Starbucks. EDIT: I am deducting ONE star for the SECOND Dave Matthews Band song I heard in one sitting.
