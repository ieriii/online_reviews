The bar is awesome! Love the drink choices and the fireplace. Sets the mood right. This is a great place to break fasting! The steaks keep coming. There is a wide variety of choices. My personal favorite is the soy-sauce steak. Tastes a lot like Korean BBQ. The back has seating options for fairly large parties. Great place to hold corporate events.
