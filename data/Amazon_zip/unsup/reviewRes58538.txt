I pretty much had the exact same experience as Kay B. I'm from Dallas, and I'm stoked any time I get to Chicago, the food is usually out of this world. Unfortunately I'm only in town for a night and I really could have done better. Ambiance: Cozy space with a lot of potential. Seems perfectly suited for a large party with plenty of room in the back. Staff seemed very attentive to the regulars and large groups who came through.Appetizer: The bread and Parmesan they bring out is mediocre. Won't spend time beating that up, just bleh. I ordered a Caprese salad which was plated beautifully, taste was average. Served with now balsamic, just oil and pepper. 2 starsMain Course: Asked for the chef's recommendation for the main course. The waiter laughed and said, So you mean my recommendation? He threw out the spaghetti and meatballs or the honey and milk short ribs. The ribs tickled my curiosity so I went with that. The meat was well cooked, very tender not over done. Flavor was everything someone should expect from milk, honey, and meat I guess. Didn't really do anything for me. Not bad, but not a 4. 3 Stars.To be fair I saw some other patron's dishes coming out and had a few Ohh whats that moments. Unfortunately I just seemed to be out of sync with what a lot of you Yelpers have experienced thus far. Dessert: The dessert was far and away this meals saving grace. I went with the tiramisu and wasn't disappointed. It was out of this world. The waiter mentioned it is homemade every day in the restaurant. 5 Stars.Wine: I had the house red throughout the meal with a port for dessert and was pretty satisfied. 4 Stars.So long and short, I was expecting a once year kind of experience and was sad to say it was very average. Would I give them another shot?Eh. Ok.
