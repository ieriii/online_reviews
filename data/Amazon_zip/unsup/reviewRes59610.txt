this place is awesome! i know how to speak some of the lang but i'm just not confident enough to talk to a native korean speaker. the reason i said this because if you don't know how to speak the lang they might not help you much. when i was there our waitress never came back to us to see if we were doing ok til i call them in the lang and another lady pretty much helped us ... the food are great & so as the banchan.. i guess to make it short the things i don't like about this place is #1. the parking #2. the service & last but not the least you'll smell like bbq when you leave! but overall it's a nice place to eat & i would go back whenever i get a chance.
