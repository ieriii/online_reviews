I still think of the deep dish pizza at Giordano's ever so often.It was very crowded and the pizza took a long time to come. (more than half an hour). But, it was worth the wait. Before the pizza came, we ordered a few pieces of garlic bread first because we were really hungry.We ordered a spinach deep dish. It was oh-so-yummy! Who would have thought vegetables in a pizza would have tasted so good! Two of us shared one pizza and were stuffed silly, and couldn't move after the meal. It was that filling. But what's more important is that it was really good! Loved the crust and everything else about the deep dish pizza!
