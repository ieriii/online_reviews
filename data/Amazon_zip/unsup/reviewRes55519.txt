I have now been here three times, and each time has been amazing. I'm more into the sweet brunchy foods, and my husband is into the savory, which is convenient. I've had the white chocolate/caramel/pretzel pancakes, the red velvet pancakes, and the banana and bacon pancakes. All were just...perfect. The pancakes were all cooked well, and all of the fancy sweet toppings were delicious. Husband has enjoyed giant breakfast burrito, eggs benedict, and something with chorizo. Loved all of them, too. We've never had to wait for a table (luckily, we always are in town during the week, not the weekend), but I've heard this place can get quite crowded. If you can swing brunch during the week here, I would suggest that! The customer service is fantastic. Everyone is so kind, friendly and helpful. Also, very patient if you can't decide between two ridiculously-awesome sounding menu items.
