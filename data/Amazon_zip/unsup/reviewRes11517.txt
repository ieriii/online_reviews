Great thin crust pizza and interesting pizza styles and toppings too. The best topping combination I've come up with so far: red pizza with 1/2 meatballs and jalapeno, 1/2 mashed potatoes and bacon. The plain and white styles are great too, especially if you like garlic. The have pretty solid beers coming out of their brewery too, so make sure to drink a few of their own beers with the pizza. My only complaint with this place is the wait can get pretty long these days, especially on weekends. They could use some better apps on the menu to tide you over while waiting for a table, or let me call to put my name on the list ahead of time.
