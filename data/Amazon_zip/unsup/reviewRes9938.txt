High quality pastas and antipasti in an upscale setting make this a good value close to downtown. Heeding the recommendations of others, we started off the meal with the off-the-menu antipasti platter--generous and delicious portions of prosciutto, parmesan-reggiano, olives, and numerous cold roasted vegetables--and washing it down with the fantastic house breads--grissini, foccacia, and Italian baguette. For our mains, we had the Stracci di Farro and Spaghetti Neri. I loved the truffle oil and deep mushroom flavors of the Stracci di Faro, though was less impressed by the pasta triangles, which seemed heavy and doughy like a flat and oversized gnocchi. The black ink spaghetti in the Spaghetti Neri was delightfully chewy and fresh but was milder in squid ink flavor, a flavor that I personally enjoy. The seafood in the pasta was plentiful and good--lots of calamari and shrimp and a few mussels and clams. Finally, for dessert, we shared the house made dark chocolate gelato. While this seemed a little overpriced at $8, I've recently discovered that not every restaurant can pull off in-house gelato, and the smooth and creamy texture was a sweet (wink, wink) ending to our meal, even if it doesn't win the bargain award. Service was quite attentive, almost overboard at times. I don't think my water glass ever went more than a inch from full before it was refilled, and our bread basket was filled without even asking. Overall, this meal didn't blow me away, but it was quite delicious, making Piccolo Sogno one of the best choices for lovers of authentic "foodie" Italian. Price: $20-$40/person
