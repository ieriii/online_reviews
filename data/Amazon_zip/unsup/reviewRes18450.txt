This place would be more aptly named "The Mediocre Apple." Burgers were OK. The Bad Apple is clearly a wannabe-Kuma's, only it doesn't come close to Kuma's quality or variety in toppings. There isn't much else on the menu, so non-burger eaters beware. The fries were awful. I don't care if they are hand-cut. If they are burned, they will taste like shit. Beer list is long, which is impressive to someone like myself who doesn't really drink a lot of beer. But where are the ciders? You would think a place named The Bad Apple would have a decent cider selection. Boo. We probably won't be back. The Grafton serves up a better burger on a better pretzel roll for the price (and has a good selection of ciders).
