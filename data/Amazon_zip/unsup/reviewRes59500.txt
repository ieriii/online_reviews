Had dinner at LaVilla on a Saturday night. Group of 10 people. Service was friendly, prompt and spot on. This is an rather nostalgic place that will take you back 30 years. Older building, dimly lit, paneling, a singer at the bar. Very joyful crowd. Everyone there seemed to be having a great time, including those along the bar singing along with the entertainer. A good place if you need a mood lift of to celebrate something.Drinks were good. Italian bread and pizza bread were both good. Arancinii (Italian rice balls) appetizer were excellent. Salad bar was straight out of the 1970's and mediocre, but it's included with entrees, as is soup. The spinach egg drop soup was delicious. The veal dishes were excellent, as was a steak special that was a steak covered in onions, crab meat, mushrooms and a light cream sauce. A bit skimpy with the crab meat, but very tasty. The braciole was good. A tad salty but one of the better ones I've had at restaurants. The desserts; cheesecake, carrot cake and cannoli were all excellent, as was the coffee. We were there for 3 hours and never felt rushed. Good place for couples or groups. Will go back. We all split the tab and it came out to $35 a person - quite a bargain considering we ordered 3 appetizers and 3 desserts to share.
