I'm saddened to write this update and take away one star. The past 3 times we have visited my once fav Korean BBQ spot, my beloved soft tofu stew with seafood was terrible!! Ugh... It was watered down and tasteless!! I'm not sure why this is happening- there should be no reason to cut back on ingredients- the place is jam packed with a line out the door every weekend and weekdays are busy as well. I mentioned the tasteless stew to our waitress and didn't get much of a response- it's not really the kind of place criticism is taken seriously from the white girl who can't even pronounce what she refers to as "tofu stew" and points to the menu when ordering.
