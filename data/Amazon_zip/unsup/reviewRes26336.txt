When my mom saw this place on "Check Please" she decided that this would be the place we would celebrate her birthday. The room and "circuses" are quite nice. I like the open kitchen and vast open space outfitted with swank modern furnishings. The food was, unfortunately, a bit disappointing. We opted for the Chefs choice prix-fixe menu. To my palate, the seasonings were all wrong, and there was far too much bread used to fill you up. One outstanding piece of Wagyu beef does stand out in my memory, as does the wine flight we had to go with our meal. But when everything was said and done, the itch I had developed for a good tapas meal left me scratching. And the bill left me wishing I'd have gone to Cafe Iberico. The final nail in the coffin was when neither my mom nor I could remember where we had gone for her birthday last year until a week later.
