This place is a gem! Very authentic food and fabulous selection of beverages. Cuban coffee to die for. Service is so warm and friendly - hard to come by a place like this. The decor is perfect - and this combined with the music really makes you feel like you are on the island even though it is 20 degrees outside in Chicago. I believe it is BYOB also. Go here and go often.
