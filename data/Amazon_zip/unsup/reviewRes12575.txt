Went for brunch to try to use our $40 groupon - did you know on Sundays the bar doesn't open until 11 AM?! Since the bar was closed (we got there at 9 AM when it opened on Sunday) we both ordered medium OJs - fresh squeezed, a little tart for my taste, but definitely overpriced ($4.25 each). Anyway, ended up not using the groupon - it was too hard to try to reach $40 for brunch with no alcohol. Oh well - we'll be back. I ordered the honey jalapeno pork chops - and it's pretty much as good as everybody says it is. You get 1 enormous chop for the brunch menu, and it sorta has a soy sauce/asian flavor to it. It's super thick and I was worried it wouldn't be cooked all the way through - but it was and it wasn't too dry. The brunch menu comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast. The husband got the chilaquiles (fried tortillas) which were pretty tasty (I've never tried these before). Also comes with eggs. Everything was well flavored and really filling. Definitely won't need to eat anything until dinner after eating here for brunch...Service was pretty prompt, but it wasn't too busy - there were maybe 3-4 other tables in our section. The food did seem to take awhile to come out (another table seated after us got their food before ours - I blame the pork chops).
