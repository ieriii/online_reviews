Went only for a drink so this is not a review of the food. Recent Monday night...visiting Chicago, having just eaten at The Girl and the Goat, we stopped here since Maude's was closed. There were six of us standing at a tall round top for a couple of hours...the hostess would not seat us at the bar, even though it was empty. We were confused, but we went with it. I ordered a Moscow Mule in honor of Oprah Winfrey but it was too ginger-y and I sent it back. The bartender was cool about it and made it perfect the 2nd time. It appears they seat people in penned in barns (booths with low doors). I was intrigued and would try this place next time I'm in town.
