I revisited my old favorite recently to nosh on some good pastries and take advantage of free wi-fi (sadly free wifi or coffee shops are hard to find in Albany Park where I was visiting my mom). I walked in and immediately noticed the remodeling. I think I liked Alliance better when it wasn't all pastel blue and trying to look like an upscale-yuppie bakery.  They also scaled down the size of their pastries and upped the prices. Another bummer. Their delicious cupcakes are about half the size now. I also had a latte which was pretty mediocre. The cookies are still very good and they did add some more variety in the pastries which I was very excited about (mini fruit tarts!) The room next door was also remodeled and now has more tables and comfy couches, but half of the back room is now off-limits. It seems they do their wedding cake consultations back there. Despite the changes it remains one of my favorite independent bakeries. I'm going to keep coming back whenever I'm home.
