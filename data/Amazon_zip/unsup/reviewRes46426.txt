grand lux is like cheesecake factory's older hipper brother. the wait can be long just like at CF so make sure to get in and get your name on the list. the food is about the same, but a tad bit better and they have some good stuff on the menu. I love the chive potato appetizers and the mini kobe dogs. i've never been wowed by the food though, but it's pretty solid, i'm never disappointed with my order. you def get a lot and will have some to take home and it's pretty tasty.
