Oh, the yumminess. If you can afford it, this place is totally worth it. The salad bar alone was to die for, and then there was the perfectly cooked meat... Pace yourself! The staff were really friendly, and were great about filling waters and offering to clear used plates. We went for our friend's birthday dinner and they brought out a complementary decadent chocolate mousse for us. They take reservations on Open Table, which is always a bonus for me.
