Tried out this spot last night after wanting to check it out for the past year. We went with a group of 6 and only had to wait 5-10 for our reserved table.  Waiter was a little slow to get to us, but it was very busy.  Food was amazing! Everything that we all had was awesome: starting with the empanada & chips/guacamole (my only complaint was the chips- they're the overly fried harder kind) . 4 of us ordered the Arrachera (skirt steak w/rice & beans), which was so flavorful with lots of chimichurri. My boyfriend had the Chuleta (pork chop) which was also delicious, and the waiter was very accomodating and was able to grant my friend's request to have the ropa vieja appetizer made into an entree. (that was also incredible) Drinks were delicious-had the rasberry and coconut mojitos- but not very strong. Dessert was alright, nothing to write home about. Great ambience & atmosphere, HUGE space..very cool. Bill was a little high, but we didn't skimp on ordering either :)
