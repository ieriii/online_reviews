Alright. This is my first experience with falafel. And let me tell you, I felt angry and indignant when my amazing falafel sandwich was quickly inhaled by a slightly drunken self. My goodness, I can't believe I've been missing out on such an amazing food. I love hummus, but my god. They combine it with a wonderful cucumber sauce, hummus and hot sauce. Seriously. Inhaled. Only cost me $3.75 if I remember correctly.  This place is terrific! The prices are so modest! You can get a lb of hummus for $6. Crazy talk. I also got an amazing egg and cheese pie for $2 that blew my mind with it's incredibly delicious simplicity.  I would love to be able to give a more well rounded review based on more visits, but alas, I am a suburbs girl just visiting for a show downtown at the subterranean. Mark my words, I will return and try as many other items on that menu as I can possibly stuff into my mouth. I can't wait. Like people have said, bring cash!
