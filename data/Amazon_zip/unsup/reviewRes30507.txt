We went here for the first time last night... Although we are not vegan or vegetarian, we really enjoyed our food. The titanic burger is amazing! The service was great, however they do seem to have a lot of small rules that you should watch out for (not being able to be seated until all party members are there, splitting checks must be mentioned as you order, gratuity fees added on for parties of 5 or more, or checks split more than 3 ways, no substitutes in meals..) All of which make sense at a small diner, but just seemed a little tedious seeing all the rules written out in the menu. Overall it was good. We will probably only come here with our vegetarian/vegan friends though. Not on our own.
