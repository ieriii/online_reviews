The fantastically delicious and unique juices alone warrant a visit to this delightful and quaint Greektown brunch spot. Aside from your standard plain juices, they have blends limited only by your imagination: carrot/orange/honey (what I ordered--loved it), orange/banana/strawberry/honey, celery/apple/carrot, mango/orange/kiwi/honey, etc... They also have an endless list of smoothies and an impressive selection of coffees. I got the plain old boring coffee...good coffee, server not so good on the refills. I ordered the strawberry banana French toast--gorgeous on a plate, but more importantly, delicious tasting. Also had a taste of the spicy flamenco omelet (w/chorizo, avocado, jalapenos)--it is indeed spicy, but I did not like that the potatoes were totally undercooked. Get here before 10 am, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table. Service was a little weird. Our waitress seemed nice until she started pushing the daily specials like she was making commission on each one she sold. As each person tried to order, she redirected them to another (not even similar) item on the specials page, and each time we had to reiterate "thanks, but no thanks." We've already decided what we want, if I wanted the damn special, I would've ordered it. Moral of the story--fantastic juices, good food, obnoxiously pushy service. Hope you don't get the same waitress!
