I've been to Milk & Honey a few times. My last two visits have been disappointing. The second to last time I went with two friends. The hostess was space-y but nice. She was so cryptic about where to seat us. She seemed so conflicted on if we should sit inside or outside and it turned into this back-and-forth between her and us. We just wanted to be seated wherever there was space. During that same visit a friend had ordered a beverage with his meal but the girl that took the order never told him it was self-serve. It wasn't until after we were all served our meal and after my friend asked "where's my drink?" that they told him "it's self-serve." The last time I went there was it was a couple minutes after the breakfast menu ended but since the small sign next listing "breakfast burrito" was still propped up on the pastry display I figured it was safe to still order something. Boy was I wrong. It turns out the staff forgot to take the sign down. I was hoping they would oblige since they forgot to take it down and because it was just a few minutes past noon but they wouldn't budge. I was very surprised and disappointed they weren't accommodating. I ended up ordering the chicken sandwich. I felt that the chicken sandwich was over seasoned and very heavy plus there wasn't enough blue cheese. The bread, however, was divine as always. I highly recommend their coffee. My boyfriend and I love it! It's so bold and flavorful plus it's served in a really nice, big mug.
