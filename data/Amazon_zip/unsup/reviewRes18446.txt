This is one of my favorite bars in the area, I'm surprised I haven't yelped earlier. The beer list is massive, the prices are standard, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting, I dare say upscale compared to the dives I usually end up at. I'd comment on the beers list, but it would take too long. Let's just say there are two pages of beers on tap and a heavy leather-bound menu of bottled beers to choose from, organized by region. There is a decent house-made vegan burger option available, and that's pretty cool. Unlike some of the other reviewers on here, I wasn't totally nuts about it, but I'm glad it's there. I also strongly dislike their ketchup. I'll try the fancy PB&J next time.
