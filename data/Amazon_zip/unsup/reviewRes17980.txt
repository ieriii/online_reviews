Showed up on a Saturday night with a party of six. We called ahead and the host said it would be no problem to seat us. When we got there, his story was that parties of 6 should call a couple weeks in advanced. For a 'storefront' restaurant in a quiet neighborhood, it was packed at 8pm on a Saturday. They must be doing something right. The crowd was mostly older, save for the huge table in the center of the restaurant (there were easily 15 people at the table) that were in their late 20's and early 30's. There were only a handful of tables that were couples. The rest were mostly parties of four or more. The tables didn't turn very fast, if at all. As our party started arrive the host sat us first as a table of four, then as a full party of six. He encouraged us to crack open a bottle of wine we brought before we were complete. That helped enormously. Between the six of us we split two entrees and ordered another two entrees. The gnocchi my girlfriend had was good. I ordered the lobster ravioli which was good except... you couldn't tell there was lobster in it. The cream sauce it came with was excellent. It was a good thing we had plenty of wine because sober I would have been extremely irritated to pay $23 for a plate of lobster ravioli that didn't taste like it had any lobster in it. Including 18% gratuity for a party of six, the total bill turned out to be $152. Not bad. We also guzzled about four bottles of wine. The staff were attentive enough to recognize when a bottle was finished but too busy to anticipate and open bottles. A minor nit. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The host was gracious and accommodating. The plates were huge. I'm not sure the food was worth the price. But we all had a good time.
