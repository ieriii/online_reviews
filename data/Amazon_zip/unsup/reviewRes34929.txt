We've been here for half-price sushi a few times. The good: * excellent sushi * BYOB * and it's half-price sushi! The bad: * service is very hit-or-miss (sometimes we get someone great, other times, I think they could care less - we still tip like it's full-price and it'd be nice to get full-price service every time we go in) * tries a little too hard to be hip * really expensive at full-price
