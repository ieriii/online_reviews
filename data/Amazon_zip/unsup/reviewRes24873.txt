3.5 stars. I shave a 1/2 point for price. i'm tired so this may be my absolute shortest review. I am going to number everything... 1. I couldn't find the damn door. 2. when I finally found the damn door, I couldn't find my way upstairs to the damn main dining room 3. once i got upstairs, everything was fine 4. I was a little surprised by how tall the ceilings were.  5. I neither liked or dislike the light bulb light fixtures hanging from the ceiling. 6. we ordered a bunch of small plates 7. I liked the potatoe omlette 8. I liked the wild striped bass 9. I thought the cocktails were un-original 10. I thought the service was pretty good, nothing special, but on par for a restaurant of this type 11. I thought the desserts were mediocre 12. I liked the cheese selection 13. I thought it was very expensive. We spent about $350 for 4 people (inclusive of tax/service) and we had 1 drink each an NO entrees, just small plates. 14. I think if I went back, I could get a great meal for a lot less by ordering more efficiently.
