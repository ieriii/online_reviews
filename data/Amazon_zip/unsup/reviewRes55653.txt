Waitresses and staff expect newcomers to know the drill. Rush and act impatient while customers are ordering. Food is decent, some dishes unique but after a few visits and the same old condecending treatment , I will give my business to someone else. 3 1/2 stars for food NO stars for wait staff and attitude.
