We weren't even hungry. That was problem number one. But even as such, I HAD to have a some form of deep dish pizza while in Chicago, and Giordano's just happened to be in the way (like an annoying toddler). With that said: holy hell! The pizza's a combination of "wow, this is an obscene amount of food," to "this is... kinda tasty?" to "that's a lot of bread," to "oh, my god, does the cheese ever stop?!" and on and on it goes. But I'm a complainer, it's in my nature, and I'm particularly picky with good pizza. Now, is this GOOD pizza? Ehhhh, yeeaah, but it's not GREAT. I've had enough pizza to figure out what's great, while everything else is just good. But for being in Chicago, it's nice to check out.
