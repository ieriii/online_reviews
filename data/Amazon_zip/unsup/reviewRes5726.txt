This place was on one my to-go lists, but at the end of the night i was disappointed overall. When me and my gf arrived we were told that the wait was around an hour, but luckily someone canceled their reservation and we got sat outside almost right away. This was the plus part. Our server kind of sucked. First she made an obvious unsatisfied look on her face when only one of us ordered wine..is it so terrible that one of us didnt want to order a drink? Then she literally only stopped by our table to drop off our food, and never was around when we needed something else. Besides the service, we ordered the Bone Marrow pate which was honestly pretty disgusting. We are both a huge fan of trying new foods and i'm the type that enjoys almost everything i eat, but this bone marrow appetizer was like spreading lards of fat onto a crostini. We also tried the calamari which was not bad. The Kobe steak dish was very, um, regular. Every dish sounds delectable on the menu, but was quite disappointing on taste. Overall, I would come back again to give it another try. Maybe next time i'll go with just some wine and a cheese flight instead.
