Let's face it... the way people line up for this place, no bad yelp review is ever going to make a difference. But in case you're weighing the options, here we go. For deep dish stuffed crust touristy pizza, it's fine. The crust is nice and buttery. They don't really have very interesting pizza blends. For service, it's appalling. They line you up outside in the cold, torturing you not only with no chairs and screaming your name through the loudspeaker, but also the most obnoxious pop songs blaring through the speakers. I'm convinced that the vendors who sell cheap souvenirs on the street here must be half deaf, I don't see how they can put up with that. As someone who walks by Giordano's fairly often as I walk around my neighborhood... ugh. I don't need it. The wait service -- I know it can be haggard and busy. But it would be nice to not have to deal wave my hands wildly around for a new fork or a drink refill. I can only pretend to be at a dance party for so long. When I have guests from out of town and they insist on deep dish, I begrudgingly give them this. But I order delivery, since I refuse to bear with it. And yes, it will take forever. But tonight was the last damn straw. After their usual exorbitant wait time went on for twenty minutes more than I expected, I follow up with a call, and they deny they ever took an order from me. REALLY guys? REALLY??? No apologies, no offer to put in an order now to make up for the mistake (not asking for freebies here, just a pizza). Just -- too bad for me. What a*holes. I'm taking my sporadic Chicago pizza business and friends from out of town to Gino's or Eduardo's instead. Well, taking their delivery.
