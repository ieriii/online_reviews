This place is the place where everyone get's along for a few minutes. This reminds me of "The Maxwell Street of Mexican Food". You have thugs, skinny jean hipsters, vatos locos, GDs, Vice Lords, Families all in line - all under one groove - waiting for their mouth watering tacos. Don't get the chicken, just go for the steak. No frills, no bells and whistles, just the best taco you can get in the city. Put some onions, cilantro, and lime and you're good to go. Same style of tacos they server in Mexico.
