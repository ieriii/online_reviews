Came here with a group of ten around 4:30, and even though it was an odd off-hour, the salad bar (which is really sooo much more than a salad bar) looked fresh and delicious, the meats were sizzling and hot, and the waiters were extremely attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. Everything was delicious--from the potato gratin to the filet mignon to the brazilian cheesecake. The restaurant decor was pleasing to the eye as well, and the restaurant was fairly large, but it was still easy to hear the conversation around the table. Our experience was so pleasant that we ended up staying until around 6:45, just talking and digesting--and we were able to observe the restaurant as it filled up a little bit more for prime dinner hours. Can't wait to go back!
