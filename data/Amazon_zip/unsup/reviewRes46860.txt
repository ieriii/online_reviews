This is supposed to be a breakfast review- but we need to take a quick detour first. "What are you doing? Would you get down here? We are going to be late! " Came the shout from the driveway- underneath my balcony last night. Not quite a Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair- but the message was received. My friends were waiting!  We got to dinner and the liquor store on time and proceeded to have a fantastic meal- and then continued the party on- way on. I think we all finally called it a night around 4:30 (it was light out)- 3 bottles of wine and one empty and one 3/4 empty bottles of Tequila- All in all, a great time!  The grand plan for my birthday celebration also included brunch. But- guess what? No one could get up. The dire need for sustenance and liquid finally arose around 2:30. Iced coffees consumed, dogs walked, we were on a mission. Unfortunately- by then it was past 3 and NO ONE serves brunch in this town at that time... WTF? However, uncommon ground did serve a tasty bloody mary (heavily peppered) and chicken sandwich. That was almost as good! The sweet potato fries were outstanding.  The fish tacos looked ok- but well, I did not think fried would serve me well. One of my friends consumed them with glee. Our server was great- funny, quick with the drinks and patient when she had to refresh my memory on the choices.  The atmosphere was cool, calm, and QUIET- a much needed pleasure! They did have outdoor parking lot seating, but given the tornados in the area, torrential down pours, and lack of umbrellas, we did decide to pass on that option. I do have to say- the food was amazingly slow- especially when they had only 4 tables seated. However, good things come to those who wait. In our case- it was great food, quick drinks, and then to our homes for well earned naps. I do hope to make it to brunch at uncommon ground. They had some great looking options- however, that will require a bit of restraint the night before! We shall see, we shall see!
