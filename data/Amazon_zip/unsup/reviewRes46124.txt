Love the Grand Lux! Despise the wait sometimes. Heartily despise. It happens though. But the service has been nothing but fantastic. The food is average price for downtown Chicago. And the food itself is always exceptional. I still dream of their salads. Mmm. Ay, que fabulosa! Grand Lux is a downtown necessity. You may wait. And you will probably get so so so so so angry waiting. But once you're seated, it's fantastic. And the rotunda is divine.
