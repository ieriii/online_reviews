Don't Bother. My friend and I went in around 4ish on a Thursday eve (a week ago) and two people at the front just looked at us 'glossy-eyed' when we asked if we could have drinks and small bites. We were ushered into the 'lounge' where we sat with no service for roughly 5 min. Then my friend asked for a menu, and the same lady from the front said we had to go upstairs to their outdoor deck if we wanted to eat. It was 50 degrees outside so we opted out and left. We were turned off by how rude the door girl was, and how she acted clueless when we asked about eating. I thought her job was working at Zed.?? Anyhow, she just stood around and chatted with another waiter and did not even attend to us. Zed managers take note, if you no not want to loose any more biz, educate your host folk on how to be courteous with walk ins. * What the hostess and waiter should of done ...taken our drink order and handed us a menu, simple.
