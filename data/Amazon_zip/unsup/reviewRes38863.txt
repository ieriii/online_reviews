So I've been hearing reviews on how great and delish the pizza is at La Villa. Well I finally ordered last night and I'm so sad to say I was disappointed. I normally order from Petes Pizza BUT I wanted to try another place, and La Villa shouldn't have been it!  I ordered a thin crust mushroom and bell peppers.... It's OK pizza nothing special, too cheesy to where you couldn't even taste the crust which is one of my favorite things on pizza.  I don't think I will order again, it just didn't do it for me.
