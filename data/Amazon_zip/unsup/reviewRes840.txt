Not sure if there's anything left to say about this place that hasn't already been said. Having read about Hot Doug's in some magazine I can't seem to recall or maybe it was the travel channel, but regardless, I was going to drop by during my 3 day stay in Chicago as part of a cross country trip. I was not disappointed. I ended up getting 'The Dog', 'The Elvis', and my sister got 'The Sal' dog and we also got an order of the duck fat fries. We both got our hot dogs deep fried. My goodness, can hot dogs really be this good... Oh the 'snap'. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G One of the best hot dog joints in all of America.
