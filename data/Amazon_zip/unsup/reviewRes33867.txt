I did my homework, so I knew it was best to arrive early. I happened to pop out of bed early and figured today might as well be the day we try brunch at Yolk. We probably walked through the door at 9:30 AM, and the place was already packed, but the wait was just 10 minutes. When we left, the sidewalk was full of people fanning themselves with take-out menus, so I'd have to say the earlier you can get there, the better. First, the good: * The strawberry-orange juice was indeed delicious. * The blue bayou scramble was huge and very tasty. * The fruit and nut pancakes were light, sweet, and scrumptious. Then, the bad: * The waiter was slow to notice us and quick to drop off the check, but that's pretty standard for these touristy places. * The coffee was incredibly watery. I don't usually notice regular coffee one way or another, but this stuff was swampy. Overall, it was a great experience, but there were a few little annoyances I figured I should mention. Another thing to note is that the portions are on the big side. If you're a party of two and not starving to death, it might be a good idea to get an egg dish with a side of pancakes and split it all.
