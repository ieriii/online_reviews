540 reviews thus far so there is not much more I can add. Wife and I had a phenomenal meal there last night and thought the tapas were as well crafted as most that we ate during a two-week trip to Spain earlier this summer. Of note - the pan con tomat is delicious and very reminiscent of the flavor of what we ate in Barcelona, if not the same construction. Still, it brought back memories. At the end of the meal we both agreed that the bacon-wrapped lamb was our favorite dish.
