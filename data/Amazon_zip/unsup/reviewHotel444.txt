The rooms were clean, but the minute we walked into our room, our toilet was not working. It took 5 calls down to the front desk before they answered and took the guy 30minutes to come up to the room to fix the toilet. The service at the front desk, was extremely slow and rude. The line for check in was 6 people deep and there was only 1 front desk person helping. The restaurant that is downstairs was horrible, it took 65 minutes for them to bring us our food, never did they fill up our water or coffee, we just sat there, we would ask where our food is and the waitress would say, they were cooking it and would be out soon. We were so pissed that we just wanted to leave. we did not leave a tip and was not happy at all when we left. alot of the other guest were annoyed as well to how long the food took. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone that is on a schedule, the staff has no sense of time and does things as they please
