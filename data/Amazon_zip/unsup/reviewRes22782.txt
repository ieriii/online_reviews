This is the typical Greek restaurant I grew up with when my family would eat in Greektown after coming down to check out the Marshall Field's window displays over Christmas (like every good little Jewish family does over the holidays). So coming back here as an adult, this place definitely makes me feel warm and fuzzy all over. But be prepared to wait on a Friday night. Food comes out quick and the service is always impeccable (if you come in with the understanding that you're going to have a cold, impersonal, male Greek server - no chicks waiting tables here). If you like garlic, you'll love their skordalia (think hummus but made with pureed potatoes, not chickpeas). I usually head towards a special of the night dish or their typical gyros platter and am never disappointed. Opaa!
