The best place you can ever go and well worth the $60/ head. Anyone giving a rating less than 4 stars does not understand the concept of service and/or have the taste buds of what really good food tastes like. Service: you are never waiting. Once your disk is set at green the servers are lined up, knives sharpened and stacking your plates until you say stop. Your water or drinks are never less than 3/4 full. It's an experience you rarely see. Food: the salad bar alone is worth $60 with your fresh cut lettuce/veggies, authentic taboulis, fresh salmon, cheeses and bread to die for, authentic soups, and the list goes on. As for the meats .....amazing!!!! Top sirloin, lamb chops, and house special are my favorites; the remaining 10-13 other meats are great when i want to switch it up a bit and later cleanse my buds with my favorite meats. Within the last 7 years I've hit this place ~ 15 times and every time a dynamite experience. I've never ate their during lunch hours so no comments on lunch. If your ever planning a visit to chi town it is must to stop eat here. Well worth the trip.
