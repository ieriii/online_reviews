I've been to brunch at this place 2 over the past month or so and both experiences were really excellent. Both times were right around noon on a Sunday, so a line is inevitable. However, the staff up front keeps things moving and there's enough room in the entry to stand comfortably and not be a hindrance to others' comings and goings. I've only tested the breakfast thus far but both choices were exciting and I was thankful for having them. The Corn Cakes...holy god...I'm still dreaming about them. I've also witnessed the omelettes of my fellow diners and they look like a future possibility. The coffee is good and the cup is ALWAYS full. The menu is incredibly extensive--full of lots of cajun spices and choices. Also...carnivores will absolutely love this place--lots of meat going on. I've heard feedback on the biscuits (excellent) and GRITS--my one regret this far...that I've not had the grits yet. But, I still have time. I'm not gonna tell you that the place hasn't been really crowded both times I've been in there. I'm not a huge lover a enormous crowds but the atmosphere has not bothered or intimidated me either time. I'm definitely going back (again...and again). Can't beat the price for the food and dining experience. Just a really good, casual, neighborhood place to eat an awesome breakfast.
