Ok After reading all of the reviews on Yelp I decided to go anyway. But made my reservation for monday so I wouldn't have to wait an hour for my food. The atmosphere did have a hole medieval theme going with the long table in the middle and the booths were like stable when the close you in with the wooden door. The beer selection was great if you like designer Belgium beer. My date and I ordered the mussels, steak tartare, fine sliced ham, and the Avalanche salad with pig ears. First of all the food was a little over priced and being originally from the South I do believe no small salad with pig ears should cost 6.00. We were told the portions would be family size but they were definitely tapas size. Though I admit everything was wonderful the prices on the menu was not. Isn't pork the cheapest meat you can buy? By the way even though we were there early monday evening the wait was still long to get your entres.
