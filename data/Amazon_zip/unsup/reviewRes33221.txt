I've definitely had better but for the price and quantity, you can't beat it. I've yet to try to Falafel but the Kefta kabob was good. I also tried the Chicken shawerma (sp?). Both were good - but like I said, I've had better at the same kind of cafe/buffet line at the same price. I would say that this place is authentic. If you're hungry and need a quick eat & love middle eastern food, I for sure, recommend this place. I left happy and full. That is all that matters.
