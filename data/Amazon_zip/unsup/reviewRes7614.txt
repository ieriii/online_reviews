I've gone here a couple of times before going to a movie at Landmark. I always leave very full and happy! The food is delicious, they have a good wine selection, and the service has always been very attentive. My only complaint (and I use that term loosely) is they don't have a huge selection of dishes for vegetarians (unless you eat fish & seafood, then you'll be ok). I will definitely be back again.
