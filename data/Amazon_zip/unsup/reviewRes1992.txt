Let's break this down.. 5 stars - Going on a weekday. Ordering off the basic menu (Keira Knightley oh yes). A regular Chicago dog is $1.75. How can you beat that? 4 stars - Going on Saturday and waiting 1.5 hours in line (that first dog made it down in about 8 seconds).  Duck fat fries? Believe me, I looooooove duck fat, but the fries are marginally better. What they should do is give you duck fat in a dixie cup to drink with your fries. That would be better. 3 stars - Ordering any special dogs. I've tried 3, and they just aren't as good, nor are they worth the price. 1, 2 stars - Waiting outside and having fickle Chicago weather start going nuts on you.
