I had been wanting to try this place for so long, and food-wise, it did not disappoint. All the dishes we ordered tasted amazing: bacon-wrapped dates, serrano ham and fig salad, steak and scallops, cider-glazed pork belly... There were more that I can't remember, but it was all delicous. I was totally disppointed with the seasonal sangria though. It was completely watered down. Also, at the risk of sounding like a geezer, it was so loud in there! If you go with a group, be prepared to only talk to the people to the left and right of you b/c you won't be able to hear anyone else. It's just the acoustics of the place - it's not like they have loud music blaring. I would def recommend sitting outside to avoid this.
