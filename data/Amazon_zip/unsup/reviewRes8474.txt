Come hungry. Really. From the salad bar to the table, everything is up for grabs in unlimited supply. The salad bar has an amazing selection, but my favorite is the asparagus. They're frickin HUGE! And at the table, fried bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese breads are amazing, especially when eaten with different cuts of meat. Alternate between crisp salad and tender meat, and that's quite a meal. Yeah...the price is pretty expensive. But when you consider what you're getting, it's not that bad. Especially if you're hungry and eating platefuls!
