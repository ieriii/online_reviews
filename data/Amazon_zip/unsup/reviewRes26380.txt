My girlfriend is Vietnamese and she loves this place. You can't beat their lunch sandwich specials for $6.95 that includes the sandwich, a tall glass of lemonade and fresh fruit. And if you want to order just the Vietnamese sandwich, it's only $4. Consistently good food. I even ordered a full tray of sandwiches for a party that was quickly gobbled up. Cheap, good eats!
