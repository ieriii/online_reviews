Forget kumas corner, lockdown bar and grill is where its at. The burgers are very unique and wit loads of favor. They have like 10 big tvs in the restaurant so its a perfect place to watch the game and eat a kickass burger. The fries are fresh cut and salted, simple and tasty. I would go back in a heartbeat. Next time I'm going to get the Fat Elvis burger, it has Peanut butter and bananas. It sounds weird but hey that's what separates them from the other boring plain burger places. And you dont have to hear shitty music and wait in line forever like at kumas. I like kumas but this place is just better.
