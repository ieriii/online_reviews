This place is fabulous. My favorite brunch place in Chicago thus far. We do always have quite a wait for brunch (45 min - 1 hr) but it's worth it! I LOVE their different variations on Eggs Benedict - they are always done perfectly and are most delicious. We've tried a few other things too - the pancakes and French toast have been good as well but I usually stick to the Eggs Benedict (esp. if they have the one with avocado) because it's just too good to pass up. I can't wait to go back!!
