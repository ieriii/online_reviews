Oh, Caro Mio! Mi amore!!!! Not only did I love the food, but I couldn't get enough of our fantastic waiter, Cesear, calling me "mi amore." I felt so special. :) This place is intimate and warm. So much, I almost wished there were drape covered booths to snuggle with my date and feed him gnocchi. Caro Mio can ooze with romance, especially with the right trance music playing in the background. We went on a weekday as soon as it opened (the best time to go). We were completely catered to; the company of our waiter was a delight. I didn't even look at the menu! You basically tell your waiter what you like and poof he brings back this delictable meal that is exactly what your tastebuds were craving. The gnocchi porticcino mushroom dish is my favorite. I honestly wanted to lick the plate. The pumpkin risotto was a girl's creamy dream. I am a creamy girl, what can I say. The green bean ensalda was also delcisiouso. The portions are generous, I have lunch for today!! Truly a great first date, second and for life-r date spot. If you feel like partying up a bit, there is a backroom that can accomodate larger groups, but book ahead. I hear that Caro Mio gets crazy packed on weekends. People must know where the great food and ambiance is at!!
