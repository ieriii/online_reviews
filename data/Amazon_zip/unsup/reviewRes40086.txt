Bravo L&E! I've been on a gastropub binge lately due to the gloomy weather and Longman & Eagle has long been on my punchlist.. After perusing fellow Yelper's reviews, one rainy May night, I knew it was time for me to give it a try.. I had the pretzel with welsh rarebit (cheesy but not overpowering) to start. My friends and I ordered the following to share: Wild boar sloppy joe, Scallops with braised oxtail, and the Cauliflower (i forgot the trimmings). The standout was the scallop dish, it was PERFECT though the portion was small. I'm still craving it. The cauliflower was surprisingly delicious and a standout on a menu that mostly caters to carnivores. The wild boar sloppy joe was lauded by most patrons, but was not the best in my opinion. I don't think I'm a fan of gamey-tasting meats.
