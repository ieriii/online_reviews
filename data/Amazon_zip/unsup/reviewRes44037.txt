One word: Overrated. I was so excited to finally try this place out with my friends. I have only heard of good things. Waiting I was looking at the food, it all looked great and the atmosphere is trendy and "tranquil", BUT after all of that I left with a bitter taste in my mouth. The rolls were way over priced for my liking. I'm not cheap by any means but I believe rolls should be at least reasonable to the amount comparable to the fish/rice ratio. Another thing I didn't appreciate was the $8 cork fee for EACH bottle you opened. Needless to say, my friends and I didn't open any of the 5 bottles we brought there [good thing we live down the block]. However, my food was alright and I ate it although it was overwhelmed by the bitterness of prices and fees. The service was good as there were about 3 serving our table of 8. Hatsu-Hana anyone?
