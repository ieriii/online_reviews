Sunda was good but I was expecting more. I came for lunch with a friend and we were both left wanting a bit more. Our waitress, Noelle I believe, was outstanding. The service was top notch and she was friendly and cute. I ordered the eggplant and tofu toban. The eggplant was excellent but the black bean sauce was a little overwhelming. I had the spicy tuna sushi with it and that was very good. I think I would have been happier with the dinner menu. I had heard so many great things and then the lunch menu was a bit disappointing. I will definitely go back but I am not in rush.
