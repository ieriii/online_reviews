I love eating here but I don't come here often due to the long wait. Even when I come around 4pm on weekends (to me, that is down time), it is still more than an hour wait.  What I love best are the desserts! They are so good and easily eats 4-5 people.  My favorites: Molten Chocolate Cake With a Melted Chocolate Center. Served with Vanilla Ice Cream Fresh Strawberry Shortcake A Warm Sugar Topped Shortcake Filled with Fresh Strawberries and Vanilla Ice Cream. Topped with Whipped Cream My favorite entrees: Asian Chicken Salad Sliced Chicken Breast, Crisp Wontons, Rice Noodles, Lettuce, Napa Cabbage, Green Onion and Roasted Almonds. Tossed in Our Asian Dressing Miso Glazed Salmon Served with Rice and Stir-Fried Vegetables You must eat here if you're shopping on Michigan!
