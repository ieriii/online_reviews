Was there no later than 2pm and was super hungry. We waited 45 minutes for a table and another 30 minutes for the deep dish pizza. It's good but I don't know if it was really worth the wait. I'd say it's a bit overrated and pricey. Overall, one slice will hold you over if you're not too hungry, but given the wait, you'll definitely be hungry.
