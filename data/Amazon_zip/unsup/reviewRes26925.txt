Graham Elliot is such a high profile chef that I thought dinner was going to be "fancy" and that I would have to "behave." I couldn't have been more wrong. The restaurant was very nice and modern/ contemporary and the ambiance was relaxing. We were taken to our table and a minute later a basket of popcorn was placed in front of us. It was one of the most exhilarating tastes ever, for popcorn that is. The popcorn had fresh ground pepper, chives, parmesan cheese, and the best ingredient ever, truffle oil. Such an orgasmic combination of flavors! I could have eaten that for dinner and skipped out on the meal but I didn't of course. For my starter I had the cheddar risotto. It was a playful take on the classic Mac and Cheese. The cheddar risotto was creamy. Nice balance of saltiness and sweet (apples). My entre was wagyu beef, powder foie, and truffle consomm. The wagyu was cook perfectly but it wasn't as tender as I had hope. I tasted more like tri tip than wagyu. I can honestly say, forget the wagyu and just give me the truffle consomm. The consomm was rich and just with each spoonful was a burst of great flavors. I also stuck my fork into the venison chop for a taste and thought that the chops tasted better. Overall it was a good dining experience that served good food. I must say, the food was good but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It was good solid American food and it was done right but I wish that there was a wow factor. Great service and I had cold but lovely evening. I would give this place a 3.5 star for food and round it up to 4 because of that popcorn. So friggin good.
