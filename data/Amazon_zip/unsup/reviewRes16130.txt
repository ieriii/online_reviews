I came to this place on the recommendation of my trainer and friend Rob L. and I can't thank him enough. What can I say about Violet Hour that hasn't been said already? Great date venue? Check. Kick ass drinks? Check. I love the fact that it doesn't have music thumping in the background so loud you have to shout just to have a conversation with the person sitting 2 feet away from you. Not to mention the fact that it's only a 5-10 minute walk from my home and the few times I've been here I've never had to wait. Unless you've been there before or go with someone who has it's very hard to find as the only thing that identifies the entrance is a small light above the door which, I might add, completey blends into the wall. The first time I went there I was about 15 minutes late meeting my friend b/c I couldn't find the entrance! But once you've popped your Violet Hour cherry, I guarantee you'll want to come back for more. I've only tried about 3 different drinks thus far: Juliet & Romeo (my fav so far!), The Etiquette (too sweet for my taste), and something else, I think it was named Confederate's Widow? Hmm, doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore. It had a some Absinthe in it, and as I'd never had Absinthe before I figured I'd try it...definitely not something I would order again but only b/c of the licorice flavor of the Absinthe. I had to take off a star for a couple reasons: 1) first time is hard to find and 2) they took the fried chickpeas off the menu. Even so, I will still come back to Violet Hour for their fabulous cocktails. In fact, I'm going there tonight!
