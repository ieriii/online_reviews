The first time I went here was about a year ago and I fell in love. I went back a couple of weeks ago and the crowd had changed, it was really GTL and disappointed me. Tourists, people wearing Ed Hardy, it seemed like it was the first cool bar they'd ever been to. The first time was fantastic. It was more of an unknown bar, with amazing drinks (drinks still amazing), amazing atmosphere (atmosphere still amazing), but the change was I didn't have to wait in line for an hour listening to obnoxious chitchat wishing I was at Big Star across the street. Go once to try it....
