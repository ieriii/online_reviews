Great fresh seafood and tons to choose from. Glen's is rather new to Ravenswood and they do serve breakfast all-day BUT its really a Diner "in name only:" Don't let the diner name scare you off because there is some great chow coming out of this unassuming little restaurant. They advertise BYOB but they have a liquor license and there is a small corkage for wine. But who cares- there is enough fresh seafood to choke a whale.
