I always ordered the breakfast here as their egg sandwich is the best thing ever. I finally tried the fish, going with the rainbow trout, and man was it great. My roommate got the whitefish, which was excellent as well, but the light butter pecan of the trout dish combined with the vegetables was the clear winner. I'm going to try a new dish every time I go back.
