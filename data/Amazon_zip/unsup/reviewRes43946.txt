Yum! Such a cozy little place that feels even cozier because of how packed it gets on weekends. It's kind of fast food style in the sense that you line up to order and pay for your food at the counter, grab your own utensils, when there is seating you'll get seated (my girl friend and I waited maybe 20 minutes at noon on a Saturday), and they bring your food out when it's ready. I tried the huevos rancheros (which is only offered on weekends) and pancakes du jour (blueberries on top).  The huevos rancheros seemed to be the most popular dish ordered. It is served casserole style: black beans, pico de gallo, scrambled eggs, all baked with a cheesy crust on top. Both entrees were delicous; fresh and healthy tasting. It doesn't seem food here is weighed down by sauces or fat. Portions are also just right for the prices ($6-8 for most). Sandwiches are served daily after 10 AM, and brunch on weekends goes until 2 PM. There are also a limited number of bakery items they sell. The only drawback is the lack of space for the herds of people who come in and have to wait for a seat. You'll get a lot of hungry people in line eyeing you jealously while you're stuffing your face.
