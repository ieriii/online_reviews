An intelligent bar that specializes and perfects everything a real bar should and should not have. No television sets- check! Extensive beer and wine selection... that come in their branded god given glasses- check! Delicious 5 star gourmet food- check! A fabu outdoor patio- check! Really, I could go on but I do have a few small qualms that all revolve around the need for a larger bar and more space. Getting a drink here is very stressful. They need more bartenders and more space stat! PS- love the door man with the vegas themed tattoos... so cool!
