This is the best taco meat i have ever tasted in my life(outside of Mexico of course)! The little steak cubes are so deliciously seasoned with who knows what. For steak tacos, this is the spot to go.Drunk or sober, they taste just as good. I have not tried anything else on the menu but why bother when you can order the steak tacos and never be disappointed? The only negative here is the salsas which are bland and icky.
