I expected naked men fanning me with banana leaves while little people massaged my feet while I was eating this meal. Especially for the cost. But it was amazing all around dining experience that intrigued all my senses. Spectacular service. Fabulous attention to detail. Food was a work of art. Definitely recommend it at least one time in your life.
