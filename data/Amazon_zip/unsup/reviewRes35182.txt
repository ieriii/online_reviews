While the oysters at Shaw's were great, I wish I'd picked another restaurant when my dad was in town. The meal for the three of us (my boyfriend also attended), was slow. It is the first time in my 24 years that I have ever seen my father complain about the speed of service, as well he should've. In addition, when I sat down, I inadvertently knocked over a glass of water -- my boyfriend should not have been the one scrambling to clean it up. For a special occasion splurge dinner, I recommend elsewhere.
