Do not go to Caro Mio if you like real Italian cooking. The sauces on the meats overpower the taste, the salad was wilted by the vinegar ( I actually put bread onto the salad plate to soak up the dressing) and the pasta stuck together! You get what you pay for. This probably serves the locals well but it is not for an educated palate. Service is uneven. The only positive is the BYOB policy. I had a great wine!
