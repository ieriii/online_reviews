We finally made it to having dinner there. I sipped on a dark and stormy while waiting for the bone marrow. I cannot resist marrow ever. I thoroughly enjoy the insides of bones =P Then I chose the piglet, which was great. I liked the different textures. He had fried quail and said it was fantastic. Even though we were buzzed, which could have had an effect on the rating, i don't care. It's good, forreal.
