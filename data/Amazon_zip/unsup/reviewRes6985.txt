The free plates of pickles and potato chips as soon as you sit down are a great start. The pickles were a little sweet for my preferences but the chips were fresh and delicious. The drink menu was average - some good cocktails (wife approved the Q Martini) but the beers were all bottled. Luckily, the specials ($2 off about five different beers) made up for this.  Next up were the bacon cheddar hush puppies - crispy, warm, and infused with the delicious aroma of bacon. So good I wish there were more on the plate. For the main dishes, I had the q2 with the pulled brisket and a half slab of baby back ribs. The meat was amazing - tender, flavorful, juicy, and just enough spice. Three different barbecue sauces are provided a la carte (spicy, regular, and a vinegar style) for your dipping pleasure. The wife got the salmon special which was pretty good but the filet was a little small for the price ($25).  My recommendation would be to stick with the classics and you will not be disappointed. Great atmosphere and food, a fun place for a date, family, or a large group of friends.
