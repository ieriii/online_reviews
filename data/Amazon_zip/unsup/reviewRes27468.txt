After living vicariously through Rick Bayless cookbooks for the last few years I was excited to come and taste the food at one of his restaurants - I was not disappointed. A started out with the Mezcal margarita and then a Tamarind margarita which had a hint of chipolte(yum). For dinner I went with the Bagre Pibil, an achiote-marinated wild Lake Oceechobee catfish grilled in banana leaf, poblano chile rajas, Yucatecan rice, pickled red onions, incendiary habanero salsa and a michelada to help put out the fire. It was very hot with an amazing flavor. The meal ended with duo flanes of caramal and Mexican vanilla, both were excellent and the roasted almonds and caramelized puffed rice put them over the top. The only bummer about this meal was eating it myself at the bar, but I would definitely come back to do it again - with our without someone else. Great food, value, and service.
