Well, i wish i could have had a better experience. My friend and i decided to eat at The Sun Wah later in the evening, and the place was mildly busy, which we took for a good sign, however, it was misleading. The service was mediocre, the food was ok, and the atmosphere reminded me of a large dining hall or a cafeteria. I could not help but overhear that the couple sitting next to us, who were there when Julien and i came in, had not even gotten their appetizer yet. I had finished my meal before they were brought theirs. The worst, i think, was when the staff started putting up the chairs and mopping the floors before anyone sitting near us had even had the chance to ask for a desert option. (not to say that i had any plans to do so, but our food was still on the tables.) Sun WahT were you thinking. Sorry.
