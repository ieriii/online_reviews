Recommendations: oatmeal chocolate shake. I've had the burrito and vegetarian special here before, both were excellent and *inexpensive*. Friends have had the potato tacos and report that they are good as well. Also, if your dish doesn't come with them, be sure to get a side of the fried plantains! Yum!
