Very very good! We each ordered two different breakfast selections, and shared as always! Breakfast bread pudding - was like quiche was very good but not life changing... Eggy wonderful I can't remember empanada - this was buttery flaky delightful with a wonderful salsa to dip and douse with.... I liked this a bunch! Open face torta - with an over easy or poached egg and good meaty tasty spicy goodness through out... I am a fan not gonna lie! Egg Chorizo torta - this was wonderful, unlike any torta I have ever had, I am a big fan of them from my local dive taquera, this was more like a panini and it was wonderful, the story here was the texture for sure, crispy on the outside and on the inside the juices coalesced with the bread to make a moist wonderful melange of flavor and excitement all drizzled with a tasty fresh salsa and it was really beyond good, it was great! The drinking chocolate was lush I went for the creamiest richest version I figured one of them were low fat why not go for it, and it was rich to say the least...  The show stopper was the churro, with out any reservation this is the best churro I have ever had; whether you dip it in your drinking chocolate or not it is amazing for sure, I have had them off the street corner and from multiple panaderia in many cities and what ever they do they do it right! Ill be back!
