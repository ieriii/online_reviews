Most overpriced, overrated hot dog joint in the universe! If it weren't for those hot dog statues on the roof, the 50's-era drive-up ordering and the Superdawg PR machine, I believe their business would drop off 62% give or take. Their dogs are nothing special. The fries are limp, and I never got the green tomato gimmick. There are too many other good hot dog places on the NW Side (Jeff's at Six Corners, Jimmy's at Pulaski and Grand, Gene & Jude's in River Grove to name just a few) Let the tourists eat at this place.
