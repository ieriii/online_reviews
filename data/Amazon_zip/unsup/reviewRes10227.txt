This place is like the restaurant version of violet hour. The atmosphere is very comfortable and you feel like you're dining in someone's house. The waiter seemed like he was flown here straight from Italy and could not have been friendlier. We went here with another couple who raved about the food. I wasn't disappointed at all but I think that my boyfriend didn't fully enjoy his entree. The fresh mozzarella absolutely melts in your mouth so be sure to order some caprese salad to start. The sampler was also great to share with the group and we got to try a little of everything. My gnocchi was quite tasty and flavorful. My boyfriend had the short ribs but felt they were somewhat average. I would recommend this place and will be coming back to check it out.
