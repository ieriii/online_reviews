The thing about going to Lollapalooza parties is that they sweep you up in their arms and fill you with vodka and Pop Chips and hairdos and fancy hair products and face washes and so on and then they spit you back out into the world and you are at a total loss for what to do with yourself. Unless you're me. Because my first inclination is to go eat weird meats - which is PERFECTLY NORMAL so all of you can shut the hell up right now. So my friend and I left the Lollapalooza parties on Sunday and wandered up Michigan Avenue until we arrived at the Purple Pig. Because after 36 hours of free vodka, bone marrow and sweetbreads sound like heaven. Hell, after 36 hours of vodka, everything sounds like heaven. Shoe leather sounds like heaven. The only thing that does not sound like heaven is more vodka. Anyway, we sit on the patio and order three dishes: Melrose Peppers - Which were covered in sea salt and had awesome flavor Bone Marrow - Not as good as The Bristol's, but you get more of it. Crispy Sweetbreads - Which have a deceptive name because offal is neither sweet nor a bread. Everything was fantastic - especially the marrow. Our server seemed a little annoyed with us, but it didn't get in the way of the service or our enjoyment of the food.
