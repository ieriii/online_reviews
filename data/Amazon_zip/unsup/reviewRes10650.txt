Reviewer #719 Why does Piece need another review? Well it doesn't, but I went there so fuck it. Uber cool rock God Rick Nielsen owns the joint. Once he had Rachael Ray in and got her pissed drunk. The night I went there was another show filming, a band playing, and multi-neck guitars on the wall. It was a bright-spot in the culinary mess that is Chicago. The pizza was thin-crust, not that crappy, greasy, artery clogging shite. The beer was good, I got a growler of the IPA and finished it in the cab on the way back to my hotel.
