Can this food get any better!? I love this place. Great food for a great price. I normally get the eggs and steak and only spend $6 on a huge meal! The shrimp fajitas are amazing. The chicken soup is the best best best! I wish I could order everything on the menu in one sitting. I love how they give you a free appetizer before they bring out your meal. The only reason why this place doesn't get 5 stars is because they don't serve alcohol. I know I could byob, but I'd rather just order 1 margarita for the convenience. But over all, this place is wonderful, I go there just about every week.
