I gave up all dessert a few months ago - it was my Kryptonite, and it had to go. Still, I visit Alliance Bakery every few weeks and have no plans to stop. No, no, it's not for me any more... For the kids: Chicago baseball team-decorated huge-ass cookies. When attending dinner parties: French macarons! Oh God, yes! I miss the macarons more than ex-smokers miss their cancer sticks. Chocolate, coconut, passion fruit, berry, banana, and others, I usually get a few of each to bring to my dinner party outings. Nothing creates a buzz like a box full of macarons. Sucking up to the boss: I haven't done this yet, but word is my boss loves carrot cake, so I have good intentions of scoring a carrot cupcake and leaving it on her desk, anonymous style. She'll know it was me. Birthdays: Duh. The cakes are so light and delicious, and very pretty. And they have coffee, so there's a lot to love.
