Me and piece are friends! I ususally like regular ol' greasy square sliced chicago pizza, but when i'm feeling wicker parkish I get Piece. I usually get the bbq chicken and it is pretty pretty pretty good 20 is bucks for a medium with chix and bbq not bad I say!. The beer there is good as well and most of the servers are pretty knowledgeable.... I have never gone to the live band kareokee but I am intrigued that's'next on my list!
