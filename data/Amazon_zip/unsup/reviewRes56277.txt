One of my favorite restaurants in town! Delicious Vietnamese and pan-asian food, exceptionally friendly owner and staff, generous portions, superb value, and fast delivery. I am a huge fan of their lunch specials- comes with side salad, beverage (fresh ginger tea is yummy!), and fresh fruit! My roommate and I order from them at least once a week (not sure if I should be proud of that or not ;-) Another favorite is the beef noodle soup- very affordable and amazing flavors!Highly recommend both the restaurant and their delivery service.
