As much as I would love to try other places, something about Uncommon Ground draws me back again and again.I have never been disappointed. How could I be? The place is amazing! A bowl of sweet potato fries, and what could be bad?Try the bacon wrapped meatlof (enough for 2) and tell me you won't be back!YUM!
