Where is a $12 cocktail worth every penny? Answer: At Violet Hour. This unmarked lounge with tall chairs and blue drapes earns its reputation. You won't be disappointed, unless you were looking for PBR in a can. In which case, there are 60,000 (roughly) bars within spitting distance that will make you happy. If you are trying to impress your date, you should come here. Because she probably WILL be impressed. Bonus points for having a clean bathroom. When was the last time you went to a bar like that?
