My friends and I stopped in this morning for brunch around 11:30 AM. The food arrived soon after we ordered. I had the down on the farm scrambler (which consisted of bacon, ham, onions, peppers and tomato, topped with Jack and Cheddar served over potatoes with an egg on top), It was rather tasty and the portion was huge. My friends and I were still enjoying our meals, at 11:50, when one of the bus boys came over (stared and then interjected) "Are you done with that, yet?!?" directed at one of my friends. Before she could even answer her plate was whisked away. By noon, we were being stared down by the owners after we had paid our bill. I guess this was our cue to leave. As we headed toward the exit, I witnessed one of the owners snap his fingers at one of the servers as she was attempting to deliver dishes to a table! Overall, the food was great. However, we were basically forced to rush through our meal within a half hour! It made for an unpleasant experience and I wish we could have enjoyed our meal without the pushy service.
