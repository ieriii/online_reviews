I loved the prix fixe lunch option, for $15 you got three courses. For the first course you could pick the bacon cheddar hush puppies, or one of two salads. For the second course you could pick either a BBQ pulled pork, pulled chicken, or brisket sandwich, with a side of either fries or cornbread. For the third course you could choose from vanilla bean ice cream, cinnamon ice cream, or two cookies. Having an appetizer, entree (with side), and dessert for $15 is a great deal. For those that were wondering, the sandwich seemed to be full sized, the ice cream came with two scoops, and there were three hush puppies; you will be full. They give you homemade pickles and BBQ chips to munch on between courses; the chips were amazing. They give you new silverware between each course; probably standard for a prix fixe meal, however, I've never had a prix fixe meal before. The service was great; they refilled our waters constantly before they could even get a fourth empty. The only downside for me is that the pop came in eight ounce glass bottles and were $3. Personally I hate when restaurants don't have fountain pop because if I pay for a pop, I want to be able to drink as I want without having to rack up a huge bill (for the record, I didn't ask how much a second pop would be, once I realized the pop came in bottles, I didn't get another one because I've never been to a place that didn't charge a lot per bottle). I felt quite under dressed in a t-shirt and jeans because the building's finishings were so fancy and the service so attentive. The place was pretty empty inside (as everyone was sitting outside on the patio), therefore, I didn't get a good feel for what the average customer wore. Next time (there will be a next time), I'm going to dress up a bit more.
