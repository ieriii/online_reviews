Finally a GREAT restaurant on Taylor street! Ate here 2 nights ago and I am already planning when I can go back again. First of all the entire staff is fun, gracious and inviting. As soon as we walked in the door it felt as if the whole staff turned to welcome us. Our server was soo much fun and the sous chef Matt was AMAZING with helping us figure out what to order to get the best taste of this restaurant. Can't beat the unique wine concept they have going where you order a bottle at cost and then if you want to drink it in house you pay a $7 corkage fee otherwise you walk out the door with it. Makes this place VERY affordable and absolutely worth every penny you spend here! Also, their spreads are very similar to those of Purple Pig (as would be expected) however they are more then eager to bring you out more bread making the $4 price-tag almost too low!  Overall this is a great place to go on date-night, with a big group of friends or even by yourself and sit at the bar (they infuse vodka to make WONDERFUL seasonal cocktails).
