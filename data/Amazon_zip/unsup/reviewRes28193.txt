Visited Frontera Saturday with family from NYC. Great visit. Poncho great server in the bar while we waited for a table. Guac was great but a little pricey. 2.5 hour wait for a disappointing dinner. Catch of the day " Tilefish" was cold and mealy. Priced at $24.95. My wife's Duck with pumpkin mole also cold. Appetizers were good. No wow. But good. The plantains that arrived late were a high light as were the oysters. It's difficult when a restaurant doesn't meet up to expectations. Particularly when you like the chef so much.
