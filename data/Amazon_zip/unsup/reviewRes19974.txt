The sushi was decent, we ordered Tomago nigiri, however the rice was INSIDE. Last time I checked, that's no longer nigiri if you make it somewhat like a roll. We've had better Tomago at Sushi Mura. The volcano and white dragon were good, as well as the crunchy spicy tuna. Sushi gets 3-3.5 stars. Coast should work on the politeness level of its staff to the patrons. I was not impressed. Their new alcohol policy also is less than to be desired. They cannot touch your bottle, and you can only have 1 for every 2 people. Interestingly enough, you can have wine and a 6 pack of beer for 2 people... which seems to be counter intuitive to said policy. Service Level 1 star. Alcohol Policy -10. If you don't live in the area, I wouldn't recommend trekking out for this place.
