I dig this place for several reasons 1) it's in walking distance to my apt. 2)lovely ambiance-ooh they have multiple lounge areas. So it's perfect for just grabbing drinks 3)great service! 4)I love the drink concoctions. The mixed drinks strike a balance of utterly delicious but subtly strong. I like! 5) nice crowd-more yuppie less stuffy
