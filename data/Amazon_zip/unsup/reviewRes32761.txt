Zomg, best food EVER. If you are a vegetarian or vegan and you need a fix, COME HERE. They do not f*ck around. I have gotten maybe one thing in my life from there that I didn't like, and really it was only because I was confused about what polenta actually was. The seitan wings are amazing. The vegan nachos...I'm sorry, I got distracted fantasizing about them. The cheese substitute they use here, I believe it's called daiya, is honestly better than real cheese, I swear. It tastes better. It's so good. The nachos...just go, and you'll understand. And that's just the tip of the iceberg -- mac n' cheeze: amazing. Every one of their sandwiches is mouthwateringly delicious: the radical ruben, the california ruben, the black bean burger, and my personal favorite: the Dagwood. It has, like, three kinds of veggie meat smothered in swiss and this sauce that's just really...okay, I'm going to have to go again now. Service is great, ambiance is great, Chicago Diner is pretty much the best vegetarian restaurant ever. Just go and get the nachos.
