Really, this place doesn't need another review, but I wanted to comment on how surprisingly good the pizza was, imo. When I'm looking for thin-crust, I want a thin somewhat crispy, not cracker crispy but definitely not soggy crust, a tasty sauce and a good sauce-to-crust balance. I don't ask for much. Anyway - this one made it -- good-tasting crust with nice texture, really good sauce and the right sauce / crust ratio. We ordered the regular red sauce pizza, but got half sausage/pepperoni/green pepper and half artichoke/goat cheese. Yes, there were XX and XY chromosomes in our party. Only negative was the place is extremely loud. And to top it off, they blare the sound system over the already loud voices, so we spent most of our meal yelling across the table to our friends. If you know that going in and don't plan to do any important verbal sharing, you're fine.
