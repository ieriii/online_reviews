I went back to India House last night for dinner with a groupon that was going to expire. The staff were very courteous, we came in with our 6-week-old son and they seated us in the back area where we were the only ones seated, so I could feel comfortable nursing and didn't have to worry about him screaming (were they being courteous or protecting the other diners?? I will never know!). Right away we were given a basket of naan and a tomato-y dipping sauce which was pretty good. For entrees I ordered the palak paneer with naan, and my husband ordered the eggplant tamarid with rice. My meal was just so-so--I had waaaaaay better. It was just sort of tasteless besides the little bit of spice. The paneer wasn't very flavorful either. I didn't taste my husband's dish, but he said it was swimming in oil. NOT appetizing. I would definitely return for the lunch buffet but would not come back for dinner. To me, it's worth it to make the 1/2 hour drive to Devon for real, authentic Indian food.
