First off, if there was ever a place to benefit from the now smoke-free laws in Chicago it's gotta be this place. If you have been here before the law went into effect you know what I am talking about. ...my clothes would REEK of stale cigarettes bad enough to make me wanna hurl. Because it is now smoke free, I venture here now and then. As far as the review, you really can't go wrong here especially for the Sunday night poetry Slam. Oh, and the jazz, the jazz is phenomenal. Not to be missed, especially for out of town visitors. The history of this place is pretty cool. When you walk in you can almost imagine Al Capone enjoying a drink in a booth in the back.
