Hot Dougs. How can I not review this place, regardless of how many have come before me? I am an extreme latecomer to the Hot Doug's bandwagon, having intended to go there for the last 2+ years but only making the trip in late '07. My first time, I was in the area running errands on a Saturday afternoon, and it was bitter, bitter cold outside. The line still wrapped around the corner of Roscoe and almost to the alley. As I was watching, the line was always moving so I decided to brave it. I stood with all the veteran Hot Doug's patrons, who were all talking about what they were going to order, what they had ordered in the past, etc. The girl behind me was ordering just a single regular hot dog and fries... considering all the incredible specialties, I was impressed that the regular, buck seventy five hot dog was that awesome that someone would wait 30-40 minutes in freezing cold for one. You get to the counter and regardless of the fact that they are slam-packed busy, Doug will ALWAYS have a kind word, usually a joke or two for you before he takes your order, and if you want a recommendation he is usually dead on. After my initial visit, I went through a hardcore addiction phase where I was going several times a week (almost never a wait of more than a couple minutes on Mon-Thurs), but have slowed down to once a week or every other week now. Formula for a perfect business? Keep it simple, be better than everybody else at what you do, charge a fair price, and be good to your customers. Hot Doug's exemplifies all four of these points each and every time I set foot inside.
