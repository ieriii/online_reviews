I finally got to taste Giordano's pizza. After having tried Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Pizzeria Uno for deep dish and being disappointed, I almost gave up. But several people told me that they liked Giordano's, so I decided to give it a try. My best friend from high school was in town, so I had the perfect reason to go. We ordered a small, half spinach, half beef pizza. The toppings (or fillings, rather) didn't have much flavor, but the cheese was pretty good. I also liked the crust, which was salty, chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside, without being greasy. The small is more than enough food for three people. While I still like Zachary's in Berkeley better, if I'm going to eat deep dish, I think Giordano's should be your tourist destination if you're going to try deep dish in downtown Chicago.
