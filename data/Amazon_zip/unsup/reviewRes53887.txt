If you like crowds and overpriced Dominick's deli fare, by all means drop by The Purple Pig. There was not a single meat or cheese on the menu that stood out as unique.  I could put together a better charcuterie spread at home with a quick stop at nearby Fox and Obel. If you do stop by, skip the deep fried deviled egg. The deep fried brussel sprouts were the highlight of this mediocre, over-priced meal. There is nothing special about The Purple Pig.
