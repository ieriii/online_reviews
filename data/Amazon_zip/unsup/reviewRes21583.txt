How did I miss writing a review for this place??? It's really great Mexican food, and they have drink specials all week! Thursdays are half-price margarita nights, and (I think) Wednesday is half price sangria. The wait staff is AMAZING! I've only been here a few times, but they remember and treat you like you're their best customer each time. They are super attentive. I had my birthday dinner here a few months ago, and we were loud and drunk off margaritas, but still got awesome service. One of my friends gave me a pinata for my bday, and the waiters helped me hang it up outside and gave me a stick to go at it with! Very fun place! Highly recommend it!!!
