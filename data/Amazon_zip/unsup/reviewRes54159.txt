I first stopped in for a hot chocolate and a churro. Phenomenal. I returned months later for dinner and my first bite was like the scene from When Harry Met Sally. Everyone was looking at me. I couldn't help it. Everything is organic, the sandwiches are sooo good and still, even in the summer, I hope they serve the hot chocolate. It's that good!
