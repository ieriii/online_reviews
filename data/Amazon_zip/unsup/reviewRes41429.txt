So not only were we having a party, but most of the party was happening in my mouth... and it was amazing. We were in the private room upstairs, and were led up by the very welcoming staff. I felt like I was VIP or something. We had about 3 servers, who kept refilling our wine before it was even close to being dangerously low (aka half left), which impressed me being the wino I am. For apps I ordered their seared ahi tuna. The party was really kickin at that point.  There were 15 of us, so we had to order quite a few apps, but they were all great. The crab cake was not fishy at all, and the calamari was soft.  Since Ruth and Chris seemed to prove themselves with the seafood, I ordered the fillet for dinner, cooked medium, with shrimp.  It came out on a sizzling plate and was cooked perfectly. There were a variety of sides which were good, but mostly forgettable compared to the steak.  For the encore, desserts were ordered and I got the cheesecake. Definitely split this or take some home because there is no way you can finish it, I barely had two bites and was defeated. I have no idea how much this cost, which is the best part. So if you do go here, be careful because I'm pretty sure you get what you pay for.
