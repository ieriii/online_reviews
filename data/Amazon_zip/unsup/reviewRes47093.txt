I enjoy the atmosphere and service here very much. Our waitress was very informative on almost everything we needed to know. The beer selection was impressive, but was a tad pricey, even for good beer. The menu is not large, but that's fine by me. I had the pork loin, and while it was delicious, I will defiantly get something else next time. Because this place deserves another visit, no questions about it.
