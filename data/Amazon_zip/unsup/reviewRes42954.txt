A friend and I had heard rave reviews about this place so we opted to check it out. We got there at around 10:00 on a Friday and unsurprisingly it was packed. We asked for something in the lounge as we just wanted some apps to go with our drinks and had a quick wait (for a Friday) of abut 30 minutes or so. We started with the Iroquois cornbread and it was really good! The first bite I took, it was okay, but once all of the elements combined - the veggies, the chicken jus, the butter - AMAZING! After we had scarfed down the bread, we moved onto the mussels. They were pretty unremarkable. I've had better mussels around the city and surprisingly better mussels at bars (hello Hopleaf). We ended with brownies a la mode. They make their ice cream in-house which is always a plus. My goodness! The pistachio ice cream was DELICIOUS! It tasted more like gelato than ice cream - but that's a good thing! =) The hot fudge was amazingly rich! Delish! The atmosphere was your typical Loop spot - a bunch of slightly older yuppies and tourists. In fact, a bunch of guys were there from some orthodontics conference held at the Sheraton. If that's your scene, you'll like this place. I would go again, but it's not at the top of my list.
