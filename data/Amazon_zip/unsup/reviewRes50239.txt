Big fan of Fifty/50.  Everyone in Chicago should follow suit with the TV outside. This should be a requirement for outdoor patios in the summer.  The food is above average for a bar and there is a good crowd here on the weekend.  In addition to this they have a kick ass wait staff. (kick ass meaning very nice and accommodating...)
