Mmmmmmm. I had the 24-courses (plus the fois gras extra from the chef) and was in culinary heaven. It really doesn't get much better than this. I'm a vegetarian and lactose-intolerant and the chef was soooo great about it! When we made the reservation, I asked them if they could do a vegetarian option and they overwhelming accomodating about it. When they called to remind us about our reservation (how could we forget??) they double-checked I want it all vegetarian and AGAIN when I sat down! Holy smokes. It was fabulous. I've never felt so amazing after a meal.. slightly too full, but worth it. Bravo Alinea. You live up to the hype!
