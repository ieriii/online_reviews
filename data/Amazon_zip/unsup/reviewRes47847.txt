I'm writing this review based on appetizers and drinks at the bar. We came on a Sunday evening so it wasn't busy and we got a cozy seat by the fire. I loved the natural decor and all the wood. I heard they have really good cocktails, but was only in the mood for wine at the time. The bartender was pleasant and scored us some naan from the restaurant. We ordered the roasted veggie and meat fondue and boy, was that good! It was a perfect combination of veggies and tender, juicy meats. It was plenty of food and we didn't even need to order a second appetizer. Next time I want to eat STEAK and checkout the rooftop!
