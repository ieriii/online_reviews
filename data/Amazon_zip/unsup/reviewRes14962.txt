I came here with my girlfriends for a night out. I was unsure what to expect at first, I expected a lounge with a dj. We got there and its not easy to find, the door is hidden since it blends with artwork which goes across the whole wall and there is no sign up that says Violet Hour. We waited in line for 40 minutes....when we were about to leave, we finally got in. To our surprise, everyone gets a table, it has beautiful ambience inside, unique drinks, nice furniture. This would be a great place to bring a date. It's dimly lit and the menu has plated appetizers and wine pairs. I would definitely go back, but remember to plan ahead to avoid the long lines. *R*
