We went here to meet my boyfriend's mother for drinks. When you enter on the street level, whomever the gentleman working the desk was, was rude and abnoxious screaming, yes I mean screaming, at somebody inside. We thought he was yelling at us. We asked for instruction on how to get to the lobby and he remained unapologetic and angry. Anyhow, we wandered around and realized we were at the wrong Embassy Suites (Monopoly : Another Embassy Suites is 4 blocks away). This Embassy Suites does not have a working waterfall fountain at this time.
