I love Wildfire. It's one of my favorite chain restaurants. I've never been with anyone here that wasn't totally satisfied with their food. The martinis are great, and they have a full bar. I've always had good waiters and good service as well. When you pick your meal, you get a choice of a lot of different sides (au grautin potatoes, redskin mashed potatoes, vegetables, rice, etc). Also, for an appetizer I recommend the goat cheese fondue and the spinach artichoke fondue! Both are awesome. It's a little pricey, but I think it's worth it. The food is really good.
