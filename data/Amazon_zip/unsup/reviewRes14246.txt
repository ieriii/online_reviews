I stumbled across Glenn's a few months back when a friend of mine was in town visiting from Iderho... Ahh yes... that lovely land of hairy chested men, total lack of gun control and the largest potatoes you've ever seen... How on earth would this "toddlin' town" match up to Idaho?? I mean... really?? How?!?!? Fortunately, that's where Glenn's comes in... the breakfast at Glenn's was just the ticket to start the "weekend of woo" for my visitor... we all noshed on yummy pancakes... to die for omelettes... and of course to seal the deal... their famous in house potato pancake! These potato pancakes are so stinkin' good that often times my roommate will order additional sides of them... Needless to say... my friend went home, put her house on the market and is currently looking to relocate to an apartment above Glenn's... If you want a good breakfast... a hearty meal or even a fresh salad... where the food is good and the portions are the size of Idaho... go to Glenn's... you'll be more than satisfied!
