One of my favorite places to go anywhere. Don't let the exterior and the long line fool you, it's worth the wait, and it really just weeds out the annoying and too drunk.  Inside, you're seated at plush chairs or even at the bar. Music is good, and at a perfect volume - no shouting necessary. Limited seating ensures some intimacy and more of a murmur rather than, again, loud crowds. Sometimes it's just hard to find a complicated, entertaining drink in Chicago. Cocktails are about $15, but they serve some really imaginative mixes and you can sip for hours without getting annoyed looks from the servers. (just, you know, tip accordingly)
