This was our first time here. We had early 6:30 dinner on a Saturday night here on the main floor. I know there was an upstairs but there was a private party going on so we didn't get a choice to sit upstairs nor see the rooftop bar. I *loved* their Harvest buffet selections. I would go there just for that for sure! For this occasion we did order the $44 dinner - the meats (ribeye, venison, duck, chicken) were awesome; the seafood on the other hand ... (thumbs down). The salmon was completely raw on the inside. The catfish was chewy and oversalted. The conch fritter was all deep fried dough. The ahi tuna looked ... plastic-y? I've had better grade tuna at every other sushi place I've been to. The service was awesome. Management was nice. Would return, but would be extra cautious in selecting which seafoods to eat/try.
