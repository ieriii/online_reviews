I was really disappointed by Spacca Napoli. I guess I had pretty high expectations given all the talk about this place and the supposedly very authentic Naples style pizza - and it's rarely a good thing to have high expectations going into a restaurant. Anyway, the place itself is nice and cozy and the service was great, down to the complimentary little glass of dessert wine after our meal. However, the pizza was just way off the mark. While it looked like it would be perfectly done, with the slightly charred crust and bubbly edges, the excitement ended with the first bite. The crust was way too soft and spongy and there was too much cheese and tomato sauce on top of it, making it even more soggy. How they can turn out such a poor crust with that nice of a wood burning oven in their kitchen is beyond me. Even the flavors didn't impress, which was surprising considering they used what appeared to be very fresh ingredients on the pizza. Somehow it still turned out bland. We ordered 4 different pizzas, and all of us were equally disappointed - especially after spending $14-16 per pizza.
