This review is for the Sunday Brunch, as I haven't been to Sprout for a dinner service. I was able to sample several dishes for the brunch and they all left me wanting more. The lamb sausage "Farmer's Skillet" dish was delicious and hearty with its spicy sausage and nutty oatmeal, but I only got three quarter-sized meatballs. The dish would have been a home run had it been prepared with a farmer's appetite in mind. The "Steak and Eggs" had a great flavor profile, but the skirt steak was covered in a pointlessly thick batter. The "Omelette" was probably the shining star of our table, as it was large and flavorful. Chicken, shrimp, eggs, and spicy giardiniera? That's brunch food. The appetizer of Lithuanian Bacon Buns was sub-par, though the bacon was excellent. The highlight of my brunch was the Curious Jorge, a tequila, coffee, horchata, and banana cocktail. Get one and save the caramelized banana as your last bite.
