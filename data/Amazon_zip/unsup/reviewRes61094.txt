Having studied the Mayan ruins twice in Mexico, this food is hands down the best authentic Mexican you can grab. Extremely resonable on the pocket book and this place is a "Five Star - Bang for Buck" type place.Stop in for a loaded burrito (get everything on it, sour cream, cheese, guac, beans and rice) and you'll have the biggest and best burrito you've had and likely have half left for a rainy day.If you drove "do not get a pitcher of margarita" you will not be able to drive home. This place is also recomended by your local law enforcement because it is a manly place to eat.
