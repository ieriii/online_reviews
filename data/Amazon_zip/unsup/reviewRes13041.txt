I would give the restaurant 3 1/2 stars if that were possible. The food was very good but not wonderful; however, I looked at the pork chops the people at the table next to us were having and they looked incredible. I had the Cuban Beefsteak which could have been seasoned a little stronger. I enjoyed it but I could have made it myself. Unless I'm going out for dinner strictly for convenience because I need to have a meal before a show or I'm out shopping and I'm hungry, I don't like to order things that I can make just as well on my own. The plantains were very tasty and perfectly cooked. The person I was with ordered blackened duck. It was ordered rare and it looked rare but it didn't taste that juicy. It was o.k. The mashed potatos that came with it were excellent but there were only a couple of tablespoons on the plate. I can't understand skimping on mashed potatos. I might return to this place if I had some sort of a coupon but let's put it this way, I would not buy another groupon but I might consider coming with a $2 http://restaurant.com certificate. By the way, I read a lot of comments about slow service. Our waiter was very nice and attentive.
