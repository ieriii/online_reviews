This place best asset is the BYOB. The prices make up for loss of alcohol revenue so when it comes down to it, the food has to be awesome and it does fall short. I used to love this place, but with the prices for pasta going for $20 you certainly might consider paying for your wine and going somewhere else. I guess if you are in the mood for seafood, this can still be a decent option. I only wish that the owners were Italians so they can taste what's lacking.
