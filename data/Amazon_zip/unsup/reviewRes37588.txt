The best food market in the city, hands down. The paramount place to come for groceries, dinner parties, or even to grab something quick for dinner. They have a marvelous selection of fresh seafood, meats, veggies, cheese, breads and deserts. Their prepared foods are all I live on; they are amazing and have kept me from starving, since I have no clue how to cook. There is a little caf on the premises so you can grab a coffee if you have some extra time to kill. There is also no need to look for parking since they have valet!!!
