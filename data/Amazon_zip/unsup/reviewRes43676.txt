I eat breakfast here at least once a week, although this is mainly do to the close proximity to my front door. That said, I find Milk and Honey exceptional, great food at a decent price and refreshing atmosphere. The cafe has a short but masterful menu of well executed contemporary American breakfast and lunch standards. The chalkboard menu is always punctuated with seasonal, weekly, and daily specials, which is nice to see from such an affordable establishment. The seasonal cocktails and daily special pancakes are always sure things, as well as the specialty pastries and casseroles served for weekend brunch. The Milk and Honey Granola which you might recognize from the shelves of your local Whole Foods has no equal and is a true under appreciated gem. The service is minimal, fast, and sweet. The cafe keeps down costs by playing down table side service and encouraging self-busing. Although some might see this as a negative, I've found the approach allows a non-invasive casual atmosphere which is lost on most nosheries. Seating can be tight and become scarce over the weekend, expect to wait at least fifteen minutes minimum for seating on a Sunday. As a whole, this popular Cafe could teach a few things to most breakfast and lunch joints. Well worth a look if you happen to be in the neighborhood, or even a couple of neighborhoods over.
