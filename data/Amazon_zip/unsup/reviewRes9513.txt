Finally went to Sprout's Sunday brunch with a friend and my sister while she was visiting town for the weekend. * I made the reservation 2-3 weeks in advance and didn't have a problem getting in. In summary, we all loved it! From the decor to the drinks to the food - it did not disappoint. Though the music did confuse us - having Sunday brunch to techno tracks playing didn't seem to fit but maybe that's the vibe they are going for? Their specialty cocktail menu is not to be passed up. We had the Afternoon Delight (a fruity prosecco) and the Bugeymosa (a fun twist on a classic mimosa...but SO MUCH BETTER). The Bugeymosa had a surprising Thanksgiving"y" flavor of cloves or cinnamon we couldn't quite put our finger on it but it was the favorite. The Rumaki Fizz (with pineapple and infused with bacon) looked exciting too, though we didn't order it. As for the food, we started with the Lithuanian Bacon Buns - suggested since there are 3 to share. These were probably the most surprising. Reminded me of hawaiian sweet rolls but with a meaty surprise stuffed in the middle. Served with homemade butter with salt and black pepper. To be honest everything on the menu looked deliciously creative from the Caesar Omelette to the Rabbit Hash. Below is what we ordered: Curry Shrimp & Grits - great curry flavor, perfectly portioned Ham Croque Madame - Rich and delicious with stone ground mustard Lingonberry French Toast - perfectly moist with peanut butter mousse, fresh strawberries and raspberries YUM! Great alone or to share for the table for a sweet ending Bonus - Chef Dale sighting at the hostesses table : ) Can't wait to go back for a dinner date!
