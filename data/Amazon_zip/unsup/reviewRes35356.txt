A must stop when in the downtown area. I can't even count the number of times I have visited Shaw's and every time, I have not complained once. Shaw's can be for a classy or a dress down occasion. Depending on whats in season, the recommendations do change. If there is a must order scenario, I would recommend a dozen of the blue point oysters, bowl of the seafood gumbo, and order of the soft shell crab. But lets not forget about desert, I would go with the classic key lime pie.
