Tapas, tapas, tapas!!! This place has got the goods. Every plate that our party ordered was absolutely mouth watering. My only negative review about Mercat is that our party of 8 had to share these small morsels making all of us want more. We spent a fortune (YES, expensive tapas joint) on this place trying every dish possible on the menu. What a recommendation?! TRY EVERYTHING!I! The white and red sangria is pretty good. The white sangria seemed stronger than the red - both hit the spot though :) The decor was awesome! When you first walk in, you enter the retro-60's mod decor...you think, this place looks cool and cozy - but once you are called for your table, you are taken up the spiraling stairs to dining, dazzling mecca. Great high ceilings and large windows made my Mercat experience even more extravagant. You can see the kitchen wherever you sit ... its a good thing just in case you think the chef might spit in your lovely meal. Good food + Great Service + Casual & Comfortable = A YELP 6 STAR! *sigh* I miss Chicago....sorta ;)
