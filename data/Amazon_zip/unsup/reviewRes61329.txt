Meat lovers, rejoice! This place is definitely not good for your budget, or your waistline; but I suppose, that's what makes it so good! If you can splurge, do it here. Their meats, and there are so very many, are all cooked to perfection and seasoned just right! The salad bar should be renamed in order to include what's available here at Brazzaz. Breads, cheeses, sushi, pasta, vegetables, salads; whatever, it's there. There wine list is as wonderful as their staff. When I visited Brazzaz, it was 9:30 on a Thursday, and they still let us eat. Not only were they accommodating enough to even serve us, they were still sure to ask if we had any requests from the grill. Whether it be beef, pork, chicken or lamb that you crave, don't choose just one, Brazzaz has got your back in all categories!!PS: Be sure to thank the animals that fed you, a lot of them were sacrificed for this place.
