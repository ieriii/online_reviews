This was not the first time my wife and I had visited Yolk. We came early on a Wednesday morning, so there was no wait. I ordered the Irish Benny: basically a corned beef Benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached and everything came out piping hot, so we know it wasn't sitting at the pass for long. It came with a side of fruit and potatoes. The oranges were a bit tasteless, but the grapes made up for that. My wife had the multigrain pancakes. They were pretty good, but there isn't much more to say on that, it's what you would expect them to be. The menu says comes with "Maple Syrup" but I guess nowadays that is used to describe the high fructose corn syrup splooge and not actually 100% REAL Maple Syrup. The bill came out to be about $25, which is not bad at all for 2 entrees. So this might be a bit unfair since it was literally 90 degrees outside at 7 am when we went there and they have east facing windows, but it was REALLY hot in there. If they can do anything to fix that, like crank the AC as high as it can go, they should do it.  All in all, great place for breakfast and not too expensive.
