This was a great place for our two-day stay in Chicago. It was a good location, had free parking, a restaurant-style breakfast (instead of the typical continental fare), and a friendly staff. There was one guy, Wallace Pope, who always had a big smile, and was extremely courteous and helpful. I even wrote to the Best Western CEO about him.  It was not inexpensive ($375 for two nights, including taxes), but I think it was a reasonable price for downtown Chicago.
