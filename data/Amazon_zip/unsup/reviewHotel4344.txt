Oh my God. This place is SWANK. And not trashy swank like Vegas, but I'm-from-old-money-so-suck-my-balls swank. And that's definitely a good thing. We felt like such hobos with our non-designer suitcases and 3 duffel bags full of beer. I mean, valet parking alone was $60. They mean business! I don't know how she did it, but one of my fellow bridesmaids got us a room for $95 a night. Holy bajeezus, man. Nothing skews your sense of power more than a high class hotel room for that little money. I wanted to freak out and just start breaking things, rock star style. ANYWAY. My only gripe with the room is that there's no mini fridge. Wtf? How's a girl supposed to keep her liquor chilled? We made do with a bathtub full of ice. Incidentally, we also couldn't get the drain to stay plugged, so I guess fun sexy bath time is a no-no. On the plus side, the closet is huge. So big, in fact, that we made our guy friend sleep in there. He loved it, haha.
