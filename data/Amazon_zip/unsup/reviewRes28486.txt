[UPDATE: I'm updating because this place is awesome and deserves better than some petty negative reviews from people who only gave it one try. I have been here MANY times and can tell you that both the food and the service is consistently excellent and evidences care and pride by the owners, cooks and staff.] Snob free zone, not a place for refined tastes and don't expect your server to fold your napkin for you whilst you retire to the latrine. Anyways... I really do enjoy this spot, good service and great food not too mention unbeatable prices. I've had the Farfalle Pollo, the Gnocchi Aurora, and what was basically the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had. Each dish has a good balance of veggies and meat (if it came with it) and just enough sauce. And if you like mushroom, I hear the Portabella sandwich is exceptional. Do yourself a favor and go there.
