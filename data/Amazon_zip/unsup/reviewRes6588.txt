LOVE CHICAGO Q!! Easily the absolute best BBQ in Chicago. From the corn bread, to the cole slaw, to the ribs, to the carrot cake - it's bar none the best around town. Only complaint is that the bar is a little small. The restaurant gets busy quickly, so make sure to have a reservation. The outside seating is romantic and a lot of fun!
