Was taken here for my birthday and it didn't dissapoint - one of the best meals I've had in a long time and the service was great. Obviously very expensive so its definitely a special occassion place. The food is great, but I think you pay a little premium for the "scene" and the prime location in River North but you know that going in. Steaks, sides and drinks were all awesome.
