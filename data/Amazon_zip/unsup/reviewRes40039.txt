There's a hotel here. DON'T STAY THERE! The food and pub are great. Super service, great selection and yummy food. The hotel has the most hipster rooms in the world. Stay on a bed covered in your brother's old highschool bed-spread. Enjoy mixed tapes on your room's casette player. Sleep with the "white noise" of pub gurests laughing and vomitting. Wake at 3 am to the stink of someone down the hall smoking cheap ciggarettes. If that's not enough, the milk glass doored toilet allows for intimacy with your partner. The 6 inch gap above and below the door allow you to hear and smell what you would otherwise ignore, about your partner's bathroom habits. Enjoy.
