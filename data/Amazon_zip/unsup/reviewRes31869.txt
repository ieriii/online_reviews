I'm a long-time fan of Ethiopian food, especially the community platter ("messob"). It was excellent here at Demera--fresh and vibrant flavors. I also had a wonderful modified margarita, which was made with this wonderful fruity liqueur that invoked African flavors... cardamom was one of them, but I can't recall the rest. We'll be back!!
