This place is solid. I went on Saturday. The wait was long, but for some reason none of us minded...oh, wait that's because we were drinking delicious beer. I love IPA and was not disappointed (although in my heart I will always call it IP Che). The pale and porter are good as well. Between us we had the chicken sandwich, pulled pork, fish and chips, tempeh reuben (nice!), pizza (the one with rapini is awesomely garlicious) and the sweet potato cakes. All of it, really good especially in light of the fact that we were expecting opening week quality. As others mentioned, the frites were a little soggy, but again, the kitchen was working pretty hard... I like the austerity of the space and the limited televisions. The service was great--both during our wait and dinner. I don't think I ever had an empty drink or plate in front of me. Nice work.
