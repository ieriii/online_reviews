Southern style cooking found its way north to Andersonville and into my heart. The Boarding House Lunch served fried chicken that made me forget about KFC for a split second, along with collard greens, beans and rice, corn bread and biscuits. Wash it down with a crisp French ale and you have a meal that not only fed my belly, but filled my soul.
