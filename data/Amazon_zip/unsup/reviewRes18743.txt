Dear Chef Bayless: Please turn away vegetarians. Don't even try. You are disappointing them tremendously. I had an awful root vegetable mess in the late 1990's at Topolobampo, and now I feel cheated at XOCO. After wanting to go here since it opened, I finally was able to go this weekend. Shared a special vegetarian torta they had for their Farmers Market event , Vegetable/Black Bean soup, churros, and Aztec hot chocolate (roughly $30 total). Torta: 0/5 - Uninspired combination of veggies, braised greens and beans served on a toast baguette. Wish they used the traditional soft oblong torta bread that every other Mexican restaurant uses.  Soup: 1/5 - it was an "earthy" broth that tasted like the saltiest beef soup I have ever had. Had to be reassured by the staff that it was indeed vegetarian. Had only a handful of the potato-masa dumplings. The upside was the hunks of avocado that were floating around in the soup. Churros: 5/5 - I wish they would eliminate all of the food except the chips & guacamole and the churros. The guac is stellar (no guac this time for me, but I have had it at Topolobampo in the past). Aztec: 2/5 - Too bitter and not enough sweet. Also, staff needed to mix the drink before serving. All of the spice as at the bottom of the cup.  Atmosphere: 4/5 - it is a cute, although small restaurant Bathroom: 4/5 - It takes up a lot of room. But I am happy that they didn't have me go to the restaurant next door to use the bathroom.
