Mi Piace! Even on an average day during the middle of Chicago's winter, this restaurant can brighten anyone's mood. As soon as you walk in you're eyes are greeted with their spacious entry way and a beautiful bar. The dining area felt very intimate, but yet lively for a small area. They must have a seasonal menu, because the menu online was not the menu we were given at the restaurant. I had the Spaghetti Neri Frutti Di Mare, a black spaghetti with mussels, clams, shrimp, and calamari. Perfecto! My husband had the Tortelli Alla Bolognese, a potato and fennel safron stuffed pasta. He thought it was some of the best pasta he's had in Chicago...he also lived in Italy for a few months.  We also had the Cecina Fritta (chick pea fritters) and the fried Calamari...both delicious.  Such a great value for a wonderful Italian restaurant experience in the city. We can't wait to go back during the summer!
