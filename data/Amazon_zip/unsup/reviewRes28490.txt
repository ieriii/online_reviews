Straight-up one of the best restaurants in all of Chicago! Generous portions, great service, and completely reasonable prices :) Been going there for YEARS! And do my damned best to turn-out as many people as I can on the place. Found out about it on an episode of "Check, Please!". Awesome show, by the way :) I always get the *Spaghetti Fruiti Di Mare* (shrimp, mussels, scallops) "Pasta Bowl, you'd get 10-stars from me!"
