I've been twice, and both times it was...well, everything everyone has described. The first time was 6 months after it opened, the second time was January 2007. I have 2 quick things to add to everyone else's comments. First, I am so pleased that Chef Aschatz' cancer is in remission and he will be able to taste his creations.  Second, and much less importantly, I am a vegetarian which always makes me wary at the best restaurants. Elite chefs--reasonably--don't want to have to compromise and my food choices can get in the way. It's one thing to make a special request at the local greasy spoon, another thing entirely at somewhere as special as this. I've had to eat plain noodles at world-class restaurants before.  However, Alinea was just as amazing for me as it was for the other people in my party (I had told them there would be a vegetarian in the party in advance, which I think is always a good idea).  Everything was amazing. Most of the creations were modified versions of what my husband got, some were completely different (and, I suspect, pulled from the menu with more courses).  My wine pairings were excellent and the whole experience was as perfect as I had hoped.
