what a fun place to go on your day off. it's charming and straightforward. people are happy to be there, and they take pictures because there's no other place like this in the city. i had the supercheesie and my [very excited to be there] friend had the traditional superdawg. burger=ok. fries=really good. fake green relish and the tomato=awesome. i hate hotdogs, and i was nervous to have her eat one in the same car as me, but it surprisingly didn't smell horrible. maybe because it's an all beef hotdog, with no filler :) love it.
