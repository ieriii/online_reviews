I've been here a few times and I guess I was just hoping for a little bit more. I will say I am a big fan of their ceviche (any-style, really. Maybe I just love jicama). The food was good, but not great. The drinks are pretty small, though, and that's never a good thing. I guess, like I said earlier, I was just hoping for a little bit more. I'd say, if you're looking to get blown away, you might want to go next door to Topo.
