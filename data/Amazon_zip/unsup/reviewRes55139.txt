Q was highly recommended so we went for a late lunch early dinnerWe should of stopped with the pickles and chips........We ordered the Q3....very glad we shared this since everything was cold and nothing had any flavor.The ribs(baby back) were very fatty and I never experienced fatty baby backs before.We are big fans of Smoke and Fat Willies and Q does not begin to compare to either of theseAll I can say is we were very disappointed and.....NO NEXT TIME for Q
