I've been wanting to try a Rick Bayless restaurant for a while so I'm glad I finally got a chance as it did not disappoint. I know this place is popular so I was prepared for a long line but it actually wasn't too bad. Maybe it was because it was a Friday or maybe we just came at a good time. The line was moving pretty well until right before we ordered. We got stuck behind a party of 6 and we couldn't get seated until they got seated. This is a dumb way to seat people because most of their tables are for parties of 4 or smaller so we ended up waiting a lot longer than necessary. This is probably my only criticism. I thought churros from Sea World were good but Shamu has got nothing this. These churros were amazing. Warm and crunchy with the perfect amount of sweetness. I savored every bite and it paired beautifully with their hot chocolate, which was as good as advertised. I had the Mexico City Thick. I was afraid it might be too thick so the cashier let me try a sample first. It was a lot thicker than my friend's Almendrado, but I still liked mine better than hers. I'll have to go back to try the other varieties though. We both ordered the Top Chef Torta, which was the special torta of the day. The braised beef tongue was very tender and the chorizo gave it a nice kick. The bread they used was a little different than what I've become accustomed to in Houston. I'm used to having a soft, airy bun and XOCO's is more like a hoagie. It has a much thicker crust and is very crunchy. It's definitely more substantial and does a better job staying together than the soft buns but I think I still prefer soft bun.
