First off - yes, there are a ton of people waiting for a table. But don't fret, it really will be only 10 minutes like the host said. I promise. I've been in the service industry for years, and I have a lot of respect for those that work here. Every time we've been in, the service has been quick, friendly, and well-done. Five stars. If you're lucky enough to get a window table, the view is spectacular. I've worked on Michigan Ave for 2 and a half years, and I still think the view here is wonderful. The rest of the ambiance is ok, but the view is killer. Five stars. The food.... Well, if you stick to ordering the American dishes, you'll be ok. Don't get anything crazy, the burgers, pizzas (mmmmm, mushroom and goat cheese) the appetizers are all very good. The boy got one of the Asian dishes and wasn't very impressed. Lose a star. Well, when you look at your options downtown, this is the closest to being affordable without going to McDonalds. I recommend.
