Get it in! I say, get It IN!!! Yuh huh, I be at Crisp getting it in with the Korean burrito! Cause they are dynamite. Ooooh that chicken, lemme talk about the chicken. . . . . fantabulous. Yep, methinks that a word. I know, I know. Hush, it's ok. Korean burrito does sound unnatural when first approached by it, but it's not whatever atrocity you may be imagining in your mind. Their version is basically bi bim bap in a tortilla w/o an egg. And it's GLORIOUS! Out of their "You so Crazy! Korean Burritos" (that's what is says on the menu) I've had the Seoul Sensation and the Chi-town chicken. They're basically the same except the Seoul Sensation is made with bulgogi. It automatically comes with their atomic sauce, which from what my friend says who can handle their fair share of spicy is really hot, so if you aren't into the fire you should ask for their delish ginger sauce instead. I've also had the Greg's Grillmaster sandwich. I've liked it all, but the Seoul Sensation is what I can't help but get every time I go back. Oh, um you should know that if you eat in you may be sitting picnic table style with people you don't know. Sometimes this is cool for me and sometimes it's not. It really all depends on who ends up sitting there, lol. Otherwise the light is vibrant and sets up a lively environment. The music isn't too loud and your food comes out in a timely manner. I go out of my way to come here and there's few places I do that for. Don't let your sour vision of a Korean Burrito turn you off and go try one. Sure, the wings are most likely orgasmic, but be adventurous. I bet you'll like it.
