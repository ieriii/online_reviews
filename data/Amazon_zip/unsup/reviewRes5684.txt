You can def. tell The Purple Pig is a hot spot of the moment. Tiny little space, packed the gills. They added outdoor seating under a big purple tent, but the place is still packed and crammed. I felt out meal was hit and miss 1) Pork Fried Almonds with Rosemary and Garlic: Loved the favor of the rosemary and garlic, wish the almonds had been a tiny bit more crispy, they were a little on the soggy side, which I don't like in my almonds, but the flavor was spot on. 2) Prosciutto Bread Balls: well doest this sound amazing and life changing? well it was ok, but i expected more. They were really salty and I almost felt like how they were fried took away from the prosciutto and just left you with a taste of fried saltiness. 3) Chorizo Stuff Olives: well I hate olives, but gave it a try anyways. I felt the olive taste was way too powerful and you couldn't taste the chorizo. Again, very salty. 4) Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers & Fried Egg. This was the big hit! Would def. order this again. No complaints at all about this dish. Loved the crispiness of the pig's ear. 5) Roasted Bone Marrow Smear. I liked it. First few bites I loved! Thought it had a nice rich flavor, however the boyfriend couldn't get over the texture, therefore I ended up eating the whole dish. The more I ate of it, the more I wasn't into it, just to rich not to split with someone. Left the restaurant under impressed from all the hype and feeling like i ate a ton of salt! I would not make it a point to return.
