This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Chicago. Not only is the food amazing, but it's cheap and you can bring your own wine, spirits, etc. Everyhing on the menu is good. This is one restaurant that I can say that I've never had a bad experience at (knock on wood). Some of my favorites include the Tiger Cry, Spring Rolls, Peanut Sauce Lovers w/ chicken, and Pad Thai.
