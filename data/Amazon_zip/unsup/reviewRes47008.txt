My husband and I have been wanting to try Uncommon Ground for a long time, not only because we have heard great things but also because it's in the neighborhood and we like supporting local businesses. Boy, were we disappointed. The first thing that struck me was that this restaurant brags about serving local and organic food, however there wasn't much listed on the menu that was actually organic and there was no information about the farm sources they use. Also, how can the food be "seasonal" when the menu never changes??? I had been to the Uncommon Ground on Clark in October of 2009 and then the one on Devon just a couple of weeks ago...SAME exact menu. So, seasonal? Not so much (especially if everything is supposed to be local!) But on to the food. In my opinion, it was overpriced and really nothing special. Mac and cheese was good but tiny portion (I mean, if I am ordering mac and cheese I had better be able to gorge myself). Had the halibut the second time and the fish was good but it didn't "wow" me. I have to say, the service was the phenomenal (our waiter was so nice, attentive, and helpful). I wish wish wish I wanted to go back but I just don't:(
