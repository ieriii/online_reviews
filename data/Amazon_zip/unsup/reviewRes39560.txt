Cool bar, fantastic cocktails. Very well balanced. Great selection of whiskey, scotch, bourbon etc... Menu is amazing, with great animal parts I love to eat. Liver, sweetbreads, tongue, etc. Some of it was a bit salty and rich though, maybe just my selections. I do want to go back and give it another go. Based on other reviews and their reputation this is a place not to miss. I'd give it a second go.
