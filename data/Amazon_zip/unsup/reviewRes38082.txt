I LOVE Giordano's. The pizza is AMAZING. For us Michiganders, we think Pizza Papalis is the end-all and be-all. Well, I hate to break it to you, but Giordano's started it all. According to the myth, one of the founders of Giordano's left and started PP in Michigan. Don't take this as gospel, but I'm pretty sure this is true :) My husband and I both had food-gasms while eating the pizza we ordered. A small deep dish is really enough for three, and we got sausage, pepperoni and garlic. We paid the price with wicked breath later, but it was worth it. Tons of toppings, melty cheese, crisp crust and tart sauce. We forced ourselves to eat ALL of it because we didn't have a fridge at the hotel and we couldn't let it go to waste. The service lacked a little bit - but it was fine. The server wasn't genuinely happy or pleasant, and refills were a bit slow. Oh well. The pizza is the star of the show.
