I have been here three times in last couple of years. It has become a tradition every time we visit Chicago. I lOVE, LOVE, LOVE this pizza! I just finished our carry-out. We hadn't planned on getting it to go, but the line was long and the weather was cold...carry-out it was! Places our order, headed over to Banana Republic to kill the hour wait, and returned to pick up our pizza. We had a 10 minute walk back to our hotel room in low 30 degree weather but the pizza was still nice and hot. Will return for sure!
