If you have any hesitations on going here for dinner in a small group, a large group, or just with a date, GET OVER IT! This place is delicious, authentic, accessible, and well priced. I went on a saturday night and we definitely needed a reservation. The host was nice enough to seat us in 10 minutes-- but we would have been happy to wait longer at the bar.   There is live Ethiopian music playing (a dude playing a cool instrument) in the dining room. There is even a beautiful, friendly dancer who will teach the diners how to do some shoulder action dancing while eating. I had so much fun watching her. If anything, I'm gonna go back just to see her again!  While dancing like a rockstar, my 4 friends and I shared the vegetarian sampler ($14.50 per person)-- which is every vegetarian option on the menu served on a large piece of ethiopian bread-- which can be described as spongey, filling, and delicious! Even if you are not a vegetarian, I would suggest to get this sampler or any plate for that matter. It's so much more accessible than a meat dish-- it will remind you of Indian food textures.  Get the vegetarian sambussas-- knock your socks off delicious.  You should also know that there is no silverware. You eat with your hands-- so wash 'em!    I'll definitely be back here.
