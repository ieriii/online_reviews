The Indian House is my favorite Indian restaurant. Their food is always fresh and the spices are perfect. The only reason I don't go as often as I would like is because the prices are a little high, but it's expected when the food is so good. I always get the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, naan and the rice. I try going to new places, but they don't compare to the Indian House. For all the people who never ate Indian food, this is a great place to try it for your first time.
