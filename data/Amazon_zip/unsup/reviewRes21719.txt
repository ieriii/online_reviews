I have lived in this neighborhood for almost 3 years and I would drive by Superdawgs time after time, saying to myself I am going to come and check out this place tomorrow. And I would never do it. Finally I was true to my word and drove up and step backed to the 1950s. When times were simpler! What a great gimmick, Drive In services! You can't beat that. Also, the little boxes that the food comes in are perfect for in car eating. Now on to the food! Everyone has their own version of what the perfect Hot Dog is so I am not going to try to sell you on that. But if you do love the Chicago "Dawg" then you must, and I mean MUST, take time out of your busy life and at least try this Magnificent Dog. You will not regret it. And even though the Hot Dog is what they are known for by all means try out the rest of the menu. Everything is equally delicious! With summer around the corner I will be coming back quite frequently!
