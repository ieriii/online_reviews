Sometimes it's hard to rate celebrity run restaurants. You go in with completely different expectations than your typical neighborhood place. The food may be better than most, but is it possible to live up to the hype? The service, guacamole, tres leches, and cocktails were outstanding. The entrees were tasty, if not great. I would avoid the oysters.
