Fresh and excellent tasting sushi would give this place 5 stars. However, the noise level is atrocious. I couldn't hear the person sitting right next because of the noise level. Plus, the server did not refill our drinks until we finally had to ask the busboy.  Although the rolls were not really creative, they were solid and what sushi should be. They were rolled tightly and tasted great. The prices were middle of the road as far as sushi restaurants go.  I will definitely be frequenting this place again.
