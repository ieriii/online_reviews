Bring some patience and bug spray as the line is usually long and there are biting bugs that like to wait with you in the summer. Cash only, and check ahead because the hours are short and they like to take weeks off around the holidays. Aside from all that, the people we waited with were friendly, as was Doug. The decor was hot dog 50's kitsch and clean. We ordered several specials so we could sample and share. There was a raspberry smelly cheese number, jalapeno, a regular dog, and some duck fat fries of course! Pretty delicious homemade encased meats and a good time.
