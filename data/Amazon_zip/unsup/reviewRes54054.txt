Loved it! I went on a Friday at 6ish with a group of 8, we got a big booth to ourselves and had an excellent time. Decor-wise, I dug the big curtains and the tall chairs. Normally, $12 for a drink is excessive for my taste, but it was definitely worth it! Quality ingredients, strong, and delicious all around. Our server was very nice and had great recommendations.
