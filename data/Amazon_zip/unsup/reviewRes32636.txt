If you've never had Ethiopian food before, this is a great place to start. They have it set up where you can choose four different dishes and they bring you little mounds (which are still a good bit of food) piled on top of injera (the bread that you eat with). This way you can try a bunch of different things. Usually my husband and I do eight little dishes and get to try a bunch of different things. Their lamb is amazing and I wish I could remember the name of the particular dish. But really most everything is very flavorful and yummy. And their Ethiopian coffee is beyond amazing. They bring out your own little clay pot and everything. My husband loves it.
