Gilt Bar was a wonderful place to celebrate a recent milestone over a couple of cocktails with some ladies I don't see often enough. It managed to live up to my high expectations, and I expect I'll be back on a date-type excursion again soon. Trendy, yes. Yuppie-ish, definitely. But the decor is warm, with wood tables and yellow lights sprinkled around the lofty space. The service is attentive - bordering on hovering, perhaps, but in a good way. I never saw the bottom of my glass. Speaking of glass, the cocktail prices are a bit steeper than I'd typically spend for an everyday happy hour. $11 for a Pimm's cup - but what a Pimm's cup it was! (OK, so it was two...) Food prices are a bit steep as well, but the quality was wonderful and the portions were sized for sharing. The pluot salad, the gioia burrata (the "dreamy, creamy cousin of mozzarella"), and the orecchiette with spicy pork sausage were highlights. Oh! and they accept reservations via OpenTable.
