We held my daughter's bridal shower in Calo's private room after experiencing several wonderful meals in their dining room. The whole day was such a pleasure...the manager is top notch and very service oriented. He was onsite the entire time and continually checked in with me to see that things were running well...and they were! From accommodating last minute table changes to great pours from Diana the bartender, only the food outshone the service. Chicken Vesuvio came out of the kitchen perfectly- tender, moist, flavorful and surrounded by wonderfully roasted potatoes...everyone raved about the food. The room itself is very intimate without being small and since the table set ups were for eight guests, everyone got a chance to sit and chat with each other. Lovely votive candles were set throughout the restaurant (not just on the dining tables) that created a warm atmosphere. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the private dining for anyone who would like to have an event to remember for their guests...and I won't hesitate to return to have dinner again and again after the great experience we had with the shower! Outstanding attention to detail, quality of food and overall good management make a go-to place from now on! There is even a free parking lot directly accross the street!
