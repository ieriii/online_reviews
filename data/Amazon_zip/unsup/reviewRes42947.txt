I still love this place!!! My absolute favorite non-Chicago style pizza in the city! I am a regular customer and could eat here every day. The staff is really nice, too! Have had lots of different pizzas and all are excellent! My husband especially loves the Buffalo Chicken - it's too rich for me, though! They never skimp on toppings, too. Go there!
