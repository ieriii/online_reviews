-Cheesy garlic bread is the bomb. Best cheese ever. -Fries doesn't look great, but they were perfectly salted. -Thin crust pizza was okay. I probably wouldn't get it again. -Pan pizza with the caramelized crust was pretty awesome. Get the sausage but stay away from the fresh basil because they don't give much of it. Great service and the pizza comes out pretty quick (when we went, at least). Thumbs up for value.
