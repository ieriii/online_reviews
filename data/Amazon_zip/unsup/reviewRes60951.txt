3 friends and I had dinner at Bin 36 last night. We had an enjoyable evening up until the last 10 minutes of our meal. After spending over $300 on appetizers, wine flights and entrees my friend asked if she could take home a few of the complimentary breadsticks for her husband. The waiter said sure, "for $1 a breadstick." Surely he's joking we thought. She asked for 20 breadsticks and sure enough there was a $20 charge for breadsticks. We paid the bill and on the way out I explained to the manager how angry we were about being nickel and dimed over COMPLIMENTARY breadsticks after spending over $300 on dinner. She apologized for the confusion and offered to return the $20. We said that would be fine and when she handed my friend her money back she took the breadsticks back!!! WHAT!?! We were absolutely livid by this point and when I asked her to explain the policy of charging for a complimentary item she said "they didn't want to get into the business of selling breadsticks." Really? Is that that big of a problem at Bin 36? The restaurant was half-empty and they were more concerned about the potential crisis of getting into the business of selling breadsticks opposed to taking care of customers who otherwise would have left quite happy. Now over a few silly breadsticks that probably cost them a few bucks TOPS they've lost 4 customers and the countless number of people each of us will tell about this ridiculous, inconceivable policy. I'm in the food industry and have had the honor of working with some of the top chefs in the country and I simply cannot imagine any of them treating a customer the way we were treated last night. At some point I'm sure I'm going to have a good laugh over Breadstick-Gate but right now my blood is still boiling. There are too many wonderful restaurants in Chicago to waste your time and money at Bin 36.
