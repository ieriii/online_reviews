Despite feeling cheated that Hubert Keller didn't win Top Chef Masters (and I take that personally for my man Hubert), I did really like some of the food here...but then I also really didn't like others. The ceviches were all really fresh and yummy. The queso was just okay -- kind of bland, really oily, nothing special at all. I really liked my entree, a spicy seafood soup, but thought that the bf's entree, a grilled fish, was pretty bland, dry, and the grilled potatoes/veggies that came with it were all soggy from the sauce. Tres leches cake at the end was alright, nothing special. Basically, what Rick Bayless does well he does REALLY well. If everything was like the ceviche/seafood soup, this place would be amazing for sure...but some of the dishes are just not good and even more painful because you're paying a premium for food that is usually much more affordable. It does seem like people who ordered the margaritas seemed to enjoy their meals more...maybe his margaritas are like MSG in Chinese food and everything tastes better with it. Just order the right thing or drink a bunch of margaritas. I should probably just add that last line on all my reviews, seems like excellent advice if I do say so myself.
