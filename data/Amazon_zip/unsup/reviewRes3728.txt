So, whenever I grumpily drive crosstown to crisp, I have an internal conversation/argument with myself. It always goes the same and ends the same. It goes a little like this: Good me: yay! I love crisp, their buddah bowl are large, can come with brown rice and full of fresh veggies. They are healthy AND delicious. Insidious me: and what about them seoul sassy wings you love so much. Good me: oh, well...no! Those are the opposite of good for me. I would be undoing all the hours spent sweating at the gym and the point of dropping $15 on a "healthy" lunch. Insidious me: But you no longer live in lakeview, you are gonna drive all this way, illegally park in an alley, and are gonna bypass those impossibly perfectly sweet and savory, larger than practical wings? Good me: well...when you put it that way... Then I succumb and grab a 5 piece order of wings. Crisp can be pricey, but I accept it and I accept it enough to leave the south loop, brave lakeshore drive from Roosevelt to fullerton to enjoy it. They are that good. Do not be fooled, the wings are large. But also, don't kid yourself, you aren't going to want to share.
