Some of the best pizza by the slice ever. They have a great selection of pizza by the slide in both pan and Chicago-style. I've also had the spaghetti dinner here which is HUGE! Came with a salad, soup, roll and a large portion of spaghetti.  There is no atmosphere, it's a large room with drawings on the walls, and usually a baseball game on. But they have free parking, if the lot is full street parking usually isn't that difficult.  Get dessert here or go across the street to Baskin Robbins
