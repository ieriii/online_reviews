A friend I was visiting loves this place and I can see why. The reason for my three (which is really meant to be 3.5 - I wish there was a way to do this!) stars is because of some of the feelings I had about food, it goes without saying that choices and wine menu and the decor of the place made me a very happy person to start with and to end with as well.  we had: Crispy pork belly + apple mostarda - this was a good start though I felt a bit on the dry end , the apple mostarda made up for a little bit of the dryness Ligurian style baked focaccia + fresh soft cow cheese + honey comb - this was great , I would say too much bread, and not enough honey to lift the cheese flavor, otherwise well crafted and presented And seasonal farro salad with roasted squash, warm goat cheese, and greens. I would dare say this was my favorite tapa of the evening. - the flavors meshed well, the farro's texture was very pleasant and the whole dish just worked. Riccio di Mare e Granchio ... Linguine + sea urchin + crab - I was excited to see this dish on the menu, as I had something similar in the past. The pasta was a bit tough in my opinion, and you could not distinguish any sea urchin. But it felt homey and simple and did do the trick of filling us in the end of the meal.
