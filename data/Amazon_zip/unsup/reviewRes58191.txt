One of the best dining experiences ever. Definitely worth the price. I love to go to fine restaurants stateside and abroad. After reading the reviews, when I came to Chicago on a 3 day business trip, I decided to dine at Alinea. From the greeting at the door, to the fine service, to the spectacular meal, Alinea was an amazing trip for every sense and lots of fun - met every expectation. I was a solo diner and had a fantastic time. The staff was great and every dish was an adventure. Having read about the 20-25 courses, I decided to go with a Grand Cru champagne cocktail to start and forego the wine pairing. I never would have made it to the end had I opted for the wines. The portion sizes are perfect for each dish, and, by the end of the meal, I couldn't have eaten another serving. The quality of the ingredients along with the artistic, creative, and often amusing presentations were culinary high points. I'll never forget the Truffle Explosion. Every dish had a wow factor and the dessert was to die for. Can't wait to visit Chicago again..
