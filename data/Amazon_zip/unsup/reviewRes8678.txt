This fresh and airy Italian restaurant is a great lunch spot for friends, couples and families. The chatter is lively and the pizza, tasty. We ordered the tomato, basil, and buffalo mozzarella cheese pizza along with a salad and two drinks, which came out to less than $20.00 without tip. We frequented Spacca Napoli on a random Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of seating, but from personal experience I know that this restaurant can become very crowded in the evenings.
