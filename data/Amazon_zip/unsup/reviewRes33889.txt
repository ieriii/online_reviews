I am a huge fan of falafel, hummus, shwarma, etc but I hadn't gotten around to eating at Sultans Market until recently.  I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and the baked zatter bread which I had no idea what it was but it looked good. And it WAS good, a sourdough bread with tons or oregano. I would go back there just to order that. They are also really fast with getting your order ready and it was totally affordable for a quick lunch. The seating in there is a bit dark but I wanted to eat my food so bad I didn't have time to take it home.
