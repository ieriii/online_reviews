I am a huge Rick Bayless fan and XOCO did not disappoint. My bf and I stopped in here for lunch and had to wait in line for an hour - this appears to be typical and we were expecting that. We ordered apricot-mint iced tea, chipotle chicken torta, chorizo torta, guac and chips, and finished it off with some churros dipped in chocolate sauce (we had leftovers). Everything was very flavorful, fresh and delicious. Nothing was mind-blowingly good (for that I would suggest a dinner night at Frontera or Topelobampo) but being a causal breakfast/lunch spot I thought it was perfect. Anywhere I can go to get awesome food in sweats is on my good list :) I only wish the wait weren't so long, but I think it's worth it. I will be back to try some more delicious food.
