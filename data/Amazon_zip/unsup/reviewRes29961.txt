Probably my favorite Thai joint to date, in Chicago. Very nicely decorated on the inside, food was great and very cheap prices. BYOB with a liquor store right next door. Service was good also. I forget what I had but I remember it tasted great. Only negative was the appetizers. I had shrimp dumplings and the dumplings were as big as nickel. My entree was a very good size. I eat a lot and definitely didnt leave hungry from this place.
