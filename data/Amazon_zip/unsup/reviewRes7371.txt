Food is great. Some items are a bit overpriced, but I have never found the pricing to be an issue. The lobster ravioli is my absolute favorite, but I have enjoyed everything I have tried on the menu. The atmosphere is lovely both inside and out.  I have been here a few times for parties, and they are very accommodating. They will also do family-style for larger groups, and they do it very well.
