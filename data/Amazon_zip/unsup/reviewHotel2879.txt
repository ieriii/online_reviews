Went here to meet up with a friend.... The lobby is super nice...the rooms are no bones....which is fine because we werent sitting in the room. Its a great location....close to downtown, close to the lake, close to public trans, etc. They have all the standards. You know me, judging a hotel room based on if they have an exhaust fan....alas, they do not....
