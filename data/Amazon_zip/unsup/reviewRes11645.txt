This place is decent, but I feel the hype made me hope for better. I had the red velvet pancakes, which are fairly good, and insanely sweet for the first thing you eat in the day. My friend ordered an omelet, which just didn't make it to the top of my list. I came on a week day and still had to wait about half an hour, and there are just places I feel are more worth the wait.
