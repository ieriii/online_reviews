I came here with a group of Yelpers for Christmas dinner. The restaurant is much more spacious and considerably less unseemly and filthy than its former space around the corner. We had the duck tasting menu. The Pekling duck was amazing. The skin was perfectly crispy and much of the fat roasted off. The duck fried rice was also delish. The soup and lo mein duck were aveage to me though. So why only two stars? Well first there was a puddle in the bathroom. Secondly, I ran out of napkins and our waitress took forever to come back. Finally, one of the soup bowls had a slimy yellow stain on it. Three spoons were also dirty, one of which had grains of rice crusted on it. Seems like they have not changed much from there ways at the old location. Good food, but always make sure you get the fresh stuff and order to go.
