I was a little apprehensive about the long line when I stopped by last week, but it moved quickly. I got a few things to go -- tabouleh salad, baba ganoush, and a spinach pie. I work at a Mediterranean restaurant with amazing food, so I naturally compare any other places to the food I eat on an almost daily basis. The tabouleh was good, it could use some more tomatoes, though. The baba ganoush was excellent, a little chunkier and spicier than I'm used to, but good all the same. The spinach pie was more pie than spinach, not recommended. I don't like falafel, but if you do, read the other 150 reviews that rave about it. The guys behind the counter were smiling and joking with customers, that's always nice to see at a restaurant. Everything is reasonably priced. I'd definitely stop back in, but I'm not in a crazy rush.
