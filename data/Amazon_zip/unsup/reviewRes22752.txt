I am beginning to wonder about going back to places where I have experienced some of my favorite meals....you know when you have had that quintessential and forever memorable food experience....yet, there is always that little piece of hope that it can be replicated. It is the classic setup for disappointment.....yet, you keep going back, again and again -- sometimes there a glimpses into that past magic, but I am not sure they can ever be replicated. Each experience is unique, which makes those memorable experiences even more treasured. That all being said, I was in Chicago and jumped at the opportunity to go back to Lao Sze Chuan. Yes, it was very good -- but the food was a little bit different and didn't quite live up to my memory of the last meal there. Dan Dan noodles were excellent, but didn't make me weak in the knees. Salt & pepper scallops were good but fell just a bit short of expectations based on my last vist.... That all being said, next time I am in Chicago I would again jump at the chance to try and revisit that one amazing meal I had here last year.
