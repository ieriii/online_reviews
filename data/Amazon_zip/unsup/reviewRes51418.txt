I don't see what the attraction is here. Simply having huge burritos and a passable salsa are not the keys to mexican food heaven. Went Saturday night, I had the pozole and gf had shrimp fajitas. Pozole was thin, watery, no body, no flavor, no condiments (had to ask, no have radishes). Shrimp fajitas were bland, bland, bland. I should have tried the bistec ala mexicana first, which is a true barometer of mexican restaurant goodness. 2 stars
