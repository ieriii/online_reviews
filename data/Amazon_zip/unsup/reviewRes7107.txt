We had 7pm reservations last night January 2nd. The place was packed. We only waited 10 minutes which was great. Matt took care of us and was spot on throughout the whole 3hrs we were there. We were a party of 5 and slow to order and even ordered another appetizer after we finished eating the first round, no problem for Matt, he kept the drinks flowing and the funny comments timed perfectly. Two of us had not been to Sapori before and were pretty impressed. Even though the menu prices started at $20 each, the portion size was perfect for next day left overs and sharing of apps. Thanks Matt for listening to adjustments to our orders (no browned butter, add tomato sauce). Way to go!
