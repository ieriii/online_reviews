Tasty, fresh, cheap, quick. Always my go-to place for Thai in the Lincoln Square area. In fact, it's better than the more popular/overrated Spoon just down the street, and it's almost as good as Duck Walk on Belmont, which is my favorite Thai place on the North side, so YMMV. The only problem with Opart is that there's this one waiter (stocky guy, kind of looks like a Thai Charlie Brown) who's always completely unfriendly and even surly; he once grabbed a menu out of my friend's hand before the friend was even done ordering! Dude, fix whatever's wrong in your life and THEN come back to work as a waiter!
