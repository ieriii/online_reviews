I wish there were a way to select zero stars for this review. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch today (our 2nd time) and were pretty excited about it. Being lunch we didn't want to eat a lot so we asked how the salad bar worked. Our waitress explained it, including that if you order an appetizer it was 7.95 instead of 11.95. Great, were were already planning on ordering an appetizer and my boyfriend wanted something else so he ordered the salad bar. The food was ok, although he said the salad bar was nothing exciting (he had a side salad and some strawberry's that's it). When we got the bill I noticed we were charged full price for the salad bar. I questioned this with the waitress who tried to explain that it should be full price because I ordered the appetizer and he ordered the salad bar. Confused, I explained that the appetizer was for both of us to which she said "ok I guess I understand what you are saying" and said she would fix it. A few minutes later an incredibly rude man (I'm assuming the manager) walked over to the table to ask what the confusion was. I again asked why we were charged full price when the menu stated it should be reduced if you purchased an appetizer. After discussing this for over 10 min (and him being extremely rude) I'm still confused by his explanation. I think he said that each person had to order an appetizer and the salad in order to get the reduced price. I asked to see the menu to see where it said this so that I could understand, but the menu said nothing about this. All he kept saying was something about him giving away free food. I don't care about the $4 (even though I still think that even $8 for a crappy salad is ridiculous) it was about the principle of being told one thing and charged for another. Due to the rudeness of the manager, we will not be returning to RJ Grunts.
