This joint is old school and I dig it. Don't come here looking for some fancy shmancy presentations or a fashion show. They don't skimp on portions and are reasonably priced so it's a great family or large group spot. Kick butt pizza delivery, yummy crab legs and great calamari diablo. No surprises here, food is always consistent.
