I absolutely LOVED this place. My bf and I were looking for a cozy Monday night date place, and this place was definitely it. At the risk of causing a stampede, Monday nights are prix fixe nights - $20 a person for a 4-course meal. And man, do you get your money's worth, because each course includes more than one choice - 2 apps, 2 soup/salads, 3 entrees (supposedly "sample" size, but really, they are a meal in themselves), and 2 desserts. It is an amazing amount of food - and it's all delicious. The butternut squash was my personal favorite, but I enjoyed it all. It's cute and cozy, but not so small that you feel like you're sitting on top of your neighbors. The service was excellent as well. I can't wait to go back.
