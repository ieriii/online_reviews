Went here for brunch on the recommendation of a friend. Loved the atmosphere, the chips, and the guac. We had to wait quite a while for our server to show up and for our guac, but after that he was pretty on the ball. The food was so/so. I ordered some egg/steak thing in a corn tortilla smothered with cheese. It was mushy and didn't have much flavor (although the beans on the side rocked!). I can't remember what my boyfriend ordered, but it's his "hangover meal" in his hometown in Mexico, and he was not pleased. To him, "authentic" Mexican food is supposed to taste like it was "made at home," and this did not. Meh. Wouldn't go back.
