Sit down at any table in this popular Lincoln Square restaurant and they'll give you some very fresh, very good home made salsa with traditional corn chips. For you spicy food people they have a green version that packs some kick. Or at least that's what I'm told. I'm an absolute wimp. It's great and they are more than happy to refill your salsa, and or chips during your entire stay. I'm sold already and I haven't even ordered. Garcia's offers a host of traditional Mexican cuisine along with some non traditional for you "gringos". My particular favorite is their Burritos which are as large and lovely as they come. Skirt steak, chicken, and even veggie, these things come loaded and fresh. I can only finish their burritos when I'm hammered and, because Garcia's keeps late weekend hours I've finished many a burrito. And enjoyed them. Garcia's Burritos are what I believe the people behind the chain "Chipotle" had in mind. Outside of Burritos Garcia's offers many reasonably priced Mexican fare. You can easily eat and eat well for under $10. Con's: The restaurant is on the small side so depending on when you go you might have to wait. I've only had to do that once in my many times having gone there though. The bathrooms are on the gross side and they serve pop/soda drinks in stryofoam which is sort of tacky but on the other hand these styrofoam cups are enormous so you are actually making out volume wise. None of the food is gourmet quality. Over all Garcia's is great. It's a staple in the Lincoln Square scene. Everyone there is very friendly and service is very very quick.
