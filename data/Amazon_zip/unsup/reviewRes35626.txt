Although this probably puts me in (good) company with the baby boomers demographic, I will happily put Shaw's in my top-five favorites of Chicago.  I have dined on both sides of the restaurant, and each time I dined the atmosphere seemed fitting to the occasion. The first time we ate here was on a hot summer night prior to an evening spent imbibing at some of Chicago's watering holes. The oyster bar is much more casual and festive. We were there on a Thursday night without a reservation and were seated after about a 20 minute wait. The mood was incredibly festive with a jazz band playing and cocktails slinging. We sat at a cocktail table which I thought was fun, although might be tough for people who prefer chairs with backs. I got a surf and turf dish that included steak and scallops. I loved the food, the service was awesome... It almost felt like a communal experience as everyone looked like they were having a good time. My second visit was with family before attending a play. This time we ate in the dining room, which has more of a slacks and dinner jacket feel, but not stuffy.... I guess they make it work. Kind of how I would imagine a smoking lounge would be, without all of the smoke. The atmosphere is much quieter than the oyster bar, and the crowd is considerably older, with some families with children scattered throughout. The service is excellent. We were on a time crunch due to our show, so the waitress got our order in and food out quickly. I had bay scallops which can only be described as decadent. I have tried to replicate these scallops time and time again at home, but something is always missing (could it be a pound of butter?) After these two great yet different experiences we have returned several times for birthdays and nice dinners out... The experience has always been memorable. In such a great food city, we keep coming back.
