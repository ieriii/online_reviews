I've eaten at Meli about once a week for nearly two years. Not once have I been disappointed. The food is just top notch. The service is fast and efficient.  If you get there at around 11:30am on a week day you'll miss the rush and won't have to wait. The daily specials are always worth checking out. But you can't really go wrong - there's nothing on the menu I know of that you should stay away from. For a few months last year I just let the server pick something for me. But now I almost exclusively order off the specials menu.
