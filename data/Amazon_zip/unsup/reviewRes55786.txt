I was pleasantly awed! Calo Ristorante exceeded my expectations. I chose to celebrate my birthday here with an intimate group of friends and definitely recommend others to do the same. The service, food, and drinks, as well as the warm environment of the restaurant was so refreshing! Our waiter, Juan, handled a table of 30 and our table of 12 and was still so prompt with every thing. My pork chops were overcooked, it was bearable I just thought I'd let Juan know that it was a little dry. He brought the owner over to the table and he had the chef cook me knew ones to take home with me. A large piece of tirimisu, which, might i add was to die for, was brought to the table along with singing. The owner handed me a $25giftcard and apologized for the chops. One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time if ever at all.Totally positively refreshed....
