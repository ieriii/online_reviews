Just came for a late dinner after a longish day at the office. Pretty good beer selection and a great looking menu. Service was great. Ended up just sitting at the bar since I was alone on the road for work. Sometimes that can mean great drink service, but horrible meal service. Not the case here. Quick, great service all around. Romaine salad (ceasar) was a great. I went with the Amish chicken. It was well prepared and tasted great. I'll be back again.
