Prepare yourself for some amazingly tasty food. While the beef sandwiches are my favorites, I make a point of trying some of the other items on the menu. The pumpkin soup should not be missed. Not the typical pureed soup, Simply It has big beautiful chunks in a broth that is just not to be believed. You also have to try the beef short ribs, heavenly. The perfect balance of sweet,salty and tangy. There's salad and a mini spring roll on the side for the lunch specials, and you also get a drink (the lemonade is really, really good). You can also count on getting a healthy portion of fresh fruit for you to have for dessert, and most of the lunch specials are under $10.00!  The folks at Simply It are a very nice bunch of people who make wonderful food at a more than reasonable price.
