Awesome food. Enjoyed my daughter's chicken fingers almost as much as the massive Big Boy Buddha bowl with bulgogi, which was piled with vegetables and perfect with some Sriracha. I guess I agree with the folks who say that the fries are nothing special, but they were perfectly fine and everything else we had was delicious. Definitely will be back to try the fried chicken.
