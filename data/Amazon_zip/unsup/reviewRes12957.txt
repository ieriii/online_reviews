Yeay for Cafe 28...Again, you have proven to be my favorite place in the city!!!!! It was a little busy with all the Groupon users there but it was well worth the wait. I can never decide between the Red Sangria or the Mojitos, so I usually get one of each....delicious and fresh!! My boyfriend and I ordered the Grilled calamari....Yummmmmmm...., and the Goat Cheese...Heavenly. Of course we got the Famous Pork Chops....they should be entered into a contest!!! Im still working on trying to get the recipe! Overall, you can't go wrong here!! I wish I could give it 6 stars!!!!******
