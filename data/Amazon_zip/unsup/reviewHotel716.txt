GREAT location and awesome service. Close to the best shops and taxi cabs are plentiful. The bad: -rooms are a bit dated for the price I paid -I woke up in the early AM b/c the next room I was next to was partaking in adult activities. Then I proceeded to listen to the conversation after wards, and not because I'm nosy, but b/c THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN!
