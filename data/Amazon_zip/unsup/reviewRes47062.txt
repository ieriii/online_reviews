What is not to love about Uncommon Ground? Their menu is exquisitely delicious, and their wait staff is friendly and accommodating. Also, the ambiance and atmosphere is relaxed and casual. For someone like me who doesn't often make dining an experience, but rather a survival mode, Uncommon Ground brings out the dining connoisseur in me.
