Sister had her baby last March at the Northwestern Women's Hospital. What to do? As a good brother and new uncle, I go down the street with my brother-in-law (and new dad) and bring back Gino's pizza to the hospital room for everyone to enjoy. Welcome to the world, baby! I'm proud to say one of the first aromas baby smelled was Chicago deep dish pizza. He's got a good start. Man, I'm a great uncle.
