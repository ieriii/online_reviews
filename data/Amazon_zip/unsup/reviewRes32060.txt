Four suburban ladies looking cute and wanting to broaden our horizons ventured out to the big city for a night out! I saw Demera on Check Please and added it to my long list of "I'm totally goin to the city to try that place!" One particularly savvy friend named Hollybear picked up a Groupon for four to Demera shortly after. So we headed down to Demera with rezzies at 7pm and got there about 45 minutes early. We decided to go in early and have a drink before dinner. Pre drinks didn't happen. Although there were only one or two tables occupied , once we were seated we weren't approached by anyone for what seemed like about 15-20 minutes. We were chatty and chatching up so it wasn't really inconvenient but we were wondering what was going on. Hollybears Groupon was on her celly and her battery was yellow. Not in a hurry but we wanted to keep it timely! Finally when our server approached us we told her about our groupon and she very minimally described our choices. The choices were vast, only the description minimal. Our server seemed alittle less than thrilled to have us over for dinner but we made things easy for her. Since we knew nothing about ethiopain food we let her choose everything for us. Thanks to the Groupon we had appetizers, two bottles of wine, a family style messob and dessert! With in no time the place filled up to the max as we continued stuffing our faces with everything wonderful. With all the choices I think we tried much of the menu. The honey wine was good but very sweet. The sweetness would have been much easier to handle if it wasn't warm. My favorites were the spinach sambussa, the beets, THE BEETS! YUM! Grab some friends and check it out, especially with the Groupon it was a great price! The portions were huge, I think we were only able to finish half of our plate.
