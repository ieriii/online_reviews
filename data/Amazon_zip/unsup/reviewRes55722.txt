Sabatino's is the bomb when it comes to good italian food. Been there a number of times now and have never been disappointed. Do yourself a favor if you go, eat half the meal and bring the rest home so you have room for dessert! The Banana Foster is awesome! Go as a couple or with a group either way you're going to enjoy yourself!
