This place is a little pricey but you do get alot of food. I ordered the veggie entree. It comes with a salad, cheese fondue appetizer, then the veggies (with plenty to fill you, couldnt even finish it) then dessert, chocolate sauce, strawberries, and cake. It was like 19.95. My bf got the seafood and the meat (which was like $45.00 or something) but again, adequate portions with plenty of food. We sat in a corner on a raised section so it was actually romantic but if we would have sat somewhere else, I dont think my experience would have been as nice because the tables are really close together and there are people bustling around everywhere but we were away from that all so I really did have a great time there and I would recommend it. Pros: lots of food, romantic, plenty of wine to choose from Cons: no parking, tables close, smells of oil
