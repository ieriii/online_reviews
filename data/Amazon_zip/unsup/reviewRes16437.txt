I have wanted to visit the Violet Hour for a while now, but between the wait lines and the expensive drinks, we never made it. I was very pleased when my husband's company decided to host a party here. I'd be able to go, no waiting, and no paying for drinks! Waiters/waitresses brought around a sampling of their food (the chili hot dogs want to be like Skyline SO BAD but they just don't come close). We had a sampling of their signature drinks (the whiskey one was fantastic!). Since I imagine they were getting paid a pretty penny and we were there for the "party", they didn't enforce the cell phone rule (it IS a computer company, after all) and let guests in even if they weren't up to the dress code. The little booths and heavy curtains were very enchanting and I liked the innocent yet dark motif they had going on. However, after about an hour, we were all bored. I don't know, it just wasn't as inviting and the staff acted like they were doing you a favor instead of getting paid for serving. I'd go back, but only if someone else is paying.
