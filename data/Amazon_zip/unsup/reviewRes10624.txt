I really like this place. Great casual atmosphere for beers and pizza but it's also a good time at night. I've been here multiple times, lunch, afternoon beers, dinner, karaoke on Sat. nights. Good beer, good pizza. Service is alright (handful of good, handful of mediocre). Give it a try. Fav beers: Dysfunctionale, and Worryin' Ale
