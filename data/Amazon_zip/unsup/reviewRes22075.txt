You know you've arrived when you see the two freaky tall hot dog characters with glowing red eyes. This is a loaded hot dog that just has so much to it that it's hard to describe. If you want a Chicago hot dog, come to Superdawg and try one. Sesame seed bun, pickle slice, peppers, onions, etc. I'll stop before I crave another one. It's a drive-in but there was a group of us so we walked to the counter and ordered. There's a small room where you can munch on the food.
