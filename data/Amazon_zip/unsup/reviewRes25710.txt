After all the hype with the Blackstone Hotel and in speaking to people who worked at the hotel, I figured I would get some friends together and try it out. The views from this massive room were amazing! We had a spot in the back by the elevator, which was a great spot for people watching. There were six in our party and we went through multiple pitchers of the very tasty Sangrias. The menu had so many different selections that it was actually fun to make selections from. Our favorites included the Cheeses, Ham & Fig Salad, Spanish Omlet, Ham Croquettes, Spicy Potatoes, and items from the Grill. While this isnt your typical tapas place, you are in for a tasty adventure. Definitely a great place to take someone you want to impress. Its a great date setting, romantic atmosphere, not too loud and 5 star service.
