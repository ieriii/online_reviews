I have been coming to the 'Leaf since before they had food, and were just a Belgian beer hall and the back room was non-smoking. It does hold a special place in my heart; I developed a taste for 'fruity Belgian ale' while living in The Netherlands, as well as Leffe, and was thrilled to find it in Chicago back in the day. Hop Leaf is a steady winner in so many areas: great European beers and ales, $5 pints of Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA on tap, moules et frites, and the dreamy CB&J served with a side of stilton mac n' cheese. I have tried on several occasions to recreate the CB&J at home--I even stewed my figs!--but nothing has come close to Hopleaf's. The only downfall with the sweet and savory sandwich is that it discourages the drinking of the Leaf's amazing Mustard Ale. Speaking of mustard, the sausage plate rivals anything you would find at Hot Doug's. Back to my favorite beer, it compliment and heighten your experience with the Nueske ham sandwich and the brisket sandwich, so never fear. Mmm...the Nueske; there's a reason TOC voted it the best thing they ate in 2006!  Perhaps Hopleaf is trying to compete with Lula for the longest wait and snottiest hostesses. My boyfriend and I know that a great dinner at the 'Leaf can be had earlier in the evening on a Sunday, say, around 6:00 and no later than 7:00, with minimal stress and irritation. Don't bother with the salads, which, while doused in tasty vinegrettes, are chinzy. The bar upstairs serves a minimal selection of drinks and doesn't have anything on tap (this might have changed), but is kind of a fun place to sit. You might want to order your drinks downstairs and stroll upstairs to sit. If the wait for the dining room is forever and you need to have mussels, try to eat your meal at the bar; dining in the front room without actual waitresses can be stressful and annoying.
