This review is based on the take out service and food quaility.This is my first time at SImply It based on a recommendation.The customer service was exceptional friendly and warm.The packaging Excellent! They wrap all the boxes with plastic wrap (saran wrap) preventing any spills. Love it Love it Love it!There was plenty of food. For the price, you get an appetizer, soup, meal, dessert and a drink! Thats hard to come by these days.I ordered the Curry Mussels Lunch Combo. They placed in 5 mussels! I was only expecting 3 at most. I love my seafood! There was a small side of salad, 2 mini veggetable eggrolls and 1 side of rice. The soup was tofu and vegetables (no complains). I didn't even get to my dessert watermelon). I was too filled.I took 1 star off because the curry wasn't as strong. It was a bit diluted down.But 5 star for service!
