I like this place BUT i think you have to be with the right people to have a good time. You're certainly not going to mingle with other groups while you're here so bring your own fun. I had a really good experience while waiting for the rest of my group to arrive with the bartender explaining about the drinks. Also he made a favorite drink of mine, the Pink Lady, even though it's not on the menu and it looked just like the ones in the movie Topper, where I first heard of them. Sweet! Anyways, it's pretentious and if you're a guy and you like it, that's kinda weird, but it's the kind of place girls want to go to because it's chi chi and sophisticated and art-deco-y. And it's fun to get dressed up and go here. I love that it exists but I wouldn't go here time after time, just for those special nights.
