Yolkyolkyolkyolkyolk, say it, it's fun. In my "last days of summer" attempt to get out of my neighborhood a bit more, we rode our bikes down to Yolk for breakfast. They seated us in 10 minutes on a Saturday despite the fact that we weren't wearing what seemed to be the required "Walk for the Cure" t-shirts. I wasn't super-impressed with my crepes, but that's what I get for ordering crepes at a place that is "voted #1 breakfast in Chicago exclamation point ouiiiiiiiii". that said, service was quick, the fruit included more than just melon, and you can have pancakes instead of toast. Pancakes! They go great with crepes... no, I don't know what I was thinking either. We probably should have split one meal because we each finished half, but I always feel bad about doing that. The waitstaff did seem a little frazzled, but such is weekend brunch in Chicago. Pancakes!
