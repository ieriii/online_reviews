I've been to the Publican several times now, but only for brunch. I'm excited to go to dinner in the near future! I absolutely LOVE brunch here! The food is delicious. The red wine poached egg with prosciutto (which lots of people on Yelp love, I see) is amazing. I also love their breakfast sandwich and mussels. The last time I went with a friend, he didn't love the steak and eggs, but enjoyed everyone else's food. To top it off their drinks and coffee are great too. The bloody marys with corresponding beer chasers are a perfect start to the day. The wait staff is friendly and I love the open-air atmosphere with lots of light. Yay Publican!
