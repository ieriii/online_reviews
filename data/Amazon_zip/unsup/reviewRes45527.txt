One night after a not so great dinner at Adesso up the street, 3 of us were walking home through a blizzard and out of the snowy abyss this place appeared. We were cold and covered in snow, so we decided to stop in for a hot drink. The place wasn't crowded at all and the first thing we noticed was the fire place. We b-lined it to the seats over by the fire place only to be cut off by the hostess who offered to seat us in the "library." Sure, why not. Then we sat down and ordered 3 irish coffees....OMG they were to die for. Hands down the best irish coffee I have ever had. No baileys, just freshly brewed coffee, a little sugar in the raw, whiskey and shaken heavy cream on the top. It was a little taste of heaven on that blistery cold night.  I really can't review it much for anything else beside the irish coffees and the decor was amazing! This used to be a crappy old True Value and they turned it in to this dark hardwood heaven! It really is beautiful. I can't wait to go back again!
