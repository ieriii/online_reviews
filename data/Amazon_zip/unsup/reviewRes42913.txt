Love this place!!! I'm still making my rounds to various Chicago restaurants, but if I could, I'd go here at least once a month. I've been here 5 times within the last 8 - 9 months. Although their menu changes, several of the items I've tried have been delicious. Here are a few: Sweet balsamic roasted garlic/olive oil, Roasted bone marrow with red onion jam and course salt, Gunthrop farms roast chicken with oregano and roasted garlic, and the Roasted brussel sprouts. I'm big on flavor and these dishes definitely keep my taste buds happy!
