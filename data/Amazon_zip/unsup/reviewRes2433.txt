I just went there yesterday in the late afternoon at about 3:30 p.m.  There was no line and I was able to ask questions about the product till my heart's content. I had the lamb with goat cheese YUM! I just had the regular fries to go with it. Today I'm going for the duck fries and just getting a regular chicago style hot dog.
