Some Yelper reviewed this place while back ago that these guys deliver sushi so I bookmarked it! Just the other day I was thinking about sushi and not wanting to go out to eat (too cold outside). I have to say they came quicker than they said 1 hour time, they actually came within 45 minutes. Pretty good so far. For 2 people, spending $40 for sushi here feeds so much, you will definitely get some leftovers from here. I just like the plain rolls because I'm novice to eating sushi so I had an expert friend order for me. Ordered dragon something ?? and caterpillar sushi well as miso soup which I didn't have any.  I didn't like that they put too much cream cheese!!! c'mon sushi chefs, too much of something is no good. It was huge chunks, similar to feta cheese you see in Greek salads, you know what I'm talking about? I have never dined here but ordering sushi from here was okay. I wish I knew other sushi places that delivery close to where I live. I might want to try them when I'm craving some sushi.
