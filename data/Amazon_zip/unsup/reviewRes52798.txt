Had a leisurely late lunch by myself on the patio. I got three empanadas: goat cheese, veggie, and guava with goat cheese; with the avocado side dish and a passion tea.  The sauce they serve with the empanadas is delicious - I think it's mainly olive oil, cilantro, onions, and a bit of lime juice.  I treated the guava with goat cheese empanada as dessert. I very much enjoyed the avocado side dish, as it's simply a whole avocado sliced and drizzled with a bit of olive oil. I thought $4.50 for an avocado was a little steep, but it made such a perfect addition to my empanadas that I can't even complain. Where else do you even get the option of ordering an entire avocado? The service and ambiance can't be beat.
