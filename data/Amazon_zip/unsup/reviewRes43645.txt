I planned a birthday party for my man. He turned 35 and I wanted to adequately commemorate the occasion. I made a large reservation at Kinzie Chop House a few weeks back and counted down the days.  I wanted it to be a surprise so we were about 10 minutes late for our 8:00 p.m. reservation. My other guests had already arrived and were seated at the table. When we got there, we were told the table was not yet ready and encouraged to wait by the bar. I panicked a little because I didn't see anyone I knew, so I called a friend who quickly informed me that everyone had been seated. How cool is that? Kinzie tried to help out with the surprise! And let's just say my boyfriend was shocked. Although he was a little suspicious, he had no idea what I had been planning. Our waiter was tremendous. With a party of 8 people, he was courteous, friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and most of all patient. He expertly explained the specials and described each cut of steak available on the menu, complete with real uncooked examples. Nice touch. We got a little bit of everything. Several people ordered delmonico steaks, one ordered the tuna and a my man and I got the special with Kansas City cut steaks. As promised, the steaks were tender, juicy and delicious. We also had crab-stuffed shrimp with a lobster sauce on the side. Wonderful. To top it all off, we told the waiter that it was my man's birthday and in a few short minutes, he returned with a scrumptious, warm lava cake (with lit candle) and the words "Happy Birthday" written in raspberry sauce. Sweet! The table sang happy birthday to my baby and the rest of the back room joined in. It was really neat. All-in-all it was a superb experience. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. I love the soft ambiance and the look of the place and will definitely return for a more intimate dinner for two. Excellent work Kinzie Chop House. Thank you for a great birthday celebration.
