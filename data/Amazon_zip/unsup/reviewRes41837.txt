I was looking for a reason to only give Ruth's Chris of Chicago only 4 stars. I'm not sure why, maybe because I'm a bit tight fisted with the money. Well, I knew going in it was going to be a pricey meal and it was well worth it. I think the Cowboy Rib-eye was the best steak I've had in years. Cooked perfectly and tender beyond any expectation. So...5 stars.
