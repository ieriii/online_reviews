We recently went there for some apps and cocktails to njoy the nice weather. We order the 2 smallest and most expensive app ever.. nasty too... of course the beer and drinks are overpriced, why would they not right? please- rip off- I will say, i went there before and ordered a tuna melt, that was good.. service was OK. don't think i'd go back, it's prob better for meat lovers- not my game.. oh, and way $$$ for their food...
