This one-star rating is for one reason alone: the blatant lies regarding wait time. We called Sunday mid-morning. What is your wait time? The hostess at Meli's told us to expect around a 10 minute wait. Fantastic! So we walk the 2-3 or so blocks to Meli's, maybe a 5 minute walk, and ask to be placed on the wait list. The hostess handed me a buzzer and told me "it'll be around 45 minutes." WHAT?!  5 minutes ago, she had just told me that it was a 10 minute wait. So we went across the street and called Meli's again. The hostess again tells us a 10 minute wait, despite JUST putting our name down and telling us it would be 45 minutes. After waiting around an hour, we finally were seated.  Meli gets one star for telling us a bold-faced lie on the phone regarding wait time. This was the second time they did this. The first time I gave them the benefit of the doubt. To anyone reading this, know that the average wait time during a weekend morning will probably be anywhere from 45-60 minutes, regardless of what they tell you on the phone. Consider yourself warned!
