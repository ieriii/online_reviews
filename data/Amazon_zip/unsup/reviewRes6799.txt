We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly upon our arrival even though we were a few minutes late for our reservation. The restaurant did not appear busy in the front room, but within half an hour almost every seat in the front room, the back room, and the outside patio were occupied.  Our waitress and the staff was very friendly, courteous, and efficient. Our water glasses were never empty and they listened and complied to our requests without hesitation.  The food was excellent - this was our first time here and we came with a 4-course Groupon coupon. Each course came out smoothly one right after another. My wife and I shared one of the choice appetizers for that night and the asparagus salad, all refreshing and light. I had the lamb ossobuco (Vitello Ossobuco) and the meat was felt off the bone at the slightest touch. The accompanying sauce and lasagna were so good I sopped up the remaining sauce with the house bread. We shared the panna cotta and it tasted exactly like Nutella.  On a final note, I accidentally left my bag at the restaurant and didn't realize until the next day. I called early in the morning and they were able to return my call before they even opened the restaurant and confirmed they had found the bag. I had a friend pick up the bag on my behalf as I was flying home and they were extremely thorough and conscientious in verifying who the person was that was picking up my bag. Their honesty and support made my level of esteem in the staff at Sapori Trattoria go even higher. I will not hesitate to recommend anyone to this restaurant if they are in or plan on going to Chicago.
