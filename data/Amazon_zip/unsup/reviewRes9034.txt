I think that this place was comparable to Rezas and Andies. However, the cornish hen was out of this world and way better than anywhere else I'd eaten it. It was tender, super juicy, and marinated to make it bursting with flavor. My fiance got a steak and lamb kabob - both were tender and good - it tasted like it was marinated in some kind of tomato sauce? Not sure... The hummus was pretty good, but the hummus at Pita Inn is better. Hey, why don't they serve falafels?  Anyway, it was a great meal for 2 for $45 with lots of leftovers. My faves are still the rice and chicken and falafels they serve at Pita Inn - all for a price tag of $5-7!
