Good food, awful customer service. Both staff and management seem to have a chip on their shoulder and treat their customers like crap. It seems like anything you request is a hastle - we are YOUR guests, not the other way around. I don't care how "well known" your restaurant is - you don't get anywhere with awful customer service. Honestly, this place is lucky it gets two stars from me because of that.
