The Indie Signature Curry is worth the trip on its own- but this place isn't going to allow you to just come in the one time for the one dish. A little background- unlike other restaurants that hype about doing Asian fusion- this place holds true to two different Asian food-styles: Japanese and Thai. While it isn't exactly traditional in any way- they do keep the menus for both style separate- and therefore honoring the traditions of both well. Everything I have ever had here has been terrific. I always appreciate a creative maki and this place has them! From city-themed maki (Philadelphia is good, but I most like the Santa Fe), to their interesting music and cartoon-inspired maki (the Santana roll, Metallica roll, and my favorite- the Popeye roll), they do creative rolls well here. Appetizers are good too- with both the Japanese and Thai themes represented well in all parts of the meal. I sidetracked though- back to the Indie Signature from above. The absolute perfect blend of mussamun beef curry with a blend of different spices, cashew nuts, and my favorite- potatoes. The potatoes are what makes this dish so unbelievably delicious to me! Oh yeah- BYOB to boot. Dominick's is right up the street so if you didn't already pick up that bottle- stop there before you stop here. The place has expanded since the first few times I had gone- which is a good thing considering even now there are long lines to experience this place. Overall, just about my favorite place for either sushi or Thai- and definitely my favorite place to go when I am looking for a bit of both.
