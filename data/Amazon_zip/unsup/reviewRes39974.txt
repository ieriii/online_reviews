I've been here a handful of times, so my review is based on a few experiences. Service - 5 stars+ each time. I have been here with larger groups a few times and with 4 or less a few times as well, and every time they get it right with the service. Great bartenders, great servers, accommodating hosts. Friendly, fast and knowledgeable staff for sure. This includes a visit during the opening weeks - which can be a little nerve-racking for any establishment, so kudos on great hires and great training. Food - 5 stars if you go for dinner. 3.5 stars if you go for brunch. Admittedly, this past weekend was my first brunch experience. The reason for a 3.5 star rating is that by comparison, brunch food seems to be lacking in the amazing flavors we have come to know and love from L&E. Both my husband's meal and my own just didn't hold up the way we hoped the would. I will say that the booze-y brunch drinks were innovative and delicious though, and for the record, it's not that the food was bad, it's just that for the price, you're expecting a little more. In short, I will definitely be back and I'm very glad to this place in the neighborhood. Just hoping they get a little more heavy-handed with the spices for their brunch menu.
