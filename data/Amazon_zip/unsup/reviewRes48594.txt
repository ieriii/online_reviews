The Publican has been on our "to eat" list for quite some time and we were finally able to make it at the end of September. It is in my top 3 restuarants of Chicago, now and I would recommend it to anyone who lives here or comes to visit! I'll start off by saying the beer list was very impressive and I was glad to see they offered the Belgium Duvel ale, which was one of the first Belgium micros brought to the States. Our server was very knowledgable about the whole beer menu (and food menu, but that's later) and was able to suggest exactly what each of us were looking for! I had the Brasserie Dupont' Saison and the Hercule Stout. Both of which I highly recommend. If you are looking to expand your beer conquest, you will be thoroughly satisfied at this restaurant. The small dish-sharing style of restuarants is catching on quite quickly and this is of no exception. That being said, it's always kind of hard to guess how much to order and which dishes may be too similar to each other. We were a group of 4 to put it in perspective. Once again to our rescue, our server nailed the perfect amount of food and which dishes we shouldn't duplicate. We ordered a half of farm chicken, the potee, the veal loin, and the squash and romanesco veggie plates. The farm chicken was cooked to an amazing tenderness and the veal loin was very good as well. We also ordered the chef's selection of oysters and these were delicious. I'm a decent fan of oysters and these were the best I've had in a long time, especially for Chicago. We did get two desserts; the waffles and apple pie. If you were to pick just one, I'd go with the waffles. Not a typical dessert menu item, but done very well. I think the value and price are great. For 4 people to each have two drinks, be sufficiently full from a variety of oustanding dishes AND desserts, and have a high quality waitress for about $60 per person after tip is nearly unbelievable! Highly recommend!!!
