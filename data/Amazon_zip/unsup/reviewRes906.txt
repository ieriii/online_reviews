Ordered the foie gras and duck sausage dog. Was it as good as everyone says? In this world of hungry children and failing economies and corrupt governors, did this specialty dog warrant the $9 price tag, the commute, and the lines? Hm... I don't know... I don't think so. Firstly, I will say it's very very good. It was definitely duck flavored and good combination of flavors and I don't regret at all coming here and trying it once. However here were a few thoughts I couldn't help thinking: 1. Was this the best hotdog I ever had? Maybe but I can't say for sure because this is a unique specialty dog. So it didn't really fix my traditional hotdog crave nor did it fix my foie gras crave (I like mine grilled). 2. Was it worth $9 and perhaps a wait? It was definitely worth $7 and a short wait. And definitely $5 (I am dreaming obviously) and an hour wait (at that price I would order 2 for sure). 3. It's hard for me to give any place 5 stars that didn't blow my mind, or affordable enough for me to visit regularly. 4. Hm, smaller than I imagined... (that's what she said) Take friends and family? Sure. Try at least once? Totally. Regular spot? I don't think so. Still, very very very good.
