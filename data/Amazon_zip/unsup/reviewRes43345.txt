The atomosphere was really laid back, yet really put together. It was a little chilly outside otherwise we would have sat in their spacious outdoor seating. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my fiance ordered the grilled panini breakfast sandwich which both came with housemade potato chips-very delicious! The orange brioche french toast that was also offered for breakfast peaked my interest but I'll have to try it next time! I also looked over the sandwich menu and was impressed by what they had to offer. The service was good, efficient, and too the point, which I really appreciate. All-in-all, a very enjoyable experience! I can't wait to go back and try the sandwiches!
