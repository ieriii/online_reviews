Luckily, after all the buzz about Longman & Eagle, I went last night for a friend's birthday. The food was astounding...I almost couldn't believe what was happening in my mouth. I started with a 2 oz glass of Rittenhouse Rye and we tried the roasted beet salad with goat cheese, candied walnuts and bacon vinaigrette. The smoky bacon flavor and earthy beets were an extraordinary pairing, finished with a smooth, milky goat cheese. We also had the kobe meatballs with cheesy polenta. I don't know what happened but I think it made me black out for a minute.For my entree I had the kobe burger with cheddar and neuski bacon and beef fat fries. I have to say that my burger was a little overdone but given my ravenous appetite the thrill of the moment, I soldiered on. The bacon was mind-blowing, fries were phenomenal and there was an incredible dijon mustard on the side. My boyfriend had the veal breast with bacon braised pig brussel sprouts and I think I can safely say that it was the most delicious thing I have EVER put in my mouth. It was perfectly seared and tender as hell, cooked by gods. I can't even describe the flavors.Oh and our waiter was both handsome and charming, delightfully casual and playful but attentive. Go to Longman & Eagle, they have an astounding drink menu and even better food. If you're disappointed, there's probably something wrong with you.
