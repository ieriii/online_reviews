Run. Not for exercise. Get yourself there now to experience Big Jones's revamped menu. If you don't run, you'll regret missing out on two words: fried chicken. What, Kellie K?? Hasn't Big Jones always served fried chicken? Why, yes, but only once during the week. Lucky for us, the new menu gives us the opportunity to eat family style and knocks it right out of the park. At lunchtime, the Boarding House Lunch offers fried chicken, biscuits, sides, and dessert, all enough to induce an afternoon food coma and reduce any hope of productivity. Don't order an appetizer. While you can dine alone, this style of dining is best done with at least one other person and plenty of time (enjoy your food and company!). The chicken is tender, juicy, and the outside perfectly crunchy. The biscuits are light and flaky with tasty preserves for spreading. Mashed potatoes, gravy, voodoo greens, and beans and rice round out the meal and fill every every remaining crevice in your belly. I've heard the sweet tea is pretty darn good. If you don't have anywhere responsible to go for the afternoon, try a Sazerac or two. Similarly, a seasonal Family Meal is served up for dinnertime. I'll definitely be back to give that a whirl. I've been here a number of times and each time has gotten better and better. I won't even go into their homemade andouille, because that would be another two paragraphs of drool-worthy words. Fried chicken should be enough, shouldn't it? Grab your family, a pal or two, and an empty belly, and run. Laissez les bon temps roulez!
