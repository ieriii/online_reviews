It may be old hat, but this well-known establishment is a always a must-stop for me when I'm in Chicago. Excellent appetizers (be sure to try the fried zucchini), exemplary service, and pleasant decor/atmosphere are among G.I.'s features. But most important, ladies and gentlemen, they have Malva olive oil. On the Mount Olympus of olive oils, it is Zeus--in a light, delicate, fruity kind of way...so I don't know, maybe it's Aphrodite, the point is it's good. Imported directly by the restaurant, you can't get it anywhere else, so stock up if you're passing through--and grab an extra for me.
