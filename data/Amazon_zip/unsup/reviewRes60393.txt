While all of our former favorite sushi places are going downhill, the quality and freshness at Wakamono is consistent and strong. That's what we crave in our sushi -- predictably fresh and tasty. We used to be Bob San loyalists, but Wakamono has won us over...we only wish they delivered south of Division (pretty please, we are only a few blocks south)!
