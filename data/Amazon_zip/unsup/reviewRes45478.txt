I want to give it a a 5, but the only thing holding me back was the food. It was almost there. -Try to score a seat near the library, it's nice to sit away from the crowd, yet see everywhere. They have a bunch of old dusty books, and it's got the feel of an old library - Their bloody mary's rock. The mix is homemade, it's got a spicy punch to it as well. It's made really well. It's garnished with a stalk of celery, caper berries, and peppers. Great hang over cure, downside it's about $8, well worth it though -I got the burger, it's done alright, the fries rocked for some reason. As I was leaving the joint, whatever people were eating, looked awesome. The chicken stood out. Large portions.
