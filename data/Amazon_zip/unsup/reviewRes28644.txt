I went with a friend to this restaurant to try out their "restaurant week" menu. We went during lunch on a Saturday without reservations because they said they were full but that we could try to show up. When we got there it was a 45 mins wait to sit down or we could try the bar which was open seating. This is a horrible set up, I do not know why busy places even try to still use this cause it basically forces you to stalk other people for there table. So we had to wait the 45 mins , but then they actually expected us to wait IN the building. For 45 mins! They looked at us like we were crazy for wanting to walk around! So we get our food and the tortilla soup was very good, but it took them forever to clear the table after we were done eating and then forever for them to bring the second course. The special menu is set in stone! What the hell took so long? My friend got the pork tacos and I got the steak. When they brought the food she had literally 5 times as much food as me! I finished eating in five mins then I had to watch her eat for the next 30 minutes! And I am an incredibly slow eater because I talk so damn much! They just totally skimped me on my meat! I take meat very seriously and I got almost none! This was disappointing because I THINK it tasted very good but I hardly had enough to tell. They also took a really long time to clear to table here as well. We got dessert but I am not really a fan of dark chocolate so I can't comment about it but it looked fine. I didn't taste it. So basically this place is good but it was not really worth it to me for the price. This special promotion lunch still ran us about $30 a person and I was so hungry we had to go to the Chipotle down the street afterwards. I was much more satisfied with the $7 bucks I spent there than here.
