I won a dinner to his restaurant so I was very excited; not to mention I traveled from Seattle. We were seated and then brought a strange munchie of popcorn followed by duck pate shaped liked lolllipops on a stick and lightly dipped in "pop rocks, the candy." I thought it was a joke and tried not to laugh. Are you kidding me? Duck pulvarized liver dipped in pop rock candy? So, the experience went downhill from there. My Mom had some of the popcorn, but we had it taken away when she literally picked three long hairs out of her mouth, the food was insanely overpriced and indulgent and I wish we would have walked out after the liver/pop rocks joke. When we were standing at the door waiting for our cab another guest asked me if I was off to get a hamburger.
