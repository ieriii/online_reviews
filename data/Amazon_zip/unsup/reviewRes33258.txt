We tried the $25 3-course meal, which consists of soup/salad, entree, and dessert. We tried Veal Paprikash and Sausage-stuffed chicken thighs. Both were very flavorful. Beef soup was good. I did not care for the chocolate ganache. It smelled old like it was in the refridgerator for a while and the texture was gross. My boyfriend enjoyed his apple strudel though.
