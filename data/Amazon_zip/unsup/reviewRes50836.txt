Eggs New Orleans, Intelligentsia Coffee, Corpse Reviver cocktail, very attentive and friendly service. Best brunch I've had in some time, and also a plus that they stay open all day so a late brunch goer as myself can stop in right before 3 and not have to feel rushed because the place is closing. Will be back to try the Golden Graham Pancakes!
