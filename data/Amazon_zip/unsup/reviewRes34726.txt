i really liked this place! came here for NYE dinner with a group of friends. our eyes were hungrier than our mouths though and we ordered a TON of food!  some highlights: -the fish tacos (though i'm allergic, and i didn't eat them). everyone was saying how amazing they were. -asian pot roast was really good. it tastes exactly how it sounds, a pot roast with asian flavors. served with wasabi mashed potatoes and crunchy crap (good crap) on the side. -godzilla roll: freaking great. -the oyster shooters: holy large. i had to break it up into 3 bites bc the oyster was ridiculously giant. my mouth ain't that big. -buddah roll: everyone said it was the best veggie roll they've ever had. the service was great, too - we had 10 people and they handled it very well! the local art work on the wall was really cool, too. i'll definitely be back!
