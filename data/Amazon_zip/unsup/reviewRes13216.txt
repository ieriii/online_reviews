Where can you go for delicious fish with a laid back ambiance? This is the place for you! With a wall full of fish entrees (really - you walk in, the wall is like a chalkboard and filled with delicious fish options). My husband and I love coming here and always meet the best people! This experience was no different. Glenn's you must have a reservation (ok, strongly encouraged). To start, my husband had their clam chowder soup (yes, on a 95 degree day, he still wanted the best clam chowder!!!), I had the mussels - good but not great. I had their Red snapper, this was incredible and he had the artic char - spicy yet so flavorful!!! We brought a bottle of wine with us but guess they just got their liquor license. Still, feel free to BYOB. Tuesdays seem to be the day where you can get half off or a fixed price on Crab legs!!!! Parking is available on the street/meter....
