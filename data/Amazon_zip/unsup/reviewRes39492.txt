The banchan (side dishes) here is amazing (I think we counted 31 banchan dishes), and you definitely come here for the Korean BBQ. The restaurant itself is definitely designed to accommodate groups of 4+. I went with two other girl friends, and we ordered kalbi (marinated short ribs), bulgogi, and spicy pork galbi. We finished 98% of the food and the banchan ourselves. We left smelling like good ol' Korean BBQ. It isn't Korean food if it doesn't leave you smelling like it! Definitely delicious, the galbi is a little pricey, but I definitely recommend a) the bulgogi, b) going with a good group of friends, and c) going with at least one Korean person. The wait staff was attentive and friendly, and we had no problem parking on a Friday night around 630/7pm. It did get kind of crowded around 8/830. Also, I hear they are open til 4am WHICH IS AWESOME.
