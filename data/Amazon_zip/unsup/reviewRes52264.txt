Ok... so after listening to the hype of the deep dish... I couldn't wait for my first one! Not sooo impressed. But that's not Gino's East's problems. So here is my reasoning for their rating: Negative stars: 1. Hmmm...I didn't care for the ambiance. I may be alone on this one. But, of course this is subjective. 2. Ordered the Calamari - The Marinara sauce came out cold. Kind of ruined the whole dish. 3. Ordered the Cheeseburger pizza - The cheese wasn't completely melted so the cheese was oddly rubbery. Maybe it got cold too fast? But, they should figure out a way to keep this nice and melty! 4. Ordered the spinach artichoke dip - their combination of cheese overpowered the actual flavor of anything but Cheese. I think they need to offer more than just bread with this.  Maybe some Tortilla strips would do it well. Serving it with HUGE pieces of bread made most of us full too quickly before we could really enjoy the pizza. Positive Stars: 1. It's a fun place and the staff was inviting! Good place to bring people that are first timers for deep dish. 2. The crust was pretty good. 3. They have a system that works. The Gino's special pizza came out really good. 4. Good Beer.
