As a person who has no love of meat, I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to find a small woman jabbing a spoon into the center of a massive cow thigh bone to savor the marrow. The carnivores at the table were very pleased with the meats and veal brains, er aka sweetbreads. give it the 3 stars for "A OK" but I deduct 2 stars for 1. Unbelievably loud. We had to shout to converse and we were in a booth. This was a real turn off for me. 2. Lack of vegetarian options. When I say lack, I mean none. If you have a non meat lover, be sure they eat seafood at least. I thought the service was delightful and informative and the beer list is cool.
