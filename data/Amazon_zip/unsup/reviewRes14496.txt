Just had dinner here for the Tues night All-U-Can-Eat King Crab special. After being seated quickly by who I believe was Glenn himself, I was overwhelmed at all the different fish selections on the chalkboard menu. Some sounded so good that I almost decided to forgo the crab...but my Asian-ness won out and my mom and I ordered the crab. Our first batch came with 3 large crab legs, buttered ear of corn with parmesan, and some coleslaw. The crab tasted great, as did the corn. The coleslaw was forgettable. There was a slight vinegary twang that I didn;t enjoy at all. One taste and I pushed it to the side. KFC coleslaw is my master and I bow down to it. I'm at Glenn's on Tues to eat crab anyways, the other stuff is for suckers! The second, third, and fourth helping of crab was a definitely saltier but not so much that it wasn't still enjoyable. But it was a noticeable difference. My mom LOVES LOVES LOVES sweet corn and we weren't sure if they would give us more but our waitress Heather said it was no problem and brought out more as my mom asked for them. Service was perfect, no complaints whatsoever.  Overall, I'm looking forward to going back and tryig some of their other offerings, especially the Apple Jack Tilapia.
