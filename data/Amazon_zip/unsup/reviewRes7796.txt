Holy crap, the food is amazing. I thought Scoozi had my heart for my favorite Italian in the city until I came here. AMAZING! The lobster ravioli is so good I can't explain, and the appetizers are great too. I tried some of my date's lasagna and ended up stealing most of it off his plate. Make sure you get a reservation because this place is always busy. Has a very nice atmosphere inside, very Italian cafe. Highly recommend.
