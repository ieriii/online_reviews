Mercat is a terrific place. Wonderful fresh food, great tasting, nice place to bring friends. Consistently good at dinner. Once had a lunch that was not quite up to their great quality which was disappointing as I brought an out of town friend there (I shared this on my next lunch there. The staff was very concerned and made sure that this experience was not repeated.) One other negative is the music. We brought a group there to enjoy the food...which we did...but the music was pounding and way too loud...we could neither hear each other nor the waitress. We loved the cheeses, breads, scallops, mushrooms, etc...and the presentation which is very pretty. All in all, if the music problems are addressed this place will be perfect.
