Vegetarian friends: The Strange Famous, a house-made wild mushroom, seitan, chick pea and corn burger, topped with red onion & Sage marmalade, spinach, goat cheese, is one of the best veggie burgers I have had. Meat eating friends: If you find yourself at the Bad Apple and maybe you've had too many red meat meals in a row and just aren't feeling a beef patty, get the Strange Famous. This is not a joke. I finally took the plunge and tried it on Saturday. It was so satisfying and flavorful. Secret tip: Get the beef patty subbed out on ANY of their burgers with the veggie patty. I think my next meal here may just be a Strange Famous El Chupacabra. Yup. A veggie patty topped with braised goat chili, roasted garlic pure, goat's milk cheddar, and avocado. BTW, I actually really like their ketchup. What is everyone complaining about? Their house-made ketchup + spicy chipotle seasoning on the fries = Yanyao's jam!
