Piece was ever-so-tasty. We'd been talking about going there for quite a while, and I'm sorry it took so long. We had the white pizza with sausage and basil, and it rocked the house. My boyfriend declared it his new favorite pizza... I'll go as far as to say it certainly is the best thin crust I've had in the area. The beer was also very very good. The only negative was that it was soooo crowded, but I guess that's what happens on Saturday nights. yum!
