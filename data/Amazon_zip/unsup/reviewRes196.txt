Oh Alinea.... My Boyfriend Adored eating here, and it was an experience of course. I particularly loved the hot and cold potato soup.... And the presentation of the food which was gorgeous. But what ruined this what-should-have-been-immaculate meal for me was the attitude and proximity of the staff. From the get go a waiter who presented us with a wine list turned up his nose and nastily said, "No!" when I asked if they had any wine from South America. (I adore Chilean and to a degree Argentinean wine). The table next to us then inquired why they did not carry it, which set him off on a diatribe on how it is lesser wine, cheap, not well-developed, etc. Apparently not only is the customer not always-right, her taste in wine should be criticized openly to the whole room. Whereas some restaurants, not having the wine you like, will gladly offer to go pick it up for you, Alinea rather slapped us in the face. That already left a bad taste in my mouth, which was agitated all night by the fact the gaggle of awkward waiters stood maybe 5 feet from our table against a dresser continually eyeing us as we ate. There is a not-so-fine line between attentive and obnoxious service. The waiters at Tru know when you need your wine refilled or are ready for your next course - they don't hover near you giggling and telling hushed stories to each other like a couple of high schoolers. Maybe they should be sent over to Tru for a lesson in waiter and sommelier etiquette. Yes, I should have said something to the manager at the beginning of the night, or at least when I realized the situation would not improve. My boyfriend loved the interesting food and textures at Alinea. I hated the vibe I felt the entire time I was there. He wants to go back some day. We might. I hesitate. And am truly disappointed.
