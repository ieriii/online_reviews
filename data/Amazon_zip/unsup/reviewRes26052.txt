We had such a lovely evening here! Went for the restaurant week special, and it is such a value for money! For 32$, we got a small salad, cheese fondue appetizer (which was huge), main meat course (shrimp were excellent), and the chocolate fonude dessert which was by far the best. Also coffee with whipped cream! The ambience was lovely and cozy, staff was very attentive, and there was NO CHEESY/ OILY smell around, like in some other fondue places. Had a great time....!
