Fantastic falafel and lentil soup! I have to go out of my way to eat here everytime I'm back in town. AND there's usually some cuties behind the counter. This food is wicked cheap and afterwards, I usually feel so stuffed that I have to rush somewheres where I can lie down and digest. And they always have super neat looking little cookies and pies, which I haven't tried (I'm the kinda gal that likes to keep getting the same thing each time...) but I bet they are mighty tasty. Actually, this place is so fucking awesome, that people that I've met living in Texas have talked about eating at Sultan's and remembering how delish it was years after visiting. Cheap and quick and tasty are all good things in my book (unless you're McDonalds).
