Mastro's is your mainstream, Ruth Chris'-like steakhouse. They have everything you'd expect from a standard-upscale steakhouse. This includes your caesar salads (which was very good) and typical sides. We had the asparagus, double baked potato, and truffle gnocchi which were all very good. I did get a nice surprise, when you order a cocktail, they bring you the shaker filled with whatever is left over. This is nice because you essentially get 2 cocktails for the price of one! The one downfall, which is probably a big one, was that my steak was overcooked. Please note that they bring the steaks out on very hot plates. I don't know if they account for this, as it continues to cook the steak on your plate. While I ordered mine a medium minus (just a smidge under medium), I felt I got a medium well done steak.
