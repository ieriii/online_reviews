I've been wanting to go here for forever now, so while taking a stroll in Wicker Park one nice day, the hubs and I decided to go. He got the falafal sandwich and raved about it the whole time he was eating it & even planned on going back. I tasted his and it was quite yummie! I think I will order it when we return. I got the chicken shawerma dinner and MAN was that a lot of food! Had to pack up half of it to take it home & eat later on :) It was very tasty. Fast service, VERY good prices, Great tasting food! We will be back :)
