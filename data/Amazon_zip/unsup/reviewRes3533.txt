Who knew that the best fried chicken in Chicago would be can be found at a Korean joint? Well, it is. The boyfriend wanted to go out for some kick-butt chicken to celebrate his birthday, and he'd suggested this place. I was a bit leery, knowing that the neighborhood isn't the easiest to park in, but figured what the heck. I'm glad we went. So, last Sunday, we headed out to try something completely different.  Parking (metered street parking) wasn't as bad as I feared. When we walked in I was a bit surprised at how small the place was. I'd estimate there were about four large picnic-style tables and counter seating around the walls & front window. The place was pretty full, but we found seating without too much trouble. He got the funke chicken combo (a whole chicken, 2 sides and 2 sodas) and I got the Baby Budda bowl (brown rice ) with a side dish of Kim Chee (There's a choice of cabbage or radish style). The Plain Jane chicken was great. Just the right amount of spice and very crispy, yet tender. The onion rings and fried mushrooms were awesome and I really liked the spicy mayo dip that came with em. The BF was VERY satisfied with everything too. I was also impressed with the Kim Chee and the portions were very generous. That 'Baby' Buddha bowl was HUGE, excellently spiced and totally satisfied my semi-vegetarian soul. Even the fried egg on top was good. The best part is that when the BF mentioned it was his birthday, they gave him a coupon for a free chicken on his next visit! AWESOME!!! We are TOTALLY going back there.
