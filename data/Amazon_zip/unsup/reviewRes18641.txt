When a business has over 1000 reviews on Yelp, you really must ask yourself: why should I write a review? The answer in this case is churros. Churros, churros, churros, churros. While I could easily write a well-articulated review including elegant prose describing the earthy crust of the tortas accented with chile sauce and rich goat cheese or queso anejo, or the sweet sound of the simmering caldos over the din of the not-so-muted conversations during the very worthwhile wait, instead I will reminisce in brutal detail over the sweetness of the churros juxtaposed with the rich, dark, melted chocolate they're served alongside. As with either of the other Rick Bayless-run restaurants, his books and face are featured prominently, and the salt-and-pepper of his hair describe well the way his dishes are accented with artful choices of flavor. For under 20 dollars for a three-course experience and beverage at Xoco, the only downsides are waiting both to order and for the food to arrive at your small table and learning to properly pronounce the name of the restaurant. Those artful choices of flavor allow for a cross-section of experiences in the same meal that generally require a larger investment at a more haute establishment.  Skip the reservations at Frontera and Topolobampo and eat at Xoco!
