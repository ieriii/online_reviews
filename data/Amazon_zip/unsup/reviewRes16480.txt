I don't know what to say that hasn't been said already about Violet Hour. The name is pretty ubiquitous by now. I think what you pay for is exactly what you get in this case. I'm a ginny, so there are certain shades of paradise about the place. J&R. Swanky, suave and sultry. All things considered, I've never really felt the above and beyond of it. It is just as it is.
