Poetry slam is the best....in my opinion this is a perfect place to take a date. Even better if you can talk Marc Smith into making her (or him?) a judge (a "virgin virgin"!) I've got a lot of admiration for the people that get up there and compete and they come up with some amazing stuff. So every time you go it's a roughly similar format but with much different results. Get there an hour or so early to snag a good seat and get a head start on all those beers you're going to want to drink. They might have a full bar there...not sure because I've only ever had Guinness there. Yummy. I think it is something like a $5 cover on Sunday evenings? Also just a short walk to the red line L stop.
