Wow. Time to promote your friendly, competent bussers/runners and get rid of your godawful waitresses and hostess ASAP! I can honestly say I've never experienced worse service in Chicago or anywhere else. Our waitress forgot drinks, forgot half of a friend's meal (how exactly does one eat fajitas without tortillas, salsa, sour cream, beans etc.?), and then had a audacity to add a 20% gratuity to our meal. Doing so probably allowed her to pocket a few extra bucks- although I tip 20% as a rule, I think I would have done more like 15% for a woman who couldn't deign to spend longer than 20 seconds at a time with our table (and it was *not* that busy)- but she has definitely lost our business. Aside from the bad taste left in our mouths by the snooty server, the food was frankly overpriced and underwhelming. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. The nice ambiance fails to redeem this disaster.
