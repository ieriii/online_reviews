I'll start by saying that Thai food is my favorite quisine. Opart thai is a staple restaurant for us. We used to try different neighborhood thai restaurants and were always disappointed. This is by far one of, if not the best one that we've every tried.The wait staff is always friendly (many know us by name), service is quick and accurate.There are many spicy dishes, but they will adjust spice (heat) level to suit you. Have tried almost everything on menu over the years and have never been unhappy.Of course, who doesn't like a good BYOB? There is a liquor store right next door in case you forget or need more!  They can get very busy, but I've never been made to feel rushed to leave. We drive to Opart, but it seems that it would be easy to get to by using public transportation. El stop right there. I recommend Opart Thai highly. Give it a try I think you'll enjoy it.
