What else can I say about this great place that has not been said yet? All is fantastic here....everybody knows it...hence the always long wait. Note: I do not like sweet stuff for brunch/lunch. Tho I do love desserts, I am not a fan or French Toasts, Pancakes as main dish/entree'....however, the Chocolate Tower is Absolutely Mind Blowing. If there is a heaven, I am sure they serve the Bongo Room Chocolate Tower EVERY day.
