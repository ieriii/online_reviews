Double-rainbow, all the way, oh my, what does it mean? No I'm not having a rainbowgasm. And I won't over-exaggerate. I don't think there is such a word, but you have to give it to these guys, they are pretty good when it comes down to ambiance, choice of food and selected service. I say selected service because as you might have read in other reviews, you might get attitude. You have to right for bad attitude in front of a customer. You go down when you do that, You're the loser when you do that, your business loses, you lose, you could lose your job. Its just plain wrong. Anyway service from some of the waiters and bars is ok. I like everything pasta. I ordered some gnocci and oricchiette, we were quite a group and very nice braised pork belly, pork roast, and had some toasted coconut and mocha for dessert, all. very good. After doing dome research on foie gras, I didnt want to even think about ordering that stuff. it seems well cooked pork and beef is the only thing that sits well in my stomach.Very nice dim lit place , good music in the background, not too loud but still present and enjoyable, lots of kinds of drinks to go around, and lots of good food. Prices are high for me, but then again, this is high end stuff , its not your everyday cafeteria, so in that respect, its a good place to spend a night out with friends. Or to spend a night out with a date.
