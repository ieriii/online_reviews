Another good place for bunch. The items on their menu are really unique, especially the pancakes, which included things like red velvet and carrot cake. My friend ordered the white chocolate, caramel, and pretzel pancakes. Be forewarned that their pancakes are huge and are more like dessert than breakfast/brunch food. I settled on something more savory in the grilled chicken, goat cheese, and sun-dried tomato pesto omlette. Again, huge portions. The flavors were strong but complemented each other very well. I found the egg part of the omlette to be a bit rubber-like and so I resorted to eating only the filling and the accompanying hash browns.
