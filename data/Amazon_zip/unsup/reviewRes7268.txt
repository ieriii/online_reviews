EVERYTHING about this place is un-freaking-believable! Allow me to enlighten you: 1.) Set in an old mansion...not the typical grungy, sloppy BBQ joint (not that there is anything wrong with those.) 2.) Insanely huge portions (as mentioned earlier everything is unbelievable) but the baby back rib meat literally fell off the bone when I picked 'em up. 3.) Service was some of the best I have ever experience, anywhere. The GM and MOD were walking up to tables engaging in conversation and refilling water glasses. The entire team works together and has a passion for this establishment. (Chef Whippen must be proud!) 4.) Fries, mac & cheese, onion strings & HOT wings were outta this world flavorful. 5.) I have recommended q to at least 3 other people--all of whom went and had nothing but rave reviews as well. 6.) Go. Seriously. (But park the wheel barrow in front cuz you aren't walking anywhere once you're finished. The food coma WILL set in.)
