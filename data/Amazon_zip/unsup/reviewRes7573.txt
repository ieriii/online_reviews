We went to Sapori with friends over the weekend. They told us that it was their favorite italian restaurant. When my friend made the reservation, he let them know that one of the people dining with us was vegan. They said they had a few options, not on the menu, but the server would be able to make suggestions. When we arrived at 8pm on a Saturday night, the place was crowded, but we were seated right away. When the waiter came over he already knew that I was vegan and was able to suggest three different entrees. Oh my gosh! My pasta was awesome!!! Everyone else was equally pleased with their meal. I would go to this place again!
