Absolutely one of the best pizza places in town! Let's start with the restaurant itself. It has a clean, open feel to it. The tables are fairly close to each other, but not uncomfortably so. The wait time is usually very reasonable, even on weekends. The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable about the menu. I HIGHLY recommend you ask about the specials. They have never disappointed me. Listen to what your server has to say and trust their recommendations. They know the menu inside and out. The food! Oh, the food! Most recently, my girlfriend and I tried one of their specials. It was a buffalo mozzarella cheese ball, injected with another cheese (possibly ricotta?) and topped with butter. They served it with fresh, toasted bread. Absolutely amazing. My girlfriend got the grilled vegetables, which were also delicious. I'm not a veggie lover, and even I liked these. We elected to get a traditional pizza margherita. It was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. The dough was thin, but had a good substance to it, I didn't feel like I was eating off a cracker. It was slightly burnt on the bottom, but in a very good way. The wine selection appeared to be very good, though we didn't get any. Their beer selection is decent as well. On the way out, on Friday and Saturday nights, you'll be handed a free canoli. The BEST canoli I have ever had. I will be back many times to come!
