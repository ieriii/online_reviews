I took the #77 bus from my apartment to about 2 blocks away from Hot Doug's. During the bus ride it started down pouring so by the time I got to the restaurant I looked like a drowned rat. The decor is pretty cool. Kind of a 50's diner throwback with a modern twist. I'm pretty sure Doug actually took my order, he was super friendly and it seems he treats all his customers like he knows them - very inviting atmosphere. I ordered the The Paul Kelly with fries and a small drink. I was surprised that you were allowed to grab your own cup, and get free refills. I waited around five minutes and got my food (I went at 3pm). It was amazing. Who would have thought that a bratwurst and fries might be one of the best meals I've ever eaten. I also only spent around 6 bucks for the entire meal. Its insanely cheap and certifiably good.
