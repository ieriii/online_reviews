ethiopian culture must be seriously laid back; everytime i'm in an ethiopian restaurant it takes FOREVER to get the drinks, the food, the check... i appreciate not feeling rushed and all, but can we get this show on the road?! either way, they were understaffed, and the slow service definitely didn't impede my chowing DOWN on one big ass veggie platter. we shared the veggie messob for 2, but it was definitely enough food for 3. as in most ethiopian places, there were a lot of veggie options; great for my non-carnivorous friends. don't miss the ye-misir wot, i love me some lentils, and theirs had some nice spice. we tried a couple of ethiopian beers too. neat to try, but i probably wouldn't order them again. not really my style i suppose.
