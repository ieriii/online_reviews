I was so excited to see that Fox & Obel recently offered a $20 for $40 Groupon deal. I live on the far north side, but ever so often my bf and I make the trek out of Fox & Obel to replenish our olive oil and balsamic stash. While the produce section isn't to die for, it is the little things that shine at Fox & Obel for us. Per usual, we walked around like kids in a candy store, filling the cart with olives, ciabatta, chocolate, tea, beer. The selection for items like this make Fox & Obel an eating experience, rather than a grocery trip. I do wish that they carried more local vegan specialty items like nut cheeses, coconut ice cream, or even Upton's or Field Roast mock meats. I believe these products would sell well in a place like this. Nevertheless, I think Fox & Obel is part of what makes Chicago food culture great.
