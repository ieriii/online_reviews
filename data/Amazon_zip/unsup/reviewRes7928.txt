I had really high expectations for this place... My Italian friend recommended this place saying "they serve the real Italian pizza" However, I wasn't that impressed. Pizzas are yummy, but not extraordinary. My pizza crust was really burned so was the appetizer bread. The prices are high. The waiters call all the ingredients in their Italian names and confuse the hell out of you. I didn't get a refill on water the whole time. 4 stars overall.
