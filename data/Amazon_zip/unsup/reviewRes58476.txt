Definitely a must see after the television segments on the historic Superdawg drive-in: 1) Great superdawgs & homemade french fries (some of the best i've ever had)2) The pickled tomato along with the pickle is an interesting addition to the top but they were great3) Quite a large drive-in; able to accommodate at least 30 cars i'd guess4) Definitely a must for a great superdawg & superfries when in the Northern Chicago area!
