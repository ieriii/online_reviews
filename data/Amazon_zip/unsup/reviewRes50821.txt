A local took some friends and I to a Wishbone on a recent visit to Chicago, and I'm glad she did. I was impressed. The decor is pretty cool and kinda rustic, which I like. The food is "Southern cooking," but only in terms of what dishes are offered. For instance, their coffee is fair trade/organic. Being from the northernmost of the southern states, I know firsthand you don't get that in many actual southern eateries. Also, when I think Southern, I basically think of meat, potatoes, gravy, green beans, simple sides, etc. But at Wishbone, their menu goes well beyond that simple scope. They offer pretty standard dishes, but with nice twists to them. Take the corn cakes as an example. I am a big fan of cornmeal pancakes, so when I see them I usually order them. Most places I've had them down south just make them out of cornmeal and serve them with syrup, done deal. At Wishbone, they are made with cornmeal, but with actual corn and scallions in the mix. Instead of syrup, they are served with a roasted red pepper sauce. Delicious. I had them with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and two eggs, over medium. The mashers were sprinkled with chopped pecans. I love sweet potatoes, so I'm biased, but these were great. Dishes my friends tried included chicken sausage, black bean soup and crunchy french toast. Everyone loved their food. Our average bill was $10-11 including beverages. Very good, indeed. I see myself returning on future trips.
