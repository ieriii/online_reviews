This is the only thing better than my howling three wolf t-shirt. How could that be you ask? How could there be something better than three mystical wolves of pure masculinity howling at the moon? Hear me out. Fogo de Chao is all meat. It's the closest thing a man comes to beast. Everyone moves so quickly, you are constantly on the hunt for the meats that taste the best (bacon-wrapped filet mignon and garlic beef were the top of the list for me...) Things actually got so intense that at one point, I started fighting for a piece of meat with the table next to me. After that got well out of hand and we both realized, "Hey, it's all you can eat!", we relaxed and resorted to non-violent stares for the remainder of the evening. If only I had been wearing my wolf t-shirt at the time, things would have played out MUCH differently. He would have known what was up. You live and you learn I guess. Go here for copious amounts of meat. Wear a wolf t-shirt for copious amounts of women.
