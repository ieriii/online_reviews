First off, what's with three places on one street corner with the same name? We had to walk into two places before we found the right La Pasadita. Second, apart from what some of the reviews said, this is not the best Mexican fare in town. It's ok, but not great. The nachos were gross and the burrito was ok. I personally prefer Picante over by Damen/Division, which is definitely the best mexican food in Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park combined.
