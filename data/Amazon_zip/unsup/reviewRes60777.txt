The overall atmosphere was good. My boyfriend and I went for drinks and dessert. We had the smores dessert. Honestly, I was not too impressed. The drinks were ok, but for the price I don't think I would get them again. Let me just put it this way...we went for fries and a beer afterward for a quarter of the price and were much happier. For the price, I don't know if this place is all that great. I do, however, appreciate that they buy local, organic produce and meat.
