Soooo after reading the reviews i picked Cafe 28 for our father's day dinner thinking it had enough meat for my carnivore Mini-me and enough seafood for the non-meat eating J. Our reservation was at 5:30p so we were in before the mad rush started, the four of us seated outside, enjoying the weather. We ordered the calamari & the mariscos del mar as our starters and they were awesome! when it was time to order our entrees i ordered for the table and began with a question... (insert spanish accent here...) do you have batidos? and she was like "huh" what's that? so i explained it was like a shake...she said no. ok so i thought alright the waitress didn't know that in a Cuban/Mexican restaurant-no biggie but then i ordered a bistec a la cubana & the waitress looked at me like i was on crack- so i pointed to it on the menu and she replied "oh a bizz-tech aa lar que ban a" all i could do was hold it in as i saw my Mini-me already begin to smirk. we also ordered the chilean sea bass, the almond crusted tilapia, and some sweet potatoes and black beans & rice for little man (J's amazing 4yr-who definitely didn't hold back on enough things that made us laugh) everything was truly amazing except for some blandness on the beans- pero no one can make beans better than my abuela, so i'm definitely impartial. i will be going back... it would be nice though if they had cuban music playing while we ate.
