I resolve to eat more fish. Going to Glenn's Diner makes that type of resolution easy as...pike.* On New Year's eve day I hadn't yet decided what to do for dinner and by noon I thought about Glenn's, and was able to nab an early (6:00 pm) reservation. Glenn's is a casual place so they don't have any sort of silly overpriced prefixed NYE menu, just the standards, which in their case is a blackboard full of fish specials (in addition to diner fare.) I had the striped blue bass, which was a perfect, generous portion of meaty, flaky fish served with a butter/lemon/garlic sauce. Mmmmmmmmm. I had asked for the sauce to be served on the side, fearing the fish might be overdoused, but I ended up dipping my fish into it liberally because it tasted as good and pure as that combination should. Resolution number two: to be as good and pure as lemon butter. The accompanying roasted potatoes and vegetable of day (julienned zucchini and squash) were simple and light.  My date had the scallops with the same sides. I tried one sans sauce--he requested his on the side too, it looked hollendaisey and unecessary to me--but he enjoyed it and smothered his fish as liberally as I did with mine . In any case, my "naked" scallop melted into my mouth, sweet and soft and sexy. About midway through our meal I saw Glenn come out and scan the room. I caught his eye and he unobtrusively asked how everything was. He didn't actually say who he was but I recognized him from Diners Drive Ins and Dives (I'm a dork like that). I thought, there's a class act. Our waiter was enthusiastic and prompt. All in all, high quality food, zero pretension. *I didn't resolve not to make awful puns.
