My wife & I were FLOORED at how good the food was here! I ordered the "Wacky Wacky Wings" (yes, that's the name!), which consisted of a heaping dozen chicken wings, half that were baked in a special chili sauce, and the other half in a sweet glaze. I was in HEAVEN! My wife ordered the "Bad Boy", a rice bowl dish consisting of multitude of vegetables, a fried egg, and a side of chili sauce, all to be mixed into a scrumptious mishmash of flavor and spiciness! Crisp is highly recommended! Jae & Doug, I live way up in Portage Park, but the drive to Crisp will be well worth the trip! See you again soon!
