After my roommate and I set anchor at Parthenon Hostel, we jaunted next door to grab a bite and devise a plan for our first day in Chicago. Turns out, Artopolis was the nicest place we visited dring our entire stay in Greektown! My cousin's wife recommended Artopolis, insisting it was her favorite restaurant in the city, and I can see why. The cuisine was delicious (and easily the healthiest meal we had all week), the staff courteous, and the ambiance was both relaxing and invigorating. The space in Artopolis is almost a spectacle unto itself...large ceiling, wooden walkways, and an inviting bar to cozy up to (we skipped the drinks, but enjoyed the elderly Greek gentlemen who were soaking up their lunch adjacent to our table). The servers and bussers were friendly and prompt with their service, made us feel right at home. Onto the food. Our recommendation had claimed that the food was excellent but more affordable than some of the other sit-down Greek restaurants on the block. I am certainly inclined to agree. A relative stranger to Greek cuisine, I played it safe with a chicken and mozarella artopita and a Mediterranean salad. Both were delicious! My phillistine taste buds compared the artopita to "the world's fanciest hot pocket": tender, flaky crust and warm insides mingling on the peak of Mt. Olympus. The salad was excellent, as well: greens, tomatoes, cucumber slives and olives with generous dabs of oil and just enough feta on top. A very tasty way to start the day. My friend opted for a sandwich and pasta, which I was envying from across the table, even while I savored my own lunch...the pasta looked divine! Both of us were able to enjoy a wholly satisfying lunch for $10 each: definitely a bargain. We didn't take advantage of Artopolis' bakery, although after reading the reviews here--and remembering the lovely smells in the restaurant--I really wish we had. Sounds like we missed out by not doing so. Something to go back to next time!
