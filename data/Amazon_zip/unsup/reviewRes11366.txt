One star for the Cheap Trick affiliation. One star for good micro-brews. One star for mediocre pizza. Expensive for what it is, annoying patrons, and shitty service. Oh, and places with mono-syllabic names annoy me. If you choose to go here, try the IPA. I'm not a fan of IPA's, but their IPA is surprisingly good.
