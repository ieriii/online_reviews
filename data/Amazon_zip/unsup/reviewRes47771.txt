Warm it up, Kris...Im about to.... I have been to Zed451 twice now...once in the middle of the Summer for drinks and noshing on the best rooftop in the city (my opinion...I think it has a better feng shui than the Wit or others)...and once recently for late night drinks with a bunch of sassy United Flight Attendants looking for trouble. Both occasions were memorable and filled with shabby chic goodness. The mussels were unbelievable...I cant remember all the other dishes we had (veggie samosas was one)...but we had at least 4...and all were superb. The wine and drink list is extensive and served with distinction (Clementinis were first rate...with fresh squeeze clementine oranges)..and the atmosphere is hip...stylish...elegant...but not arrogant. Well done, Zed...I look forward to spending more time getting to know you and your considerable charms.
