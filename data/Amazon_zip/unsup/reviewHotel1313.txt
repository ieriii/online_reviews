I stayed at the Ritz on a business trip in Chicago. I must say that otherwise, this hotel is entirely out of my price range. The service was EXCELLENT and I loved my room... huge window... free wireless... comfy bed... large bathroom. It was all very elegant. My only complaint is that the general style of the hotel is a little too old school for my taste. Anyway, all in all, it was a lovely stay. OH! AND the secret service was outside of my room all night the first night I was there protecting someone quite important... I never did find out who...
