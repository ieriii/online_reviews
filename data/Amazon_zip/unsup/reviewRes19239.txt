Great, variable beer list. Bartenders who know the list, and know what you'll like. Good burgers (Do you really care if they're better than X's or not? They're very good, on an objective scale.), though some of them are a bit too trying-to-be-something-other-than-ground-cow for me. And they've got fried cheese curds. And beer.
