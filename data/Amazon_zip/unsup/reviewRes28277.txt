High class Mexican food is often difficult to pull off, but by using game meats and complex sauces Frontera Grill is worth the price for the experience. We showed up and was told that there was an hour and 30 min wait. Ok, we'll hang out at the bar. We enjoyed the guacamole and chips with a few beverages before we were paged for a table. The seating is really tight in this place. We ordered the following: jicama salad, pork tamal, and duck entree. Everything was very tasty! The beans that came with the duck entree were amazing. For dessert we enjoyed Mexican hot chocolate. The service was great, very prompt, and the server was very helpful in suggesting dishes to try. Rick should publish a book just on the dishes from his restaurants!
