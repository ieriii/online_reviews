I found this place during the summer of 2008. And up until this past Sunday, I would have given it 5 + stars. The service was very good for a packed, brunch restaurant, the food is delicious, and the daily specials are always amazingly different. However, I went to Meli's this past Sunday and was a little annoyed by the service. In the past the waitresses were wonderful and polite; but it seems that there was a new batch of waitresses just recently hired that don't quite meet my expectations. I went at 8:30 in the morning, so earlier enough that there were open tables. The service was slower than I was expecting, and the waitress never even came around to refill my coffee. Now, I'm the type of person that will drink four cups of coffee during a 45 minute breakfast, so this annoyed me. I'm hoping that this was just an off day for the Meli's crew...because I'll definitely be back for the food.
