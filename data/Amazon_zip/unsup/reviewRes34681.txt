The food is great, authentic, and very reasonably priced. If you stick to the menu options it is incredibly reasonable. For the best value, avoid the salad bar options and drink options as they add quite a bit. I'm a vegetarian and I love the falafel sandwich and the Zater Fatia (sp?) I've never had a problem with any of their food not tasting good...everything I have gotten from their Jerusalem Salad to Spinach Pies have been consistently fantastic over the last six years.
