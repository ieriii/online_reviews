Meat, meat, and more meat. Good food but I would definitely have to be feeling pretty iron deficient to want to eat here. The customer service is insanely attentive though, and extremely nice, and their signature drink with Brazilian rum and crushed up limes with sugar, is delicious. Tastes like a margarita!
