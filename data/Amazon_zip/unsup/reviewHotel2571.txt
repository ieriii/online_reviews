I want to like this place more than I actually do. From a style perspective, I love it. It's in a hip area and unlike New York, there's REAL meat packing going on here. What I don't like: No mojitos (come on!), changing reservation minimums (it's a bit sleazy to entice people to do bottle service telling them they can get bottles of wine and then changing your mind when someone willing to spend more cash shows up and you are told "Actually, it's $50 per person minimum"), how the crowd dies out so quickly, and $10 cover for guys after 11 P.M. even if you have multiple women with you. What I do like: Great location, attractive crowd, diversity of the crowd, very cool space (bonus points for the high ceiling), excellent decor, and a generally friendly vibe.  Why the rating? 4 stars because I don't see this as a place to get a night started and not end it. If I was a person who went to bed at 2 A.M., this place would get 3 stars for leaving me not fully satisfied.
