Simply It is simply a classic.  The owner (Tuon: sp?) is an amazing host and takes care of you, the atmosphere is simple and clean. I could sit in there all day. The food is incredible. Fresh, fresh, fresh. I have no idea where he gets his mango or fruit, but it's always delicious and the smoothies (with bubble tea) are amazing. The entrees generally (99 times out of a 100) are excellent and taste the way they should. I highly recommend the Simply It beef sandwich for lunch OR the Fuh (not sure about the sp?). The Fuh is out of this world, if I could live on that alone, I might. Go to Simply It before you regret not going.
