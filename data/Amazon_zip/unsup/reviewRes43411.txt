Laura R. is so right! The avocado sandwich is wonderful. The key avocado, avocado and more avocado! Also making this a great sandwich is the smoky gouda. It's a rarity that gouda is smoked enough to be punchy, this was and it added terrific flavor to the sandwich. In the summer months it's great to eat lunch here because of their spacious sidewalk seating. Of course this is true for most spots on Division. Not sure why other neighborhoods didn't adapt the WIDE sidewalks. This might be my biggest gripe about Chicago on the whole.
