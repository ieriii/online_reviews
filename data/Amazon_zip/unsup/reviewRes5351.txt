Warning this place gets very crowded! Luckily, my date and I were able to get a table ASAP! Poor guy he assumed there would be burgers with a name such as the Purple Pig..yep no! The food was pretty good...loved the chorizo stuffed fried olives! I would recommend ordering 2 small plates per a person, the waiter said 3 or 4 but that's just way too much! Their salami paninni was amazing as well. Pass on the pig ear. It tasted exactly like calamari just without the marinara. The service was okay, the food came out at different times instead of at once. Overall, nice place and good food.
