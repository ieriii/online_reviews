Stopped into Mercat the other night for a glass of wine before trivia at Grace O'Malleys. I'd been meaning to check it out for quite some time since the chef owns one of my favorite restaurants in Philly (Amada - check it out next time you're breezing through the city of brotherly love). Anyway, we went in and secured the last 2 seats at the bar of the downstairs lounge. At first I was a little skeptical because the bartender had one of her friends sitting at the bar so I was worried we wouldn't see much of her, but she was actually extremely knowledgeable about wine, the chef, the food and so on. What do you get for a $15 glass of wine? Well, you get a huge pour, and an extremely knowledgeable bartender who will pour you ample samples until you find one you like. (hmm maybe I should open some sort of business called Ample Samples because that's sort of a great name, but bah! i've gotten off subject yet again!) I told her that I have been on a long and arduous hunt for the Smokiest red wine I could find, and she let me try their reds until I found one I liked, which was great!! Then she brought out some complimentary bar snacks, some sort of foccacia with tomato puree on top? It was delightful. Who doesn't love some complimentary bar snacks? We ordered the chefs selection of cheeses, which came with these wonderful jams. So fresh and dynamic tasting. It was great! I'd love to go back for dinner sometime.
