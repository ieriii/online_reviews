We came here because it was BYOB. It was a really great night. We had made reservations, and since we had to wait a few minutes when we got there, they brought out these tiny little egg rolls and water and pulled up chairs for us. By "they" I mean this pudgy older man that was incredibly sweet and running around working very hard to make sure we are happy. It was both cute and embarassing, but you can't knock a person for trying. The place was pretty small and for some reason the clientele was a little on the older side. In general, I think Vietnamese food has a lot of the flavors of Thai, but in different combination. So, if you enjoy lime, cilantro, jalepeno and tropical flavors, I def recommend checking out this cuisine. Our server was a little on quiet side, but I saw other ones that had no problem recommending things and explaining Vietnamese cuisine. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff and were only able to get through half of it, but it was all really delicious. We had some sticky rice wrapped in a banana leaf stuffed with chicken and other stuff. It tasted like an Asian version of chicken pot pie. We also tried these lemongrass beef do-it-yourself spring rolls, which were a lot of fun to make and really delicious. We then tried to have some of the fisherman's soup that we ordered. It was delicious but we were quickly realizing that "appetizers" here were pretty huge. Then, finally, we had some of Simply It's Beef Special, which were really well seasoned filet mignon bits over veggies. It was really delicious with the wine we brought (although a little fatty for filet). I really love food adventures, and I'd love to go back and try more of their very large, very interesting menu. Next time, I'm ordering waaaay less though. Its really an incredible value especially for the neighborhood.
