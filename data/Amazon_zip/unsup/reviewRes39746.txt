Was just here tonight and had an absolutely perfect experience. We arrived with it packed and every table full, but we were seated within five minutes. The staff was ultra attentive and polite. Our order was complicated and long winded, with many alterations and additions, but the waitress was patient and caught everything. Nothing was forgotten. The food was served almost immediately, hot (except for the food we cooked ourselves), and plentiful, and excellent. We were given plenty of time to eat, and the prices were reasonable. Totally great time.
