I love this place for Greek Food! I cant spell it but their pastechio is AWESOME!! And the bread is great--I am a big sesame fan!! Again, being a diabetic, and a BIG Diet coke drinker, I was disapointed that they serve these little bottles and not a good fountain drink!! Dont get me wrong, not many companies offer BOTH Diet coke and PEPSI! Which almost makes up for it!!?? BUT GREEK ISLANDS ISNT THE MARKUP ON SODA ALREADY HUGE!!!!???? Come on now!
