Went last night with my boyfriend. Atmosphere was incredibly romantic, with the tables in little nooks and corners. The food was delicious and it was fun to have a hands-on dining experience. I could not stop eating the chocolate fondue dessert. Wanted to ask for a spoon, but thought that was going too far. Service is incredibly friendly too!
