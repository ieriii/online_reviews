Heard alot of good things about this week old spot Really looked forward to trying it out. I first had the wheat beer which was quite good then moved on to the pale ale also good. Josh's beer is pretty spot on. Food wise Had to start with the bacon popcorn Sounds good and it was. After that we moved on to the sausage platter which was ok . The pizza arugula was sparse on the arugula and the crust was soggy didn't work Also the pot roast was bland and lacked flavor Dessert we tried the almond cherry concoction which was really good. This is a huge spaced that is very busy we waited 1 hour on a Thursday night But if this place is gunna stay they really need to work on the food to keep it busy 6 months from now
