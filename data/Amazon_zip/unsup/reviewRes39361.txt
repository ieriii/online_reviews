I eat here so regularly that I no longer have to order unless I bring friends and confuse the server to as what the rest of the gang wants. We always have tons of food and more panchan than we can count, contrary to many reviews. Go beyond the usual kalbi, bulgogi and mandoo, and try the baby octopus or chigae. Also, they have an awesome beef and vegetable soup that's nice and peppery, so perfect for a cold winter's night. If you're going with a large group, try ordering the family meal and hotpot.  In respect to other reviewers, yes, ordering and communicating with their wait staff can be difficult if you're not Korean or with a Korean-speaking diner. Yes, they can seem rude, but really, it isn't exactly a service oriented establishment. Go with your friends and if you need something, ask. And don't even try to park in that lot. It's impossible to maneuver through. Try one of the side streets and you'll usually be OK.
