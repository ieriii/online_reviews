I absolutely loved the charm of this place. The tones of the dining room, white wainscotting up to the 2nd floor, and a large scale picture box really warmed up the atmosphere. Attentive service, some good beer choices, filling sides like cornbread, macaroni & cheese, and some delicious mashed potatoes. Pulled pork = goodness And everything is very appropriately priced.  Would come again just to bask in the southern Q atmosphere.
