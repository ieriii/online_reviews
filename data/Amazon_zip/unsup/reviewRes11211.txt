Well it seems like everyone and their mother has reviewed this place, and they should- this place is great. The hosts/hostesses could loose the attitude though, everytime I go there it seems like I am inconviencing them by asking for a table. The pizza is great and the beer selection will make you want to try all of them by night's end! Great place for groups and to watch sports as well.
