I am not a deep dish pizza kinda girl. I love the thin crust. However this place is THE BEST for deep dish pizza. The line will be incredibly long to get a table, but go to the bar and grab a beer while you wait. Service is friendly and helpful. The toasted ravioli is handmade. Crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. Mmmm..... The pizza crust is my favorite part. It has a cornbread feel to it. The pizza is also not too greasy, which I was afraid of. http://memphisfoodie.wor
