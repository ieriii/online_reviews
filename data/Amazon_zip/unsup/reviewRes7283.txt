I've been here a couple times including a visit on Valentine's Day a few years back. The food is solid and the lobster and butternut squash ravioli dishes are their strong points. The outdoor seating in the summer is also great. It very well may be the best Italian spot in Lakeview. Unfortunately, it's not the best pasta in Chicago - though priced comparably. I would suggest visiting ONLY with a coupon. How do you get a coupon? Well, I no longer live in Chicago but I used to live down the street in Boystown. Fortunately, my landlord has not changed my old buzzer from ringing my cell. So I continue to receive lovely buzz calls all night long. Please give me a call -I'll buzz you in! Oh and go rummage in my neighbor's mail for a discarded coupon (believe me they deserve it!)
