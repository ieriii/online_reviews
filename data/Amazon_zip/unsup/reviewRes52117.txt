I had my first deep dish pizza here. We had ordered pepperoni & it took a while for us to get our pizza, like almost an hour. I guess it takes a long time to cook it. I didn't really like the pizza, it had too much sauce & bread for my taste. My son & his dad liked it though. The best thing about this place is that you can write all over the walls. My son, who was 3 at the time, loved being able to write on the walls. In fact, it kept him occupied while we were waiting for our food. It was a good experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again
