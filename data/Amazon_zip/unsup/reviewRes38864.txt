I used to live in Girltown and have been coming here since 1992. Now that I don't live in Chicago anymore, I only get here once or maybe twice a year. The beer selection is now, and has always been phenomenal. The prices are fair. The french fries are excellent barfood but I've been too scared of the lines to try going to the back to eat. This place has been super-crowded for at least a decade. The reason is because this bar is authentically different, not trying to be different. The Achiles heel of this place is service, which only has room for improvement (thus the 3 stars instead of 4 or 5). Back in the day the bartenders were serious, not rude, just serious. I'm not just saying that the African-American male bartender is super rude and curt, but he's so unfriendly that he makes Nick the bartender from Pottersville in It's A Wonderful Life look like Isaac from the Love Boat. But I'm a guy who likes to look at the glass as half full: bad bartenders save me money on tips and thin out the crowd.
