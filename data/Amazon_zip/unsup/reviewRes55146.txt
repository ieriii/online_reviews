Food was 4+ quality, but our service made this 5-stars. My wife bounced around a couple things she wanted and our server suggested one--which she took--and loved. The wine selection was awesome, so we trusted him to bring us the perfect wine to compliment out food...and he NAILED it (he did this again later with a dessert wine). When asked why we picked Wildfire, we mentioned it was our anniversary dinner...to which he promptly brought us a mouth-watering brownie a la mode (on the house) BEFORE he brought around the dessert tray, which of course you can't pass on. He stopped at our table enough if we needed something, but mainly left us alone to talk and enjoy our evening. Amazing, amazing place.We spent $200, but had a drink, three glasses of wine, a bottle of wine (which we took most of it home), an appetizer, main meal, and shared a dessert. It's easy to spend $150 if you're willing to splurge, but can also feed two for under $100 and be very happy.
