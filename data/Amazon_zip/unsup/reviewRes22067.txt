KITSCHY FUN! Hit Superdawg for a yummy cheap meal and a one of a kind experience. The building itself is so fun. Those famous He and She hot dog figures stand atop the white, black and blue diamond pattern building. The hotdogs are served Chicago style on a poppy seed bun. The dog rests on a bed of wavy fries. The shakes are to die for as well. This place is sort of in the ass end of nowhere, but worth a trip out. After you get your dogs you can swing by that Leaning Tower of Pisa replica and make an afternoon out of kitschy fun.
