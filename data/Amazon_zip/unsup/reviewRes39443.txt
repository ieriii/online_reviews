Best tables in Chicago! Oh my does this place have great tables! Went here with a group for a friend's birthday and we all sat around these huge wooden tables that were about 3 inches thick! The grilled meats were delicious, but I loved the platter of bizarre foods that were brought out with the meal. I give the nod to the tiny, crunchy, translucent fishes! Soju was pretty solid as well. Well done San Soo Gab San
