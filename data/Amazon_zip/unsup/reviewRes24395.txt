I always loved Iron Chef Jose Garces for being so humble and talented in what he does. I was really excited to be visiting in Chicago and was about to dine at his restaurant. Guess what? I love this guy even more. The food was amazing. Thank you Iron Chef Jose Garces for a wonderful meal. My girlfriends and I enjoyed the evening with drinks.
