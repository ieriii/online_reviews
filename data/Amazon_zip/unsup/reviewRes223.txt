I finally got the chance to eat here on a Friday night during my first visit to Chi-Town. I've been wanting to eat here since I had satisfied my craving for the French Laundry a couple years ago. I was in town for a convention and totally had to make plans to come here. Originally I had signed up for the 12-course Tasting menu but my buddy who was also a foodie and I changed our minds to the 24-course Tour menu as we were waiting for our table in the lobby area. We asked if this was possible and the great Chef Achatz told our server that it wouldn't be a problem. Suffice it to say it was definitely a new and enlightening experience. I had never eaten at a progressive American/avant garde/molecular gastronomy restaurant before. This has definitely opened my eyes about what food is and can be. Every course was a mixture to tease all the senses. The presentations were beautiful and playful. The servers were knowledgeable and clear with their instructions on how to go about eating every work of art. The 24-courses came through pretty smoothly and quick, probably because we were on course to be the last ppl there that night. Our time there came at just under 4 hours so that was much appreciated. We also got Chef Achatz to sign our menus. As we were waiting for one of the staff to flag down a cab outside, I noticed the curtain to the entrance of the first level dining room slightly closed. So I peeked into the dining room and surprisingly saw Chef Achatz sitting with his back towards me at one of the tables with his laptop. Culinary revolutionist, cancer conqueror, and computer savvy as well. What can he not do?
