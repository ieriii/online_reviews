3 stars for the food... 5 stars for great prices and being outside on a summer night 2 stars for service A fun place to come with your friends and a few bottles of wine...bring enough to last the 2 hour wait though if it is a beautiful warm night out! (No idea what they do in the cold months considering the inside is tiny and kind of cheap cafeteria looking) By the time we sat down we were super hungry and our server was less than enthusiastic to say the least. Not horrible but kind of a surprise that employers actually allow service to be that spotty. The hostess was even worse. She kind of snapped at us when she overheard us complaining a teeny bit about their lack of care for the birthday situation(two of us were celebrating our birthday on that very day). Oh well- not a huge deal- I guess that's the kind of place it is. Other than that, the guacomole was awesome, tostones and sweet plantains were great, and the ceviche amazing too. The empanadas though were pretty meh-mostly just deep fried shell and kind of bland and the flan we had for desert had probably seen better days. So it was in all a bittersweet experience.  Some tastes were great, a few dissapointing. I would try again- and just stick to the basics and come early.
