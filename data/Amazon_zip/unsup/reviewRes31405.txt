Went to Sunda for a company party and really loved the upstairs party room, for those of you that are looking for one for some sort of corporate event....as for the food: BEEF LOLLIPOPS!? Love them. If there is one thing I can say I love, it's meat on sticks, but meat on lollipos!? Get out of town.They were absolutely delicious. Also had the shrimp tempura which was very good as well. I definitely want to revisit to try this place out again.
