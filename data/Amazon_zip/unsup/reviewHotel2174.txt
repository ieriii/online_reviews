The hotel has an amazing location, right on the Magnificent Mile and within walking distance to lots of shopping, restaurants, bars, and entertainment. However, I was expecting something a little more. Our room wasn't ready when my colleague showed up at 9pm. They did give us coupons for drinks at the bar and for breakfast but really? The room wasn't ready at 9pm? The remote control didn't work, one of the bedside lights didn't work and there wasn't a lot of lighting to begin with. I suspect that the rooms in the older hotel tower are much larger and nicer.   The hotel bar was great for drinks and for people-watching. If you do have breakfast at Zest, order off the menu and avoid the $27 breakfast buffet, it's not worth it. Other than that, the hotel is stunning to look at and it has about the fastest elevator that I have ever been in. However, I think if I am ever in Chicago again I will try staying somewhere else.
