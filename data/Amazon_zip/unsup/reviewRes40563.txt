We had a delightfully weird meal at Tank. At first we were a little overwhelmed by the enormous menu, but then i realized that about half of it was synonyms for "soup," and I felt better. We ended up getting the #43 pho and the #68 rice noodles. They were both basically rice noodles in broth with lots of goodies. my bf mainly ate the pho, as I'm not a huge fan of whatever spice they use in it (star anise, maybe?), but it was still delicious. so rich! My soup was AMAZING. I have a small obsession with fish balls, and refuse to share them. The shrimp were super fresh, tons of noodles, and lots of basil to make it all taste that much better. YUM. Being the dessert hounds that we are, we pulled a "we want what they're having!" and pointed to the people at the table next to us. It turned out they were having the #252, which was triple color topped with coconut milk. It was... not for us. I don't mind the sweet bean paste in moderation (in sweet buns-- yum!), but cold and slurped through a straw, it was just too beany. Point is, some parts of it were really delicious, but only if you really like beans. We will def be back, though, because the broth alone is worth it for a return trip. SOUP!
