This is the best pizza I have EVER eaten hands down! We most definetly need a Giordano's here in Cali! On a week long trip to Chi-town I regret to inform you that I ate this 5.5 DIFFERENT times They even delivered to my Hotel (Park Hyatt on Michigan ave) It's really that good! I'm actually surprised that people would give this establishment anything less than 5 stars! maybe since they live in the area they are used to this Goodness. I absolutely loved it and this proved that Chicagoans really know how to make PIZZA! I will return soon to savor once again....until next time
