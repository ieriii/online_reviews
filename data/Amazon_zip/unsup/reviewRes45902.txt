First, we were wandering around looking for a cafe, and places were just too busy, and it was misting. Despite being told "don't do it", I settled for the Grand Lux Cafe". This is Nevada style mass eating without the buffet. Although caveronous, it was clean, but it seemed to cater to the masses and specifically the ones you don't wish to have a meal. First, there is a wait, and they give you that little vibrating, "your up" devices that tell you that this event is going to be machine like. We, of course, get seated next to the birthday group, which thankfully had no small children, and even more thankfully, had not "El Torrito" type waiter/waitress birthday song rendition. Food: how long does it take for black coffee? Forgiven, because they acknowledge the wait. Meal order was accidentally given to the couple next to us, and I kept wondering, did they replace it or take it back to the kitchen and present to us. (paranoia, I know!) The food was better than I was expecting and hot, so although it was factory like, the kitchen was an above average factory. Go back. No. Would I recommend? Sure. If you want a reasonably priced deep fried meal, sure. My expectations were low, and it did not disappoint. It was a solid three stars.
