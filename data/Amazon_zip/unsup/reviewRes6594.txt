Soooo good. And so affordable! Highlights: Ricotta & Honey Comb Roasted Squash Salad Rigatoni with Sausage For three people we ordered/shared 2 glasses of wine, 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts and it was under $70. Considering the atmosphere, service, and food were all spectacular--that's an incredible value.
