Oh Alinea... how I love thee... let me count the ways.... Where to even begin? Oh, i know. ALINEA WAS THE BEST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! Take note that I didn't say best meal.... oh, the meal was only part of it. Dining at Alinea is truly an experience. I love the way Chef Grant Achatz takes you on a culinary journey where the focus is on food as a performance piece. Engaging the diners, making them feel connected to his meal. It was wonderful. I wish i could afford this kind of culinary pleasure more than once. Very deserving of its 3-Michellin star rating!
