if you do go here, PLEASE PRE-ORDER YOUR FOOD, or else YOU WILL WAIT ONE HOUR FOR YOUR FOOD. We got there early enough to beat the crazy tourism traffic. I'm not a fan of their corn bread crust. Their sausage is on point tho. Gave this spot a 2 star because....... I am all about great service and I'm not wanting top of the line fine dining service, but all i ask for is to check up on us a couple of times and... Our waitress, was, lets just say, a B*****, she came, gave us an attitude,took our order and up and left. Barely even checked in on us. Like damn yo, you expect a tip from us if you don't come around asking us if we were doing okay.
