I absolutely LOVED Davanti! I went with my husband on Friday night, there was about an hour and fifteen min wait but it went quick as we sat at the lounge right across the street (Bevamio).  Atmosphere is lively and vibrant, although if you sit near the front expect people to be everywhere... I really wish more people went across the street to wait as it's super obnoxious when you're trying to eat and have a good time and people who are waiting are bumping your chair and crowding your table. But anyway... Food was fun. We started with the formaggi, the pecorino cheese with truffle was amazing, the other cheese and salami were also good but paled in comparison. The pork belly was tasty and interesting, the hubby loved it, and the ravoli was good, but not necessarily something I would order again. I loved the rigatoni with sausage and tomato, super flavorful and perfectly al dente, however the carbonara risotto that looked so wonderful on the menu didn't quite live up to my expectations (a bit bland). We were going to order dessert (even though we were seriously stuffed) however the table next to ours just got their stuffed sardines - whoa! Those babies smell and smell big time!!! They were so pungent that we decided to skip desert as who wants to smell sardines when they're eating sweets? Our waitress started off great, but halfway though our meal she was non-existent. Very, very flaky. Hosts and other workers were great though. Hopefully they're just working out the kinks. We had a wonderful time at Davanti, I want to give them 5 stars (and perhaps I soon will) but till they work out their kinks 4 it is!
