Simply the best. Worth the wait.. Doug is the man and runs a tight ship and caters to you the customer. Keria Knightly fire dog is awesome added some sport peppers for even more heat. Wife had a veggie dog and liked it. Fries with cheese sauce are worth the inevitable heart attack! I vow to go there on every trip I make to Chicago! CASH ONLY
