I like this place. I really do. I love the caramelized cheese on the deep dish, love the sauce on the pizza. I like the vibe, even though I feel like its lost a bit of the edge after the fire, because now it just seems bigger and open instead of cramped and cozy. To some this would be a good thing. Somehow on a cold rainy/snowy night it was a great place to squeeze in with friends and leave with a stuffed stomach. Somehow though, I can't love it. Apps are good, but common and nothing ground breaking. The liquor and beer selection is great, (anyplace with Liberty Ale is a good place to be), and the pizza is great. I think the crust is good, but I feel like its missing something. Maybe I hope it could be something of a buttery crust but it certainly keeps up with the toppings. Service is usually really good too. Its a solid pizza place and certainly will make you leave full.
