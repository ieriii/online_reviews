RJ Grunts' is near and dear to me for a few reasons (visiting since I was little, parents old stomping grounds, first "lettuce" restaurant, etc), but I won't say I am biased. After all, it is the food that keeps me coming back. And yes, jerks that may know me, I am a seasoned professional cook. I cook for a living and for recreation. I STILL think a Lettuce Entertain You Restaurant of a very casual persuasion is GREAT. 'Cuz it IS! BUT, WHY is it GREAT? *The onion rings are huge, properly battered, perfectly cooked, served with a simple homemade dipping sauce. *The salad bar is fantastic. It's worth getting all by itself. It's well kept, well-chilled, which is huge for me, and has a nice selection. An actual chef and kitchen staff reside there, and it shows. The dressings are HOUSE made. *The soups are delicious, and again, house made. *The menu items are not wildly adventurous, but they are classic, and hearty. Do something simply, and do it right, I say, and people will pay attention. *The milk shake was absolutely magnificent. I want one right now. *The decor is fun, nostalgic, slightly kitschy, and cool. *The 70's and 80's music is a perfect addition to this place. You never realize how much the music in a restaurant CAN effect your experience until you go to a place like this. (Or a place that is totally the opposite.) Go to this place with friends, sit by the window, and get onion rings and salad for SURE. Get a milkshake, too. Stay long enough to let your food settle in completely, and get a 2nd trip to the salad bar. Yay, RJ Grunts'. You are lovely.
