So I came here with a friend hoping that it was phenomenal as everyone on Yelp had said. Quite honestly, this place isn't worth five stars. I tried the raspberry mojito and the arrachara. The mojito was just.. another mojito. Maybe mine was a fluke?? And the arrachara was pretty good, but not incredible. Let's just say that the food wasn't the memorable part of this place. However, this place is BEAUTIFUL. The decorations are fantastic and the room we were placed in was comfy and (what's very important in big venues like this one) quiet enough to hear the other person speak. The service was quick and friendly. I really want to come back when there is dancing though!
