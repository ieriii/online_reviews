We had an amazing experience here. Everybody else has talked about the food (which was AWESOME), so I'll say a few things about the staff. We had a great time with the 10+ people we had serving us throughout our dining experience. We certainly didn't experience any pretentiousness during our dinner. Even when service errors were made (one of the items was spilled on the table) it was recovered with a smile and a joke. I thought that was great. Instead of focus on the mistake, we were challenged to try and serve the pieces ourselves. We also elected to order two bottles of wine instead of the wine pairing and went on the recommendations of the wine director for a Viognier and a Grenache. Outside of the pairing these wines complemented our tasting experience quite well (with some dishes certainly better than others). Overall, this was a tremendous dining experience and I look forward to having an excuse (and the spare cash) to go again.
