My first visit was right when Bad Apple opened. I treated my boyfriend to a birthday dinner before going out for drinks. The food was amazing and between the two of us there was not a morsel to spare. We have been back several times in the past years and it has never disappointed. The menu has changed slightly, new burgers and some that have left the menu. I have tried a different one every time and always left more than satisfied. Its a great place for a unique burger cooked to perfection every time. I also love their home-made ketchup...its more of a wholesome tomato puree than the salty vinegary stuff that comes out of the bottle. Bad remains my #1 burger in Chicago
