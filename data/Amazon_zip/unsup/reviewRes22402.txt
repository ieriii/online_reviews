My girlfriend and I love to try new places in Chicago and have pretty much the mindset that in this city almost every place is at least decent. Well we were wrong. The Greek Islands is actually the worst restaurant I have been to in the city. From food, to service, to price. We were seated practically in the kitchen and served by a waiter that really looked a bit suicidal. We ordered the fried cheese (the delicacy) and he served luke warm cheese while he issued a very sad "hoopa" and stared around looking for a gun. Our $9 greek salad for two was a few pieces of iceberg, 3 olives and a small piece of feta. Our main courses we didn't finish. Mine was the spinach pie which actually was just a ton of spinach with crust on top and bottom. Here chicken was pink and at that point we had to bounce. I am literally astonished to see their ratings here as I use yelp regularly and am rarely this far off. We paid $45 for slab of cheese, a shitty salad and 2 terrible entrees. The old guy serving us made each bite almost unbearable as he stared us down from the corner. Save your money and your tummy - dont visit Greek Islands.
