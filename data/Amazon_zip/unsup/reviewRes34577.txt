I don't know what the hype is all about. It's HUGE, you could fit like a million people in there, but half of Chicago shows up every weekend, so you still wait forever. And the food was very mediocre. It's all the stuff you could easily make yourself at home. Uninspired and blah. It's fine if you're looking for your run-of-the-mill omelette, scrambled egg or pancake, but not if you're looking for something that tastes like it's got some talent behind it.
