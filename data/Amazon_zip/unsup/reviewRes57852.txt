Best Ethiopian food I have had in Chicago. Ive been to Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond and neither were as flavorful as Demera. Ras Dashen had some nice vegan/vegetarian options but their food was bland. Ethiopian Diamond was a little on the bland side as well. The mystery to me was that both Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond had more customers and Ethiopian Diamond was packed. Go figure. That saying a line out the door means the food is good in the kitchen doesn't apply as much in this case. If you want flavor, go to Demera. The manager was also really nice. However, be careful when parking on the streets. I got a ticket for parking in a taxi cab stand and honestly never saw the sign.
