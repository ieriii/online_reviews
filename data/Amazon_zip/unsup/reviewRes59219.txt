I been coming here for many years, since i was 5 years old. As the year goes on, the service at the front counter have gotten worst year after year after year. It seems as if they are a little over confident with the client tell they got here and finally they don't care about service at all. The food have been ok, and the peking duck isn't as great as people describe it nor is it even worth the price. Highly don't recommend this place, not even worth the wait. I feel like the only reason people come here is because there isn't much other Chinese BBQ around. Don't come here Hon Kee don't the street is a much better place, more of a Chinese feel restuarant.
