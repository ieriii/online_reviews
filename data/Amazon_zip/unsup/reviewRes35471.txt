Had to work on a weekend and the biz ordered from Shaw's for lunch and I have to say, good decision. Surprised they approved that bill but I didn't ask too many questions. I've never been to the restaurant itself but I might make an effort now that I've sampled some catered food and it was pretty damn good. They had creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin as sides, parmesan crusted chicken with lemon butter sauce, shrimp cocktail, garlic shrimp, cheesey bread and mini crab cakes. They also had caesar salad but that had anchovies swimming all over so I passed that one up, sorry. I was just really impressed with how good everything tasted in large quantities coming out of silver trays. Each was really well labeled with what was inside as well as which sauce went with the dish. Everything was a little lukewarm but I'll attribute that to me not being one of the first people in line. Honestly my favorite part was the creamed spinach, it was so freaking good. The garlic shrimp were good but really hard to get out of the shell since they were split like lobster tails. But definitely get the chicken, yummy.
