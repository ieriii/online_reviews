Sweet lord, this place good. There will be a wait, so get a bartender's attention and have him make you the best Old Fashioned you've ever had. I was there with three friends and we were told there was a two hour wait. It turned out to be 40 minutes. Patience is a virtue. It was not as expensive as I expected, especially considering our massive order. We started off with drinks. I had an Old Fashioned and a Pisco Sour. Both were delicious, but the Pisco Sour was absolutely on point. During our wait we had a terrific bowl of olives, some killer meatballs, and a warm pretzel. All were fantastic, but the olives were my personal favorite. Our actual meal consisted of several small plates and several entrees. Highlights were the marrow bones, fois gras, and steak and egg. The steak and egg was an interesting presentation as the egg was served alongside the steak, soft-boiled inside a perfectly cooked ravioli. Surprisingly, the least impressive dish was a special small plate: lobster and sea urchin served over squid-ink cavatelli. It was very good, just not as good as expected. The menu changes often, so most of this review will probably be useless, but I can't imagine anyone having a sub-par experience based on my meal there. The waiters and bartenders are knowledgeable and more than happy to suggest dishes and drinks.
