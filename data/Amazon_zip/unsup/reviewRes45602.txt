I always end up very full and happy whenever I go to Wilde's. I've been here 3 times, all birthday dinners. I love the ambiance. There's nice lighting, not too loud, and lots of books on their bookshelves! The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating to our large groups. I've had the delicious rueben, mac and cheese, and a fish sandwich. All were very tasty!
