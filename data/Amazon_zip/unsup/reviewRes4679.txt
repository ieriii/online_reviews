I have been to Purple Pig five times and I have never been disappointed with the food. Although the menu leans heavily on swine, wine and cheese there are always many interesting vegetable and seafood options to pick from. Some notable dishes I have had include broiled razor clams, eggplant caponata, bone marrow spread, foie gras, pork sweetbreads and a cold calamari salad.  Although I cannot complain about the food, the seating situation at Purple Pig can sometimes be cramped and uncomfortable. If you come at popular dinning hours, be prepared to wait and dine elbow to elbow with your neighbor.
