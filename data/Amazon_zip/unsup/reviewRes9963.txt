Anybody that can pull off a pizza and brewery at the same time deserves the right kudos, and Piece makes the cut! Their pizza might not be Chicago style but they KNOW how to make it right, and talk about their seasonal beers! It really is just refreshing...plus all the cool seats by the TVs where you can catch pretty much any game you want. The down side? You'll get carded at the entrance during certain times, which sucks if you forget to bring your ID (this happened to a friend of mine and we couldn't get in).
