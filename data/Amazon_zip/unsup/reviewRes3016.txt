I have always had a pleasant meal at Tru, but I do have to admit that the staff can sometimes get on my nerves. For instance: I had a party upstairs for my mother's birthday and at the last minute wanted to get a cake but most bakeries needed at least 1 week to create the cake I wanted. So I thought I would call Tru and see if they could bring out a birthday cake for my mother or recommend someone for me...well when I asked them for this request they were insulted that I would have their pastry chef make a birthday cake. They kept asking me if I knew who their pastry chef was, yes I did and honestly I didn't care. Finally they gave me the name of a bakery that was able to produce a wonderful 3-tired cake for the 20 guests and they even delivered it to the restaurant. Well the dinner was going wonderful till we got to desert when the restaurant informs us that they don't have any candles after they bring out the cake. Are you serious? So after a few handshakes we have candles on the cake and are able to sing happy birthday. Other then that one night dealing with the staff, I have always enjoyed my experiences at Tru.
