I want to give this place a higher review but I'm so sad I can't :(. They used to have my favorite mojitos in the city but recently something has changed and they aren't any good. Sooo disappointing. But I still rate it pretty highly because their brunch breakfast burritos make me insanely happy. I vote best I've ever had. Their taste of Cuba platter is so delicious!! It's a must if you go. So I hate to do this AGAIN but I have to drop my rating. We went, we were ignored by the host for like 15 minutes and then finally seated. Our food came and 2 out of the 3 orders were incorrect (not just like one thing here or there but the major things wrong.) and it was awful. Sad face. Used to be my go to for brunch but no longer.
