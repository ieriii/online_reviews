It looks like it would totally be nothing special from the outside...but the food inside is absolutley the best!The Plantians are awesome, the beans and rice...amazing...and they have this Oatmeal Shake that I have actually DREAMT about.For real.It's cash only, but also BYOB....Staff is friendly, and it seems family-based
