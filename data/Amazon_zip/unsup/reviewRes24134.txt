I've been here probably 50 times now.  Amazing food especially if you like it spicy. Highlights include house special sole fish fillet (delicious!), pan fried sliced pork, Tony's three chili chicken (think spicy and sweet popcorn chicken), lamb with cumin powder, Szechuan string beans, don don noodles, and sliced beef with maw for the adventurous. Great lunch special for $6 or so. And they're open til midnight every day of the week. Service is up and down but who cares when the food is this good. Unfortunately it can get really crowded for dinner (thanks a lot Check Please!) but it's worth the wait. Just be sure to get a ticket.
