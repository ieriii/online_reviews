There are too many great sushi restaurants in Chicago to deal with the pretension of Coast. Instead of looking down their nose at their guests, they should focus on service... We all but got kicked out one night when we opened our last bottle of wine AFTER we had finished our dinner. We asked our server to open it, and she flat our refused, "no. you're done eating." Now I can understand the logic if it was 8 p.m. and they had a wait, but it was about 10:30 and the restuarant was only half full, with no one waiting. So... naturally we had our strong male friend open it by pushing the cork into the bottle with a Chapstick. She was horrified, needless to say.  The food is good, but that doesn't make Coast worth it.
