This happened more than a year ago and I'm still angry. Made reservations for a surprise dinner with friends for my partner's birthday (he had cancer). After I told them it was a surprise, they still called back to confirm the reservation, and my partner answered the phone. They were unapologetic and could have cared less that they wrecked the occasion. It turned out to be my buddy's last birthday. To hell with this place!! Of course we did not go to Uncommon Stupidity.
