Every employee I've met here has been very nice and the service has always been quick, once you forgive the previously long ass wait for a table. I'm very excited about their new winter-proof back patio and I will go much more often now that I don't have to plan for a 45 minute wait for a table. I don't think this is the best vegetarian restaurant in the city, but it's certainly up there. I also appreciate that I can bring my gluten-free friends here and all of us can find something delicious for dinner. Bottom line: I love this place. The only thing that would make me love it just a little bit more would be if they went all vegan!
