I've never really been much of a Pan-Asian restaurant fan because well, frankly, most of them really suck. But not Sunda. My recent trip there completely exceeded my expectations and killed the bad taste in my mouth I had from my last attempt to dine there. I've heard many positive things about Sunda so I decided to finally go and try it last year. We made reservations and we were FIVE minutes late and they gave our table away. We even called to say we were going to be about ten minutes late, and all they said was try to get here soon. I was heated so we left. We finally came again. And I'm glad we did. Last minute reservations are impossible, but luckily I know someone on the darkside that scored us reservations. I like the atmosphere: filled with a lot of eye candy, but still manages to keep a very chill, laid back tone. Our waitress was awesome, super friendly and very helpful with recommendations. The menu is extensive and has lots to choose from. I saw they had Blue Fin tuna, so i HAD to try it. Blue fin is an endangered species, so it's a rare find in restaurants. It's endangered for good reason: it's frickin delicious. I'm all for saving animals and whatnot, but I have absolutely zero qualms about that piece of Blue Fin sashimi sitting happily in my tummy. Everything we ordered was awesome as well. The signature makis are unique and worth trying. And the rock shrimp tempura was definitely a big hit. The chocolate molten cake was so good my friends and I had to order a second round. Right now I'm in my room, sick with a cold. I'm pretty sure the only thing that would make me better right now is some Blue Fin tuna. Can somebody please pick me up and take me to Sunda, like now? Thaaaanks!
