Where I come from, fancy and barbecue are never found in the same sentence or thought. This place just destroyed that belief. The Kobe beef brisket is simply amazing, not to mention the staff had a certain type of hospitality rarely found up here. Can't wait to go back.. Oh and call ahead because it's byob for now as yet wait for their liquor license.
