When I first moved to the 'hood (1996), this was a scary bar, the kind where a dozen or so men would turn and give you the stink-eye as you walked past the open door. Most of us old-timers remember Carlos the drunk, who always slept it off in the parkway in front of the bar. One time I saw the cops roll him over to see if he was still alive. Then, it became Smoke, owned by the same people who bought the Matchbox. It could have been an early Logan Square success story. However, he refused to get air-conditioning, even when Chicago was in the throes of a major heat wave. Unsurprisingly, it failed. Then, The Winds. Oye vey--what a waste of a good spot. Straight out of the gate, at top speed and form, comes Longman & Eagle. L&E is part of the Empty Bottle corporation, which explains the "ready-to-go" quality of this new establishment. They seem to be able to keep the small kitchen cranking; the plates are small, but done beautifully. The wait and bar staff are experienced, professional and kind of cute, quite frankly. Visiting at off-times is recommended. We dined there early (7:00) on a Wednesday evening. Although our wait for a table was brief, by 8:00 pm, the place was jammed. Perhaps because of the custom wood ceilings, the acoustics are great for conversation.
