I LOOOOVE this place and would come here several times a week if I lived closer! FIrst of all, kudos on a balanced veggie/meat menu, which was expected from the same owners of Handlebar. I love the Moroccan salad (sans chicken, although I'm sure it's delish with/without it) and these sweet potato cakes on the appetizers menu. Yum! Obviously the beer selection is great and while Revolution's own beers are hit or miss they are always willing to let you sample anything, which is a plus as most places give you a hard time about that. Love the bright, light wood decor and the barrel stools. Great service also, the servers are always knowledgeable and super friendly. No too cool for thou hipster 'tude here.  Come hungry, thirsty and I guarantee you will leave satisfied and bursting at the seams!
