I'm downgrading Icosium for some recent changes that I do not appreciate. While the food is good and has not changed, the prices sure have. I have to say, I cannot stand it when restaurants nickle and dime you for every little thing. My husband and I always build our own crepe. Unknowingly, I asked for toasted almonds only to realize that now they are an extra $1?!?! Also my husband always like to order a coke in those cute little glass bottles. Well the sizes are smaller now, I think 6-8oz now but at the same price. Overall the prices went up across the board and I just cannot justify why. I mean the food is good, but it was expensive already. I doubt I will come here as often anymore because frankly, a $40 crepe and dessert crepe just is not worth it. Ouch.
