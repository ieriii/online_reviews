delicious entrees and interesting appetizers make up for what in my mind seems to be a mildly overpriced dining experience (the place is starting to have a "branded" feel and the staff is regularly overwhelmed). dining outside for lunch can be fun on a nice summer day. bottom line: good food, but don't forget your patience or your wallet.
