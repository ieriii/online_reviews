Sunda is a fabulous spot but service is seriously lacking... Came on a Thursday night with some girl friends for a few drinks. When we got there, the place was pretty packed and so we sat in lower lounge area where there was no wait. For me, this place was more about the scene than the actual food and service. I absolutely love the decor...very stylish and clean without looking over the top and gaudy. The food was actually pretty good too. I would definitely try the sushi over the other entrees...it was beautifully presented and discernably fresh. I could tell they used high quality ingredients and that they took a lot of care in preparing each roll. The only gripe (a huge gripe) i had about this place was the shitty service. Our waitress was rude, forgot our order and brought out wrong drinks. I mean, is it REALLy that hard to forget three drinks (two of which are the same). If she were somewhat apologetic, I would have let it slide but she seemed to not care at all about anything. She was unpolished and unprofessional and left us feeling a little bitter. Next time, you'll find me at the sushi bar where I can bypass the subpar service and just focus on the food and drinks.
