i have been to this restaurant twice; the first time, i loved it; the food was delicious and offered a different take on typical tapas fare. the second go around? well, i won't be going back. when my date and i were seated to our table, we waited long enough for a server that we were able to pick out all the tapas we wanted. when the server did arrive, we put in for drinks and i suggested to the server that we would order the cheese to start and then continue to order. he said he could take it all at once and they would space out the dishes. fine. we did just that. all of our food came at the same time BEFORE the drinks arrived. the food wasn't as good as the first time, when the restaurant had only recently opened. we had the hazelnut and manchengo cheese plate, and the hazelnut was delicious. but, the barbeque octopus that was a stand out before was completely different and fell flat--just drowned in a sauce that was rather flavorless. our third dish was a flatbread, so forgetable that i don't even remember what was on it. and, finally, when the server came to bring us our drinks (this being the only time we saw him since we ordered), we felt as if we were being hustled to make a quick turn around. i like my dining experience to be at my own pace, especially when sharing tapas. the whole experience left me unsatisfied and worse,,,hungry.
