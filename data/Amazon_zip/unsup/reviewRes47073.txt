Uncommon Ground is a very nice place to have a great meal and spend an evening with good friends. The atmosphere is very relaxing. The food is organic and grown in a sustainable manner and some of it was even grown on the green roof of the restaurant. Everything was incredibly fresh. I appreciate how much thought goes into each piece of food that is served here, and how much effort they put into running a green restaurant. All that being said, the food was really tasty. And that is the reason I will continue to come back here.
