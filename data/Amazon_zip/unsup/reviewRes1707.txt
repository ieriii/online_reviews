YUM they say hunger is the best sauce, and after waiting in line at hot doug's, i definitely found this to be true. the regular dogs are good but not worth the trip or the wait. the 5-stars are for the "special" dogs which are all unique and delicious. best i've had was the antelope sausage with goat cheese spread, and the garlic pork with gouda, i think? de-lish. one order of duck fat fries can easily feed a group of 3 or 4.
