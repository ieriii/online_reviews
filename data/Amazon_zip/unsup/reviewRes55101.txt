Best steaks in town. Now most people would say Gibsons, but honestly for the price and tenderness of the meat, this is the place to go. I always get the blue cheese crusted filet. We usually share a house salad, which can feed about 4-5 people, awesome! I recommend the sweet potato with brown sugar as your side dish. Also they have great desserts that will melt in your moth.Every time my parents are in town, they want to come here, which I don't blame them. They also have killer Martini's here, which I like them extra dirty. Couple of these and I will be good for the night. Great service and ambiance as well.
