My dad loves this place, so when he's in town, this is pretty much a must-go. Their food is good, portions are usually enormous, and while the salad bar is expensive, it's probably one of the best in that type of dining establishment (meaning, not super high end). It's usually packed on the weekend, so beware and plan ahead!
