Let me preface this review by the fact that I have always hated cilantro and parsley. It makes me want to throw up. No, I'm not allergic. But if you add fresh cilantro or parsley to my dish, you have ruined it for me. However, I love Rick Bayless so much that I ignore his love for all things cilantro and brave his wonderfully created and composed sandwiches. Either I've never had cilantro/parsley the way it should be done, or Rick has managed to incorporate this ingredient in a new and wonderful way. I've had almost everything off the menu (except desserts and some of the salads). The vegetarian sandwich (mushrooms and cheese) is oh so delicioso. The spicy beef sandwich (eat in only) is served in a bowl with this spicy broth... well. I would've drank it all or sopped it up with more bread if I had any leftover. The ceviche/seafood salads are excellent and fresh. I love that much (if not all) of the food is organic and local. The bread is the perfect heartiness and crunchiness for these sandwiches. Yes. The lines are long. You wait in line to order, then you wait in another line to get seated. And don't be surprised if you have to share a table with another group of people. It's not fine dining with crystal glasses and silverware. It's lunch. And once you bite into your sandwich, you won't care.
