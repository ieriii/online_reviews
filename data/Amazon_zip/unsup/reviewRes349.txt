What a fantastic place; my money was extremely well spent. The ingenuity that went into creating these unique dishes is mind blowing. They incorporate aromas so well; I personally thought the nutmeg pillow was very creative. The ambience is relaxing; allowing you to truly savor the food you are being served. Did I say the food you are being served? I meant the art you are being served. I can't wait for another opportunity to dine at Alinea.
