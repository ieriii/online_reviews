I absolutely loved this place and the food!! When you first walk in, it appears that is just a small space for seating but they do have another section in the back for large groups or for couples. The food was fantastic and the waiter was knowledgeable of everything on the menu. I felt that the service was fantastic, considering that I had a large group with me, and the ambiance was great as well. It seems like a fancy/romantic place to have dinner and you should dress casual for the setting. I had the Bruschetta, Crostini Di Avocado, and Calamari Fritti for an appetizer, then followed that up with Linguini alle Vongole (which was pasta with fresh clams). I also had the chance to try out the Vitello Ossobuco alla pugliese, which was a veal lasagna...fantastic! It does get busy at night so I would recommend making a reservation first, just to be on the safe side. They are part of http://Opentable.com so it's even easier to make that reservation!
