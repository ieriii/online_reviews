I stayed at the Amalfi when I was in Chicago for a conference and thought it was a lovely hotel. The staff was all very friendly. The rooms were clean and cozy. There was a continental breakfast set up on a credenza near the elevators on each floor in the morning which was awesome. I went out in my PJs and brought breakfast back to my room. There was also a free happy hour that they hold each day for guests that included picky foods like cheese, crackers, meats, hummus. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.
