We went to Pilsen to buy a bike from a guy off of Craigslist and he pointed us in the direction of Nuevo Leon for dinner. Great tip! Friendly service, good food, great atmosphere, free yummy appetizers, secure parking lot, on-site ATM, byob, warm chips, cold Cokes... what's not to love? The guy at the table next to us got the Mole, and it looked like he was eating hot fudge chicken -- Amazing. Bring the kids. You'll feel like you took a little road trip to Mexico with them. Totally great experience all around.
