I've been wanting to go here after reading about it on Yelp about a month ago, so I was thrilled when I was with a big group in Lincoln Park yesterday and someone suggested it. There's not much seating, especially for groups, but they were very accommodating. The waiter led us back through the restaurant and into the space next door, a bar called The Other Side. I guess it's owned by the same people--they had a separate menu, but let us order off The Pasta Bowl's menu. I had the Pesto Linguine and thought it was very good. It was a little heavy, but the restaurant just seems like a "heavy pasta" kind of place. A few people in the group got the Farfalle Pollo and gave it rave reviews. Service was very fast and my meal was only $7.50. I'll definitely go back, especially with budget-minded friends.
