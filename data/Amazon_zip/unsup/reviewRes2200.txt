Very Simple... Duck Fat Fries, Chicago Dog steamed with everything (includes carmelized onions the best new addition to tradional chicago dog fare) and you have an afternoon mouth-gasm. Chicago Dogs should be steamed, but it is nice that they give an option for char fans. Expect long lines, which are worth the wait, even in the cold.
