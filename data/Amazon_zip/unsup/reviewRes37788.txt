Yumm-o. You order your pizza at the counter before you even sit down because it takes so long to cook. Once you're seated at your table, you wait, tortured every minute, until it arrives in all it's hot, chewy, cheesy goodness. And boy did I love my ridiculously expense, takes-forever-to-cook stuffed pizza. My fiance and I made this our last stop before leaving for the airport. We ordered two pizzas- she thought we were crazy! ("It's just for the two of you?" "Do you know how big they are?" "You're absolutley certain?") But we each had two slices and packed the rest for the trip. We ate a little more for dinner on the plane and saved a little more for dinner the next night. It was our souvenir from Chicago that just kept on giving.
