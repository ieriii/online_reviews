Its menu may have been inspired by street food, but definitely surpassed its inspiration in taste and quality! Another River North Runch favorite! Although I had my chances to dine-in early in opening week, I did have the unfortunate timing of trying to dine-in after the word was unleashed the world that XOCO was open, and that Rick Bayless would be working the counter all week. I do suspect that the lunchtime crowds will be larger than normal for awhile, so plan accordingly. Also, they will eventually do take-out orders, it doesn't look like they will be offering that option any time soon. How's the food, you ask? Excellent taste, and wonderful value for the price point. Although the tortas range from $9-$13, they're worth every mouth-watering bite. It's a fine strategy to go with a friend, and split two sandwiches to maximize your flavor potential. On my initial trip, I split an Ahodaga, and a Cubano. The Ahodaga sits in a tomato broth and a chile sauce (which you specify the spice level.) It's quite a flavorful dish, and you may be tempted to use your sandwich to mop up the sauce (as I did). The Cubano was a nice griddled torta as well. The pork was well seasoned, and the bacon was cooked well. Another excellent combination of flavors. You can get chips and salsa ($3) or chips and guacamole ($4) as well, but don't expect an overwhelming amount of chips. I definitely will have to bring my co-workers to try the breakfast menu, and the churros as well. This is definitely a reasonable place to eat once or twice a month if not more, depending on your lunch budget. This place is accessible to a number of CTA buses, like Clark, Grand, and La Salle, in addition to the Red Line.
