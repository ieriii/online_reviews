I was here Friday with a friend because of GE's reputation as a quality place at a reasonable price. I'd have to say it didn't exceed or underperform my expectations, but met them. The music was louder than I expected. I know GE billed itself as fine dining but without the haughtiness, but I thought the music was a bit too loud as I felt I needed to speak loudly so my table partner could hear me. However, I did enjoy the atmosphere and the lack of tablecloth was nice for such a place. The waiter tried to sell me way too hard on buying their specialty drinks, as I must have turned him down 3 or 4 times. Sometimes a man just wants a Coke, mmkay? Popcorn was brought out before the entree and I found it to be quite good. The popcorn flavor rotates and we were given the ranch style. Can't speak to the other styles of course. For the entree, I ordered the salmon which was presented very impressively on the plate. I would highly recommend the dish. I normally hate beets, but I even enjoyed these as they had just the right amount of flavor and taste to compliment the other food on the plate. Everything was paired intelligently.I had the Molten Chocolate cake for desert which was even better than the entree. Caramel was added to the side as well as a small "glass" filled with a milk shake. Better experienced firsthand than described. Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliott but did not come away wowed or disappointed. If you're looking to find a quality establishment at a reasonable price, than GE is definitely for you. If price is not an issue, then the more expensive staples (such as Alinea or Moto) are a better option.
