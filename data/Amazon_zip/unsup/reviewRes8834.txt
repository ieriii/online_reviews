This place was great. The food and wine were good, the atmosphere was simple and our waitress was fantastic. I went with a book club and we ended up with complimentary appetizers and dessert. The place made us feel extremely welcome AND it was delicious. Plus, the pizzas were ready in no time flat. Will be going back again!
