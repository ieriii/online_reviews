This may be the best food I've ever had. Ever. If you're hungry for a huge italian or steak dinner, this isn't it. If you're in for a dining experience to blow away your tastebuds. WOW. I've eaten at Charlie Trotter's and I know that Rick Tramonto came from there, but to me, Tru is head and shoulders above. It's a "forever memory experience". Get the 9 course option. Heaven. A meal fit for God. The taste is wonderful but the texture is unexplainable.
