Uncommon Ground did an amazing job accomodating over 30 girls. I was extremely happy when the first round of appetizers came 10 seconds after we sat down. How did they know we were so hungry?! The baked goat cheese dip was unbelievable. I think the servers had to pry it out of my hands. But, the favorite part of the meal for me was the pumpkin ravioli. I never would have come up with that combination, but oh did it work well together. The service was great. Our drinks didn't go for more than a couple minutes without being re-filled. Food seemed to always be around (which is both a good and bad thing, of course. Ask my scale this morning how much of a bad thing, haha). Overall, it was a very nice experience and the decor was cozy and perfect for a cold winter day. It's pretty far from me, but I hope to return soon!
