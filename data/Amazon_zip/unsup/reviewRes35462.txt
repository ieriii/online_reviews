Ever since I started to get a hard on, I knew my penis wasn't something that could be use to wow the opposite sex. It's tiny, it's crooked and it smells like sour milk. What I'm trying to say is, my life sucks. But sometimes events take place that make me very proud to not only be alive but also knowing a group of great people in my life. One of those people had a birthday few days ago and I was invited! I was excited AND was skeptic about this place. I walk in and see a counter full with fried duck with TONS of people buying them. Meat doesn't do anything for me so I'm thinking "let's hope their vegetarian/sea food is just as good". Damn, I should have wished for a mountain of gold or something just as big. This is what I had within my quick 20 minute stop at this place: Tea: 5 stars. White Rice: 4 stars. Shrimps: 5 stars. Mixed vegetable: 5 stars. AND Drumroll please!!!!! Fried DUCK! That's right, I broke my vow of no meat just to try the duck! And I'm glad I did. Duck: 5 stars. I don't know the whole cost of meal thing since I took off before the bill arrived but I'm very sure it's much less than other places you have been to. Go there and try something new. Come back and send me a Thank You compliment.
