A friend and I biked here the other night. We stopped at Jewel for a bottle of wine and then ordered a deep dish veggie pie. The pizza took a solid 30-45 minutes. Deep dish veggie pizzas aren't really my thing, I prefer thin crust and I like to evaluate pizza joints using a Margherita pizza as a baseline. But the deep dish was solid, the crust was good and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. It was a little light on sauce, and we had to ask for more, which they cheerfully provided, though it took a little convincing to get them to heat it up for us. The service was pretty good considering it's not a full service restaurant. And BYOB is always good. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, but I won't knock off points for that. I'll write another review once I get to try the thin crust.
