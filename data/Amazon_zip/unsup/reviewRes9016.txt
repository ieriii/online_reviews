Had a really good experience at Le Colonial. They had a very reasonable ($25) prix fixe three-course meal which three of us shared and supplemented with two additional salads (the Goi Bo was especially tasty), a side and an extra dessert and it was perfect. The food was chock full of fresh herbs and produce, presented in a beautiful fashion and quite tasty. And they had a great drink menu. Who could ask for more?
