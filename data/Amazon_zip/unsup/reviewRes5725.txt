Absolutely delicious. Walked right in for Sunday lunch. Dined on roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachios, fresh corn and tomatoes with a basil style pesto, chorizo-stuffed fried olives, fig and prosciutto smear, and fried peppers. An all around wonderful experience. Simple but delightful food!
