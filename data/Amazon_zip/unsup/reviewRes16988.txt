This place is definitely fancy! We felt a little under dressed wearing jeans, but this would be the perfect spot for a first date or special occasion.  We came here with my boyfriend's father because he was in Chicago for business. We all ordered pre-dinner drinks. I ordered a cocktail, which I felt was "meh" for $9. My boyfriend's dad made the mistake of ordering the German beer which had "N/A" next to it, not realizing it meant "Non-Alcoholic" (he's from Germany). After he complained, the manager herself came over, personally apologized, comp'd him for his original beer, and poured the new beer for him herself at our table. I had never seen *that* kind of service before (I really don't go to fancy restaurants much).  Dinner was just as good as the service. The portions were perfect; not so small that you're still starving after eating, not so large that you could feed a family of 12 with just one plate. We decided to order a bottle of wine for dinner, but the waiter said they had trouble opening the cellar. We didn't get our wine until after we finished eating, but the waiter felt so bad about our wait that he gave us a free cheese plate that had 4 perfectly matched cheeses to go with our wine.  Pros: Outstanding service, delicious food, great atmosphere Cons: A little pricey, but great for a special occasion
