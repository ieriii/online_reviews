Dry cornread and rolls. My margarita came out frozen even though there was no indication on the menu that I was ordering a frozen or blender drink. The server brought out my mashed potatoes with my salad My shrimp were forgotten and when I was able to flag someone down to ask about them they were brought out after I finished the appetizer they came with (a corncake with cajun shrimp and sauce) , so now I just had a plate of shrimp... Flavorless cheese grits and I LOVE grits. You have to make an effort to keep me away from grits, but I left them. Decent collards, great mashed potatoes, ok coleslaw. The pan fried chicken was a huge, flavorless, greasy, slimy disappointment. I gave 2 stars because it seems like the quality of their ingredients is good and some of the items were good, but the service was a disaster and the menu/restaurant description did not compare to the items I was receiving.
