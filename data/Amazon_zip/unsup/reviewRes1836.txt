I had never heard of this place until Monday when I went for the first time. We got there around 2pm and had to wait about 45 minutes to get in. If the weather wasn't so cold and windy, I probably would not complain, but damn was it cold! When you get in, they have their regular menu and then their specialty meats. The regulars are in the $3 range and the specialties are about $8. I ordered the Sante Fe Chicken (Dave Kingmon) and it was delicious! Then I got the Wild Boar with pesto sauce and that was also ridiculously good. Everyone said to try the fries and I did, but did not think they were anything special. This is a great place to try, but I would dress for cold or wait for the weather to improve.
