We've been to this top-notch place several times for dinner, and I'm pleased to say it's just as good for lunch. True vietnamese food in a french colonial setting.  Took several business clients here for lunch and everyone had a wonderful meal. The shrimp beneigts and egg rolls are especially good for appetizers. The entrees are large enough to share so everyone can sample the unusual tastes available at Le Colonial. The sea bass was excellent and the Pho is as good as it gets! Good bar upstairs which can get croweded during the weekend happy hour scene. The downstairs main dining room is always elegant and perfect for a romantic dinner or business gathering. Love it!
