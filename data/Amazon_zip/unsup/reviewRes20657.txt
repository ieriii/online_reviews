As a spoiled Californian, I always enter sushi joints in land-locked states with a hefty degree of skepticism. Even in cosmopolitan Chicago, there aren't many places whose raw items have met my exacting standards of freshness. At Coast, however, I eat with abandon. Just delicious. The BYOB element is just icing on the cake. Minus one star for the ridiculous waits on the weekends (popularity is not really their fault, I concede), and the fact that the dining room can be uncomfortably warm in the summertime.
