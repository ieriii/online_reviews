I wouldn't come here for basic cheap staples (eggs and milk) unless you want eggs that have been given a K-5 education out of a rustic Amish farmhouse and milk that has been slowly milked by fair Swedish maidens in the highlands from rare golden cows. (Although both sound delicious if you have money to burn). Their cafe is delightful and delicious, their breads are in a league of their own, and the wall of olive oils are fun to try. Over the years of living next door, I have built a list of "musts" if you are trying food from F&O. Their soups are all delicious, their grilled cheese and tomato soup combo is pretty affordable, their chocolate chip cookies are chewy and caramelized because of the copious amounts of butter and sugar (YUM). They have a nice beer selection, good olive oils and fun selections of icecreams/gelatos. Finally, their bran muffin from the bakery is a must-have. It has chunks of fruit in it and is dripping in honey. A tribute to good food!
