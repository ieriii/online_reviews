Got the pan pizza to try out Chicago style pizza but didn't like the deep dish style. I think I'll get the thin crust next time. The sauce was pretty tomato-ey and the sausage mixed in was pretty darn good. The dark crust on the upper edge of the pizza was sooo delicious- crispy and burnt looking but probably won't kill you if you don't eat it that often.
