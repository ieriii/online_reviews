I like many things from this restaurant, however I'm using this for my rating of its pizza. I really like the pizza from here, my roommate tries to argue with me on this, but I have to severely disagree with him on this point. The sauce they use is right down the middle between the sweeter and more savory ends of things. Me and my friends had this and Pete's #2 last night, and while Pete's was delicious this was better.
