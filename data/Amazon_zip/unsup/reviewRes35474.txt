I had dinner here with a group and was fairly unimpressed. The waiter was confused by our drink orders, even though we were ordering right off of the menu, which I took to be an inauspicious start. My scallops were gritty with sand, and the sides (such as green beans) were just absolutely drenched in butter instead of having any sort of seasoning.  I had a version of the surf and turf, and my steak was excellently cooked and seasoned, and was the highlight of the meal, which was a bit of a disappointment for a seafood place. For dessert, I had some peppermint ice cream, which I also liked quite a bit.  I think for the price you can do much better, even downtown. I liked the decor and atmosphere very much, but the seafood just didn't live up to my expectations (or the price tag).
