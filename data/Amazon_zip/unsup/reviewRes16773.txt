This is a fun restaurant with great food. Usually, at a place like this, I like to order a bunch of small plates to share -- but the entrees are the real stars here. The steak with plantains was amazing, just enough char to give it texture, just enough fat to feel guilty. My date really enjoyed her tuna, but thought the sauce tasted 'earthy'...I kind of thought that was the point of a Latin place. Every plate was more food than we expected. The churros plate was borderline obscene (we finished it). The drinks weren't great, but I appreciate the margaritas being more tart than sweet. They do have a tequila tasting menu, along with a selection of cheeses and cured meats, but it all seemed a bit expensive and not really in the spirit of the place.
