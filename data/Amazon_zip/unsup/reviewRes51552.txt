I'm knocking Garcia's down a peg or two. The last two meals I've had there have not been their best work. I think the service is slipping a bit and food quality isn't far behind.  I have only been there since the remodel, being new to LS. Stumbled in one nigh walking around the square with an empty tummy, could smell the wonderful odors their kitchen was omitting from blocks away. I am a huge fan of Mexican food, and could probably eat here every day if allowed and socially acceptable.  The food here is great, but as another former southern Californian pointed out, not the best. Make no mistake, you are not wandering in the Barrio, you are in Bavarian Lincoln Square. But don't let that fool you, the food is delicious and so cheap its almost free. I recommend the Mole sauce, I have only had it better one other place. I have tasted from other peoples plates that were in my party, and am yet to find a bad dish on the menu. Don't go on a Friday or Saturday night if you are in a hurry, I have waited no less than a half hour to sit down and that was a weeknight. If you have the patience though, it IS worth the wait. Good salsas, better Margarita to wash down the spice!
