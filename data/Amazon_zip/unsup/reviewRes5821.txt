You MUST ask for Katherine. She was FABULOUS. Completely as wonderful and cute a server as you'd ever dream of wanting. Filled with recommendations (tried and true), she made our experience even better than it would have been, given the DELICIOUSNESS of the food here!  You must try: ricotta + local honey comb smoked cannellini beans + balsamic with cipolline onion roasted cauliflower steak + Sicilian olive tapenade + marinated lemon jam cacio e pepe (BEST EVER!!!!!) bread pudding. Yum, yum and more yum.
