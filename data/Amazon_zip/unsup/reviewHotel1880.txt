This review is for the lobby/bar Very cool atmosphere and great drinks. I thought the staff was friendly and provided good service. There was a nice happy hour crowd there on Friday but after 7:30/8:00 most had cleared out. Bonus: You can bring your dog! Talked to the concierge after seeing a beautiful husky come in for happy hour. Apparently the W is a very pet friendly hotel.
