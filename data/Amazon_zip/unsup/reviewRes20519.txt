I've heard that this place has major attitude and is overrated, which makes me sad because when I went our waitress was really attentive and the food was FANTASTIC. Way better than Sushi Samba or Kamehachi, and I like the ambience better than Japonais. Perfect date spot. I haven't been able to go back because reservations are out of control, so that sucks...but the last time I went was on a Weds. and it rocked. Plus, BYOB is your best friend if $$ is an issue...there's no corking fee and you can spend a little extra on amazing sushi.
