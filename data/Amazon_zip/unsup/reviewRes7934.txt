Now when I think pizza in Chicago, I don't expect to find nice thin crust pizza but came here with a large group and it was great. The dinning area has 3 or 4 sections so it's good for large or small parties. Here's a run down of what we had. We had a large selection of antipasti.  Bread with Olive oil and Parsley - assuming this is not on the menu and just provided since we had a large party. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Caprese con Bufala -The Caprese was nice as it utilized the punch of cherry tomatoes. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Grigliata di Verdure - Chilled grilled veggies. A nice light started. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Prosciutto e Rucola - Prosciutto, arugula, and Parmigiano Reggiano YUM! Surprisingly split among 4 people quite well. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Like the fact that they have a pizza oven. The thin crust is really good. Thoroughly baked with no burnt smell. Funghi e Salsiccia - Mushrooms and Italian sausage. Good, but compared to the others this one ended up being a little plain. Good thing they served this first. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Margherita Pizza - Again with the cherry tomatoes... nice choice, a little more mellow on the pizza. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ This was actually the most controversial dish. While the olives where a bit too much for some people the sun dried tomatoes really made it the favorite of many. Couldn't find it on the menu but it was basically olives, peppers and sun dried tomato. http://www.yelp.com/biz_ Great food, nice atmosphere, would come back if I was in the area. Only weird thing was that they have several single stall restrooms. Dunno why that stood out to me.
