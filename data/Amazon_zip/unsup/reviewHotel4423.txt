My husband and I had our wedding in the Empire Room in August. Dennis Chaffee is extremely accomodating, organized, professional, reliable, and easy to contact. He gave priceless advice. It is obvious that he is very experienced. No request was too much to ask! The majority of our guests booked rooms at the hotel- he made sure that all of the rooms were available as early as possible. The dinner was absolutely outstanding! Many of the guests remarked that it was the "best wedding food" they have ever had. We served halibut and filet. Dennis personally stayed the majority of the wedding to ensure that everything on time and running as smooth as possible. Thank you Palmer House and Dennis Chaffee! Word of advice future Palmer House brides: Be sure to book Claudia and Jane from As you Wish as your wedding planners- they are lifesavers!
