Just went for lunch. Turned out to be a really big lunch. They do have a lunch menu, but the portions were so big that only one out of five finished it all.  The food was great, excellent if you factor in that we did not wait long for our food at all. The place was not crowded (noon on a Wednesday), so that probably helped speed things up a bit. I had the gnocchi special - stuffed with asiago cheese and a little spinach with a creamy tomato sauce. Awesome. Others had the veal parm and said it was good but nothing special. The bread seemed homemade and came with the triumvirate of red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and parmesan. Mixed with olive oil, it was a treat, but probably added to the still-full feeling I have now. $14 for the lunch is not bad, especially when you factor in the service and quality. Did not take advantage of the BYOB as I was at lunch with co-workers. But good to know it is there if it is an especially stressful week. I give it 4 stars with room to grow.
