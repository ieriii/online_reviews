I am a Chicago native who defected to LA for a long time and had yet to try the legendary Jimmy John's. The truth is that each time I visited, there was just so much offered, I never got around to it. So I was anxious to try one in my new neighborhood, near Clark/Division. I have to say it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The staff was so friendly, the place was immaculate, and they have a clean bathroom. And -- they offer this great deal on bread -- I got a couple of loaves for just $.50 each ... it's great to use for all sorts of things. I wouldn't dream of trying to make my own sandwich -- I'll leave that to the pros at Jimmy John's! Oh, and they deliver! That's great to know, too!
