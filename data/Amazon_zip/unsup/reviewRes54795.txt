I visited Hopleaf a few days ago to meet a friend for dinner. The wait was over an hour long, which was ok, not ideal. They had a good beer selection in the bar area, then we found our way upstairs to wait for our table. The environment and decor made the experience worth it, but I most likely would not return. After being seated, we decided we both wanted to order the brisket. There were 2 options, a brisket sandwich and a brisket meal. The meal was just the beef with a side of their mac n cheese. The sandwich however came with fries. Well, in fears that the brisket wouldn't be good alone, I asked if I could order than sandwich with the mac n cheese.. and id idn't mind paying the difference. Nope, I had to order the mac n cheese separate, brinign my brisket sandwich meal to over $20 a plate. So I opted for just the brisket in hopes it was good..It was HORRIBLE. The meat was so dry I couldn't choke it down. With only a side of horse raddish, I ended up paying for a meal and only being able to eat the mac n cheese. If I ever return, I'll eat before i come.I guess unless you enjoy mussels, there's nothing else edible on the menu. I was very disappointed in the food. The place was cool and the server was nice.. but yeah.. they need to revisit the menu and make some changes... stat! I did tell the server.. as she could see neither of us were able to choke it down.. and they offered us a dessert.. however.. i was still hungry after dinner.
