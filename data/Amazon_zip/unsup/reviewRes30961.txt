Yea, the first time we went here we were pretty impressed and excited by the super awesome vegetarian menu. Second time we went here we were excited to show it off to our friends. Third time we were already bored of the menu (I love seitan as much as the next vegetarian but really! It doesn't actually taste like corned beef.) and the service was terrible. Fourth time? It suddenly hits us: This place is crazy expensive! A $6 milkshake?! Excuse me?!  When new people come to the city we bring them here as a fun Chicago activity. Up there with Chicago style pizza. The service has been bad a handful of times and the food just isn't that good for the price they charge.
