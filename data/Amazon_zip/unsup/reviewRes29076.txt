The food is DELICIOUS! The Prices are OUTSTANDING. The service STINKS. We decided to try this place on the recommendation of Bry H., above, who loves it, and I have to say from the dishes we had, it was truly a tasty experience. For three entrees, three thai iced teas, and an appetizer, our bill came out to $32 -- so I can't really understand how this place comes up as $$-- in my mind, this is a great deal for the quality. And for that, I will put up with the crappy service, and just chase down the waiter when I need something.  I Pad Woon Sen was a little different than I have had it before, but nonetheless, it was good. My dinner companions both went right for the Pad Thai with Chicken, and they both approved; their opinion is you can tell how a place rates by how it pulls off its Pad Thai. The Crab Rangoon was mighty tasty -- not the best I have ever had, but defiinitely not shabby, and it comes with eight pieces, perfect to split between parties of 2 or 4. The decor is classy, you can bring your own delicious and well priced alcohol, and it is a taste sensation. Now if only I could move it into where Penny's is now on Damen, life would be good -- and I wouldn't have to make every Thai craving into a pilgrimage to Lincoln Square.
