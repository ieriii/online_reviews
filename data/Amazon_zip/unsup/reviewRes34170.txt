I love this place! I use to eat here 1-2 times a week (yes, the staff knew me by name at one point). I am sad that I've moved away from here, but every time I'm in the area I stop by. The food here is amazing, and have the best pita! Their falafel is not too expensive and filling, and delicious. I've also had their zatter bread, hummus, rice with lentil, tabouli salad, and their salad bar. I have yet to be disappointed with the food thus far. There are some cons to the place but that comes with places that provide great food. They only accept cash so if you don't carry it expect to pay the fees at their ATM inside. It can be busy during peak times (lunch and dinner), but it's expected. The staff can be a little "off" but how would you act if you've been standing near hot food for a few hours with a constant flow up customers... so I'm letting that slide. Overall, this place is amazing if for nothing more than the food. Don't expect to be treated like royalty but they will respect you if you respect them. Be patient because it is a busy place, but once you taste the food you'll forget all the not-so-good things.
