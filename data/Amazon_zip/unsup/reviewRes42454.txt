I cannot stress enough how much i do not like this pho place! I am vietnamese and have had the best pho in Chicago and around the US and Vietnam! Tank doesn't taste fresh. I am not a fan of their pho at all. However, I do like that they have a wide variety of food. The bun bo hue is not all that to me either. What i would recommend is the banh xeo which is like a crepe with pork and shrimp. I would also recommend the eggrolls and spring rolls. Those usually taste pretty fresh.
