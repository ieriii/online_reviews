Looks like we made the wrong choice. I've been hearing how amazing Art of Pizza is from my friends and coworkers. Finally, we decide to try it out. Thought it would be a perfect opportunity to eat something delicious while watching the Cavs carry on their 13 game winning streak (unfortunately they lost last night). We order the stuffed (deep dish, I'm guessing), which apparently was a bad choice. The pizza looked great, but it was that buca de beppos bland taste that really kicked it all off to a bad start. Not to mention, the pizza wasn't nearly done, as you approached the middle the dough become more and more uncooked. I'd try the thin crust, but never again the stuffed.
