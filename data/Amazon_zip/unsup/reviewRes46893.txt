Uncommonly exquisite, grounds for a return trip! I've always heard great things about this place, and a brunch event gave me the chance to finally experience things for myself. Although the outside was fairly unassuming, the color scheme and furniture was quite cozy. For a Saturday, there was a decent amount of people, without being an overwhelming amount. When I brunch at a new place for the first time, I'm more "br" than "unch" most times. I elected for their braised beef hash. The meat was seasoned well, and was nice and juicy, working very seamlessly with the onions, sprouts and mushrooms. We also tried the banana bread and sweet potato fries which were quite tasty as well. Beverage-wise, you can't go wrong with their house blend coffee or any of their tea or alcoholic suggestions. I definitely want to try this place again soon, and again in the summer. It's a reasonable walk from the Loyola Red Line stop, otherwise, there is a free lot plus ample street parking in the neighborhood.
