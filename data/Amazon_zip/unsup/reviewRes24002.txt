Last night on our way home a parking place appeared on Foster Ave and we stopped. I got my husband in not becasue of the crepes but with the promise of real Turkish coffee as he remembered from his trips to Europe. His fear of not very filling food (a male definition of crepes in general) was not necessary as he had their signature crepe with lamb sausage and didn't have room for desert. I opted for the no meat option and had the Roma. My waitress was a recently graduated student of Columbia College whose portfoilio I had just reveiwed last week. We will be back for desert especially as the $28 bill was within our budget.
