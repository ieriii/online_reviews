I've been here a few times and have been happy every time! Went there for my one year anniversary with my bf and he orders a Hawaiian style steak...All I can say is that I wish I ordered it! soooo good and cooked perfectly. I also recommend the Beignets. Filling, but probably the best dessert I have ever had. The restaurant itself is very gorgeous. I could just sit in there all day! Great place for a romantic date! The only problem I can find with this place is that it is a bit pricey.
