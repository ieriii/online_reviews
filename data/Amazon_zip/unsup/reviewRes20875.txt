Great place. Great bar. Great Food. Took my wife there and before we left she was asking when we could go again. Terrific fish and chips, good salads, interesting and good wine list. First rate place. Since I began and forgot to post this review, we've been back about 4 more times, for lunch and dinner. All excellent. Good lunch burgers, in ginormous and normal sizes
