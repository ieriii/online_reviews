This is a great restaurant. We stopped on the way home from a Cubs game (yeah, yeah, I hear you Sox fans). Loved the room, but I loved the food and the staff more. Our waitress was awesome, so talkative and she brought us little extra, unless that is the norm, and we felt like it was special, Bruschetta was fresh, fruit at the end of the meal exceptional, Tortoni was heavenly. Our friend had the orange roughy, and he was very impressed. We will be back at this restaurant!!
