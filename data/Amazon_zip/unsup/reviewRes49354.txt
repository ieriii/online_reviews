Bin 36 is one of my happy places. Jimmy is my favourite bartender downtown. My advice to you, is to go in, sit at the bar in front of Jimmy, and have him create for you a wine and cheese flight. Don't tell him what you like or don't like- just let him create. You will be very very pleased.  Everything is here is delicious, from the small plates and flatbreads to the larger bistro menu. I like to keep it light and really focus on the wine- and I am so happy that you can order 1/2 glasses of anything. I never get to leave this place without buying at least two bottles of whatever i've tried.  As someone who dreams to open her own wine bar, Bin36 is an inspiration. I bring anyone from out of town here, and try to come down as often as I can from Logan Square . Absolute perfection in a wine bar.
