My husband and I had dinner at Graham Elliot last night for our first year anniversary, and I cannot say enough good things about this place. I know there are a lot of haters out there saying that it was "over-hyped" and "not what they expected from watching Top Chef Masters," but we had a fantastic meal with amazing service in the perfect ambiance. We started off the night with the foie gras lollipops. I know, they sound totally weird, but they were absolutely delicious. Yes, you can have pop rocks at a nice restaurant! I had the cheddar bacon risotto as my first course, and it was really, really good - strong bacon flavor, a nice hit of cheese, great consistency, and oh yeah, topped off with Cheez-its. The thing I enjoyed the most about our meal was the whimsy. I really liked that the chef didn't take himself so seriously. It made it so much more relaxed and fun to eat there. For entree, I had the glazed pork belly with dandelion greens & butternut squash. That piece of pork belly goes down in history as one of the best pieces of meat I have ever eaten. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and most of all - delicious. My husband had the sturgeon. It came on a bed of napa cabbage and potato puree. The flavors on his dish were totally different from mine, but just as good. For dessert, we tried the flourless chocolate cake and the caramel apples. I would recommend the cake over the apples, but both were good. I really appreciated the laid back atmosphere in the restaurant. The decor is warm and inviting, and the service was fantastic. Our server was informative without being condescending, and everyone we came in contact with seemed to really love working there. I would go back any time!
