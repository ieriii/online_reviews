so Daniela from Fogo actually messaged me after my review to explain why my kibe and coxinha weren't as delicious as I'd hoped. She also said that the next time I order, I could get 2 sides on the house. :) I super appreciate a business that tries really hard and is appreciative of criticism. So of course I had to call back and order again! This time I went with my guts and got the chicken, black beans & rice, potato salad and an x-large chicken club pizza. The roasted chicken...O.M.G. that was soo delicious. So much roasting juice. Every bite was flavorful, even the crappy breast pieces were delectable! I don't think I can ever go back to a Jewel chicken after this! The black beans and rice were good, but nothing compared to the chicken. The chicken club pizza was pretty good, lots of avocado, chicken and tons of bacon. However I wish I'd gotten a different pizza since the x-large is extra extra huge and I have half a pizza left. The lettuce and avocado on top of the pizza make it kind of hard to reheat. Maybe next time I'll just get a mushroom and spicy sausage pizza...AND a whole chicken. That sounds like the no-fail order.
