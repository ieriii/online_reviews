If you like tender beef dishes, get the Ropa Vieja, served with white rice, black beans and fried plantains. The meat just falls apart from hours and hours of slow cooking. Very, very good. I have had other entrees here, but keeping coming back to the Ropa Vieja. Better for dinner, brunch is only so-so.
