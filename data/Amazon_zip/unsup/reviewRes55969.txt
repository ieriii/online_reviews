Too much grease, butter, fat in gnocchi. I could only eat a third of my plate. When I nukes left overs, a pool of oil appeared and each gnocchi I picked up was dripping in oil/butter. The plate was easily 5,000 calories. Fresh garlic served with bread. Yes, tastes nice as long as you are going straight home alone. The dessert was nice....a mango gelatin that was surprisingly light. The only thing that stood out. Nice servers but completely un-impressive.
