Just how much meat can a person eat? I really do like this place though, but it's just SO expensive! $3 for each soda fill.. sigh. Come on.. Mediocre sides.. fried bananas and mashed potatoes. A bit salty but good. The meat at Fogo is delicious but again a bit on the salty side. They do have an excellent salad bar. Their scary super-sized vegetables scared me off at first but everything is fresh and delicious. But who goes to Fogo for their salad? On my visit here I came with a large party. When our bill came it took us awhile to divide the tab accordingly. As we started to collect everyone's money we realized there were several drinks in there we did not order.  Later it turned out they had added someone else's bar tab onto our bill! That really put us off and the manager comped us four drinks (out of the 10+ we ordered) Other than that, pretty decent experience. I just don't think I'd go back because of the price.
