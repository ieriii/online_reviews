I live in Portland, Oregon and hear all the time that we're the cheapest city for food in the history of the world. A recent trip to Chicago is making me question the validity of that claim. Straight up, I cruised into Sultan's Market and got a big ass falafel sandwich for $4. This is a brick and mortar business, not a food cart. $4. HUGE. And it was awesome. I'm not typically a big fan of falafel but a homey said come here and I obeyed and the results were more than gratifying.
