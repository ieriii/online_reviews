Mmmmm duck fat fries. Yes, it sounds gross, but they are so yumming delicious! I had the gyro doug and it was really good. They have some interesting dougs like the britney spears and elvis costello which are all custom made. The service is fast once you get inside (the wait can be really long) and Doug is always there to greet you! A Chicago classic.
