I've been to Geja's thrice, most recently for my unofficial anniversary last night. I'm still kind of full this morning! Considering all the reviews this place has, I doubt I could really add anything new, so I'll keep this review brief. You're welcome. Great ambiance, great service. Pricey food, but lots of it. You can't possibly leave here hungry! I wish they had some more variety, like the Melting Pot has. But I still like the overall experience at Geja's better. You will leave smelling like oil. Complimentary coat check, so your coat won't. Good, reasonably-priced wine list, a few specialty cocktails. If you don't want to cook your own food...don't go to a fondue place.
