So excited to go to this place! The veggie potstickers were absolutely fantastic! I got the ravoli and it was awesome- it was decently proportioned and came with delicious garlic bread. I'm a new non-meat eater so this place made it easier for me to eat what I like....it also doesn't help that I'm lactose intolerant....so technically a vegan..... Anyways! This place is great and should definitely be given a try. Went with a meat-eating friend and they weren't too enthusized but said it was 'pretty good'. They have great drinks and even vegan/vegetarian/gluten free food and desserts! The place is small so you may have to wait, but it's worth it!
