Such a great experience! My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary dinner this year and had an amazing and romantic time. Our waiters were so attentive and the food was phenomenal. For starters my boyfriend ordered the Pho, so delicious and worth going to Le Colonial for alone! I had the tuna tartare (Ca Song) which was very light and refreshing. For our entrees I had the roasted duck (Vit Quay) and he had the stir-fried shrimp, scallops, calamari, & mixed vegetables (Mi Xao Do Bien) both were great and I highly recommend the duck if you don't get to eat duck very often. The tamarind dipping sauce is divine!  The atmosphere is dark and romantic, themed pretty well with hints of Vietnam and France (mostly the service and presentation) all in one. Although I can't afford to come here every week or month or even every six months I would say it's worth trying at least once while you're in Chicago.  One thing I wish I would have tried... the dessert! I have only heard great things about it (especially on here). Until next time Le Colonial!
