My friend and I walked in around 7:30 on a Tuesday and Pequod's was really busy...luckily we snagged the last open table. The waitresses and owner were running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to deliver perfect service. In that quest, the owner yelled multiple times at our waitress and we felt bad, because she was obviously busting her butt trying to get to all her tables...that's my reason for 4 stars instead of 5. We actually didn't have pizza, so I'll have to go back soon. I had ravioli and it was great. My friend had some sort of sandwich...I don't remember what it was, but he loved it. Even though it was busy, we never felt rushed. I'm excited to go back and try the pizza next time.
