We were starving and had intense cravings for Middle Eastern food, and just so happened to be conveniently driving through this area. We settled on this place, and in the end I was glad we did. We walked in, got seated immediately with some warm pitas and cheese. We enjoyed great service, and took in the lovely decor - they have some beautiful mosaics on the walls and exotic artwork in the back room. Then when our food came, we barely said anything throughout the meal because we were too busy enjoying our food - our dishes were so freakin' good. The dill rice, the roasted tomatoes, the kabobs...everything was amazing.
