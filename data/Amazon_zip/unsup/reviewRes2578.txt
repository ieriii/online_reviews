Absolutely as good as it gets, waited about an hour and a half at lunch time (and missed the first part of the cubs game we had tickets to), but it was well worth it. A perfectly executed Chicago style hot dog, great spicy fire dog, and my first experience with Foie Gras went over extraordinarily well with the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris dog. My girlfriend had the best of this meal with the Chicken Mole dog. Oh and the duck fat fries, mmm. Top 3 meals of my life. The only reason i would not recommend Hot Doug's is so the line is shorter for me.
