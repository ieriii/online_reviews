Went here specifically for the gluten free menu. Their gluten free pizza is't Chicago style (deep dish), it's New York style (flat and thin). And unfortunately, it TASTES gluten-free (some restaurants have perfected the art of not making meals taste gluten-free, but this one has not).  Although I recommend the restaurant as a whole (good atmosphere, good service, good food for those not allergic to gluten), I'm not impressed at all with the gluten-free bread they bring to your table (it tastes gluten-free) and their gluten-free pizza (it shoud be deep dish or at least have the decency of having more tomatoe sauce so you don't taste the gluten free pizza crust so much)--so I'm giving it 2 stars.
