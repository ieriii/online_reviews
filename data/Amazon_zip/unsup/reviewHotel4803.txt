I decided to take my mother to the rooftop bar at the wit on mother's day for a few cocktails. i wanted her to see a trendy boutique hotel such as the wit. we first sat down in the middle of the rooftop area. there were some stool-level gas heat lamp-type things. a server approached us but we weren't ready. we then decided the smell of the gas was uncomfortable, so we took a seat at the bar on the far end. it wasn't open but there were plenty of available stools and there was already 1 other gentleman there. upon switching seats, i notified our cocktail waitress and she said something like 'that's fine. someone should be w you shortly'... after 10 mins, no one came. we proceeded to move indoors because of nobody coming and it got cold. another 10 mins went by and it wasn't until i made eye contact w the manager on duty that i then saw him asking 'are those 2 being taken care of?' to a waitress... 1st round of drinks was fine. we had the prosecco w grenadine... too much grenadine at the bottom of the glass but it was ok. i had a glass of prosecco as my second and it was FLAT. there were barely any bubbles. i was completely dissatisfied, however i didn't complain. i'm now writing this review on here to share my unpleasant experience. the space was cute. the over-head lighting in the indoor portion of the rooftop was kind of tacky. i think a more glamorous, edgy chandelier would be more appropriate than those LED lights. i don't recommend going to the rooftop... may i sugguest the terrace at trump? cocktails are $12 at the wit versus $14 at the trump, a whopping $2 difference. also, the view of the river, navy pier, and various skyscrapers is stunning. there really is no comparing. the wit is edgy and the trump is a little more sophisticated... however, the terrace isn't a suit & tie environment. when considering everything (drinks, prices, views, facility), the wit can't compare to the terrace at trump
