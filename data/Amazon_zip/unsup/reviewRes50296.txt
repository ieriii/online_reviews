On most weekends, my bf and I love the idea of having brunch outdoors with a pleasant view, while sipping a glass of wine and partaking in people watching (including dogs) like other carefree diners. It goes without saying that we are committed to contributing our time and efforts, specifically referring to our travel time from point A to point B. In this case, Big Jones was one of the restaurants that took us 45 minutes in total train and walk time to arrive there. First, I have to say that I was pretty surprised with the classy layout of the restaurant. Nothing like I expected. The next good impression was made by the host at the entrance. He was nice enough to accomodate to my requests to be seated by the glass window, despite the fact that it was a busy lunch time and only limited tables available. I liked everything about the place but not so much the food that I ordered, which was the Gumbo Ya-Ya. But just to be clear, there wasn't anything wrong with the food and it was entirely my personal dislikes for the dark, smoky roux in my dish. It had a salty and slightly burned flavor to it and my bf thought the same, so we ended up adding a few tablespoons of water to make it less salty. However, the shrimp and grits from the brunch platter tasted pretty good and worth a try. If you're wondering, my bad meal at Big Jones did not affect my decision to give this place another chance. But just not anytime soon as I've more restaurant pit stops ahead!
