Food was great again but the service was awful. Any time we ordered a drink or coffee at the end, everything took at least 15 minutes. I don't mind sitting at a restaurant and not being rushed, but an expensive restaurant like carnivale needs to do a better job of accommodating certain requests faster. Many other reviews say the same thing: the food is great but the service sucks.
