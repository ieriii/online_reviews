I happened to be in town when they announced they were voted best chicken in America last year. Came...sign on the door says they ran out of food and would open back up in a few hours. Time flies and it was worth it. Tried the buddha bowl + chicken wings. Extremely tasty, sauced correctly, bigger, and whatever adjective you want to insert here. Staff was cool and friendly. Very upfront about the wait and told plenty of jokes to ease the then frantic atmosphere. Wish I brought some for the plane ride back home to LA. I'll make sure I come here when I'm in town again.
