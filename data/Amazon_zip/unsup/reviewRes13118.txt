Glenn's is a very good seafood and cereal restaurant...yes cereal. I've never had a bowl of captain crunch with my ginger soy glazed mahi mahi, but it is indeed an option for all diners at Glenn's. Also, they are a Ravenswood BYOB gem! They have a great dinner menu. I have dined here a number of times and the food is always consistenly good, the fish very fresh! Tasty sides like oven roasted potatoes and asparagus. The service is always very gracious. In winter months there can be a bit of a wait on weekend nights, but the fare is worth it. Generous portions, big enough for two. Leave room for dessert! They do a fairly bustling breakfast biz here too. Good omlettes, fishy egg dishes, and of course cereal. Between very good fish and offering at least 20 different breakfast cereals, Glenn's Diner has it covered!
