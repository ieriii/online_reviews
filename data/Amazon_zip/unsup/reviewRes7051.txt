My boyfriend insisted that I give Q one last chance, and I am glad we did. I had previously complained about problems with their service, but they have hit their stride. My reservation was found immediately and we were seated right away. The waiter came and took drink orders within 5 minutes. Excellent. The waiter was able to give a wine recommendation, and drink arrived promptly. I like that they give you pickles and chips to nibble on. The first thing we noticed is that the chips have gotten so much better. They are packed with spicy barbeque flavor. It is a great first impression of the food. As others have noted, Q isn't a traditional BBQ joint. It is more like a steakhouse both in atmosphere and presentation. The sides are a la carte, and it has a much classier decor than any BBQ place I have previously been to. So know what you expect. I ordered an appetizer as my main course. I chose the BBQ trio which has tastings of the pulled pork, pulled chicken, and bbq kobe brisket. The three signature sauces are on the side. It is definitely a solid amount of food, and a fun way to try a little of everything. My boyfriend got the q2, which is an insane amount of food, yet he ate most of it. He is a fan of the ribs, which is how he got me to give the place another try. I like to steal the spicy fries that are on the side. For sides we got the greens and mac and cheese. Personally, I am not into greens, but my boyfriend and friends like Q's quite a bit. The mac and cheese is good, it has quite a bit of spice to it. Overall, my Q experiences have proved to me that sometimes it takes a new restaurant a little while to get going. They have worked really hard to improve, and it shows. These are people who really care about the quality of the service and food, and I really appreciate that. I also notice that they have prepared a large area for outdoor seating in the summer. It looks like it is going to be great.
