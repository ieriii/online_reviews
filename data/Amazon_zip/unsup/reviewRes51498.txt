Upon speaking with one of the servers I have come to find out that the chips they serve are NOT gluten free. (Cross contamination from other gluteny items fried in the same oil.) However, if you explain your restrictions and ask politely they may not have a problem with you bringing in your own! I also now stick to tacos on corn tortillas just to be safe.
