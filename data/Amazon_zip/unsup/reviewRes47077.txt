I love that this restaurant has great food, great drinks, and still feels like your friendly neighborhood restaurant. It's an easygoing atmosphere and the food is delicious. I highly recommend the seared duck breast, which three of my four friends also ordered and raved about. Our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly and provided some nice insights on their craft beer selection.
