Tips for brunch at The Gage: 1. You will not need a reservation at 11 on a Saturday, even the weekend before Christmas. You may, however, need one at 12. 2. Request a table near the front so that you can enjoy the space brightened by natural light. I've always been fond of their aesthetic, but sunlight brings an unexpectedly freshening and comforting quality. 3. The brunch menu is modest, even a little boring; but the lunch menu looks much like the dinner menu only with more sandwiches. Order from the lunch menu. 4. If you insist upon a brunch item, get the biscuits and gravy. Oh yes, do. 5. Want a healthy starter? How about the enormous plate of fresh fruit. Even in December you will find watermelon, strawberries, and blueberries at summer quality, not to mention honeydew cubes, raspberries, peeled orange slices, and something akin to a dark pink, non-tart grapefruit. Oh, there's yogurt and granola on that plate too, but the fruit is by far the visual and gustatory star of that scene. 6. The omelette might be a little blas, but the handsome cast-iron dish of delicious crispy, garlicky potatoes redeems it considerably.  7. If you like the lunch menu, start with some soup; with luck they'll offer the parsnip puree that you had never realized was the perfect December afternoon soup. 8. Pair that soup with a scotch egg for one of the best first courses you can imagine. It may almost sadden you to move on to the main dish, but chances are strong that you've made another fine choice and will not be disappointed. 9. Open your visit with a Guinness. If you're brunching during the holiday season, close it with an Affligem Nol. If you happen to miss the Nol, I'm sure that they will have another excellent beer to tie a perfect bow on your marvelous brunch.
