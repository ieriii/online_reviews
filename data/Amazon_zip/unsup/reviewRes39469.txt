There has been some vegetarian chatter on here, so I just want to speak for the non meat eaters and say the waitstaff had no issues with making me Bi Bim Bop with no beef (basically a veggie stir fry, with egg, in a hot pan - only $6.95). There were lots of interesting veggies floating around, just have a meaty person try some of the questionables out. Maybe they will even share the soup and rice that comes with their meal. You can't be too sensitive though, as I watched baby octopus burn right before my very eyes tonight. Yeah, maybe not ideal for vegetarians but it was my good friend's birthday. Oh and Korean beer (BO) and sake rules. Staff was friendly to us, even when we had to wait a half hour for our whole party to arrive. Thanks to Bette for the food suggestion, and to the person who mentioned wearing nice socks.
