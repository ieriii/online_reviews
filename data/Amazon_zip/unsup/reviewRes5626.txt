horrible experience! food was only mediocre.. server Kelly needs to go! if you're in a large group she's the person to go to, if its only a couple you're screwed.. she just doesn't give a damn about you. 20mins in still didnt get to order.. had to talk to the hostess to find out who was my waitress.. after she took my order.. that was the last time i saw her.. she never came back to check up on us to see how we're doing.. oh she did come back to pick up the check.. lol.. anyway i ordered the pork shoulder -- well cooked very tender.. but the portion was too small for a main.. it was more like an appetizer.. this place is all hype.. our waitress did not care for us so i did not care for her.. only paid for our meal and left.
