Amazing. It is expensive, but occasionally I would go. It is worth it. They bring in many cuts of meat when you turn your coaster green. The meat is so juicy and tender. They also bring you unlimited mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and little bread puffs. This is probably my favorite restaurant when I want meat. Their salad bar is fancy as well, but I would only get a little bit so that you have ample room for the meat.
