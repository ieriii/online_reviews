I was underwhelmed. For all the rave reviews this place gets, I was disappointed w what I found to be just mediocre Italian food. The owners/chefs are from Mia Francesca group and I really wish we'd have gone there (even though I've been a dozen times) instead. The only two things that really stood out were the bruschetta and the black pepper and cheese spaghetti. I don't like mushrooms so I was hesitant about the bruschetta. But I gave it a shot anyway and I might just be a mushroom convert now. Sooo good. The Pepe e Cacio spaghetti was amazing. There was not enough of it for two people, though, as promised by our server. (Or maybe we just wanted more because it was the only main dish with any true flavor?) The salad was good, light. Had apples sliced very thin to add some much needed taste to an otherwise bland dressing. The pork belly was fine but it's pork belly. How is that just fine?? The polenta is too creamy, created a mess, and lacked any kind of flavor at all. My grandmother was from Italy do maybe my polenta expectations are too high but I was really underwhelmed by that polenta. But the meat ragu they put on top was killer, so points for that. The risotto carbonara was, frankly, inedible. Points for presentation (they break the egg over it right at the table and mix) but wow was it wayyyy too rich and the sauce was wayyy too heavy. Had two bites and had to stop. It was also LOADED w salt so you could barely taste anything else in the dish. Dessert (a sort of cloudless chocolate cake) was fine but nothing I'd order a second time or even recommend to a chocolate lover. Points for great service, an amazing wine list and for it being fairly inexpensive for all you get. That said, $120 for mediocre food for 2 is $100 too much.
