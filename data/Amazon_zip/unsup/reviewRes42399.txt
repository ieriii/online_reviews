ah... pho xe tang... seriously, this was a blackhole location there restaurants just cannot survive, but pho xe tang changed up the location of the doors and that may have done something to the feng shui... the service isn't the best in town, but most ppl don't each in argyle for the service. the food is true viet and cheap... pho and mi xao do bien (pan fried wide noodles with seafood) was the bomb.
