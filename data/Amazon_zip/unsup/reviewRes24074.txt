I went here for the second time yesterday. Since the first time I'd been there I had been salivating for a second visit. After sitting down they place a plate of cabbage in a spicy chili sauce on the table. This will never cease to delight me. For an appetizer we started with the 'Never Forget Chicken'. While difficult to eat because of the many bones, it's well worth it. The chicken is tender and seasoned with an unidentifiable spice that required me to down an entire glass of water while eating my portion. For my entree I got the szechuan tea steamed duck (something like that), but it was a tad disappointing. The duck was nearly dry and didn't have much flavor. I wish I had ordered my steamed chicken in onion broth, as that was delicious last time. I sampled the other two dishes my party got and they were both delicious; basil chicken and the lalala. This place is one I suggest everyone try because of the exotic menu, the quick preparation, and the tastiness of the food. They have a great selection for vegetarians as well. For the record, they do have non-spicy menu options, but this is definitely a place for seekers of spice.
