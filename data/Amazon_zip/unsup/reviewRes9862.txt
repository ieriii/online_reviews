Le Colonial gets an A for atmosphere. I liked having the choice of eating upstairs or downstairs. My friends and I ate on the patio upstairs. The wine and booze was flowing so I was pretty buzzed by the time we ate our entrees. Lots of interesting dishes and desserts from what I remember and the service was good. Didn't get to see the bill but I'm sure it was astronomical. Great date spot.
