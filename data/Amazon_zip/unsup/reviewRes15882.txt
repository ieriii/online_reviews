You look like a small box from the outside...... Upon arrival I was thinking... IS THIS IT????? It looks kinda small from the outside... little did I know I was to stumble upon a HUGE decorative, festive restaurant! I absolutely love the decor. "Carnival" inspired for real! The ambiance is soooo unique, FUN & VIBRANT! My friend and I had reservations on a Friday night at 8:30pm. The wait wasn't long and we started off with drinks. The bartender didn't even card me.... hmm, that was the first.... We were seated on the balcony. The view of the entire restaurant from the balcony was fantastic! I kept admiring the decor.... couldn't get enough of it! For appetizers, my friend and I ordered Tacos de Pascados (it comes in 3) I've never had fish tacos before and this one tasted better than I expected. I honestly say now that I prefer fish tacos over regular tacos anyday! We loveee seafood, so we ordered Chupe de Mariscos. The blend and quality of the seafood was delish! On the side we also ordered rice and beans - no need to order two because one order was enough to feed two people! Fabulous food, beautiful decor, and great service!
