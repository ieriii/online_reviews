Went her for my fianc's birthday. We told our waitress it was his birthday but there was no cake or anything. Had the signature martini flight. I'd definitely order that again. The corn chowder was delicious. The potato's au gratin were a little salty. The steak was tender and had a great crust. The flour less chocolate cake was great but could use a little more ice cream on top. I'd go back but I don't think it would be my first choice in choosing a steakhouse again. Ambiance: It was a little cramped in the dining area we sat it but noise level was moderate.
