I have been going to the Diner pretty regularly since 1992 and obviously the menu and staff (management) have changed over the years. The food is good but not always great, but what can you expect from a diner? It is not pretending to be a four-star restaurant or anything! Since I've been hardcore vegan for many, many years it is great to go somewhere where I can actually eat about 90% of the food on the menu -- as opposed to less than 10% at most places. I especially love their deserts (e.g., chocolate chip tofu cheesecake), but I won't stay too long to eat when it gets too noisy in there ... okay, okay, it IS a diner ... so I guess I won't complain too much ...
