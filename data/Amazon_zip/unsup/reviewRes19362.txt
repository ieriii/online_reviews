I don't eat a lot of fried foods, but there's a special place in my heart for good Fish and Chips. At Gage you will find that it is about as good as it gets! They use vodka in the batter so it evaporates faster when cooked locking in the juices and giving your the crispiest coated, moistest and tenderest cod fish ever. Fries are crispy and yummy.  I also tried the Gage Fondue which was really good. If I didn't know it was a gazillion calories I would have eaten the whole thing.  Finally, the service and management of the restaurant is excellent. At least 3 times a manager came to me during the meal to say hello and ask how I was doing. My waitress was always there when I needed her.
