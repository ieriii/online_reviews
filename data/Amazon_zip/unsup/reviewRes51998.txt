I remember going to the original Superior St. location when I was 10. I remember the place looked like a dump. Dingy walls with grafitti strewn everywhere. I was amazed that we were actually allowed to tag the walls. I read some of the writing. People came from all over the country and left their mark. Do they still let you do that? I know other locations try to mimic this, but it's never the same as the original. The place was started by a couple of Chicago taxi drivers in the 60's. How much more authentic can you get? The pizza is excellent, and like I always say, the crust defines the pizza. If the crust isn't good, the pizza isn't good. Gino's crust is cornmeal based (or so I heard on a television special about pizza), giving it a unique texture and helping it to stay firm. The deep dish is awesome, and if you're a fan of a lot of meat, I would suggest the sausage patty. The entire pizza is covered with a giant layer of italian sausage. Sounds like a lot, but it's awesome. The wait time is a little much downtown during peak hours. But there are other locations in the Chicago area that also deliver. I've had their pizza delivered, and it's just not the same as actually going there and having one freshly made.
