This was a whole new very cool experience for me. This is the kind of stuff I live for. Wow, I sound a little over excited but new and different food is Fun! So i had no idea what to expect. We looked at the menu and fumbled our way to the BBQ. I knew I wanted the fire pit at my table. My friend steps away and I ordered the chicken and the short ribs to the servers recommendation. So then I am sitting there alone and a woman comes by and unloads a million little dishes of mystery foods all over the table. What's going on? Did I order this? I guess I did. Another woman must have noticed our bewilderment so she came along and asked if this was our first time and started explaining the deal. You grill your wonderfully seasoned meat and then one way to go is to take a large lettuce leaf and add meat and the mystery foods from the little dishes on and eat it like a wrap or you can just pick at stuff. The little dishes are filled with thing that I have no idea of the name. It were good though! Some of the things I recognized was black beans, bean sprouts, kimchee, broccoli... It was super fun and oh sooooo tasty!
