For me it is all about the short-rib sandwich. Really one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. And yes, I say "sandwich," because it is served on French bread baked in Chicago, which is an English-speaking city. I also do not ask for the "Gunthorp chicken." I do not want anything called "Gunthorp" on my sandwich. I do not say all of this because I am an ignorant, anti-green, gringo with a limited cultural viewpoint, but because I feel that there is a fair bit of pretention that goes into this joint, and that that pretension directly effects the prices; prices which mean that I can only eat lunch here once a month, even though I work two blocks away. So I say a big fuck you to the bratty white culinary school cashier who always corrects me by saying "you mean on your torta?" when I ask for the short rib sandwich. If we were in Mexico, or even in a Mexican restaurant in a Mexican neighborhood, I would of course have the respect to ask for a torta, and I would use my best spanglish to do so. But this is not a place that was made for people in Pilsen or other any other Spanish-speaking barrio in Chicago- and little could most people in these neighborhoods -much like myself- afford this unfortunately titled cuisine. This place was made for yuppies and business people -mostly gringos- who inhabit one of the richer areas of the city. And I doubt that Rick Bayless grew up asking his mommy for "tortas y caldo." What great food, but please, LOSE THE FUCKING PRETENSION!
