YES! This is the real deal my friends. I grew up eating Cuban food and this place is like mom's cooking. I am so happy I found it AND it's close to where I live. I've made it my personal mission to try every Cuban restaurant in Chicago. 90 Miles is hands down my new Cuban go-to. I can't wait to take my mom here when she's in town. Other recommendations: Cafe Laguardia or Cafe Bolero for a nice sit down dinner. 90 Miles for a fantastic grab-and-go lunch or dinner.
