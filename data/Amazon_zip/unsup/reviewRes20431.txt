This place makes me go WOO! So damn good. Went for lunch today, a Wednesday, at 12:30PM. There was about a 15 minute wait to get a seat, which was shorter than I expected for the first warm day of Spring. Start to finish, lunch took up about an hour. I had the AMAZING Ahogada (dine-in menu item only). Now I can't imagine getting anything other than this when I come back. A crispy wood-fired torta filled with pork and pickled onions, cut in half, and served in a bowl of spicy tomato broth goodness. You dip and eat, dip and eat. Phenomenal. SO Delicious!! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I know this is a small detail, but they have a self-serve water "station" with still and sparking water, an ice bucket and limes. Such a nice touch and much appreciated! Ended the meal with churros and a shot of the house chocolate. I'm not sure if I have ever had churros before. Now I can't imagine eating any other churros other than Xoco's. They are that good people! Pry yourself away from the daily grind and eat here for the perfect lunch experience!
