So, 5 stars for the EXCELLENT Boarding House lunch. 3 Stars for the mediocre service. Our server only paid attention to us when we first placed our drink and food order, and then not again unless prompted (which is curious, because one of us DID want to order another drink. Hello, you lose out on sales if you don't check in, AND make it hard for us to get your attention). There was a 45 minute wait for the entire meal, which I wish I would have known up front, as we brought my not-quite-7-month-old baby along. Luckily, he was a champ, and behaved for the entire 2+ hours we were there, but seriously? I felt bad that we were taking up a table for so long, but we had no choice. We could have changed our order, but when you want fried chicken, nothing else will do. So, be forewarned - expect to wait for your food. The Fried Chicken and the delicious sides are worth the wait. The dessert was a dry pound cake with a scoop of ice cream. We were stuffed, so it wasn't a huge deal, but the people to the right of us had the same dessert and their pound cake pieces were significantly larger than ours. Just saying. Also, we had to ask about the biscuits, which ended up being corn muffins in the end, but came after some prodding. As did serving spoons for the sides.  All in all, we'll still come back for the fried chicken. We are going to try to mention that we want the Boarding House lunch when we make the reservation. Maybe that will speed things along.
