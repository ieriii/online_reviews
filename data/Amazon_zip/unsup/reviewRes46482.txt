Was at a regatta near the zoo and the food selection area wasn't great so we just got some fries to-go from here. Fries came out luke-warm and pale... I'm not afraid of some oil, guys, I ORDERED JUST FRIES, I think I can take it. And as I entered, the revolving door ruined my sandals because some crazy guy came barreling out of there like an asshole. Most expensive lackluster fries I've ever had.
