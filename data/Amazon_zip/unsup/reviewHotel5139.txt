The room was ok and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (20th floor). But a little dated. The wireless internet didn't work at all. Service at the front desk was cool. I also enjoyed the Skyline Bar. I like the complementary buffet. Parking was pricey but so is the rest of Downtown Chicago.A few complaints -- the "Business Center" was horrible and charge per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. Also wanted you to swipe your credit card for a $40.00 hold that was unrealistic
