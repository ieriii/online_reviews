This is plain and simple a fabulous place for breakfast. The set up is the counter order, take a number and find a seat. As annoying as it can sometimes feel to wait in line, order then sit, this place is worth it. A solid bakery plus cafe, this place serves Intelligentsia coffee, has amazing breakfast items like waffles, pancakes, kick ass granola and even breakfast specials I sampled a mouth watering almond, chocolate chip, ricotta coffee cake as a prelude to my granola and yogurt breakfast. I remembered seeing something like fig and walnut pancakes or some crazy combo like that when I was there. Family/kid friendly, bright, casual atmosphere. Would go back in a heartbeat to sample more from their menu. Toronto is missing a breakfast/brunch/bakery place like this. Milk and honey cafe would do a killing here.
