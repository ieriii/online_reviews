Love this place! I read about it on yelp and since it's super close to my old apartment my boyfriend took me here for my birthday.We went on a Saturday and it was super busy! I'm really glad we thought ahead to make a reservation because I think I overheard someone being told the wait was about an hour.. at 7pm. We were seated in the back room, which was slightly quieter than the front room confusion but as our meal progressed the back room also became very busy and super loud. However, the food was so good I am willing to forgive the fact that I couldn't hear anyone, much less our very nice waitress. We ordered the calamari as our appetizer, and you are now warned- it is huge! I was so full from this that I could barely eat any of my pasta. My boyfriend had.. a meat dish that he said was one of the best meals of his life. (Both of our dishes were from the seasonal menu). Couldn't make it through the entire tiramisu, but it was wonderful. My boyfriend had let them know ahead of time that we were celebrating my birthday and they printed out special menus for us that said Happy birthday, Elizabeth at the top. It was a nice touch. At the end of the meal you can also sign up for their mailing list, and they send coupons which will definitely come in handy for the many more times we will surely go.
