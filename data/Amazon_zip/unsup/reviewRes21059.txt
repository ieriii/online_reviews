I walked in with my expectations sky high. Xoco is, after all, the brainchild of Chicago's Mexican food maestro, Rick Bayless. The food surpassed those expectations by leaps and bounds. I consider myself something of a torta connoisseur and the one I devoured that night (the divine Milanesa) was easily the best one I'd ever had. My friends and I passed all of our tortas back and forth, pretty much everyone got something completely different & it was truly a joy to sample little bits from many different tortas and caldos. We washed it all down with a generous helping of churros and hot chocolate-- the perfect cap to the evening.
