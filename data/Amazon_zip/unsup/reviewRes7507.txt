4.5 for the food, 4 for the ambiance and 2 for the service. Not what I would expect in this price range. I took my girlfriend there for her birthday. When I made the reservation they asked if there was any special occasion I was celebrating and I told them. I was expecting they asked because they were planning on bringing out a dessert for her and wish her happy birthday or even putting a little card on the table like they do at some nice restaurants. The fact that they did nothing was just a small let down in a series of them at this place. Our waiter was not good. It took forever for us to be able to order our food and drinks. After 5-10 minutes he stopped by and apologized and said that he would be with us soon. He was one of the least attentive waitstaff I have ever had. We had to ask for the wet towels at the end because we were already paying our bill, they were nowhere in sight and our hands were sticky. The food was good and I love a good barbecue. If you do go be sure to get the sampler starter and make sure it includes the beef brisket. I actually prefer it in the chopped up form that comes with the starter rather than the main dish. All said, I would much rather go to Fat Willy's and get equally good barbecue, with much better service at a lower price.
