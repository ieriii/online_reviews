Very good burgers that come on pretzel buns! I had the Lockdown Warden ($14), and it was so flavorful but messy! We also shared the cheese/chorizo/peppers dip with our group of 7 and barely finished it - that thing is huge. Next time, I'm going to try the kimchee burger and the build your own mac and cheese. Yes, there are parallel similarities to Kuma's... both have very decadent burgers, restaurant themes (heavy metal vs jail house), build your own mac & cheeses, the pretzel buns... but there was no wait at Lockdown when we came here on a Sunday for dinner, while there is usually a very long wait at Kuma's.
