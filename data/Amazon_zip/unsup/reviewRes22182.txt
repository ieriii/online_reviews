Superdawg Drive in is done in the style of the old 50s drive ins. You drive up to a station and park your car, order your food, and they bring it out to you on a tray that sits on your window. And not only is the food great, but the presentation is some of the most fun I have seen. The hot dogs come in great boxes with fun things to read. Each hot dog comes with fries and what ever condiments you desire, except ketchup. I would highly recommend the hot dogs, but the burgers and shakes are also excellent. I love the feeling of sitting in a car with the windows down waiting for food. It makes me feel as if I'm in a time warp and am sitting in a bit of the 50s. And the signs! Anyone who has been there will probably never forget the hot dog man and woman who stand on top of the place. Classic. This is a great, fun, and pretty unique place to visit in the city of Chicago.
