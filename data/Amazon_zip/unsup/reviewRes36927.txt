The boyfriend took me here on our very first date, almost a year ago, and we came back to visit last weekend. We happen to be beer snobs, so the extensive beer selection at Hopleaf makes for great drinking (and spending more money than planned). They've added a new addition next door which was very much needed- Nicely done and huge improvement in the quality of space! A couple more bartenders to handle the customers at the bar and throughout the restaurant would be great. We sat at the bar for awhile, and when the restaurant started to pick up I was hesitant to ask the bartender for anything as he was busy handling other customers coming up to the bar. The food was wonderful!! Very gourmet. Yum-o! I highly recommend this place, primarily to anyone that truly has a passion for beer.
