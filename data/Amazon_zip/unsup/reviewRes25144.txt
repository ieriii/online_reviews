Fondue? More like FUN-due!  Went here on a Saturday night, had a great experience. I was able to book reservations the day before for 9pm through opentable. We arrived a little late, and there was a big crowd - but despite the busy atmosphere the staff seemed to have everything under control. We were welcomed to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to get ready.  Within 5 minutes we were seated in a cozy booth. Our waiter was friendly and informative, and clearly explained all the choices available. I went with the seafood package, which included scallops and shrimp. The fruit, bread and cheese starter really hit the spot. The second course meat was fresh, delicious, and the veggies were extra tasty. The chocolate desert was a perfect cap on the night.  It IS really dark in there, but I felt that only added to the experience. Also, my shirt still smelled like scallops the next morning, so if you're going out for drinks to another establishment after dinner, bring your fabreeze! This isn't a place you'll want to go every weekend - but if you're looking for a unique dining experience and are in the mood for some adventure, give Geja's a shot.
