If your looking for a good Costa Rican Restaurant, then this is a great option. Before we went, I called to see if they were BYOB and they are. I was surprised that it was not mentioned in other reviews. At least the ones I looked through. Reasonably priced. Indoor or outdoor seating is available. Their dishes are full of flavor. Service is good. Oatmeal shake is awesome. I always get on to go as I am leaving. You have to try it.
