Honestly my favorite place to eat. It can get pricey, but its one of the few places where I feel I always get my money's worth. The staff, all of them, from the hostesses to the owner, managers to the head chef to the bus boys are unbelievable. They remember who I am and and what I like. They offer great suggestions, and I always love what I get. I am going to miss living so close when I move next month, but fortunately I will work nearby. The food is so fun! The drinks are thoughtful and super tasty, and the beer, wine, & spirits lists are exhaustive! I've been on holidays (Valentine's Day, etc) when they have special menus and the dishes & drinks are great. I've also been to special beer & food pairings which were impressive and educational. And it is one of the only places where I always order dessert, even though I would usually have something less sweet. Their soups are always on point as well. I will continue to advise locals & out-of-towners to go to the Gage. I will also continue to take my friends, coworkers, whoever I can get a hold of to the Gage. Absolutely love it!
