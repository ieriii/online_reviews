I've never felt so cool for $15! What a fun place...romantic, unique, a little exotic and maybe a little trendy---but with a timeless vibe. You might come by dressed to impress like the suave doorman or your beautiful server in a little black dress. Or you might just come in your hipster gear if you live in the neighborhood and still feel like a man in your skinny jeans. Hope you like egg whites in your cocktail! There's stuff on this menu I've never seen before - not that I'm some expert - but it's really fun to try new drinks. Don't go to get drunk - you'll miss the atmosphere and might ruin it for others. There's a line by 9. Once you're inside you'll never know if its noon or midnight, so come by while it's light and walk out into the darkness on top of the world.
