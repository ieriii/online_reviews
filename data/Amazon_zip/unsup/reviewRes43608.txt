I was looking for a steakhouse while in Chicago and found Kinzie on yelp. I made a reservation ahead of time but when I got there (a Sat. night) it wasn't very busy. The menu wass large and had much more than just steaks. They had seafood, pasta, meats and more. I ordered the seafood pasta (recommended by our waiter) and it was heavenly. I haven't had a pasta dish that tasty in a long time. The fettuccine was al dente, the sauce was a light tomato and it had TONS of seafood. There was as much seafood as pasta! It had mussels, scallops, and shrimp--for only $16.95. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts but I felt they could of been better. The sides were a little high in price ($7). The sprouts were very large---too large, they should of been cut into quarters or they should of used the smaller kind which has more flavor. The service was wonderful and the bathroom was clean. I highly recommend trying this place if you want a nice meal in Chicago. The prices are super reasonable for the quality of food. If I'm ever in town again, I will surely dine here again.
