Last night after leaving the Dodgers game, I thought about coming home and writing what I hoped was inevitable. But I didn't. After visiting Chicago on numerous occasions, my wife and I have never failed to eat at Frontera Grill. And now Bravo has affirmed what we always hoped was true, Rick Bayless is the best chef in the world. We loved Alinea, Tetsuya in Sydney, traveled to Basque country, Cal Pep in Barcelona, ran the gamut in NYC - and still think the Frontera Grill is the best game in town. I made a bet with myself that if Rick won, we'd be back ASAP (tickets booked for Columbus Day weekend) - and I can't wait.
