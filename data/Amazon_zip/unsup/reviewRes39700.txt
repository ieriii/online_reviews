Traveling to san soo gab san by CTA takes a long time from where I live (hyde park). The two times I've gone before were awesome, so my boyfriend and I decided to make the long trek again a few days ago. I was disappointed that the servers were stingy with the banchan; that's part of the allure! They took way too long in taking our orders, which wasn't true the first two times we went. They also forgot the egg in my jjigae (which is included in the soup) so that was disappointing. I don't get it; the first two times we went it was super packed but we still got plenty of ban chan without even having to ask! This time the place was nowhere near as packed and we had to ask for a second round, and they only brought out 4. Boo! I still love this place, but please don't be so stingy next time!
