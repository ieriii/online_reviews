The brunch at The Bongo Room reminds me of something you'd order at Norma's (the Parker Meridien in New York). Their portions are GIGANTIC, but you can order 1/3 of an item so you don't stuff yourself and you can sample a lot of different food. I went with my friend and ordered the eggs benedict, chocolate french toast, and banana pancakes (everything cut into 1/3 portions). The meal was above average, but they doused EVERYTHING with sauce (I'm looking at some photos I took from my brunch there and the sauce makes me want to throw up). My favorite was probably the eggs benedict, except the chef went a little overboard on the dill. Otherwise, it was pretty perfect. The french toast wasn't soaked properly so it tasted like chocolate bread with creme anglaise.  I'd definitely go back if I'm in Chicago (because I haven't found a lot of great brunch spots in Chicago), but next time, I'm definitely asking for SAUCE ON THE SIDE.
