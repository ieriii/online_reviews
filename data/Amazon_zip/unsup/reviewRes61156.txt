I love this place! I frequent this place for lunch mostly because the food is delicious and the service is quick. The above is not the same for the evening.I will say that I am a fan of the service before 4PM anytime after that the customer service downgrades and the quality of the food differs; not in a bad way, just different. My last two evening dining experiences were a bit rough. It took the server forever to come over to the table (it was not crowed). When the server arrived she was annoyed that we did not know what we wanted to order, but how could we know if we never received menus. We ordered drinks, when she returned there were no drinks in hand and she asked if we knew what we wanted in the same tone as before. Food was ordered still no drinks... Half way through the meal, drinks showed up. I refused the drink because I was halfway done with the meal! The on another occasion we never saw a server, so we left.I love the food there but I will be a little more careful about the time I choose to go.The food and daytime services gets 5 stars, but the evening gets 2.
