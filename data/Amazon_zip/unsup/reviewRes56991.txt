Texas de Brazil looks great when you walk in the door. The waiters are completely helpful, especially if you don't know how a churrascaria works. The salad bar itself could be an entire meal with the delicious shrimp salad and outstanding lobster bisque soup, s in addition to the wide array of cheeses. When the meat starts coming around, it is overwhelming. There were so many choices, I didn't know where to start. My favorite was the picanha, a traditional Brazilian meat. I also loved the filet wrapped in bacon. The service was outstanding. As soon as I flipped my card to green, more food started coming. I also had a beautiful view of the wine artists which were a pleasure to watch. I would recommend Texas de Brazil to anyone and will be returning in the future.
