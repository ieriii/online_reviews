I threw a party for 10 for my boyfriends birthday, it was a fixed dinner for 10 including alcohol. A gift certificate we purchased at an charity. The food was amazing and just kept coming. It gave us the opportunity to try a lot on the menu. Some unusual flavors, not typical and delicious. Service was also just as wonderful. Low key too! Not often you find such quality in a low key place. I highly recommend this gem.
