we stayed at the seneca for a mini staycation this past weekend. the front staff upgraded us to the presidential suite, which was really nice. fully functioning kitchen, small dining area and a living space in addition to our very large bedroom. the only drawback was the teeny tiny shower, and the equally small jacuzzi tub. im about 5'8, and couldnt stretch my legs out in the tub. the shower had weak water pressure and the head didnt have a knob to change the pressure. we had limited interaction with the front staff, but the check in and check out went smoothly. i would stay here again, but the bathrooms need some improvement
