I went to Crisp for lunch with a friend a few weeks back and really enjoyed it! I ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl and was quite surprised that it was a "mini" version of anything. I couldn't even finish all of the food, which was pretty tasty. I liked the flavors and the fact that it was packed with veggies. It seemed like quite a healthy meal and was only $6. The guy at the counter was very friendly. I will definitely go back again soon!
