Great sushi place, definitely my favorite in the west town area. I love the robust green tea, and the sushi is consistently top notch. Surprisingly, one of my favorites is the shiitake mushroom sushi. Delicious! I can't seem to find any other sushi place that can replicate it. Excellent Unagi and dragon rolls too. Decent size portions, and prices aren't too bad. The place has excellent decor and friendly staff too.
