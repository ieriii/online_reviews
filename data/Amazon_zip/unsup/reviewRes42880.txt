This review is for the stuffed crust pizza (by the slice). So I was pretty disappointed. Soggy crust, basically not crunchy at all, I thought the sauce was overpowering the other ingredients. I had spinach, mushroom and onion. This pizza might have been verification that I'm just not a "stuffed-crust pizza kinda girl" but I will for sure go back and try their pan pizza. Their prices are great and I LOVE the option to get pizza by the slice for those days when I need pizza but when I don't want to eat tons of it. I will give them another shot, maybe just 1 cause there are so many great pizzas in this city.
