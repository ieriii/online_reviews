Lockdown in your mouth = perfection. The burgers are amazing--even better than Kuma's in my eyes, without the ridiculous wait and semi-pretentious airs that you find yourself lost in at Kuma's. It's funny to think of such a thing as a snobby metalhead, but there it is looking right in your face... Those two factors in themselves may be the lead contributors to a resentment affecting the overall atmosphere and attitude once you actually get seated to have your damn burger over there. Making guests wait 3 hours is not very metal. On to the real point of the review: I discovered Lockdown far too late in my life and have a lot of making up to do! The staff is super nice and provide a great comfortable atmosphere. Good music & flat screens playing hardcore/death/metal show dvds just inches from one another aligned throughout the entire bar. I've never experienced a wait. As I said, the burgers are delicious. They serve complimentary homemade chip baskets that I think have chili powder or something else spicy, and I can't resist them! Tied for favorite item on the menu is their bacon mac n cheese! And although I'm not much of a wing girl, I do have to mention they're pretty tasty :) This is the place to go when you want great food & music, and a down to earth atmosphere. \m/ ps to the ladies: the bathroom had no lock/broken lock the last time i was there and the seat is just far enough from the door to have to struggle to hold a leg up (i'm 5'7 and had my tip toe to the door) when someone comes bursting in to take a whizz and, guess what, its right across from a table of more guests. if that's not metal, i don't know what is...
