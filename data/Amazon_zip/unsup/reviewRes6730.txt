Finger lickin' good BBQ with Gold Coast style! I ended my Restaurant Week endeavor with an early weekend lunch. We opted to sit near the fireplace in the "casual" seating area up front. We were promptly handed various menus, dark napkins and a bowl of BBQ chips 'n pickles. BACON CHEDDAR HUSH PUPPIES This was my first time having hush puppies and thought they were decent. Came with a side of chipotle sauce. HALF SLAB ST LOUIS RIBS Fall-off-the-bone, tenderness! Came with the largest piece of honey butter cornbread. Needless to say, I could not finish. I loved having the options of slathering different sauces: honey mustard, original, spicy, and cider vinegar.  MILK AND COOKIES Great ending to the meal! Between three different options, I picked the oatmeal 'n bacon and white chocolate apricot almond bar. However, I would've liked more sweetness with the oatmeal 'n bacon... maybe more raisins or chocolate to offset the smokiness of the bacon. Service was friendly. Our server came around post-entree with hot towelettes for our BBQ laden hands. With such generous portions, we ended up toting leftover CQ bags. I definitely will be back to sample their other meat offerings!
