This is by far my favorite Asian food place - I mean Thai is my go-to cuisine however Tank takes top honor when it comes to noodles soup and comfort food when I have a cold. I always get #39 because I feel like a trip Argyle and Broadway is wasted without having some noodle soup cooked for cook-only-knows how long to get that neat and complex flavor (ya i know - imagine that in ethnic food types!); but I also try out other entrees. The portion is humongous. I always end up with more than enough left for lunch the next day. Other recommendation for Tank would be lemon grass chicken, egg drop soup and the smoothies... yuummmmm!!!
