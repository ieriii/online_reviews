The wings here are HUGE. Kinda like 3 wings in one. Seriously, I'll take my time eating one part of the wing and put the other part down for awhile and then by the time I finish the first part, I forget that there was a second part, and I think wow, I'm not done with this one yet?!  Anyway, I tried the BBQ one and the Seoul Sassy one and they were both good.. one sweet and one spicy (gochu jang sauce), and both were delicious! They have things other than wings, but I didn't get a chance to try them. I'd say based on wings alone, it was definitely worth coming here.
