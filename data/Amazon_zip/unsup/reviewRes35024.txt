I was always a huge fan of Sushi Wabi - that is until I received a bill (which normally would have been about $60) that totaled about $110.  With Sushi X's slightly decreased pricing, fresh fish and really spot on delivery service, I am a believer in sushi again! I've never had nigiri here, but the rolls, albeit americanized (I know purists will dislike this), are quite tasty. My faves are the honey and spider... and I also like all their mega sized rolls. And you can order sides of spicy mayo, roe, etc... I don't dine here because the black walls just creep me, but like I said, the delivery service is a blessing.
