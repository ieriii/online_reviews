One of the best strawberry shakes I've ever had. Oh, and they have good hot dogs too. I'm going to miss you when I move to SF. You've been a dear friend of mine since I was a sophomore in high school and could drive here. Superdawg is especially nice when it's nice out. You can sit at one of their outdoor tables and enjoy the Milwaukee avenue traffic.
