Okay, so, my review for the Uncommon Ground on Clark still stands, but these two are very different beasts. Unlike the Clark UG, this location almost never has a wait, is a much bigger space with a better layout so you don't feel completely crammed into a little table. The waitstaff are unbelievably cool, and I haven't met one yet that I didn't like. Now, for the food part. More of the same, really, but that same is insanely delicious. The sweet potato fries? As though Jesus himself reaped them from Earth's bosom and served them upon a piece of porcelain heaven; they have been perfect each and every time I've had them (which is a lot, now that I think about it), and the goat cheese fondue is breathtakingly wonderful. Try the strawberry rhubarb poptail. Try the pancakes. Try the IPA. Just go, go, go! If you hate this place, you have no soul, and I don't think we can see each other anymore.
