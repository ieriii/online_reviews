This place was described to me as an upscale English Pub so I was expecting traditional pub fare. I was so confused! I was a little diappointed in my salad - for $9 I got a handful of greens and like 3 little pieces of goat cheese. The brie baked potato was delicious though. My friend was not that impressed with her $17 fish and chips either.
