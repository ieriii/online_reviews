been here multiple times and every time the food is good. service is a little choppy...sometimes its awesome and sometimes it's "eh". it is getting better though..a lot less "eh" But they do know how to keep your drink of choice full at all time...as long as it's alcohol. Last time I was here on a sunday and they had $4 mimosas... our server gave them to me in a unibrou glass.. I was buzzed off 2 mimosas even after I ate, awesome!!!! The food is excellent the meatball sandwich is amazing and they have it half off or $6 on one of the days. I've tried a handful of their burgers and all are excellent and come out cooked exactly the way you want them. as for apps... their hummus is realy good and comes with a good variety vegetables. if you're a cheese fry person get the barbed wire or just get the queso sauce on the side with your meal...usually comes with fries anyway. it's out of this world!! spicy, cheesy, chorizo-y great dip or sauce. Very cool place to hang, you usually find a seat in a few minutes...no hour wait (unless you have a huge party) They have good food and drink specials everyday of the week and they play metal music...which btw is loud....let me say it again...the metal burger joint plays LOUD metal music... if you want quite ambiance where you can hold a serious conversation...take it togo and eat it at home. okay?
