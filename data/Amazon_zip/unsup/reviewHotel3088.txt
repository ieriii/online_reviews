Best room views in the whole city! I travel to Chicago often and this is the first place I look at to stay! The "Lake View" rooms are stunning! I can not stop using exclamation points when reviewing this hotel, that's how much I love it! I love the design of the the bathrooms with the window that opens to give more space to the whole room. I'm not a very demanding guest, so I don't make the staff jump through hoops and then complain about horrible service on here when I don't get my way. The location is great for the views, but not nessacerely for getting to public transportation. Cabs are always available, though if you have a car, expect to pay $50 a day for parking. The bar on the 30-something'ish floor is less to be desired. It's just a very dark room with a view over looking the city. This is Chicago! There are plenty of bars every where! I love this place! Have I mentioned that? :)
