My girlfriend and I have been going to 90 Miles for over a year. We remember when we first went to the original location on Clyborn when it was just us and a bunch of police officers from the nearby station.  We just went to the new location on Armitage and love the place! It feels like we are in Miami or Latin America. From the colorful decor, to the traditional salsa music, to the friendly staff. We've been to Miami several times, and make it a point to stop at Versailles in Miami's little Havana neighborhood. We think 90 Miles is better than Versailles in Miami. The food is amazing. We love the ropa vieja, lechon, and arroz con pollo. The empanadas banana shakes, desserts, are also excellent. Alberto (the owner) is one of the most down to earth and sincere restaurant-owners we have ever met. He takes time to talk to each of his customers to make sure everything is okay. When some restaurants expand, sometimes the quality goes down. At 90 Miles, Alberto has grown the business, and has kept the quality high, and prices affordable. 90 Miles has definitely become one of our favorite restaurants!
