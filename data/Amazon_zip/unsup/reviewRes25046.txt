Love the atmosphere here. So completely cozy and romantic feeling. Also, as many have mentioned the half price wine on Mondays is great. Hypothetically I would like to say this place is 10x better than melting pot, we should all never eat at melting pot again, etc. I thought most of the things I ate were better here, but melting pot has such a better selection. I didn't particuarly like the cheese blend they used and it sucked to have no choices. They have one cheese choice, one chocolate choice, etc... other than that this place is great.
