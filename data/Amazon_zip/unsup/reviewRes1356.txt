Sometimes on rainy Seattle nights, I wake up thinking about Hot Doug's. I think about the Game of the Week, which might be boar or snake or pheasant. I think about the creative toppings that are judiciously applied to a hot dog bun and served with french fries that sometimes come cooked in duck fat. I do my best NOT to think about the fact that Doug's is 2400 or so miles from where I live, but inevitably that realization surfaces and all I can do is rock back and forth and cry myself to sleep. I bought a Hot Doug's t-shirt and I wear it around town, roaming the streets and simultaneously talking to no one and everyone about The Sausage Superstore. If I'm feeling really festive I sing one of the Hot Doug's theme songs. I'm a little closer to understanding what possesses a man to become a street preacher. The next time you're on the street in any big city and someone nearby is talking loudly to no one in particular, don't just assume it's the gibberish of a homeless guy who ran out of insurance money and didn't get his meds. Don't just write it off as some fancy stock broker making high stakes 6-figure trades on a bluetooth hands free earpiece that you can't see. It very well could be another Chicago transplant, another now devoid soul, who foolishly went back to the Windy City for Thanksgiving only to discover that Doug closed up shop for the long weekend. This rambling person might teach you something, something significant and life-changing, something about what can be done with encased meats that your senses will never forget. Think I'm exaggerating? Ask the 200 or so other folks who gave it 5 stars. Ask anyone in the line that forms before he opens, wraps around the building and down the street, and stays thick until closing time. Hot Doug's is like that.
