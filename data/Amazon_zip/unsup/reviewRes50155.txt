The crowd is meh.. The food is A-ok the drinks are- woo hoo! I will always go to this place earlier than later. I had the Mac and cheese with Jalapenos and it was supperr good. The beer cocktails stand out. I had a Georgia peach and it was like a dessert in a glass. It was made with peach lambic... suuper good.. My sister had a laid back gin and tonic with some kind of apricot ale in it and it was also good. The only complaint I have is that they don't serve the Lambic beer unless its mixed in the drinks boo hiss :)
