Violet Hour experience # 1 : we'll do this bullet-point fashion...1-the ambience is simple, classic and nice. yes, very ny like, and the age ranges from mid twenties to upper fifties--which I thought was an interesting mix, in a positive way!2-do not attend this place if you're hungry, or anticipating a great eatery. Their sustenance menu could be better perfected--do NOT order the mini hot dogs or chicken wings, better elsewhere. The best : potato tater tots. Sort of a random mix menu...3-The wait actually isn't too bad. It's all a little hyped up, to be quite honest, as if you're walking into an exclusive club. They were very understaffed for Sat. night, but kind and unpretentious.Overall, would I go back? Maybe...if someone else in my party was itching to go. Would I recommend this place? Sure, if you want a nice sit down, wine/conversational setting. It's not loud, rather quiet and simplistic set-up. I would NOT order appetizers again, and just drink their Malbec hence, I attend again--not satisfied, but not ecstatic...it was mediocre, and a lot of hype.
