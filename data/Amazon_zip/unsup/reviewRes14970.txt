Mmmmm is all I have to say. Was in here last Friday night. Expected a wait for sure. We were told 1.5 hrs, but it only ended up being about 40 min. I saw some people leave when they heard the wait time. Come on people, it's Chicago, on a Friday night, in Logan Square. By the time you find somewhere else to eat and wait their wait time, you could have just stuck around and had a beer or two. Stared with the Iron Fist IPA while we waiting, which was fabulous. I think it would be even more fantastic on a hand pull. After a beer and conversation, we got sat and I ordered the Anti-Hero IPA. I think I was expecting a bit more hoppiness from it. It was good, just not as good as I was expecting. Ordered the Cheddar Ale Soup and Sweet Potato Cakes as apps for the table. Both were phenomenal, especially the yogurt pepper sauce on the sp cakes! I had the Vegan Reuben, which was out of this world. I was so happy to see that they didn't try to make the tempeh taste like meat. I'm a vegetarian because I don't like meat, so why do I want to eat something that has the same texture/taste as it!?! Good job Revolution! My fries weren't even lukewarm when they came out, but the server quickly got me a replacement for them. No room for dessert that night, but they sure looked good on paper! Can't wait to go back when I go sweet home Chicago for another visit!!
