I've often thought about having a blog about how restaurants that treat groups well. How often have you gone to a group dinner for, say, a birthday dinner, and had really awful service and gratuity is automatically added? I'm happy to say that Sapori Trattoria was not like that. I was there recently for a friend's birthday dinner, and our server was very nice and totally on his game. He, and the bus boys helping him, we very polite, attentive and helpful. The lack of one star is for the prices, which I think are a bit over the top for piles of pasta (delicious pasta, but still pasta).
