I was on a two month Yelp hiatus thanks to Navy Basic Training. Now, after two months of monotonous galley food, this celebration called for something special for my palate. I've been a fan of Rick Bayless ever since I watched him knock out two of my favorite chefs Michael Chiarello and Hubert Keller in the first season of Top Chef Masters. I thought to myself, "Damn...he must be good." Sure enough, my visit to Frontera supported my first impression of him. The atmosphere was warm, inviting, and the bustle of the patrons (ranging from tourists to businessmen) made it electrifying. For a busy Friday afternoon, we were seated promptly after 15 minutes. I highly recommend getting the trios for a taste of everything! After seeing him make his mole on his show, I got the mole trio, which was on point. The pork clemole was my favorite of the three - the morsels of tender pork and the sauce was packed with flavor. You can pick up the complexity of the sauce with just one bite. The poblano enchiladas were delish as well. The meal was topped off with some Mexican hot chocolate. When my cup was near empty, the waiter was kind enough to top off my cup with coffee. Overall, it was a perfect meal to celebrate a great accomplishment. Definitely coming back here again next time I'm in Chicago.
