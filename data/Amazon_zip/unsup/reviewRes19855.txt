Overall great date place, just make sure you make a reservation at least 5 days out otherwise your not getting in without a long wait. Had dinner at Coast last night. Being the guy I am I always like to make the woman feel comfortable so I stuck with the basics to keep her happy as she has only been eating sushi for a few years. APP: Shrimp/Veggie Tempura for an app was good. SUSHI: Rainbow Roll I thought was fantastic. Then tried the Spicy Salmon Roll which was nice. (Side Note: All the fish was fresh and the portions were appropriate for the price.) Next came the soft shell crab roll which was average. Lastly, my date wanted to try the Philly Roll (which I didn't taste as being Jewish... if I want Lox and Cream Cheese I would just go pick up Lox and Bagels on Sunday), but my date enjoyed it so I'm sure it was good. DESERT: We had Fruit with Chocolate. The Kiwi, Papaya, Strawberry were all fresh, but the chocolate sauce just tasted like heated up Hershey's. I was a big fan of the fruit. OVERALL: Good Date place and would return.
