This place was SO TASTY! I went with my boyfriend and we got the cheese and chocolate fondue, which is a little pricey at 21.95 a person, but still worth it. The cheese is SO FREAKIN GOOD. Seriously. They give you plenty of yummy things (bread, apples, grapes) to dip in it, too. The chocolate was also delicious, and once again they give plenty of food to dip into it! The best part of Gejas Cafe though is the service... our waiter was attentive and friendly, as was the manager and hostess. We were using a Living Social coupon, so I half expected to be treated a little "less" (like some upscale places will do if you have a coupon), but they gave us great service. The atmosphere that they (along with the decor) created was perfect! This is a great date spot... I definitely recommend it.
