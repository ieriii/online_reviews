I love this place. To be honest the only thing I've eaten here is their Wilde burger. I just love it so much that I don't wanna try anything else. I'm a big fan of burgers and I've been all over the Chicago looking for the best burger. I wouldn't say this is the best one but it is certainly one of my top choices. Also, the bar inside looks really nice and atmosphere is really good at any time. I go there almost once a month. Definitely my favorite place in Lakeview east.
