So here's the deal.  The food is great-- no surprise here. It's Willy Wonka fabulous, and you'll probably eat stuff (and combinations of stuff) that you've never had before and will never eat again. The food is art, the art is food (you'll understand after you eat your centerpiece), and the exquisite attention to detail is...well...exquisite. The service was fine-- I didn't find it to be over the top stuffy, but it wasn't overly friendly either. The waitstaff was pretty smirky with each other, and I could actually overhear them gossiping and making fun of some of the other patrons in the restaurant (we were seated close to the service station in the middle of each room). The wine...made me mad. That's right. It was offensive. I expected our food to be expensive, and I was ready for that. What I wasn't ready for was a $500 wine bill. We decided to do the "reserve pairing," and in all fairness, we were warned it was going to be a little more expensive. The wine was good, but it certainly wasn't great-- and our 4 glasses a piece (be prepared for a splash of wine every other course), just shouldn't have been that expensive. You're getting a few mouthfuls of wine that retails for $80/bottle. So go for the food-- but save your money when it comes to beverages. Drink a glass (or bottle) of something really nice before you go, and save your money for something like...the cost of a month's rent.
