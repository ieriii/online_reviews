Disclaimer: we've somehow never set foot in here? I'm not sure how that's possible. We get pizzas to go from Piece when we're looking to feed more than just the 2 of us. They have delicious pizzas and they hold up pretty well both waiting for us to come claim them and driving 10min home! The crust, in particular, is phenomenal. Next up, we've got to actually come here in person. If the carry-out food is that good, I bet sitting in a booth here is even better!
