They brought bread pudding for dessert when I was there for my birthday. With a candle in it. When I asked for extra cilantro on my rice, they put a quarter cup of chopped cilantro on it. It's got a beer cooler. The servers talk to you. Really, does it get better than this? I think not. Irazu has an outdoor area that's about twice as large as the inside, complete with patio heaters, which the host/hostess cheerfully rearranged for my rather large party, in case we got cold (it was one of those fun 60 degree June days). I think I'm going to propose to this restaurant simply for that. The menu is simple, the ingredients ordinary, the flavors mindblowing. Irazu has quite possibly the best ceviche I've tasted in Chicago, full of lime-y goodness and seafood. And avocado. That was a nice touch. Both times I've been there, the entrees were fantastic. It's BYOB, which makes it that much cooler in my book. I'm not all about paying $9 for a glass of pruno, or whatever the house wine is. There's a liquor store up on Western and Milwaukee for those who want beer, and a wine store right across the street from Irazu for those with sophisticated palates. Just don't expect a fancy glass with a "stem" and made of....well...."glass". Long story short, Irazu, I'll marry you any day of the week. You cook, I clean. Deal?
