Look, forget about the line. It's a fact of the restaurant. All the best novelty food places should have a wait...how else would you know you were going somewhere good? Line aside, this is the only place I will go and eat $20 worth of sausages in one sitting. It's too hard to pick just one from the list, and beside, you spend all that time thinking about what you're going to get while waiting, and you don't want to back down. The duck fat fries are awesome, the bratwurst is maybe the best bratwurst I've ever had in my life, and the spicy pork sausage with gouda (one of the fairly regular specials) is to die for.
