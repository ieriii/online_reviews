I totally forgot to yelp about this place while I was staying there last Saturday. My friends and I stayed at the W hotel last Saturday while I was in town visiting my BF on tour for the night. This place was nice. I usually tend to stay at W hotels but never here in Chicago. It was clean, decor was nice and most of all very accomodating. We ended up with a great rate. We had a really nice view from our window. We booked two rooms to fit us all and they were able to put us on the same floor. Although I stayed one and a half days here it was a great experience.
