My boyfriend has a serious man-crush on Doug. I mean, I guess it's for good reason: if you're not a tool, Doug will estimate your bill (on the low side), which means you end up savin' some dough. Don't forget to tip, though: those cooks work hard, and Doug is ALWAYS personable with everyone. The man truly seems to love what he does.  There are always lines out the door, so get there early if you can. However, if you're still in line, you're still gonna get your food. (I've heard they give a little kid a t-shirt to be the Line Police to anyone who tries to sneak up after 4.) Doug has Saturday hours, so if you DO work a 9-5 during the week, that's your best bet. The duck fat fries are winners, and I've never tried a sausage I didn't like. We will continue to stand in line for the goodness that is Doug's as long as he dishes out his encased meats.
