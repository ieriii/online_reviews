Previously I would have given this place 4 stars but I feel there are some issues with consistency with them. The empanadas are great, full of flavor but are kinda small and expensive and they kinda skimp on the chimichurri sauce now. They used to give you a huge tub or forget it altogether! Don't waste your time on the Snickers one, you are better off waiting for summer and getting a deep fried snicker at Ribfest! We tried the Grouper soup and it was a super fishy smelling and tasting mess, most of it went into the trash. I like their steak with Chimichurri sauce but I think it is more for the sauce than the steak! All in all, the food is good and the service is great you just will have some trial and error with some of the food.
