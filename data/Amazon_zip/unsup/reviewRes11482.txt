Everytime I go to Chicago I HAVE to come here. Best eggs benedict EVER. I've tried so many eggs benedicts to try to find something as good as this place near where I live and have yet to find something that compares.  I keep ordering this but take friends so I can nibble on what they get and I love everything.
