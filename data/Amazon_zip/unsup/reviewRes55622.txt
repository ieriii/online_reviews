This place was recommended to me from a colleague, who rants and rave about this place. Telling her that I've yet to find a place that was equivalent to the Cuban cooking in Miami, she recommended this place. I was looking forward to going to this spot, only to be disappointed. If you are looking for a fusion of Cuban and Mexican cooking come to this place, but for authentic Cuban I suggest going elsewhere. I started off with a carife of Sangria which was watered down, and tasted more like the cheapest table wine and fruits that were thrown to call it Sangria. (Yes, I know that sangria is basically that, but trust me I know the difference). The spinach quesadillas were quite tasty(one of the reasons why i gave this place 2 stars, instead of 1), The main entree I had was the Cuban style chicken with a side of Yuca, which is one of my favorite dishes. When they brought the food out, seeing the beans n' rice, which I told them to take back because it was burnt. Yet the waiter told me that is how the beans n' rice is prepared--WHAATT??? The plantain, was very hard, and on the decorative side--sticking out of the burnt beans n' rice.  After my friend started to laugh hysterically, because I was acting too 'funny' and she didn't want anyone to spit on our food ,I decided to eat my food. The chicken was seasoned, but not the typical Cuban seasoning. Again disappointed. Then came dessert, Tres Leches that had coconut..again.WHATTT this place trying a little to be different. Look point being is this, this place is a Mexican-Cuban infusion. If you are looking to go for your first Cuban spot, don't try here. Try Cafe Laguardia or Carnivale, for a more authentic taste of Cuban food. It is ok to be different, but there are some things that are better off left the original way, and Cuban food would definitely fall into this category.
