Loved pretty much everything about this place. It's huge, but all the rooms/tables are set up so it feels pretty intimate. I would definitely recommend reservations especially with larger groups or on busier nights. The drinks were good and the food was AMAZING. We had the shrimp ceviche which was good but the pork belly appetizer was phenomenal. Our entrees (pork adobo and the braised rib) were also delicious. We cleaned every plate! Our waitress was attentive and knowledgeable as well. Would definitely go back here again and it's great for special occasions.
