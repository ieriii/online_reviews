Really a 3.5 rating. Have been here with my boyfriend twice. Not the best Chinese food I have ever had, but quite good considering the food here is pretty inexpensive and the portions are definitely generous, especially the noodle dishes. The service is efficient and unobtrusive. In 2 visits we tried the Peking duck, beef chow fun, walnut shrimp and ha moon mai fun. The Peking duck was definitely very good. The small portion is more than enough for 2 people. Beef chow fun was fine, although a little greasy. I definitely wish there were more vegetables in this dish like I have had at Chinese restaurants in NYC and Philly. The ha moon mai fun was ok, but a little too salty for my taste. Would definitely ask in future to tone down the sodium. Finally the walnut shrimp....we both did not like this dish at all. However, for the sake of complete disclosure, my boyfriend and I had no idea what this dish was when we picked it. We were a little surprised to see a dozen huge lightly battered and fried shrimp drenched in a savory, custard looking sauce with sugared walnuts on the side. We just couldn't get past the heaviness of the sauce and the strange texture difference between the fried shrimp and the sauce. I would definitely recommend asking for the sauce on the side.
