Our party of four came in on a Saturday at 1:45 pm and the line was out the door. I decided to hit the head while my companions held our spot in line. When I returned I saw they had been seated in one of the tiny 4-person booths along the waiting line of standing patrons. Rather than eat with folks standing over our table I asked to be reseated and they graciously moved us into a much better location in the larger and quieter west room. I would never settle for a table in the small room on the east. From that moment on, Nuevo Leon was its usually reliable experience from the surprise opening dish to the generous piping hot portions. Our opening surprise this date was a small bowl of chicken soup. The Shrimp fajitas came with plenty of jumbo tail-on shrimp. Avoid the refried beans if you are health conscious. The taste of the beef lard was overwhelming. If I eat them again it would be just to spite my cardiologist.
