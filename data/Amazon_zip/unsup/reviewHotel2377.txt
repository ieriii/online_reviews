Old school but great. Or should I say old school and great. Had the privilege of staying here for four nights for a conference. I come to Chicago a lot but have never stayed here.  Love the history of the place. In the elevator, the small screen has a rolling quiz about the history of the hotel. Queen Elizabeth was there, it was housing for soldiers in WWII -- tidbits like that.  The room was nice and cozy...not small, just comfortable. I had a wet bar that I used just for leftover pizza. No microwave but that's okay. Bathroom was fairly small but the windowsill was perfect for a place to keep my many toiletries so that was good.  Had a great view of the lake. The executive lounge for breakfast and snacks was wonderful. I fell in love with the multi-option coffee machine!  It's a bit of a walk to shopping and a lot of the restaurants around Michigan Avenue. Kind of a hike from the river. In any season but winter, no problem. However, there are other places nearby including the great Lou Malnati's on State Street just a couple of blocks behind and over -- go there!
