After years of living in Chicago, I finally made it to this place - and - OH -MY - GOD was it an experience! You get the choice of a 3 course, 6 course and 8 course meal. Well, me being the lush I am - we went with the 8 course! I swear the heavens opened, and angels came down and kissed this food. We started with some white caviar (now normally I'm not one to eat raw fish eggs, but delicious!) then got some mixture of beats and a truffle soup. The party in my mouth was then joined by a main lobster and some potato's (not mashed, not the fries of the French, nor of the simple baked - but a masterpiece of taste perfection). My favorite though was by far the Rib eye steak. Melt in your mouth tender!!! By this time I was SOO full, I didn't want to keep eating - but I couldn't help myself, I had to finish the desserts.... If you have a special occasion, or just the taking that special someone out, or even just to have an experience - this is a must. Don't wait like I did.... Go..... NOW....
