i recently discovered their salmon BLT (ATLANTIC SALMON CLUB Grilled Atlantic salmon, maple Applewood smoked bacon, field greens and tomato. Served on sliced brioche with lemon herb mayonnaise). you see, it's one of those things you dream about. it wakes you and then before you know it, forces you to get dressed and go consume as soon as humanly possible. crave-worthy to say the very least. also, pair it with their edamame salad. you will not be disappointed. promise. actually, invite me too would ya?
