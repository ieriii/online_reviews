As much as I wanted to love this place, I gotta give it a "Like, but don't love" rating. I met up with friends here on a Saturday night. We expected it to be crowded and for there to be a wait. Apparently they take reservations now, but we made a last minute decision to go, and decided to wait with a beer and appetizers.  Ambience: unique, slightly confusing. I'm not bothered by the communal seating; however near the windows, there was also private seating for groups of 4 or more, separated by these sort of horsestall-like doors. Weird. I liked the fact that the waiting area is large and includes tall tables for drinks and appetizers and hooks underneath for coats and purses. The whole place kind of reminded me of an upscale European beer hall. The food/beer: Overall, it was pretty good, but not worth the price. I'd go back and sit at the bar, have a beer and some oysters or the chauterie plate (think I misspelled that - oh well!) Beer list was extensive and they have a great selection of Trappist ales, Belgians, American craft beers, and German wheats. A little pricey, but good beer doesn't really come cheap. The food was hit or miss. Small plates were better than large ones. The chicken with fries was tasty, but $21? Ribs with polenta chips were fatty. Pickle plates were good, but also expensive, and we got charged $3 for an egg on our fries. $3. For one egg. Cripes. Service: Not great. Pushy when we wanted him to back off and lackadaisical when we needed him. Also, we ordered the kale with pancetta, which never came. Lucky for him, it also never showed up on our bill.  Overall, I liked this place all right, but it's way too trendy and scenester-y for my taste. For a similar gastropub experience, but with better food and service, go to the Hopleaf in Andersonville.
