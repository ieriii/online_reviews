Amazing meats, amazing salad bar, amazing place overall. I've been to Chicago three times, and eaten here twice. Both times, I was blown away by the food (I'm a steak snob and thus a churrascuria cynic, and yet the meat here was still delicious to me), the service, and the overall atmosphere. Don't know about Fogo, but Espetus in SF doesn't have nearly the salad bar selection this place has. By salad bar, I also mean the calamari salad, shrimp cocktail, and oysters on the half shell. All you can eat. Fantastic.
