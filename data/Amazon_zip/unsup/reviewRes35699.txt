Note to self: Come back to Sun Wah. I'm generally a little skeptical about Chinese restaurants in Vietnamese neighborhoods, along with Vietnamese restaurants in Chinese neighborhoods. But this was a definite spot! The place is also really big too (unlike most Asian spots) and so they were able to seat us quickly. Overall the place was really legit. Too legit to quit. Try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed. What we had: Chow Fun Duck Beef Stew Beef Tripe Salted Shrimp Pork Skin Tofu Hot Pot Chinese Broccoli
