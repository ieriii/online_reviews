I know everyone has a big boner for Hopleaf, but honestly, I've always been less than impressed. I think their popularity has sort of gone to their head and they don't think they need to bother with their customers because there are always more Andersonville-ians waiting to get in. And while they do have a vast beer selection, it seems like it is always very heavy on the Belgians, which is not my cup of... beer? It's always SUPER crowded which, good on them, but it's a bummer trying to find somewhere to sit.  On my most recent visit to Hopleaf, I was with a large group, celebrating a birthday. Some of us (including me) wanted to eat, but getting a table in the back area was like getting into Fort Knox. We stood on the ramp leading back to the dining area for a while, next to what appeared to be a couple flirting with each other, also waiting for a table. Eventually a server approached us and asked if we were waiting to be seated. I answered yes, after which the server asked if we were eating. When I said not all of us would be, the girl who I thought was flirting with her boyfriend stepped forward and told me we could only sit in back if we were eating. So...this girl worked there and completely ignored a large group of people who were waiting to be seated while she hit on some dude? Lame. And I get it, it's annoying if you're trying to reserve the back area only for people who are eating, but when the front is too crowded for people to even stand, you might consider loosening up those restrictions. So, for a comparable beer list and friendlier service, I recommend Quencher's or Map Room.
