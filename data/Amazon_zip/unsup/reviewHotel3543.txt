We got a great deal ($107 per night for 2 nights) on a nice room here. Valet parking was $49, which seemed a bit much. It was very nice, and comfortable. But bring pop and munchies with you. The bar in the room wanted $4 for a coke, and there are no vending machines around. $20 if you want a refrigerator for your own use in the hotel.  Seems like with the cheaper price rooms, they are trying to nickel and dime you with everything else. Surprised they didn't charge extra for the towels.
