Great everything, down to their chicken soup (with a twist= lime!). The only, only thing that put a slight damper on our meal was that we ordered salad with grilled veggies, not really looking at the price, and we ended up paying $13 for some romaine leaves in olive oil + salt with some red onions + bell peppers! That's just mad... minus 1 star. On a brighter note, BYOB w/o corkage fee is pretty sweet- you can even bring your own wine to mix in with their house made sangria mix!
