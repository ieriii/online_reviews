Fantastic grocery store.... It reminds me of Trader Joe's with more flare and style... They have an amazing selection of fresh food, steaks and sea food... Also, everything in the store seems to be ritzy gourmet style items... so expensive... But I only come here for breakfast... I love the eggs Benedict... but I always have to ask for additional hollandaise sauce on the side... There a little skimpy with the sauces... Its a sure bet that you'll have to wait to get in and a table... but its worth the wait... and the prices are not too bad... FYI, there are no servers, you have to get in line and order your food from a cashier like Starbucks, hunt for a table and servers come a deliver your food to you... But that's pretty much all the servers do... You have to do the rest, like get your own utensils, free coffee refills and any additional condiments. It's cool with me cause I never leave a tip...
