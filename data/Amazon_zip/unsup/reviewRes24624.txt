AMAAAAAAZING! I have never been to a fondue restaurant. I've only had chocolate fondue and maybe cheese (I can't even remember). At first I thought the pricing was ridiculous, but it was actually a really good deal. We chose the Prince Geja's Sampler (or something like that... the first choice). It was like 52 bucks, you each get a salad (loved the simple dressing), cheese fondue (YUM), meat/seafood/veggies fondue (the scallops were to die for) AND chocolate fondue. The sauces that came with the entree were so good too. I loved the dill sauce and their signature sauce. We also got a bottle of the red wine on special for 28 bucks. We left very very very satisfied and not disgustingly full. I can't wait to come back. I'm not the best cook, and I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to cook the meat (and I didn't over cook it!). Another note: the next day I woke up and had a tweet from Geja's thanking me for coming! Not even sure how they found me, but that was a nice touch!
