Food is always good. Crowded during the weekend rush but overall great service. Everyone is super friendly. Once you're seated it doesn't take long to be served. You'll never feel like you're being pushed out the door after finishing your meal. Yolk has an extensive menu that even the pickiest palate will find something to make your taste buds dance and tummy say yummmm. Everyone in your group will be satisfied because if you don't want breakfast no worries have a burger in the morning. Don't forget to have the freshly squeezed orange juice. The OJ always tastes so good like you're biting into a juicy ripe orange...never tart always tastes like the oranges are in season. Fresh blueberries were firm and ripe never in some artificial syrup to masquerade the taste of berries. I love fresh berries and this always hits the stop. If you have a hard time finding street parking there's a public parking lot right next door for $8.00. I'm always satisfied when I leave.
