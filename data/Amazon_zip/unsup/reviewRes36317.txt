Yummy. This is all I kept saying at every stage in the Meli dining experience. Yum. EEEEEEEE. (Well, not really, because my breakfast mates would relocate out of embarrassment to another table if I did.) But seriously... this Greektown breakfast joint has it going on. In delightfully fresh fashion. The atmosphere is bright if not a bit crowded. The service is friendly and efficient (but not the small-talk type) and the food is picturesque perfection on a plate (yes, of course it is delicious, too). So many Greek-y spoons fall into cliche but not Meli. No brass accents and mirrors to interfere with really fresh-n-fab food that will please just about anyone. The menu is creative, too. And I like that. The omelette with pancetta and melt-y herb-dotted Boursin cheese was... heavenly. As were the communal honeycakes with - yes - real maple syrup from trees (not brown-tinted high fructose corn syrup). Tip: Don't leave without trying the free-flowing Lavazza coffee and homemade jams (the pineapple strawberry was my personal fave).
