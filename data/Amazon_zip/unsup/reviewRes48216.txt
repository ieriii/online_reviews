When my friend told me about a place that was known for its meat (and appropriately located in the meat-packing district), I had high expectations and The Publican more than met mine. The ambiance was nice and I loved the big chairs and tables and the eccentric pictures of pigs on the walls. Our server was extremely friendly and upfront about what was available for the night. He gave us great recommendations about beer and other drinks (I tried the hard cider). We ordered: - a round of oysters - they were so good! I had never tried raw oysters before in my life. These tasted really fresh and the flavors ranged from sweet to somewhat salty. - a cold plate - came with an assortment of prosciutto, sausages, and other sliced meats - a hot plate (my favorite) - rabbit sausage, beef tongue, pork confit and a few other things all tossed in a couscous You can find the exact descriptions on their website :) We also tried the dessert: - Rhubarb pie - excellent taste. Not too sweet, not too tart. - Waffle with blueberries Bottomline: if I'm ever in Chicago again, I will definitely go here. The food was tasty, the service was quick and the company was fantastic.
