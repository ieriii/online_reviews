Went here for dinner with friends on a cold cold Saturday night in Chicago 1/16/10.  The staff was really friendly and we had about a 1/2 hour wait (even though we were told about 45 min). They had a nice wine selection and great menu options for cheese, meats, and entres. We ordered 3 cheeses for $14 and 3 different types of meats to start our dinner (obviously we ordered wine). When the cheese platter came, it only had 3 small slices of cheese and a VERY small amount of meat. At first, I thought that the meat on the cheese plate was part of the cheese plate and not the meat that we ordered. When our waiter came by to check if everything was okay, I asked if this was the meats we ordered, to which he replied "yes". I was shocked at how little (and I mean little) meat they give you, esp for the price. It was very tasty, but not much to taste. Obviously, you can order more, but it adds up quickly. The pork entre was my favorite, a big winner! If I could order all over, I would have stuck to the cheese platter and entre and skipped the deli meat section. Also, regarding the wine, the sommelier was very accurate in his descriptions of the wines on the menu, so if you are craving a certain type of wine, describe it to him and you will get exactly what you're craving! All in all, I recommend this place and I will be back, if I'm ever in Chicago again!
