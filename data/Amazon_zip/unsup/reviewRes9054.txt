Came here on a Thursday night for a first date. I enjoyed the upstairs area, very cozy and small. Definitely a standard style, nothing that blew me away. The food was ok, nothing really memorable. If this is a restaurant trying to be "fine dining" then it's completely missed the mark. I was excited to try this place from the strong reviews but I left rather underwhelmed. I would suggest you try to make your own decision but I don't think I'll be back here any time soon really.
