Before entering the restaurant I spotted lechon (a full pig roasting) outside! (drool). In my yelp book, it already got a star for that alone. Anyway, the service was prompt at the beginning but slowed down towards the end. During the meal, I was a bit cold. Many of the other patrons that were also seated in the back of the restaurant, appeared chilly too. They literally zipped up their sweaters, put on their hoods or switched chairs to avoid the drafts. However, despite the coldness, the food was delivered quickly and warm. For appetizers, we had yucca fritas and croquetas. From just one bite, you can tell that they can easily fill you up ( super starchy/heavy foods). So, some advice: eat sparingly to save room for your meal.  As for our meals, I had the pork chops and my brother had the lechon. My pork chops were thick and juicy! My brother's entree was a little dry but had a lot of flavor. We both really enjoyed the rice, beans, and sweet plantains. The sides really stood because they're simple but were seasoned and cooked well! Overall, I wasn't wowed about the main dishes or appetizers, but the sides were very good. The chilly factor and slower service at the end was kinda a bummer.
