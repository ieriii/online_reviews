I've been eating this pizza for years, and while I don't think it's the BEST in Chicago (I reserve that for Lou Malnati's deep dish!) it is the second-best for sure. They have a wide variety of slices, both thin crust and pan, if you choose to stop by and eat-in or carry-out, and they have all the ingredients you could want to make your own signature pizza. I can't describe what it is that makes their pizza so good (crack in the crust, maybe?) but that je-ne-sais-quoi has kept me coming back for years - 5 to be exact...so if it aint' broke, don't fix it.
