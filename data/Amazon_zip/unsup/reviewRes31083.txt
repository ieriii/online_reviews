How have I not written a review for The Chicago Diner before now?? Weird. My girlfriend and I loved it and used to go allll the time because we live so close, and it's vegetarian (yay!!) - but it's gone downhill in the last year or so. Cons: They've changed the menu what feels like a hundred times in the last six months, cutting out a lot. We have a lot of trouble finding something to eat if we're not going for brunch. Service used to be consistently great, but now it's pretty hit or miss - and when it's miss, it's pretty terrible. Pros: It's vegetarian, of course. The smoothies, desserts, and sweet potato fries never disappoint! The Chicago Diner was amazing before - but try it for yourself, and see what you think, you might not have any complaints.
