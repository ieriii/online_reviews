Ok, I love Rick Bayless and I watch his show regularly so I was very excited to finally visit this place. The restaurant is lively with salsa music and Mexican folk art so the atmosphere is great. I loved the appetizer, sopas rancheros, they were full of flavor. I would also recommend getting an agua fresca, I got their special of the day and it was delicious.  When the entrees came out, I was expecting to love it as much as the appetizer but both of us were disappointed with the entrees that we got. I got the tacos al carbon which were bland and tasteless and my mom got a fish dish which was oddly flavored. Perhaps we just picked the wrong things? The beans and tortillas that came on the side were good though.  I would definitely go back but would ask for recommendations on the entree next time. The dessert, a bread pudding with caramel was also great.
