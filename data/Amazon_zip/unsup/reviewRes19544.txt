My party and I arrived about 1pm on a Saturday--the lunch hour peak! We had a little less than a 45 minute wait in line and Frontera Grill next door had an even longer wait so we decided to just stick it out. I prefer the tortas over the caldos (too salty for me), but overall it was a hearty lunch. We also tried the agua del dia and hot chocolate--all good too. We dined in, and were sharing a table with another party because this place is very small. There was a take out option that many people who didn't want to wait were taking advantage of.
