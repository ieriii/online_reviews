Beef fat fries... sooo good! So imagine me... my non-red meat/non-pork eating self... ordering brunch. I ordered the benedict (crabcake I think) which came out cold with a side of potatoes with DUCK in it! I had ordered the potatoes au gratin (meatfree) and instead got a side of duck-covered potatoes. So admittingly, my eating habits can be finnicky, but I don't love duck. So I asked for another side. Fries? Easy enough. "BTW miss, are you a pescatarian? The fries are cooked in beef-fat..." "Well kinda... I've had those fries before. It's okay..." Really I'm just thinking, "shut up and give me the damn fries... you already messed up my order." I know that it's completely ridiculous that I won't eat duck, but beef-fat is okay. I just really like those fries. Don't judge. Anyway, the food is really good, but I almost gave this place 3 stars, because on Father's Day, we waited over an hour for our food. My benedict was initially cold, and a cold poached egg is not so good. They brought me a whole new warm benedict with my beef-fat fries though. And they kept the drinks flowing (a free round) to appease us. The brunch drink with gin, mint syrup and cucumber is AWESOME, and I hate gin. I had three in one meal. Other than brunch, I've been here for drinks a few times. The drinks are really good, even though they serve mostly bourbon and whiskey. Unfortunately, you can't get a table unless you plan to order dinner. FYI restaurants make most of their money from alcohol sales, and the drinkers will eventually order food. You should let the drunks sit down! I'm done rambling. I'll be back. Classy, good food and drinks. Welcome to LS! (Oh I went with Cleona T... check out her review too!)
