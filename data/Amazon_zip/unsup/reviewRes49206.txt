While the hazelnut cupcake's best part was the chocolate frosting, the service here was great. They had so many options for coffee drinks, all available with soy, that is blew my mind...so I asked for decaf. How lame am I? I was walking out of the clean, well-lit bakery when I took a sip...and it wasn't very warm. The very bane of the decaf-drinkers existance. I know I know...what the FUCK is the point of drinking decaf? But I ...I love the taste of coffee but the caffiene makes me tweak out, and crash and burn horribly, resulting in a mug shot resembling NIck Nolte. ANYWAY. So I ask the sweet woman there if she can just nuke it or something (it was kind of chilly out there). And she said...she would just make a new pot. How cool is that? So I ended up smoking cigarettes outside, making conversation, nibbling on my yummy frosting and she even brought the cup out and got me soy milk to put in it. Now THAT is sweetness-even for a bakery!
