This place is not good for anything other than their deep dish pizza....mind you we couldn't order it. They say that it takes up to 45 minutes forward the deep dish pizza to be made and baked.  With a 23 month old, time is a major concern. We ordered the linguini al Fredo which was over cooked and watery sauce. I am shocked. For an Italian establishment killing a pasta is sinful. Then again, I am not sure how Italian it is nowadays (just a place to suck people in). The "Italian beef -Chicago style" was silly. The server suggested that I take the Philly style b/c it had more thngs on it. It didn't help the flavour. The beef was too wet and the bread was soaked. The gravy was liquid salt wIth a lot of fat. Just not a good experience. Someone suggested order the pizza ahead of time and them go and get it. My suggestion is go somewhere less tourist trap.
