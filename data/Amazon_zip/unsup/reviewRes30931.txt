Chicago Diner ... how do I love thee? Let me count the ways!!! Ever time I waltz into this mighty fine establishment I'm pretty much jumping up and down with excitement. Literally. I have yet to try something I haven't liked. When I started eating here a few years ago, I ate chicken and fish (and veggies), it was love at first bite. Now, I'm a veggie gal and I've slowly, and successfully, pulled in a few carnivorous eaters in who have all said, "I'd totally come back." Win! More for me because I can eat everything on the menu. ;o) My favorite dish, hands down, is the Buddha Burger with kale salad. Yummo!!! My mouth is watering and my tummy is growling just thinking about it. Oh my. And don't you dare forget dessert. Seriously. Just don't. It's vegan, it's delicious and it's mandatory. In fact, maybe you should consider eating dessert first.
