Read about Crisp on the Reader and tried it last night. Happy to say that it was delicious! Plus Korean chicken joint right in my neighborhood? Even better. Ordered Crsip BBQ chicken, and Seoul Sassy chicken, the spinach salad and one of the 'buds'. Their names of the dishes are kind of confusing, like... what the hell is 'buds'?! (They're dumplings). Not really sure where they got ideas to name their dishes, but non the less everything we ordered was good. Crisp BBQ chicken is spicy and sweet. Probably closest to a typical Korean flavor, the sauce has 'go-chu-jang' which is the korean spicy sauce. I think the sauce was made with go-chu-jang and honey. Seoul Sassy was very sweet. Think of any teriyaki flavored chicken wings you've had in the past. I wouldn't recommend ordering a whole chicken of one flavor. Go half and try a couple different flavors. The best part, however, is the skin! My god is it crispy. I was biting off every possible little piece of skin attached to the bone. None of the grease, and all of crispiness. The Buds are good as well, definitely one of the better dumplings out there. The sauce that comes with is slightly sweet and different. Salad was... eh. okay. they cook the mushroom a bit with sesame oil so that adds a nice aroma and flavor. Korean style fried chicken, when done right, is the best thing ever. It's never fatty, super crispy, and seasoned just right. Unfortunately, Crisp isn't it. For those who are familiar with Korean style chicken, you won't get it at Crisp. BUT Crisp is definitely good, so it's worth a try. Bottom line, their chicken reminded me of Harold's, if Harold's was sauced. That's a good thing.
