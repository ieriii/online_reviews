I went to Garcia's with a small group for my friend's birthday. The service was very good, but the food wasn't anything special. The burritos are huge, though, so I guess that's something...though there were definite repercussions the next day, if you catch my drift.  I don't plan on going back - I've had cheaper as well as better elsewhere.
