i love pizza. so on my trip to chicago, of course i had to swing by giordano's and try their famous deep dish pizza. the restaurant itself was kind of generic and could definitely use a renovation. it wasn't dirty, but just seemed dated.  i went with a group of 4 and we got the fried calamari as an appetizer and a medium special (sausage, peppers, onions) deep dish pizza. ray got an italian sandwich because he is a rebel.  the calamari was served with a cocktail sauce which was interesting because fried calamari usually comes with marinara. it wasn't anything amazing though, slightly on the rubbery side and the breading didn't stay on well. also, the dish came warm instead of hot.  the pizza finally came out and it's a lot. the three of us eating the pizza barely ate half of it, good thing we didn't order a large or more. the pizza was too cheesy and while edible, i actually prefer domino's. it's not delivery, it's digiorno. i'll definitely give chicago deep dish another chance, but not at giordano's. my last night in chicago, i got back to the hotel really late and intoxicated, someone had ordered a pizza but didn't pick it up. i gave the delivery guy $20 and he gave me the pizza. i have no idea where it was from, but it was delicious.
