5 stars: The waffle is one of the most delightful things I have ever eaten. I am normally not overly impressed by a simple waffle, but this one was the definite exception. It was perfectly crispy, yet light and airy like angel food cake. If I could eat it every day, I would. No lie. 4.5 stars: Red Wine poached egg. Flavors melded beautifully and the red wine was subtle, yet added a nice depth to the eggs. I took off a half star because my eggs were a little overdone. 3 stars: The sticky bun was good, but not great. The texture was on the tougher side and the sauce was a typical of sticky buns. Overall, great brunch, great serving ware, and great decor. I will definitely return on my next visit to Chi-town.
