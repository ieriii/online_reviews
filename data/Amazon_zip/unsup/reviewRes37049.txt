I was a little surprised when my friend told me that we were eating dinner in a grocery store...but this is no ordinary grocery store nor is the restaurant subpar by any means! I had the shrimp risotto---I savored every bite of my shrimp and the creamy risotto. The risotto was a little heavy and there were only 5-6 shrimp in the dish, but I enjoyed it nonetheless, especially given that the dish was under 10 dollars! The waiter was attentive and prompt and I love that you can buy a $10 bottle of wine to bring into the restaurant to go with your dinner! My friends got the salmon and a crabcake. I tasted both and I'm definitely ordering the salmon next time! Also, it was fun to wander around the store and buy a dessert from the bakery after dinner. Fox and Obel is a specialty grocery store so everything they have is unique. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for something classy and inexpensive!
