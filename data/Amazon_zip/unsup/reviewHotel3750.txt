Great location and room was very nice. Shower was the best Ive ever been in. Customer service was not good. I called the day before explaining I was having something delivered as a surprise for my wife. The girl I talked to acted like I was speaking a foreign language, and total additude. Im sorry I pulled you away from your People magazine, but do your job. I wasn't asking much. I then emailed the hotel asking if someone could help me with my surprise. Still havent replied!  Not sure If Id go back since Chicago has tons of hotels that are just as nice and with better customer service.
