There's not much to be said that hasn't been said about XOCO, but I'll add a few now that I've been there several times. 1. The choriqueso is the best. 2. The next best is the alhambra or whatever. It's a sandwich served in broth. Live it. Learn it. 3. Always get chips and guac. Always. 5. Get the churros with a side of ice cream. You will f*** that dessert. 6. Consider the ceviche if they have it. I've only gone for it once, but it was fresh and tart and delicious. That is all.
