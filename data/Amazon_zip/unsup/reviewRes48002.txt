There's already a lot of reviews about The Publican's meats, but I want to give a shout-out to the fish courses and the veggies. Although the selections were limited, they were delicious and not an after thought. And as a former food-service slave who has worked in several kitchens, I thought it was great that I could buy beer for them (and not just tip the waitstaff).
