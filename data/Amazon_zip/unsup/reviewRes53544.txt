I recently tried Crisp for lunch. I had the Foodie's Choice Crisp, and my friend had a Buddha Bowl. Mine was delicious. The chicken was tasty, crisp, and tender on the inside. The sauce and toppings were also excellent. My only complaints were that the sandwich fell apart easily and it was just a bit too greasy. My friend enjoyed her Buddha Bowl, even though it was enormous. Seating is very informal but comfortable. I will definitely go back for more.
