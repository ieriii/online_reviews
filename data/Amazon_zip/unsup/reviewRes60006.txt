Brunched at Big Jones today because there was a huge line outside of our original destination, M. Henry. Glad we did!With no reservations, the owner politely found us a table and told us not to hesitate to let us know if we needed anything. Classy - thanks, Mark.The beignets arrived promptly with our server and did not disappoint. Since I am gluten free, my 'spare' beignet was quickly saddest up by my excited 7-year old. The coffee came in large mug with raw sugar and yummy cream. Cool kids milk cup was also a hit.Everyone enjoyed their entrees (Migas, French Toast and Country breakfast) and we were all full and happy. Great service, great food - would be a perfect 5, but it was darn chilly in the front of the dining room. There wasn't a line, but we didn't linger because we were cold. I'll be back in the Spring :-)
