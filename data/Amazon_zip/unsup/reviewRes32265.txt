THANK YOU...for bringing the spicy tuna crispy rice to the Chicago mainstream!!!! This dish is worth the trip alone. There are many other surprises, though, and I cannot wait to go back and continue navigating my way through the menu.  As a side note, the service was OUTSTANDING...even though (and regardless of the fact) that it was technically it's opening night. I will most definitely be back!
