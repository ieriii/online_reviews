A-OK describes this place well. I took my family here for lunch, since I live nearby and we were going to visit the Art Institute that day. Service was quite nice - though they did initially make a stink about seating 6 without a reservation, and the place was pretty empty, which put me off at the beginning. Coffee was aplenty, and there were a few things on the lunch menu I wanted to try. Note that lunch prices fare more reasonable than dinner - $12-16 will get you a sandwich with fries or a salad. I ordered the braised beef sandwich because I like sandwiches and beef. It wasn't awesome. Mostly, it was just waaay too cheesy, and coming from a Wisconsinite, this is saying a lot. The beef might have been tender or juicy or tasty but all I could taste was cheese and horseradish. Kind of a turn off. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food, including my boyfriend who ordered the same thing, so I won't be hyper-critical... but I also won't be running back any time soon.
