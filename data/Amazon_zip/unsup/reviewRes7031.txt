My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and I was really excited because he's been there before and told me a lot of great things. Bacon Cheddar Hush Puppies - it was delicious, better than other hush puppies I've had in the past. the bacon were in big chunks not small bits, the middle was creamy and yummy. The dipping sauce was really good Kobe Sliced Brisket - I got mine with coleslaw which was good, but I'm still not a fan of coleslaw overall (not their fault, just personal preference). Meat was good, but I think I had higher expectation. It felt a little dry (even though there was liquid at the bottom of the plate...so odd). It wasn't bad by any means, but it wasn't memorable. Competition baby back ribs - my boyfriend ordered that with cornbread. Cornbread is really good! The ribs were also really good (should've ordered that instead!). The meat was nice and tender with great flavors. Sauce options: Mild BBQ - I felt it was too sweet, my boyfriend really liked it Spicy - not at all even close to spicy Eastern North Carolina Vinegar - surprisingly pretty good South Carolina Mustard Sauce - also pretty good Strawberry Rhubarb cobbler with cinnamon ice cream - Ice cream was good when eaten together with the cobbler, eaten separately, the cinnamon flavor was so powerful it was actually unappetizing. Cobbler was really good, but the more I ate the sweeter it got. Pros: great service, very attentive (sometimes I might even say TOO attentive...), great food Cons: very loud (definitely not a date restaurant, very difficult to carry a conversation), our table was very close to the servers station/kitchen so they were standing nearby and at times it was very uncomfortable (felt like I was being watched while I was eating) Overall, a good experience. I'd probably go again and try other things.
