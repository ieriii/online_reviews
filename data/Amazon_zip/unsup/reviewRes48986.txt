Went here for Sunday Brunch. NIce atmosphere. Lots of nice people. I had the red wine poached eggs, which were awesome, but my toast was a bit on the burnt side. Bloody Mary and beer were VERY good. Service was also nice....the server forgot my friends fried eggs w/ frites and comped us a few nice breads and sides. I would go back again.
