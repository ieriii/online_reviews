Revolution Brewing exceeded my expectations. My uncle is a brewer at Goose Island, so I am very biased when it comes to beer and pub food. For starters, the building is gorgeous. Spacious layout; tall ceilings; urban feel; beautiful, dark wood bar and booths. The service was good. We were told we'd be waiting 45 minutes and we only waited 5! Bartender and server were nice and attentive. The highlights, of course, were the food and beer. We shared the bacon fat popcorn and wings for appetizers. I don't think you can go wrong with bacon fat popcorn, unless you don't like bacon or popcorn. Wings were meaty with a great sauce. Two of us got their forest burger. Mushrooms, gorgonzola, and shallots. A simple burger executed perfectly with fresh trimmings. My husband ordered the tofu chili dog and thought it was incredible. And my husband is quite the carnivore. Beers were great, both the house-made brews and guest brews. Overall, the only negative aspect to the whole trip was that parking is a pain. But whats new?
