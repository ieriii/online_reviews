I recently came to the somewhat surprising revelation that Publican has, of all things, my favorite brunch in town. After eating dinner and brunch here a few times, I could take or leave coming back for dinner...but brunch. Oh the brunch. Is it the nicely spicy bloodys with tasty garnishes--pickled curried cauliflower, even--and the beer chasers? Is it the leisurely pace of the meal, despite the usual line of people waiting impatiently for your table? (Which...if you go, make a reservation. Seriously.) Is it the beautifully runny eggs? Is it the slightly unexpected twists on classic brunch dishes that give you the almighty breakfast triad of savory, salty, and sweet? No. It's the bacon. I'd go just for that. Everything else is just a bonus.
