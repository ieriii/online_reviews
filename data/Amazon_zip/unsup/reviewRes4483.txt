It's honestly pointless to try and write the 300th review of this place. I've been going here for 10 years since I first moved to Chicago and my last experience was as genuine and exciting as my first. I recommend the Green Mill to anyone visiting the city and think it is one of our cities best assets. The music, environment, and history fully envelop you every time.
