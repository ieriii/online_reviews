I pretty much feel like this place is Cheesecake Factory with a better view...yeah, that about sums it up. That being said - it's a nice place with good food, decor, and service. You should check it out once in your life, I feel like it's one of those quintessential Chicago experiences. Go once and you'll be satisfied.
