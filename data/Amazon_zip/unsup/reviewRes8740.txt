This Boboli-inspired eatery is proof positive that fresh basil and mozarella are not a recipe sure-fire pizza dynamite. Our order was placed and pizzas placed in front of us within five minutes of having sat down to eat (no exaggeration). My "al funghi" pizza (a personal-sized pizza at 13 bucks) came complete with canned mushrooms. My wifey's "margherita" was bland and uninspired. Fifteen minutes later we were out the door- fastest turn around time since subway. And the tab for two crappy personal pizzas for two? 30 bucks! Never again!
