Cafe 28 was delicious. On a Saturday night there was a 2 piece jazz band playing very cool music at the bar and when we were seated the backgroud music was at a very appropriate level. The food was great. I ate the pastachio chicken and we had empanadas and tamales as an app. Sorbet for dessert. Strongly recommend this place.
