Sets the bar for what a hot dog should taste like. All beef, onion, pickle, fluffy bun. There's no substitute for a Chicago dog - I've lived in SoCal for 6 years and Chicago dogs are one-of-a-kind.  I enjoy the novelty of ordering from my car and having the food delivered on a tray to hang on my windowsill. Great place to bring out of town guests.  Cash only!
