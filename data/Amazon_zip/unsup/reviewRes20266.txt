Was it worth the hour to hour and a half wait that we had to go through at around 7PM on a Friday night? I would have to say A million times yes after a cold, windy day shopping on Michigan Avenue. Had the vegetarian caldo and some churros which, trust me, you do not want to come and not leave without tasting. The caldo (soup) was not too salty or bland...just right..you could taste the cilantro and other spices put into it. The mushroom sandwich that my friend got was also to die for. I also got some Mexican hot chocolate while waiting in line. Was very authentic but probably a bit too bitter for my taste. Would have liked a few more spices to warm it up. All in all, I'm a fan and will definitely come back to try other items. Being a vegetarian, the extensive meat menu does throw me off but the knowledge that the two vegetarian options they have are solid brings me back for more.
