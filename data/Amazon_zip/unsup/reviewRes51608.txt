Don't. Just...don't. When we got there on a Friday night it was very busy and people were waiting to be seated. Diners looked cramped in the large room, with tables right next to one another, and it was very loud. I could barely hear what the hostess was saying to me. I requested a table by the window (near the bar), and told the hostess we would wait however long. 30 minutes later (which is fine, because walking around Lincoln Square is good times) we were seated at a table near the bar. The waiter did not approach us for another 15 minutes (which was fine at the time, because we weren't in a rush, and I take a long time to order anyway). However, my guy was going to order a margarita during this time but decided not to in the duration of the wait. I ordered the steak tacos and my guy a steak burrito. His burrito simply had steak, tomato, and lettuce. He was picking cheese off my tacos and pouring on the salsa in order to add flavor. My tacos were disappointing as well. The steak tasted like nothing but grease. I did like the rice and beans included. But, rice and beans aren't enough to make me come back when the headliners simply aren't good.
