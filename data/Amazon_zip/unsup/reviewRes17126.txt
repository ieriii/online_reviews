Best Indian I've ever had. Before you take that as gospel.. I should say that as a relative newcomer to the cuisine, I haven't been very adventurous. Our waiter gave us some really good suggestions when we asked for some help picking something new to try. He questioned our original order because we were ordering two very similar dishes... Very helpful guy. I subtracted a point for atmosphere because the two of us got seated next to the most obnoxious group ever. I guess they can't really control that though... It was a buzzkill. Our tab was a smidge pricey, but we had a bottle of wine & a great meal and left so stuffed that it was well worth it.
