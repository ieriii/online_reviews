I had a groupon here that was about to expire so I grabbed a couple girlfriends and had a fabulous Thursday night! This was such a fun place to have a girls night. I will agree that there was a def smell of oil in the restaurant and i did smell a bit like oil when I left. But overall my fun night with the girls made up for the odor. We started off with the cheese fondue which I thought was quite tasty - who knew apples in the cheese would be so tasty?! I wasn't so much a fan of the grapes in the cheese. Of course bread and cheese always go together! I had the scallops/beef and was super impressed with the scallops. Perhaps it was my fabulous cooking in the oil but they really melted in my mouth and were absolutely fabulous. The 8 dipping sauces were all great. My friends had the shrimp and chicken and there were no complaints from either of them. The veggies were great as well. We ended with the chocolate fondue...even though we were all full we managed to find room for the chocolate! The highlight for me was the pineapple...ever since I had an edible arrangement with chocolate pineapple I've been obsessed! The marshmallows with graham cracker crumbles was also great. The service was good. Our server explained how it works because two of us had never been there and the busboy was always there to take away plates. I had a great experience here and would def consider this place for special occasions!
