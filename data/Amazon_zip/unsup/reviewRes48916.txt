My husband loves this place and would probably give it 5 stars but for a girl (that used to be a vegetarian) that doesn't eat that much meat and doesn't eat fish/seafood, there is really not much here. I love the beer and the ambiance but I left without taking more than 5 bites from any of the 10 dishes that our group ordered. For you fish/meateaters, it is a great place to go, but for those on the finicky side, I would eat before you go and just enjoy the beer.
