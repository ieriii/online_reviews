"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach or divorce" Spinster Neighbor growing up I am pretty sure the first part applies to Lockdown because it is truly amazing. Iron Maiden was blasting on the speakers, they were showing a concert of Metallica, the beers were on special. It was overload and in the best way. The burgers taste amazing, the meat is perfect, the bun is perfect, and the fried egg was the perfect topping. I love Kuma's as well, except the line there now reminds me of the Turkey Leg Line at Magic Kingdom and that is never a good memory. This place is packed on tuesdays because of half price burgers but they could raise the price on those bad boys and I would still pay.
