Trust me, I'm persian. and I love kabobs! So, I ve lived in LA, SF and Vancouver, and this place's Kabobs are just as good as I ve had it anywhere. I moved to Chicago a year ago, and I took my gf to all the persian joints in town, and this is the best. Their food has good portions, and they taste as close to food back home. I can only speak of their kabob dishes, and what I would recommend is either Barg or Soltani (its one Barg and one Koubideh) ... Their lunch menu seems good too, and they deliver to anywhere in town (However, It costs $12 to deliver to downtown) If it's your first time ordering this kinda food, start with dill rice and koubideh ... I'd also highly recommend their Soltani. Service has always been good, and they have your food ready in 20 mins for pick up, so seriously i have nothing bad to say about them.
