My father looooooooooves Chinese food, but not just any kind of Chinese food - for example you can't get him into a Chinese restaurant in Miami to save your life. He does love Sze Chuan food. Loves the spiciness of it - and you know what? so do I. While I lived in Chicago I looked forward to my dad visiting me every time. Not only b/c I got to see him, but b/c I knew that on the way home from the airport before doing anything else, we were going to stop at Lao Sze Chuan for a huge family dinner. This restaurant is always packed, which says a lot. It's just off the Chinatown strip, but with huge lettering on their awning it's hard to miss. I still remember the first time my husband and I drove past it. We immediately made a note to remember and bring my dad here. We were definitely not disappointed. The food portions were plentiful and had just the right spice, and the prices moderate; the service (was okay - that's where they loose a star). I do have to admit, since moving back to Miami - I miss it! The Cantonese place down the corner from my house now doesn't even come close. Oh well, it will have to do for now. But I think that like my father, next time I head to Chicago - this may just be my first stop straight from the airport - mmm mmm good!
