Delicious, classy, fun and GREAT service! I went here for my birthday and it was an enjoyable experience. We were early for our reservation, so we went and had a cocktail at the bar. We eventually were seated at a table in the bar area, which was great as there was a piano player and two separate singers as well. The food was great - I recommend the bone-in fillet! Also as mentioned before, get the butter cake! It was a-mazing!
