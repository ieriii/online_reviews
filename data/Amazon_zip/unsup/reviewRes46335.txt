Actually one of my favorite restaurants during Christmas time. The atmosphere is dark and cozy, the menu has more on it than you can imagine (the sunday night spaghetti is the best spaghetti I have ever had), and prices are well....it not the cheapest place around. If you are downtown during the holidays its a must try kind of place.
