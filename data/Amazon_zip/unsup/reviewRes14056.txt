A local neighborhood favorite! Great for brunch and dinner. Glenn's selection of seafood is always fresh and tasty. Have been a bunch of times and prefer going for dinner over breakfast. This weekend, I took my parents, both New England natives, and they also loved it. My mom had a small issue with the Artic Char being too dry for her taste and the waiter had another serving cooked right up that was perfect (and was a bigger piece of fish).  In my opinion, the best thing on the menu is the clam chowder. It is amazing! Lots of clams and has a nice creamy smokey flavor. Perfectly cooked potatoes, carrots and celery. Will go back again and again for the chowder. I also like the Artic Char and the cornbread catfish. BYOB - $5 corkage fee. Makes Glenn's an even better place. Reservations are a must especially on weekends.
