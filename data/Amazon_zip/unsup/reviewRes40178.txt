I have been to this Korean BBQ 3 to 4 times now and have had the same sort of experience every time. If you are not Korean make sure you bring a Korean/Korean looking friend with you. The service if you are neither will be awful. You will be seated at their convenience after all of the Korean/Korean looking people have been seated at their convenience. Also of note they do not even own forks at this restaurant. You must use chopsticks. The food here is wonderful. I have had both the beef and the chicken and both have been seasoned extremely well. The spare ribs have much to be desired the meat is tough and what meat there is on the bone will not easily be enjoyed. I love the sample dishes they bring out I can always find at least a few I enjoy immensely, a few i find OK and 1 or 2 I find inedible. ( I have a special palate). The plum wine they have is amazing as well. I wish i could find a place to buy that wine for my house it was so good. This is a great place to bring a party of 4 or more but any less and you will find this place to be quite pricey. The ventilation system here also has much to be desired. One time I went and the Vent was dripping greasy brown stuff on our neighbor so they moved them tables, and the vent system seem to be turned on and off intermittently. Never found this place to have a breathable atmosphere. Overall the food is good, Service is bad (unless your Korean) and ventilation system sucks(and not in the way it should!). I will continue to go back though because the food is that good!
