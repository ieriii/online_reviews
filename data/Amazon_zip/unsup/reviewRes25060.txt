I don't understand why, but I guess fondue isn't for me. And I cannot figure out why this is. I love fried food. I love deep fried everything! I worship cheese. I eat too much deep fried fish, chicken, chimichangas and tater tots. And pizza. But I left Geja's with my stomach feeling like I swallowed a bucket of uranium! And I didn't eat a lot either. I admit that it was a fun experience (putting the "fun" in fun-due), but it's freakin' expensive! Don't get me wrong, it didn't TASTE bad or anything. It was good quality, but the way it made me feel made me solemnly swear to not go back.
