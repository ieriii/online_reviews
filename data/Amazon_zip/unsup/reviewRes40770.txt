i frequent this place on the days i'm lucky enough to go to the united center for a bulls or hawks game or a concert.  i've never been there drunk. this is my sober review. i'm weary of hole-in-the-wall mexican places, mainly because most aren't good. there's always something missing - the tortillas are dry, the steak is chewy or bland, etc. here, they have everything right. the tortillas are moist. i said moist. i don't even like that word. the steak is flavorful and delicious. by far, the best tacos in the city.  i'm sure coming here drunk makes the tacos 100 times better.
