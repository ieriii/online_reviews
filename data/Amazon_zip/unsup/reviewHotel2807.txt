I sometimes want to go back and wish I had my wedding here because the atrium has a really nice, beautiful feel to it. It has the perfect ambiance for cocktails as well as for pictures. In addition, Osteria Via Stato is in the building if you want a place to have rehearsal dinner and all your guests are staying in this hotel. A great spot if you plan to have alot of out of towners at your wedding because it is SOO convenient. Compared the other downtown hotels, the price-per-plate was very affordable at about $86 for a chicken dish, moving up to get a steak would be about $105.00.  The wedding coordinator was very helpful and very organized, even ensuring that the dining room had a table set up so you could see what the table arrangements would look like complete with linens and china. She even gave me a giant wedding planning book to help me out. Alas, after negotiating for quite sometime, we realized that we didn't have enough people on our guest list to meet their minimum requirement of $15,000 (which is negotiable...depending on when your wedding is). We only had about 75 people for our wedding and there was no way we could meet that minimum. But no regrets as I had an AMAZING wedding at the Doubletree on Ohio St instead.
