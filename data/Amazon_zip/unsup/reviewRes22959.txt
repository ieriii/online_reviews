I work in Greektown. I got takeout from Greek Islands for lunch.....called in my order and they told me 30 minutes. I showed up in 30 minutes and had to wait nearly another 30 minutes just for my skordalia and gyros!!! They apologized and were busy but COME ON! No compensation was offered either.... Recently we went back to dine in. Am I the only one that thinks their service is more pushy/over-attentive than wonderful? Anyway.... I ordered the lamb special (lamb loin stuffed with spinach and feta) which was good, but a small portion for the price ($18) and had to be picked apart since they left large chunks of fat, gristle, and even skin on the lamb. My family's orders (Avgolemono, Pastichio, and Chicken Riganati) were all good....but my hubby's Mediterranean Chicken Breast was a little dry and the rice that came with was way to oily. For one appetizer, four entrees, one dessert, and 3 drinks it was only $125 (with tip) but I dunno how often I'll be back since my experiences were both just "ok".
