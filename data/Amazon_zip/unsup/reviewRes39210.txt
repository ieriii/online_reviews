Good late night spot for KBBQ. Love all the appetizers/small plates at the beginning of the meal because there are so many.  I give this place 2.5 $'s - it can be pricey depending on the amount of people u have in the group because it seems like the amount of meat given is not enough at times.  Food is delicious & tasty.
