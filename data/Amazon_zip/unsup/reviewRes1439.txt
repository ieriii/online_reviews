If I wasnt afraid of gaining a ton of weight I'd drive out of my way three times a day for this place. Seriously, its that impressive. The decor is adorable (I collect hot dog memorabilia so I was in heaven). I visited Doug's for the first time the other day, the line was inside (amazing!) so I had to stop. I ordered the Elk and fries. Best. Fries. Ever. Oh and the dog? Freaking amazing! I'll be back for sure. Thanks Doug!
