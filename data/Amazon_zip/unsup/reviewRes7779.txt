We ate here for the first time. I had the pumpkin ravioli & my husband had the seafood over linguini! The pasta was so fresh; both of our meals were outstanding! The caesar salad was great; the dressing was freshly made and not from a jar! The service was excellent. We plan to take our out of town family there for their birthday celebrations. We have high expectations. I'll report back.
