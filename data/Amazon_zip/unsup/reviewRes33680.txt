When I'm in the mood for falafel I head to Sultan's Market! The falafel sandwich is fantastic - falafel packed into a soft pita with cucumber salad and spicy sauce. It really doesn't get much better than that when it's also pretty darn cheap! The hummus is also pretty tasty and you can get it for dipping with your pita bread or even on your falafel sandwich... good either way! The place itself is pretty simple, a salad bar with plenty of fresh veggies and salads, and a counter where you can order your falafel or other veggie treat. The guys behind the counter are very helpful with questions - although if they are busy they may hurry you a long a bit. Just an FYI - this place is cash only.
