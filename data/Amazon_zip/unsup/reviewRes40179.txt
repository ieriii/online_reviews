After an hour plus wait in the beer garden (L&E doesn't take reservations), we were nicely buzzed and ready to do some damage. The wife and I ordered 7 share plates ranging from the sacred to the profane. Bone marrow, Bourbon, and belly of beasts galore. Food overall was fantastic, service was great. The place is dark, the tables are close together, and the vibe is energetic. For a Wednesday night, the place was packed, and the staff says its like that every night of the week. Full of locals, which is a good sign. Would recommend the roasted marrow bones, the 1/2 chicken, and all the Bourbon you can hold.
