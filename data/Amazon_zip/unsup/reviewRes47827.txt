What the hell just happened?  That is what I thought when I finally got upstairs to the rooftop bar. My girlfriend and I were meeting a friend at this dump for a birthday drink and they made us stand outside on the street for 45 minutes. On a Thursday. At 6:45 pm. And the upstairs was half-full. And then, the waitress took about another half hour to deliver our overpriced, extremely weak drinks. So now its 8, and I haven't even had a sip of booze and I am pissed. I asked the manager why we had to wait outside for 45 minutes when clearly there was no one in the place. He proceed to look down his noes at me, scoff and tell me "that's just the way we do things here." I hope this place closes within the year. But then again, I would not be surprised if they make it because of how efficient the classless staff is at fleecing the nouveau riche.
