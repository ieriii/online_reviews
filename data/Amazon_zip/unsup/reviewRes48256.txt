In four words: tasty food, mediocre value. I will start with the good. I just moved back here from San Francisco, and I was worried that my oyster eating days were over. So I was psyched when I saw the oyster list at the Publican (including my favorites, Hog Island Sweetwaters), and the oysters here were pristine and the prices were correct ($15 for a half dozen, $30 for a dozen). For entrees, my friend ordered the suckling pig and I ordered the sweetbreads. The suckling pig was tasty but very salty. The sweetbreads were delicious, fried and topped with a mayonnaise based sauce. Issues: the entree portions were small. Very small. I had maybe two or three ounces of sweetbreads. For entrees that are priced over $20, there should be more food. The beer selection is decent, but most of the bottle choices were overpriced. Oddly, the drafts were very reasonable. I'll give a few examples. A Westmalle tripel is $12 here, at Map Room it is $8; Saison Dupont is $12 here, at Map Room it is $8; Orval is $12 here, at Map Room it is $8. Not sure what justifies the markup. It's odd, the sister restaurant Avec has always felt like such a fantastic deal, delicious food, good portion sizes, reasonably priced and interesting wines. It's too bad that that feeling does not carry over to the Publican.
