CHEESE. SWINE. WINE. I came. I ate. I drank. And I can't wait to go back!! Here's what our group of 4ordered (amongst numerous glasses of red wine)... *Charred Cauliflower, Toasted Breadcrumbs, Cornichons & Parsley *Salt-Roasted Beets, Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette *Prosciutto Escarole Bread Balls *Mortadella, Balsamico & Pistachio Smear *Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes *Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki *Wagyu Sirloin Tip with Fingerling Potatoes Red Onions, Olive & Bone Marrow Vinaigrette *Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli *Cheese platter - Le Chevre Noir, Gouda, Truffle Tremor Yes we were hungry. After all of that, we opted out of trying the dessert. However, I will be returning. Personal favorite was the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. I've never had meat so good. No joke. The Wagyu Sirloin and the Chicken Kebabs are tied for 2nd place. I could have done without the Proscuitto Escarole Bread Balls. They were, eh, just okay. Nothing special, and nothing you couldn't find on a menu at a bar. A couple of downsides - they don't take reservations ((Buzzkill)) We still encountered an hour long wait for an early, 5:30pm dinner on a Saturday. But it was nice outside, and the waitress took drink orders, so we sat and waited. And drank. The restaurant is small and they get extremely busy, so if you don't see a dish come out, make sure you ask for it! We ordered a Purple Pig Platter (which I was sooo looking forward to) which never made it out. Boo. Oh well, next time.
