Very nice server, guided us through the menu. Ordered the crawfish fritters which were nice, but the breading overwhelms the delicate crawfish meat. It was more like an arancini crust. Corn bread was very tasty, complimented nicely with honey butter. Gumbo tasted great, but was not piping hot when it hit the table. About 10 minutes after finishing the gumbo, my stomach started to really rumble. Very rich and delicious, but a bit much for me. Great spirits selection, and knowledgable server, a good restaurant experience overall.
