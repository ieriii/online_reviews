Foie gras duck sausage hot dog + Duck fat fries = Winner! I must admit the line here is pretty darn long but it's worth the wait! once you get in the service is excellent and I had the pleasure of meeting Doug himself. Since you're going to wait a little, I recommend getting at least 2 dogs. The Foie Dog is pretty rich a a tad drier then I'd like, but satisfying never the less. I tried another dog as well but I forgot the name. As a whole I'll def come back if I'm in town and was a very unique and pleasurable experience. Enjoy!
