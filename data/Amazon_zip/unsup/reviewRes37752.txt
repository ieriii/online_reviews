I returned with my dad, and had an incredibly amazing meal. I had the "rabbit saddle"... or "saddle of rabbit".... or something like that. I had never had rabbit before, and it was kind of strange, because it is an extremely light pink color that makes you feel as if you are eating something raw, and it is so incredibly soft it makes you feel as if you are eating a baby. However it is also so incredibly delicious that I ate a lot of it. Unfortunately I couldn't finish it because I couldn't get the image of eating a baby out of my head (it's THAT soft), so I let my dad have it and he died and went to heaven. The mussels and aoli, again perfection. Honey wine was amazing and the only one I've ever had. Chocolate torte with a tart strawberry sauce and incredible little tiny salted balls of dark chocolate - killed me. Just killed me.  If I were you I'd avoid the sandwiches everyone raves about and go with a real meal, mussels, and a real dessert. Sandwiches are just sandwiches after all.
