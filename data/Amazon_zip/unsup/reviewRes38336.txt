Probably the second best Chicago pizza I have had after Lou Malnati's. Its a little thicker and cheesier, and the crust isn't as good (I think the crust is the key at Lou's), but it is still an excellent example of Chicago deep dish. I would probably give it a 5, but I have gotten orders where the cheese was sometimes just too overwhelming. It doesn't seem to be the most consistent place.
