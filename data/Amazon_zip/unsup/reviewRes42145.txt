Oh, the ribs! I'm a bbq lover so I had to try the Thursday dinner special. A full slab of ribs for $10. Not only did I get the most delicious, fall of the bone, lean and flavorful ribs, I also received a good sized house salad, italian bread and french fries. All for $10. Jackpot! Art of Pizza is a dream when it comes to my ordering cheeseless pizza. It's really good, not dry like most other establishments, and saves me from a lactose overload.  You can't go wrong with Art of Pizza --- be sure to check their daily specials for a great deal.
