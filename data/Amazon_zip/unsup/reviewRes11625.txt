Holy god this pizza is amazing. We ordered Piece the day we moved to the city after a 12 hour drive from Atlanta, and it let us forget completely the hell that moving is. So far we've tried the red (once plain, once with mushrooms and onions, once with black olives) and the white (both times with goat cheese, extra garlic, and white onions). Ask for lemon wedges to squeeze over the white-- it's mouth-watering and amazing. We've heard there's quite a wait in-person, but we've had it delivered in under 45 minutes three times now, so that might be a better option.
