For some reason, I really like this place. It's surprising because the food isn't that great. The tortas are good but, my stomach doesn't get excited thinking about them. I think I like this place because of all the other items on the menu. I really like the aqua del dia (if that's what it's called). It's basically a refreshing drink made of cucumber, lime, and mint. There's a tasty selection of warm drinks. I like the cafe with dulce de leche. Caramel and coffee together so good. There's also a hot chocolate that seems more like sauce than a drink because it's so rich but I like it. I like eating churros with custard ice cream. I can't say I've had enough churros to say these are the best but I like eating them coffee or custard.
