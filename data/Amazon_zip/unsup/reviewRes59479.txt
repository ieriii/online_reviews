We have been to LaVilla many times for dinner, showers, rehearsal dinners and weddings, but they outdid themselves on our last visit. We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful meal, the best service and pleasant atmosphere. They even suprised us with a yummy platter decorated with "Happy 40th Anniversary", hearts and singing after our meal. We loved it! By the way, their New Year's Eve parties are terrific.
