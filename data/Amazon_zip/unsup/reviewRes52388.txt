I just cannot understand all of the low reviews. All I can say is if you hate Gino's East, then you hate Chicago style pizza. Go back to New York and leave those of us who love the real thing alone! This was, hands down, the BEST pizza I've ever had anywhere! It was sooo goooood! I kept eating it long after I was full. Even my wife who's family is from New York and gets all uppity about her pizza, and was all ready to say it doesn't hold a candle to New York style loved it. We had 6 in our party so we got 2 larges (We finished it but BARELY.) We had a Supreme and a Meaty Legend. Both were amazing but the Meaty Legend was the unanimous winner of the taste test. The smokiness of the bacon really complimented the savory sauce and sausage. The best part of the pizza was the crust. OMG! A little corn meal in the crust gave it a lighter feel, a little less "doughy" than some Chicago style pizzas. Everyone commented on how great it was. The BEST, bar none!
