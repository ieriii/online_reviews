Our favorite place to stop on the way to grandma's and grab a couple of fried chickens, one in Crisp BBQ sauce and one in Seoul Sassy sauce, finger lickin' good, with sides of rice. I don't get the people who complain about the lack of salads or the fact that the steak bowl only had steak and rice when the menu clearly states "meat sans any frilly accompaniments." The menu is large and varied and there's something for everyone (providing you know how to read).
