This place is amazing! Here's why:-The food is delicious, fresh, innovative and unbeatable when it comes to taste. If you are a meat eater the meat is so tender, full of juices and cooked to perfection! The ingredients that complement the dish are delectable and although it sounds like a cliche to say, there really is an explosion of taste and excitement in your mouth! I would definitely suggest having the guacamole for an appetizer!-The drinks are amazing! Although they might be a little pricey they are definitely worth every dollar because each sip is an alcoholic mix of bliss! -The surroundings and atmosphere is completely original! This place has the swankiest bathrooms I have even been in! The whole building is an amalgamation of incredible design, bright colors, loud artistic expressions. Just being inside the building invigorated me! I wanted to eat, drink, dance, and laugh! This is a GREAT place to bring someone on a date or even just have a fun night out with your friends!-The service is fast, reliable, and personal. I have been here twice and both times our server has been very attentive and met our every need in a timely manner. Not only are the servers well trained but they are amiable and talkative. There is no flaw to this place! Whether you are a Chicagoan or a tourist Carnivale is a MUST SEE! You will NOT regret coming! Tips-*call in advance to make a reservation. Sometimes there is a week or two waiting list. *bring a few extra dollars in your wallet. This place can get a little expensive. The guacamole will be around $10, your main course will be anywhere from $15-25 and drinks are around $10 each. Dessert is amazing too! So i would expect to pay $35-50 per person.
