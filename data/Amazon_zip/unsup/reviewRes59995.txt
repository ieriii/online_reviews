My girlfriend and I decided on five stars for this. Despite Yelp's label of casual attire, the place itself was very well decorated and had an upper-scale family atmosphere. We felt a little under dressed compared to most of the other patrons, whom I would describe as relaxed business casual.The food really shined here. I had no experience with "southern style" cooking at all outside of ribs and barbecue. I decided to dive right in.I tried the grits & shrimp, which were phenomenal. I was afraid the grits would be bland, mushy, and other variations of bad. Instead, they were full of flavor, perfectly cooked, and went great with the shrimp and other vegetables. A+ dish.My girlfriend got a fantastic burger, which was priced right for what she received. The only complaint was she ordered it with onions and no mushrooms, but she received mushrooms and no onions. The staff remedied this quickly after discovery. The burger itself was great though. A. We tried an appetizer of fried green tomatoes. While good, these were very different from the tomatoes I had grown up eating. The online menu suggests they are served with housemade peppers, but they actually came with a relish. B-, would try something else next time.The service was on spot. No glass remained empty indefinitely. The tiny error was quickly remedied by the staff. The waitress was one of the most professional service staff I have ever encountered, both in timeliness, rapport, and knowledge of the dishes/restaurant. Excellent drink list, though the cocktails are on the pricey side. I tried a backwards Manhattan, but the whiskey list was impressive. Highly recommend.
