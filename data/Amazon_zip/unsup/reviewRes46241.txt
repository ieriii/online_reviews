I took my girlfriend here for a nice lunch after a movie. We were immediately impressed with the size of the place....it's huge! We loved the decor and the huge opne dining rooms. Its very similar to the Cheesecake Factory as far as decor goes. We were seated next to a window which had a great view of the shoppers. I love people watching! My significant other had the rice and salmon which was decent. Honestly, it tasted like something prepacked to me but it was good none the less. I had the fish and chips and they were fantastic. We also had the pecan chocolate cookies......they give you TWELVE of them! Seriously! TWELVE!!!! Grand Lux is a great spot for a date of just a nice lunch with good people watching. Word of the wise, we got there about 3:00 Pm and had no wait. When we left at 4:30 there was already an hour and a half wait.....on a Wednesday.
