YUM! amazing food. I went on a Wednesday night and it was DEAD, which makes me hope that this place does not go away anytime soon due to lack of patronage. i love that the menu is $20 prix fixe for 3 courses with BYOB. of course, i ended up wanting everything that had an extra fee involved, but it was still only $60 for 2 of us. not bad at all, especially since it really was a massive amount of food.  the only complaint that i would have, and it's incredibly mild and stupid, was that i ordered the veal risotto (so good!) and it came in a martini glass with the shredded veal on top of the risotto. i totally felt like i came straight out of a fancy feast commercial and had been called to the table with a tap of the fork on the glass. but i'm sure that that's just my weirdness talking. either way, i guess that cat has pretty discriminating taste and i think he would have been happy with my choices.
