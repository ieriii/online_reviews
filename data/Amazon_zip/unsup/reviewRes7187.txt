We waited about 40 minutes for our table on a busy Saturday night. Not a big deal at all, other than the fact that we were told it would be a 20 minute wait. Our waiter was excellent. Funny, quick, and made up for the extra long wait. The food was delicious... I had the caprese salad and Chicken tortellini. Rachel W. had the mista salad and pumpkin ravioli. The tortellini and ravioli are so large, I would describe them more as dumplings. The food and wait staff service almost pushed me to a five, until I was enjoying my leftovers today and found a small bone in one of my tortellinis. I will plan on going back and will try something without chicken!!
