I had been driving by Irazu for the past year and a half and finally, after seeing people enjoying themselves on the patio on a beautiful summer day for the hundredth time, decided to try it out. We bought wine from Red & White Wines and sat outside on a nice weekend evening. The place was packed as usual, but we were seated quickly. The food was....outstanding. We ordered the ceviche to start. I am a ceviche addict and found their version to be outstanding (the waiter said that the cooks put ginger ale in it...who knew?). I ordered the Casado which could have easily served two people. Everything was excellent, the service was very good (Chris was our server), the pricing is just right, and I can't WAIT to go back for my birthday this month. I'm still drooling about it. Definitely check it out.
