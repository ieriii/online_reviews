After dining here (and at Uno a few months ago outside of Chicago), I realized that I'm not a fan for deep dish pizzas. I'm simply too stuffed after just one slice and I can't distinguish what's good/bad because it's loaded with cheese. I do know that Giordano's dough is less greasy and less crispy than Uno's. This place seems to be always busy, and takes forever to take my order, takes forever to make the pizza, and takes forever to get me my tab. Bleh.
