Noon O Kabab is a nice establishment that offers you healthy and nourishing food. A friend and I rode our bikes here and we were treated very nicely during a busy lunch. They have a menu full of good stuff, but it seems like going with what you know is your best bet. We started out with Hummus, then ordered a grand feast. This consisted of some tabouleh and a mix of all their grilled meats. The meats were very juicy and full of flavor. You get a generous helping of rice and grilled vegetables. I cant recall why, but I didnt find the dill rice as great as many others have. Overall, Noon O Kabab offers up some great kababs, flavorful sides, and a nice atmosphere all around. I wasn't blown away, but they still have some excellent food at reasonable prices.
