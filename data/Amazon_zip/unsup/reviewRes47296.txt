Lockdown features big, 10oz pub-style burgers, and while much of the menu features novelty type burgers--the Warden being the head lining act--you'd do best to steer clear and build your own. I've been a few times now, and my first experience with the Warden ended in disaster. "Fucking Delicious" is how the menu describes it, however, it is pretty disgusting and is a showcase for everything else except the actual beef. Likewise, my girlfriend ordered the Flight risk burger flights, and because of the smaller size, all were dry and overcooked. The second time we visited we kept it simple and fared much better. Despite a lengthy wait to get our meal, bot of our burgers were cooked as ordered, medium and pink throughout inside. There was good amount of juice, and despite my predisposed dislike of the pretzel roll, it did a good job of keeping the burger intact while not imposing too much of it's character on the burger. The grind size was good, not a lot of beefy flavor from this patty. Tasted mostly of chuck. These are big heavy, dense burgers--maybe a touch too chewy. My guess is they are handled a lot during forming prior to cooking. My advice to the purists is to keep it simple to get the most out of Lockdown, however there are better tasting burgers in town. If you love a novelty burger, or just even a big burger then feel free to go nuts here.
