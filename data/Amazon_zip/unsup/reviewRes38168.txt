Yeah, great beer selection if you can get someone to pour it for you. The owners are really nice. This place was better four years ago. Crowds are now kind of annoying. I really cant recall ever receiving as much attitude from a bartender as I did at Hopleaf. Good beer yes, but the bartenders here can fuck off. Really.
