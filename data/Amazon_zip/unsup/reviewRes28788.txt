I was craving spicy something and I yelped, of course. Reading fellow yelper's two cents made me crave this place. Per recommendation, I had the following: Tiger cry- it did taste like Korean bbq Pad Kraw Praow aka Basil Chicken in "hot" spiciness-- this hit the spot My hubby ordered: Spicy Tofu-- Deep fried tofu topped with ground chicken had really good sauce Panang Curry w/ Chicken in "hot" spiciness-- the thick sauce had bits of hot pepper powder floating in it. It was a bit too spicy for me but it had really good flavor. I'll probably come by again next time I'm in the 'hood and craving spicy Thai food.
