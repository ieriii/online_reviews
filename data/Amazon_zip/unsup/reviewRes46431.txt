The Grand Lux is really, really pretty on the inside. My parents recommended it so I went there with a couple friends. It was everything they said it would be. Great atmosphere, delicious food, attentive servers, and timely food. We did have to wait around 25 minutes for a table however. We thought we would avoid it because we got there around 4:30 but I get the feeling the place is crowded regardless of what time you arrive. I orded the spicy buffalo chicken sandich which was really good and not overly spicy. It was juicy and went really well with the fries and coleslaw they serve with sandwiches. I also got to sample the chicken salad sandwich. It consisted of a chicken, celery and green onion blend and didn't have the typical apple and grape compenonts of usual chicken salad mixtures, but I didn't miss it. It was really good. I also got a bite of the avacado burger. The burger was huge and the avacado and cheese gave it a really rich and creamy taste. It's great if you're an avacado person. I also really enjoyed our servers. They were really imformative and pleasant. We were there in the middle of a shift change so our second waitress came up and introduced herself to us which I liked. This is a touristy place. No ifs-ands-or-buts about it. Something to be conscious of if you're looking for a more low key environment. It was no inconvenience to us aside from the long wait time though. It was a great - overall experience.
