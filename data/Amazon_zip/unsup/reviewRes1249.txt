This is where I go to train in my hot-dog speed eating. Here's why: All their hot dogs are more akin to sausages rather than the soft things you get from Vienna Beef. The casing is gamier so it's chewy and the meat is spiced up much more than your average dog. The other sausages are fantastic for training too. Of course, if you're not an aspiring competitive eater, this stuff is great too. The duck fat fries are awesome. I can definitely tell the difference the same way I can tell the difference between Coke/Pepsi. It's a textural difference of crispiness and you can taste the duck like the way you can taste bacon in a carbonara sauce. It helps if you don't eat fries with ketchup or know the taste of duck very well. If you're a ketchup using non-duck eater, don't bother because you probably won't notice the difference. And while I appreciate the complimentary cheese and sauces for their more exotic sausages, might I suggest getting them plain? I find the cheese and sauces to be delicious but overpowering for some of the better sausages. (Digression: I'll never understand Chicagoans and their aversion to ketchup because when you add emerald relish, hot pepper, tomato, celery salt, mustard, onions, and pickle; you are essentially eating a hot-dog flavored salad and the addition of ketchup will barely perverse the flavor of a good dog. If the flavor of the meat is crucial, eat it plain. And if ketchup ruins the flavor so much, why would you add it to everything else but hot dogs? Message me if you care to discuss the finer points of hot dogs and ketchup.) So many places will tell you about how awesome their hot dog is, but if it's a boiled Vienna Beef, what is the difference really? Is it so good you could eat it plain and love it? That's why I love Hot Doug's. The food impresses without being dressed up.
