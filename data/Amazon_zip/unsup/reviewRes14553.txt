This place is awesome!! My husband and I stopped by on a whim. My husband is gluten free and it is hard for us to find a place that is this good and accommodates he dietary restrictions. When we saw the menu there was a variety of options that he could eat which is a rarity. He ordered the bisteak that came with white rice, black beans and plantain and I had the ropa viejo which had the same sides. I have to say it was the best ropa viejo I have ever had and the portion was huge. I took leftovers home and had it for lunch the next day. The food was delicious and the portions were huge. After our meal we had the sweet steamed milk and coffee which was really good. I love this place and cant wait to go back!!
