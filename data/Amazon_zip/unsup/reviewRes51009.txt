Big Jones passed the Southern diner test. The shrimp and grits were absolutely wonderful - perfect mix of hominy, gravy and mushrooms and they don't skimp on the shrimp. Nice array of hot teas on offer. Good service. We went for brunch and there was no wait for a table of 4, but that's probably a fluke. I have to return at night - dinner with sweet tea will be the true test of the authenticity of Big Jones' southern-ness.
