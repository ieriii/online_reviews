I had Giordanos a couple days before I had this. Since it was much bigger and more crowded I thought it would taste better. It didn't...I was disappointed. Their crust has more corn meal in it and I'm not big on corn meal. It was also FREEZING in there. I never been inside an establishment that had their AC on so low, it was summer, but hardly hot compared to what I'm use to in TX.
