I wanted to give 4.5 stars but I guess thats a no-can-do on Yelp. And the only reason that I'm not giving a full 5 stars is because apparently the kitchen messed up one of our pizzas and we had to wait a bit...thought they could've offered to comp it or give us something for the wait. With that being said, everything we tried was AMAZING. The food was sooooo soo good and I'm not a big Italian fan. In fact, I really wasn't looking forward to going but the food was just so delicious...can't say enough about it. I was with a group of 8 and our waitress (who was excellent) suggested we get 12-14 dishes to pass around and share. I didn't try the pork belly or hearts of palms b/c I'm not a big fan but everything else I tried was perfection. The truffle egg toast was unreal! My favorite thing there. I also loved the giant ravioli with spinach and ricotta. Tuscan toast with ricotta and honey comb was also really memorable. It was overall just a really really great experience and I would suggest it to anyone in that area, whether they like Italian or not. I would definitely go back!
