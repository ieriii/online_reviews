Some of the most amazing Chinese food I have eaten in Chicago. Almost everything has been exceptional - though our favorites are the Sole fish fillet with Chili Bean Sauce, the Pork with Cilantro, Twice cooked Pork and the String Beans. Have probably been here more than 50 times. If it were closer, would probably go even more often. Tony and Vincent are the owners and are great. Some folks have mentioned problems being seated... We (usually just 2 of us) have never had a problem with being seated in the order in which we arrived. One just needs to wait in line and let the servers know when you are next. Of late they have started opening up the space upstairs on busy days. Service can be a bit hurried on weekends so weekdays are definitely preferable. Of late even weekdays can get crowded at peak mealtimes. Definitely worth the wait though.
