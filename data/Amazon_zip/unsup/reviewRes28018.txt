This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I have been watching Rick Bayless's show on PBS for several years, and going to his restaurant was one of my first adventures when moving to the city. Frontera definitely does not disappoint.  The selection of margaritas is impressive. They feature both regular and special margaritas. The Topolo Margarita is my favorite, but the sour apple margarita is a fantastic alternative.  All of the food is extremely fresh and inventive. So frequently Mexican restaurants rely too heavily on cheese and lettuce that masks all the flavor. At Frontera the freshness of the ingredients and the classic flavors are allowed to shine.  This place is a must try!
