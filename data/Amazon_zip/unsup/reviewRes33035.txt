Warning: I go to school in NYC near what seems like is populated half by delis and half by Halal places, so this review is inherently biased. Regardless, I will put as unbiased a review as I can. Price = 4/5: While some items such as the drinks ($2 for a pop), hummus ($4), and tabuli ($3.50) are a little bit pricey for the portion size, the sandwiches ($4-6) such as Falafel (3.75) and Lamb Schwarma (5.75) are a great deal. These things come in restaurant-burger size only - hugggeee. Taste = 3/5: Hummus tastes pretty good compared to the store-bought stuff, Tabuli is like every other tabuli I've had. The falafel itself is very crispy and not grainy/coarse like a lot of that frozen junk is, and the lamb shawarma is made from stacks of lamb and an onion on top of the spit instead of a frozen block. The sandwich as a whole, while a very good deal, is nothing special in terms of taste - they only add salad veggies and hummus, no white sauce that is the pride of many halal places, and would be even better with pickled radishes as well. Despite it's drawbacks, this is a great deal for lunch if you're in the area and could use a healthier alternative to meat 'n potatoes.
