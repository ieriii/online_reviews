I scheduled this lunch with a few co-workers and it was a new place for all of us. We all tried a different dish and everyone seemed to like it. I had the Hanger Steak and it was delicous as well as the Ensalada Verde. I would totally go again but this time for dinner and would love to try the place for breakfast as well. The environment is very clean and colorful. Staff was very welcoming and quick to our needs.
