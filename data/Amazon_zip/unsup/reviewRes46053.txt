I love the Grand Lux ! It is one of me and my Fiance' s favorite spots to go for a good meal and ambiance. We first discovered it in 2008 on our birthday and it was really romantic and not too hard on the wallet which I love. The portions are huge ,the service is great, the dress code is laxed. I go there whenever I'm downtown, its on Michigan Avenue and the food is yummy the desserts are what dreams are made of and the drinks are good as well -
