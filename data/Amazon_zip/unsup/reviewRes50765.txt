I have to agree with many other Yelpers. Wishbone is just ok. Crowded, expensive, average....and yes, screaming children (and screaming adults) make the atmosphere less than relaxing. Have tried both the Washington location as well as the now defunct Berwyn spot for both breakfast and dinner. They try, I think, but at this point, Wishbone is not all that much different from Friday's or Olive Garden, etc. That's fine, but don't pretend to be what you are no longer.
