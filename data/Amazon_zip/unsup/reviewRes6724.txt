I wish I could give it more stars, but the more I think about it, the more it really is a 3. The atmosphere is relaxed, but a little too dark and the music playing a little too lous for a restaurant like this, it would be more appropriate for a bar typre restaurant. The waitstaff was very prompt in terms of settin gour table, clearing, and bringing our leftovers, but our main waitress lacked a lot of personality and was not very attentive. The food was good though! They bring out seasoned potato chips and bread and butter pickles where most places bring out bread, my friends and I could not stop munching on them. I ordered the orange blossom martini, perfect, not too sweet, strong, and very flavorfull. For my meal I had the pulled chicken with a side of coleslaw. The chicken had no flavor, and I really had to use a lot of the delicious sauces they brought out on the side. The bun was too soft and too sweet for this type of sandwich. The coleslaw lacked enough seasoning, but was crisp and refreshing, and nice ocunterpart to the other heavier parts of the dish. I will not rush back, but if someone suggests it I will return.
