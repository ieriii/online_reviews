The Violet Hour puts the "swank" in "swank-kay". This place is so on the cool, there is no signage outside. How did I find it? My friend Lee has been dying to go for months. Of course I was game but every time we tried to stop in , there was a line outside. I don't wait in line for too many things (unless you count ferris wheels).  Our solution? We saddled up for a Tuesday night adventure and had no problem getting in. Four of us went and I do not suggest a much larger party. The Speak Easy music was a-pumpin' and I THINK everyone was digging it but I cannot be sure because it was SO DARK inside. I get that the Violet Hour was creating "a mood" but a little more light would be a welcome addition. The cocktail list is pretty amazing. Even though the drink prices are pretty steep, they are DELICIOUS and definitely made right. I chose the Corpse Reviver which immediately revived my love for gin. Oh Bombay Saphire, how I missed you so! The food menu was somewhat odd and limited (curried rice crispy treats? Blech!) but I did taste the prosciutto and fig sandwich - very excellent! Maybe next time I will be more adventurous . . All in all, a good place to visit on a weeknight for a cocktail or two. Pretty pricey, but you pay for what you get - old school fancy pants drinks that do not disappoint!
