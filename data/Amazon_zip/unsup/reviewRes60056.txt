This place isn't terrible. I know everything in Andersonville is automatically cool but I've been there twice now (breakfast on a weekday and Sunday brunch) and it just isn't all that great. Yes it's different. Everything on the menu looks great but it seemed my food was lacking in execution both times. They should learn to prepare greens properly or stop serving them. They aren't a salad and shouldn't be treated as such. I would say the food was more like someone who visited the south and then tried to make food like it. I ordered the "country breakfast" just to sample several things and it seemed like everything came out rushed. Eggs weren't quite done (I like over easy but hey..) and the greens were not cooked enough.The country ham was excellent though. I like the idea and I'd go back for dinner just to see but I don't hold out hope.
