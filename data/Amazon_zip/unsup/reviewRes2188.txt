I only had a hot dog from one other establishment while on my visit to Chicago, but I can safely say that I doubt there is a better hot dog joint in the city. This place was fantastic. And not only because its named after me....or that it has a mascot that kinda looks like me if I was a hot dog. But simply because it was the best damn dog I've ever had (yes, potentially exceding my love for the Guadalahara Dog at Pinks). I went with the Don Rickles (a beef and pork dog with a healthy dose of garlic) Chicago style. I'm an LA boy, so for those of you in LA who don't know what Chicago style is, this puppy was topped with onions, relish (greener then your average relish), sliced tomatoes, mustard, and a dill pickle spear....and this is the key...garnished with Celery salt. Bliss i tell you. Jenny had the Merguez dog with feta cheese and a tomatoe sauce. Not your traditional Merguez but really good. Fries were delish. This place is sorta in the middle of nothin, from what I could tell, but well worth the trip. Seriously, buy a plane ticket today and fly to Chicago simply for a taste of one of these puppies.
