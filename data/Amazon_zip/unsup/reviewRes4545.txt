When someone from out of town asks me what should they see while they're in Chicago, I always recommend the Green Mill. It is legendary, being the hot spot for THE Al Capone. They haven't done much to the interior because the speakeasy ambiance of the 20's still pervades the whole room the minute you walk in. You can't copy this venue, not in a million years. And let's talk about the music...anyone who doesn't like jazz will gain a full appreciation for it if they are exposed to it in this setting. This is one of many environments where jazz made it's full impression, in a room where alcohol was flowing in a smoke-filled room oozing of sassy, sexy saxes or cork-popping trumpets, or deep in the stomach cellos, whether it be big band or syncopated instrumental banter...no art deco here...this is the real shiznit, my friends!! I'll tell you, I think I had my first real orgasm listening to a truly talented sax player hit some really sweet notes...or maybe it was the talented picking of a guest Latin guitarist...don't remember, but for those females who haven't had a discernible orgasm, visit the Green Mill, close your eyes and listen to the music...let it play your body and you tell me!! Right?
