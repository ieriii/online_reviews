I wanted to like this place; I really did. A group of friends from work had made plans to go for about two weeks, and we finally trekked over to Piece on a Friday night. That was our first mistake. I have a feeling that no matter what time we went on that day, it would have been an hour and 15 minute wait - which is exactly how long we ended up waiting. At least they were accurate, right? In the meantime, we had a couple beers. The Golden Arm was good, but it was practically impossible to even get to the bar to order, let alone stand by it and try to have a conversation without getting bumped, poked, and prodded by the people practically running up to get their tables when their names were called. By the time we ordered, around 9:45, I was just ready to eat. I couldn't hear anyone at the booth with me, but luckily we had some entertainment when the waiter spilled beer all over the girl at the table next to us. I felt SO bad for her. Granted, the flavor was great. I'm new to Chicago so I'm not die-hard for deep-dish pizza (yet) and I enjoy a traditional thin crust now and then. And I've never had banana peppers on a pizza, and I thought they tasted great with the pepperoni and black olives. But if I'm going to be eating a thin crust pizza, I'd like it to be a little mroe crispy - I wasn't a fan of the flimsy quality of it and the fact that several toppings kept sliding off onto my lap. I think what deters me most about coming back is the fact that the restaurant and bar aren't separate enough. I liked the beer, I liked the pizza, but the bar and restaurant essentially blend into one another and the noise, lack of space, and wait time just killed it for me.
