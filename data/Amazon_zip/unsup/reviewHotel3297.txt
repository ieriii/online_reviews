I'd definitely stay here again. They've got a great restaurant in the building, nicely decorated rooms and a convenient location. My only complaint was the music options in the room. You would think the hard rock hotel would at least have some way to play your iPod in the room. But no. They did have a 6 disc CD changer and Sony receiver, but unfortunately I didn't bring my CD collection with me to the hotel. Come on guys, its 2009, the least you could do is offer up one of those clock radios that has a dock for an ipod. It's a minor complaint, but I'd really expect a hotel who's theme is music to not be stuck in the 1990s. Next time I guess I'll bring a few Pixies and Dinosaur Jr CDs so I can at least use their equipment...
