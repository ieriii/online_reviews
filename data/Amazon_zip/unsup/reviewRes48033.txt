The Publican is a foodie meat fever dream. Set in a bright (almost too bright as to create a bit of glaring ambiance) wood-toned space diners eat at either communal tables or in "stalls" (booths with odd, awkward wood doors that close you in and require servers and waitstaff to crane and reach over to serve and access finished plates. I'm sure they hate this design feature. The food is small tasting plates mostly with a fantastic charcuterie, some of the best sweetbreads (actually sweet!) I've ever eaten and some sublime fish plates as well. The most amazing thing of all was likely the simplest: roasted chicken. GET IT! It's a little bit of delicious heaven on a sharing platter.
