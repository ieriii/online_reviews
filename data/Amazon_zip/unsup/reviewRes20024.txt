I went here with a small group of friends and had a great night. We were literally there until closing. That being said, BYOB is without a doubt the best thing in the world. It certainly made for a more affordable experience. Our waitress was super nice and didn't say anything about the fact that we had more bottles then allowed (yes-there are rules posted about how much alcohol you can have at the table). The sushi itself was great. Very few restaurants in the city have albacore (which is not pan seared) so I was in heaven when I saw it on the menu. My only complaint is this: We all clearly ordered our rolls separately due to allergies and food restrictions. When the food came, it was all on one plate. It would have been nice just to check first to make sure that the food could be put on a single plate. Plus it wasn't grouped together correctly. I had one roll on the left and one way over on the other side. That's it...that's the only problem that I had. Nothing to deter me from going back.
