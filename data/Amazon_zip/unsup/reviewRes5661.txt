Although it is supposed to be served tapas style, it is viable to eat individually with just a bit of sharing. I had the famous milk-braised pork shoulder and it was delicious. The cut of meat was of a good size too, but don't be fooled by the "and mashed potatoes" bit. The mashed potatoe is literally a thin paste on the bottom of the tray, and is used basically to mositen the meat. It was good, but it was only one spoonful :( The others in party did not enjoy their meals as much. They had the pork steak and the chicken kebobs, and while they weren't bad, they were supposedly nothing special. Still, a decently cheap eat, and for that I give it 4 stars.
