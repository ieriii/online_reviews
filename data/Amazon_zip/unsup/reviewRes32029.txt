I didn't really realize how lucky I was to live near this place for years, now I miss it like crazy. Being from Chicago has definitely spoiled me, where food is concerned. Out of the dozens of places I miss terribly, Chicago Diner is on the top of my list for lunch when I'm back in town. It's SO nice to have vegetarian food that does not focus too heavily on eggs & cheese, and a place that features vegan food with consistently excellent quality. The service ranges from great to semi-terrible, but the restaurant still merits max stars because the food is always spot on, fairly priced, and pretty much everything can be made vegan. The vegan gyro is one of the best gyros I've ever had in my life, and I'm a big eater of gyros. It's seriously not to be missed, if you like that kind of thing, I'd make a trip just for that sammitch. The atmosphere is kitsch diner cutey without being overly goofball or pretentious, casual but not so much that it seems to be catering to drunks, people afraid of food, trendy college dorks, or newly-veg hipster pests. They've been doing a brisk business in this location for fricking ever, because they do one basic thing, veg-based diner food, but do it just right. (Meat free since '83 and serving folks who have been likewise meat free for that long.) They don' t always facilitate speedy service as much as they might, and over the years I've had a few ditsy servers, but never one who seemed too dirty or too stoned for work. I wish they could deliver to Madison, WI; it's a beautiful town in some ways, but our veg restaurant options up here are mostly sub par. Miss you like crazy Chicago Diner.
