This place is absolute money in the bank. You can often judge a Mexican restaurant based on the quality of the free pre-dinner items; the fresh chips, mild pico de gallo, fiery tomatillo salsa, and homemade pickled vegetables were all amazing, as was the complimentary, unsolicited beef and potato flauta (let it be known that Nuevo Leon is likely the least expensive restaurant ever to offer an amuse bouche). The food itself was spectacular - I went with carne asada and chorizo tostadas, topped with refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, guacamole, and sour cream. Amazing, and at $6 for 3 tostadas I felt like I was stealing it from them. My lone gripe is with the guacamole, which was pureed rather than chunky (as is my preference). Apparently, the puree is more authentic, but I still have an aversion to pureed guacamole for some reason. All in all: an incredibly solid option for that stands out even among the seemingly endless plethora of delicious Mexican joints in Pilsen. I'll be back often, and I may end up weighing as much as a house as a result.
