I was never a big fan of Brazilian steakhouses and thought it'd just be too much meat and thought I would never enjoy anything there. My ZED451 experience tonight changed my mind. I didn't know what to expect going to ZED and started with some soup and salad from the bar. The food from the bar was not like any salad bar. The food was nicely presented and properly heated (and of course they were delicious). Then the meat started coming around and I had the Moroccan Chicken first. I never liked chicken breasts because they were always too dry but this chicken was very very moist. The honey and ginger sauce covering the chicken gives it a really nice taste. The rest of the dinner continued to surprise me. Food that I had and really enjoyed tonight: - Tomato Bisque (Market Soups) - Fire Roasted Vegetables - Asian Pork Belly - Hardwood Grilled Citrus Wild Salmon - Moroccan Chicken - Pork Sausage with horseradish honey mustard Definitely will return. Really good food and great service.
