Visited Chicago in October, this place was recommended by a coworker. Seriously the only glimmer of a complaint I have is that it's a little hard to see from the street. We took a cab (it was POURING) and he didn't know where it was and the sign is virtually impossible to read from Michigan.  Once we were inside, I was amazed. We arrived earlier than our reservation so we sat at the downstairs bars for a couple beers. Great atmosphere, friendly bartender. The hostess seated us in a cozy little half booth by the window. We knew what we were going to order before we got there--the chef's selection.  So, the first thing we got was a little charcuterie plate that had CARAMEL BACON SAUCE. yes, you read that right. caramel + bacon in a sauce, with bread and cheese. I was in love at first bite, literally. From there we had an amazing array of tapas that ended with a steak that was cooked to absolute medium-rare perfection. I have been raving about this place to everyone and anyone that will listen since I am now back in Colorado and hope to visit Mercat a la Planxa every time I'm in the windy city.
