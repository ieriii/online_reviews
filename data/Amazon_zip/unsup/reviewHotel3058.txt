I've stayed at aLoft hotels in the past, and always wanted a chance to stay at the chain on which the aLoft concept is based. Lots of glitz and glamor, lots of hip and trendy-looking architecture and amenities (showers without doors, flat-screen TV's, etc.); but overall the service was no better than comparable hotel chains. The best feature of this hotel is its location. The views of Lake Michigan and Navy Pier are spectacular. W Hotels seem to attract a certain clientele. Young, "hip," narcissistic, club-hopping Gen Y alcoholics. To be fair, it may have been this location, but I felt like I was at a meat market. Plus, I was awakened at 3:00am one night by a large and loud group of people looking to "continue the party" in someone's room next door to me. So if you just need a place to stay during business meetings, this W isn't worth all the pretentiousness. Any of the Kimpton hotels in the area offer much better value (and much better personal service) for the price. But if hip and trendy is important, if you want to see and be seen, W could be for you. But I won't be back... at least voluntarily.
