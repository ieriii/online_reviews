This place was great when it first opened up. However, it has suffered both in the quality of the Sushi and the service. It is sad that after living in Edgewater for over 20 years, a quality Asian restaurant opened up and fell from grace so soon. First off, I can thank Indie Cafe for the fact that I will never order any type of Sushi with crab meat ever again. Secondly, every time that I've ordered carry-out in the last 6 months they have screwed it up. Rather than correct their consistent screw-ups, Indie Cafe offers me "$2.00 off of my next order." As if!!!!!!!!!!!! When it comes to dining in, they screw things up as simple as the order the food should be brought. Since when are appetizers served after the main course?!? And when it comes to the maki rolls, their menu ingredients don't necessarily translate to what is actually served. It's so sad to say that I'm done with this place. Now I will drive to lincoln square to get good sushi and service.
