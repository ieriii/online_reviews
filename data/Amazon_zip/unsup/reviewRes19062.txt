In search of a new gastropub I tried out Gage with my partner in crime one Saturday night and was very pleased. The service was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and prompt. I do have one question regarding the male employees.....are they required to have a mustache? The price for the food was phenomenal....comparable places would charge much more. My husband and I shared the seared scallops for an appetizer which consisted of only two scallops but they were both very big and definitely worth it. For our entrees I had the Caramelized Lobster Pumpkin, Lemon Quinoa, Basil, Chili which was as beautiful on my plate as it was to taste. The lobster was stuffed inside a miniature cooked pumpkin surrounded by the quinoa and drizzled with the chili sauce. All of the flavors complemented each other very nicely and made for an exciting array of zest. My husband ordered the Wild Striped Bass Cauliflower, Pomegranate, Pickled Shallot. The addition of the pomegranate was a wonderful accompaniment to the dish especially since it is not commonly seen within most dinners. I will be back to this favorite time and time again.....
