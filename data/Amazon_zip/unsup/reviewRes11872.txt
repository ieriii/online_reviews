After hearing rave reviews from my coworkers, Bongo Room is one of the best brunch places I've ever been to!!!! My girlfriend had just called off her wedding and this was the perfect place to eat her feelings away! Everything was amazing. We had the red velvet pancakes, brown sugar & fruit french toast, caramel vanilla pretzel pancakes, and a breakfast burrito. It is the perfect indulgence for a girls get together. Waitress was enthusiastic and helpful. Can't wait to go back!!!
