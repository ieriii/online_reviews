I love the food but hate the fact the the space seems cramped. This place is always busy during off work hours (at least for me). The sandwishes are great and the soups are even better. My wife and I shared the pepito tortas and carnitas caldos. For dessert I had a cholate shot and the churros. Those things were just like the ones I had in Barcelona (very good). This place is a little pricey for a sandwich shop, but I want to go back soon.
