I went here with two friends on a snowy/rainy Saturday around 1:30 PM. The place was packed but the wait didn't exceed 15 minutes. The place is very organized and clean, and the staff are very friendly. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I found it very refreshing as I've never tried Tex-mex brunch. The jalapenos were mildly spicy and I like how they topped it with an over-easy egg.
