I have had breakfast and dinner several times here in the past two years, and last night enjoyed the extra bonus of the Lovely and beautiful Gayle Ritt performing her soulful music! As usual, the food was great and the atmosphere warm and pleasant. I had the mushroom-filled pasta paired with sauteed spinach, which was nicely infused with garlic! During Gayle's break, I was inspired to create a drink while observing a gal in an orange dress...a White Russian with Stoli Oranj. Not bad, huh? Well, then while I'm sipping it, she sits across my table to watch Gayle and introduces herself...turns out she is one of the owners. What a fantastic woman! It was very interesting learning about the history of her establishment, and it impressed me how much she puts her heart into her endeavors! Fantastic evening all around...it IS all about LOVE!
