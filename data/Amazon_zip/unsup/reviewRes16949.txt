What looked out at the onset to be a tasty great looking meal became a major disappointment. If this is the best Chicago can do on Indian cuisine, I feel sorry for Chi-town. No Flavor, Over priced. Lets just say if the Naan isn't very good that's a tell tale sign. This was all more of an Indian themed meal than a true Indian dinner. I had the India special dinner that sampled most of their signature dishes. Again, everything looked great but the flavors were a big disappointment. The complexity and depth of flavor was not there and each dish was boring and very one dimensional at best. Living much of my life in Toronto, I have come to know great Indian cuisine, and this was not close. Typically one can taste a multitude of sweet and savory though a carnival of fresh spices. It almost tasted like all the spices were stale and lost their normal luster. With the high prices I expected much more. This was a first that I tossed my leftovers rather than eating everything that night or saving them for a great follow up snack! I am sorry to say I have to give my meal a thumbs down. Anybody who thought this place was great is most likely used to eating there Indian food by Lean Cuisine, or Chef-Boyardee.
