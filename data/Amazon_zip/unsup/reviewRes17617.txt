Nom nom nom. This was my first introduction to Indian food and I fear nothing will compare! I dreamed of the naan for months afterwards. All the dishes I tried were great, can't remember exactly but there were some tikka masalas and some vidaloos in there. Listen to me- I'm still new to this cuisine, okay? I recommend taking your out-of-town friends here and keeping all the leftovers.
