Great North Michigan Ave. location. Had a fantastic corner room with a room of the bay and partial skyline. The room was very well appointed. My biggest negative is that they have no wi-fi access in the rooms, only the lobby area. Although they did have a hard wired internet connection that you could connect to your laptop at the work-desk. The bellmen at the door are fantastic. Always quick to get a cab and help you in and out. The hotel seemed to have been recently refurbished. Very nice condition for such an old historic location. I will definitely be back.
