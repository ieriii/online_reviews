I went to a party at this bar & grill yesterday and it was a very pleasant surprise. After getting over the fact there was no neon sign in front, but you need to know where you are going to find the place, I found a clean, simple and comfortable bar.  I did not expect the food to be so good - the chicken breasts and the sausage entrees are exceptional. The bread is baked fresh. The first hint your food will be above average is the professionally dressed chef - no grease cook here.  I also didn't think the prices were bad and the bottled beer was wonderfully cold - this side of frozen. Perfect ! This bar & grill is an oasis in an industrial 'hood.
