Another one of my indulgences is brunch. A mimosa or bellini, a divinely prepared omelette or eggs benedict...yum.  Yet, I've struggeld to find this sort of experience...until now. This is my third visit to the Atwood Cafe for brunch and I am now convinced. This is a marvelous, little gem! The food is wonderful, the service superb and the mimosas are appropriately tasty. Even more importantly, unlike some of the other brunch/breakfast places, you can make a reservation, the prices are incredibly cheap and space is wonderfully decorated. Add the cute valet (that resembles Will Smith), the waiter with the catty...yet adorable accent, and you have the perfect Sunday afternoon.
