All I want to say is Chicken and Waffles. But that wouldn't help you decide if you should go to Longman & Eagle. Or would it...? First off, I'll admit I was a little confused. While the interior is pleasant, kinda modern day saloon, it didn't match up with what I felt was a nod towards fine dining. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I just couldn't tell if I should be taking it more seriously or going with the flow. I went for brunch with my folks on a Friday around 11. Two complaints up front: my coffee was lukewarm (at best) and the room itself was kinda cold. Other than that though, I have nothing but good things to say. I've never eaten chicken and waffles, and I'm sure this is classed up to the point of being unrecognized. Whatever. It was AMAZING. The maple syrup oozed into the juicy chicken giving it an almost teriyaki type flavor. Oh, and it was served with a side of porky belly sweet potato hash. Yes, it was as good as it sounds. Mom had the Monte Cristo and dad enjoyed the PBR breakfast minus the PBR. They cooked his bacon extra crisp like he requested and didn't seem to notice (or care) about the difference between their one hour eggs as opposed to his desired poached. I can't wait to go back for dinner and drinks...but probably with different company.
