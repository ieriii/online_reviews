I already feel lost in the crowd of praise for L&E but here goes! LOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVELOVE...did I mention I loved it? Pat with homemade giardinera?! Fuck me silly! my friend doesn't eat shrimp heads so I got ALL OF HERS and they were delectable! Drench it with sauce and you don't care that people are starring cuz you're sucking at the shrimp head so loud you forget all other troubles. Pork Belly! It's tiny but it's oh so rich...but yes, I could eat 3 of them in one sitting and still make room for more pat And although it's pretty obvious I'm a carnivore, even I enjoyed the vegetarian small plates...although not as much as the duck liver with MORELS! It goes without saying that all the cocktails are fabulous but the gin fizz was the perfect drink for a beautiful evening in their outdoor patio! p.s. here's a tip. Come on Monday night and there's no wait! so..would I seem too needy if I returned on Wednesday?
