They do have a ton of beer here so if that's your thing, you need to go here. Personally, I think beer snobs are worse than wine snobs and one of the bartenders was particularly lame. Am I supposed to be knowledgeable about every beer that every country makes?!?! Our waitress was eh...not very enthused but I wouldn't be either considering it is so crowded there. However, we're still tipping you so maybe come around a lil more often. Let's talk about the food. The mussells were great! My steak was not. It was huge but the texture was terrible and not seasoned well.  It's a great place to go to hang with friends and try new beers but expect a wait and maybe a bit of an attitude.
