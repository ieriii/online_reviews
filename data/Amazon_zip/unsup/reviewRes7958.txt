Well it sure is a lot of meat, isn't it? To me, this place will always be tied to finding out I was pregnant. The day before the pregnancy test (the Walgreens kind) my husband & I went to Fogo de Chao with another couple. I ate an amazing amount of meat... more than my husband and almost as much as the other guy we were with! I couldn't figure out why... until the next day when I finally did the math and went and got that kit. When my daughter's a bit older, maybe I'll take her here and tell her the story of the time Mommy out-ate the guys at the meat joint (normally I don't each much of the stuff). In general though, you have to be a big guy (or a pregnant woman) to get your money's worth here. But the food is pretty tasty.
