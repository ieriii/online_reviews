You've got to be kidding me! I have been coming here for almost two years and while I am obsessed with the Buddha bowl's I had no idea how amazing the chicken is! I mean I am salivating just thinking about it. That is some phenomenal chicken you have Mr. Crisp! I guess I'll be back to order family style for myself very soon!
