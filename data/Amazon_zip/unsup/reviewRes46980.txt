Uncommon Ground on Devon became my newest weekend brunch spot this summer. The interior of the restaurant is nice, feels almost like a nice art gallery, complete with exposed brick walls, high ceilings and plenty of artwork on display. The bar area with its comfy lounge seating and fireplace is a nice spot to hangout during the cold months. They have a well-publicized rooftop garden and they incorporate as much of the harvested produce as possible into their menu. It appears they also utilize solar panels for part of their energy needs. I think more businesses should follow this restaurant's lead in doing their part to become more environmentally responsible. The one thing that keeps me coming back for brunch is the ever-changing menu as the seasons change. I've had everything from the Rooftop Tomato Scramble (bummer, already discontinued) to the Montana Omelet and everything I've tried thus far has been amazing. The produce used in the dishes are about as fresh as it gets. A friend had the Sweet Potato Fries with his sandwich, which he said were outstanding. They also offer a menu of interesting brunch drinks. The service is not rushed or exceptionally fast, but has always been very friendly and they make sure to keep your coffee cup filled as well.
