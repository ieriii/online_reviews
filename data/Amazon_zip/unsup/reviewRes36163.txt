Now Meli's is what I call the top 5..... What's top 5? Kinda like they are influential all over the Chicago Seaboard and everybody knows their name. Or rather, for breakfast that is!.... If Barbara Walter's had a special on the most influential breakfast in Chicago, this would make the list. Along with places that rhymes with H-Menry, and Polk, and Tongo Room! What? I'm just saying! Unfortunately, I made a wrong choice in Choosing A instead of B on my menu choice. Don't get me wrong, everything was good but I was expecting a lot better when I hear of Meli's. I'm going to once again break it down Barney Style of what was good and bad Good: Toast with the honey butter, jam and berry compote...A+ Carrot, apple, grapefruit juice blend....A Sun dried tomato vege Omelette....A- Location and ambience: Very great place to dine and close to UIC...A+ Mediocre: Vegetarian Eggs Benedict....C (Thought it was too messy and flavors didn't mesh very well together. Never had benedict before so I don't know what to compare it to?) Baby Red Potatoes......C ( Potatoes are lukewarm and not crispy like I like them, and the meal came out way too fast after placing the order. I hope it wasn't pre-made and set out with my dish. But then again, I would not be surprised if it was) Overall, I will visit this place again. The menu looks fantastic with tons of variety which is different from a lot of the breakfast places I usually frequent. So I will try you again Meli, but this time..... NO COLD SOGGY POTATOES.... yah, Hear! P.s. Wait was 30 Minutes on a Saturday morning around noon
