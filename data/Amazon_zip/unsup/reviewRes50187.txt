Fifty/50 has passable bar food like burgers, sandwiches, wings etc. The bacon mac 'n' cheese is above par as it's not too heavy. They also put breadcrumbs on top so it gives it a nice texture and crunch. The meatball sandwich looked good but the meatball was cold on the inside and looked undercooked. I told the waitress and she checked out the situation. She returned and said that the chef said that is how they are supposed to be since they use pork The waitress asked if I wanted another sandwich and then I ordered the BBBLT. I got it to-go since while I was waiting, I became full. I am inthe middle of eating it right now and it is one of the best BLT's I've had. They are extremely generous with the bacon - I think they have an underground supplier. BTW, our waitress was very accommodating and quick. I've also been here for drinks and I recommend doing that.
