This is the second I've been here. While the first time was great, the second time was phenomenal!! First time, I ordered a la carte. This time, I ordered the tasting menu, which was incredible!! The truffle popcorn was fantastic and you won't find anything like it anywhere else. The tasting menu consisted of the caesar, a corn bisque, halibut w/ mushrooms and asparagus, waygu beef w/ fingerlings and desssert that had chocolate. My favorites were the halibut and the wagyu. However, I was already full after the soup course, but I couldn't stop there, due to how wonderful the next 2 courses were! They have 4 different tasting menu options and I presume they are all fabulous! Each one has more options than the last. However, I chose the smallest one b/c I didn't feel like sitting there for hours and hours. If you have a lot of time on your hands, opt for a larger tasting menu and you won't be disappointed!!
