I've been meaning to try Purple Pig for a while. Every time I went shopping on Michigan Ave, I would pass by and wonder what a restaurant by that name could possibly be like. Before I read reviews, I was expecting some sort of hokey BBQ joint -- instead I found that it is a classy sort wine-cellar, hang around the kitchen and enjoy great food type of place. Their kitchen is the size of a basic home kitchen - it's so impressive that they can get everyone out so quickly for so many tables.  The minus one star is for communal seating, of which I am not a fan (the man across from us had a cold and kept sniffling very loudly, which was really disgusting), and also for not serving martinis. We knew we wanted pork shoulder, but were unsure about anything else. We asked our waitress - who was really nice btw - for suggestions and ordered everything she recommended. Great choices!! The gist: - tapas style Mediterranean (Italian/Greek/Spanish) food - delicious pork shoulder with mashed potato - I could have eaten two of these orders easily! I wanted to lick the bowl. Okay, that makes me sound like a pig, lol, but really, it's that good. - smears... the descriptions do not sound appetizing - pork neck, really? That sounds depressing. OMG it was soooo good. - sepia, a type of squid. I never heard of it before, but I like calamari, so we gave it a try. It was served in a lemony juice with almonds. It was delicious! - prosciutto balls were good, but not on the same level as everything else. - dessert: Nutella, banana and marshmallow sandwiches (one order is big enough for two, too big for just one) So simply and yummy. I'll definitely be back, but probably will wait for an individual table.
