The Purple Pig is adorable -- and fills a much needed void on this portion of the Mag Mile. The atmosphere is perfect for an after work drink and a couple of small plates. The asaparagus salad, fried manchego and tune proscuitto with piquillo peppers are all worth trying. Minus one point for the service. The hostess was lovely, but we sat at the bar and I found the waitresses behind it to be unhelpful and stand-offish.
