All I can tell you right now is that, if you are a Carnivore, with the capital "C", you must GO. Really fantastic, expensive and worth it. If you are from the west coast, we've yet to get Fogo, so gogo! (I couldn't resist) ....FOURTEEN different cuts of the highest quality beef, interspersed with chicken, pork and linguica sausage....all you can eat. Dinner, $50. A week later, I am still feeling the effects of eating a jungle of gourmet salad and a side of beef. I have yet to forgive fellow yelper, Tricia L., who is an amazing reviewer - for hipping me to this place. It "put me over the edge", as they say. I think Tricia said something about a "meat baby", disgusting and apropos.  I can't wait to get back to Chi-town for another pass.
