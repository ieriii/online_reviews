Good lord is this place fantastic. Me and two others went last night, and we had:  1. crab rangoon--fantastic. best crab rangoon I've had in a long time. 2. gyoza--also very nice.  3. tom yum soup--really nice complex flavor, served at the right temperature, and I heard the shrimp was cooked well. 4. 3 sushi rolls--boston, spicy salmon, and shrimp tempura--good balance of ingredients, the fish was not overpowered 5. Signature curry--i can't even describe how delicious this is. The meat is fork tender. 6. Mango cheesecake--light, sweet, flavorful, creamy 7. Mango sorbet, tasted very fresh All this for $50 :O I'm moving back to edgewater/rogers park and I cannot wait to visit this restaurant on a regular basis. UPDATE 6/28/08 well, We were here fri night and I have to knock a star off. -crab rangoon was good as always -tom yum soup had all kinds of bits in it's broth that should have been strained out -sushi was warm as though it had been sitting out a while -my partner's beef had a ton of fat all over it. We actually thought it wasn't worth th $50 for the two of us. And that makes me sad. I hope this was just an off night and not what Indie's turning into.
