This hotel is definitely in a prime location on the mag-mile. That being said, watch out for the homeless people that prey on tourists over here after dark. Lol. That aside, the hotel itself is good. I mean, it's standard. Now that I've been living in Chicago for the past few years I have been to way nicer hotels, but for the price and the location, the Hilton Garden Inn has much to offer. The pool is very clean and the business center is completely accessible. The service was good and everyone was pretty friendly. Even at 5 AM when we checked out, the person on duty was very attentive and helpful. Also, I need to add that the Weber Grill attached to the building is definitely tastey and convenient. As far as I know, the Hilton Garden Inn does not offer as many local discounts as some of the other Hilton hotels in the area (like the Palmer House). It is nicely decorated, but isn't by any means any competition to the Wit, James, Palmer House, Drake, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this hotel at all and it offered some pretty fantastic views of downtown Chicago.
