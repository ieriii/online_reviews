This place is supposedly famous for their falafels. Um, that's quite sad. Grandma Zarifa also can't make a lentil soup - it's not hot, it's not seasoned, and it tastes like barley in some watered down cream soup. I'd rather go to Pita Inn. At least they had an outside seating arrangement so you can take your food outside (as well as your pet(s)). Service was efficient, but the place isn't worth the trek.
