I have read some of the negative reviews on here and I don't agree at all!!! This is the 2nd W Hotel that I have stayed in, the 1st being in Manhattan, and I really like this hotel!! And I'm not a podunk!! The hotel is very modern and the beds are VERY comfy!! And, the bliss products are great! We were on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan and the Navy Pier. Now, we didn't understand the swinging wooden doors between the bathroom and the room but it didn't bother us enough to complain about it. We just thought it odd. We were there just to have a girls weekend and when we asked the Whatever Whatever staff on suggestions on night life they were very helpful and sent us to some great shows and made the reservations and arranged a car to take us there! They were a gem on both nights that we wanted to go out!! We travel a lot and I will be checking out the W's in other cities as well!! If you want a fun, modern and lively hotel with a GREAT staff in Chicago....here's your hotel!!
