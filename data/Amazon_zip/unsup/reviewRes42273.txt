One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Food is fresh and cheap. The pho and sandwiches are excellent and you get a good amount of food for the price. Like the coffee, but think it is better at Tai Nam. Service is decent. You have to be wiling to share a table if you are a party of two -- which is fine. Go for the food, not the atmosphere.
