A bit on a pricey side, but their food makes up for it. Their menu boasts many interesting choices such as rabbit ravioli or gnocchi with calamari ink. I was not bold enough to try the rabbit ravioli but had the gnocchi. It was not exactly what I expected (pasta with pitch-black pasta sauce that would dye my teeth in black), but it was clear they went lavish with ingredients. Overall, a great place with great food and atmosphere. No complaints.
