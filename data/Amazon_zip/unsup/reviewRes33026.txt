Wanted to offer a little reality to some of the raves here. The food ordered fresh from the counter is definitely pretty good, as are the items from the cold side of the salad bar (love the dolmades!). However, the stuff on the hot buffet side had obviously been sitting way too long on the recent evening when we were there. It was very unappetizing to look at and I don't understand why they would leave it there, since nobody was eating any of it. This is a popular place, and I did not find the service speedy, which was especially problematic on a very warm evening (the other room, away from the grill, was much more comfortable). Other than the dolmades, my favorite here was the hummus. The pita bread, unfortunately is just ordinary stuff you can get in any grocery store and it is served cold. Prices are OK in my opinion.
