My experience at Bin 36 was an all-around success. The food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the beet ravioli and was disappointed when I found out it was seasonal- guess there's always next year. The wait staff was very knowledgeable of wine and made me feel comfortable, especially since I knew very little- I was never disappointed with what they recommended. I loved the open atmosphere and even managed to meet a couple people while dining. I will definitely continue going to this restaurant.
