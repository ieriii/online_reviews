The food was okay, standard brunch food. But the manager was downright racist and rude. My vegetarian friend found meat in his vegetarian omelet and had it sent back, wanting a new one and the manager came over and said that he was sure my friend's god would be okay if he had meat once in awhile.  I grew up in a rural town and I couldn't believe that I had to come to Chicago, a large and diverse city to find this kind of intolerant behavior. If you have never eaten here, it's totally not worth it. You could get better brunch elsewhere, and support some nicer people.
