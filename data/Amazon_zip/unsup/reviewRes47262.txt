I really really really did not want to do this... I love the food here, the owner is awesome. The service was so unbelievably awful, I cannot even tell you. We ordered our drinks not once, but twice. NEVER came. We switched from a table to the bar, but were instructed that wouldn't be a problem. As we waited for food and drinks, we witness our waitress doing a shot. Wonderful. Our food arrives, still no drinks. The food was beyond amazing. Both of us were insanely pleased with the food. Why did our service have to be so bad!? We wanted to love this place! We never got checked on the whole time we ate. About 15 minutes after we finished, the waitress asked us how everything was. I told her we never got our drinks. Instead of being apologetic, she said she would then go get our beers, I then told her we no longer wanted them, then with a smug look, she announced she'd bring the bill, and the drinks were never added to the bill, anyway. Hmmmm... I wonder why!? Maybe because you forgot to put them in both times!? We never got an apology, our even a smile. Also, no one else asked if we were ok the whole time, although it was quite obvious we were upset and looking for some kind of service.
