Good food for cheap prices! Huge pitas! I really like the chicken schwarmma sandwich with hummus. You can make all the pitas spicy if you want too! The hummus is really really good. Other things I like: the falafel, tabouleh, and I've heard the lamb kebab is good. During the summer, there's a bunch of outdoor tables. Inside is a little cramped and not terribly appealing. It doesn't really need to be though; the food sells itself! The Sultans in Lincoln Park is almost as good, but has only a few seats and is a little cleaner, cuter and less crowded.
