Don't mess around with Chicago dogs or their cutesy celebrity dogs here, aim straight for Today's Specials or the Game of the Week. It's a good thing there's a line, else I would never have time to weigh the relative benefits of eating elk sausage with forest berry mustard vs. smoked chorizo in a tomatillo mole. Gives you time to pull yourself together. The duck fries are overrated.
