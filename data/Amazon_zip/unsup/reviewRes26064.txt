I really liked Geja's. It lived up to it's hype. I can't imagine it as being somewhere I would go too often because the menu was limited. It can't be so vast because of the fondue nature, but the food, service and atmosphere was phenomenal. My husband and I had three courses and a lovely bottle of red. It's been a while - think it's time to use that groupon!
