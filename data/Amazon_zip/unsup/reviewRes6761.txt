Service was much better on my last visit, and for the first time, I expanded my horizons and tried out the kobe chopped brisket sammich instead of my usual pulled pork. It was juicy, mouth-wateringly great meat, but a little fatty. I highly reco the jalapeno cheddar cornbread! Another new dish I tried was the braised green side. Yes, it was $7, but it's enough to last 3 meals. Mmm, makes me want to eat veggies more. I can't wait to come back to try out something from the dessert menu.
