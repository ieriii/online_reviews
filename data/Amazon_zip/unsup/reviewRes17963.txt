There's nothing better than rolling into a bar and being intimidated by their beer list. I mean that in a good way. I love a place that challenges me to pick something outside of my normal favorite beers. Their proximity to Half Acre means they get some great local brews. We went on a weeknight and I was surprised how crowded it was. Not uncomfortably so, just enough to let you know people like to come to Bad Apple! The burgers were ridiculous. Great size and great toppings. It's like a less annoying an pretentious Kuma's Burgers. Good fries as well. It's right down the street from our new place, which is a problem because we will definitely be back.
