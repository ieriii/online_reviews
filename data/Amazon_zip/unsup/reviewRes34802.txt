Based on some good online reviews my two friends and I decided to try this place out on Saturday night. We walked into a small dark place, with one wall being a huge screen that was showing anime the whole time. It was a bit crowded for a Saturday night but there was an open table - we had to wait over 5 minutes for one of the two waitresses working that night to come out from behind the counter wall to seat us. Once we were seated we had trouble reading the menus with the very dim lighting - I'd suggest they reprint their menus (without the black background and 4 point tiny gray font). Once the waitress came back to our table to actually take our order (at least 10 minutes after we sat down) things got better. We ordered miso soup and edamame which came out relatively quickly. The miso was excellent and just hot enough to enjoy. Edamame was standard, but that's hard to mess up. They brought us two buckets of ice for our two bottles of wine - unfortunately we had just bought them, so not enough time to chill. Suggest you bring chilled wine... We ordered 4 rolls which were amazing: Spicy tuna, Reg Dragon, Double Stack, and Spider Roll. All were fantastic. Will definitely go back if I'm in the area to try more rolls.  Funny that someone below mentioned they had no ice...by the end of our meal they ran out of ice too! Pros: Great rolls & not too expensive Cons: Inconsistent service (once at your table they were nice though) & weird atmosphere
