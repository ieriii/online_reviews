'...wakin' up too early maybe we can sleep in i'll make you banana pancakes pretend like it's the weekend now" i had the bacon and cheddar omlette a glass of orange juice (blood orange) and we all shared the oreo banana pancakes (really good..not too sweet). wifey had the lump crab benedict that was very rich...visable pieces of crab...not bad. the food here is pretty pricey for breakfast/brunch...but overall it was pretty good. we just stumbled upon this place after walking around shopping. i do suggest going early as this place gets really busy. not the best spot for groups over 4. i really don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant. as a first-timer i had a good experience. check the website for prices ahead of time or ask for a menu before you sit down if you're looking for cheap eats.
