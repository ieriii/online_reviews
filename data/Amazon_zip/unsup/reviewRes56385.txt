I'm a pretty frequent visitor, this place is always fantastic each and every single time I come.The food is deliciously fresh, I'm always really fond of the coconut and mango beef. however this weekend they offered a very delicious dungeoness Crab which is not usually offered but Tuan (the owner) put it on the menu just for this weekend only.It was amazing! delicious, and scrumptious!I'm pretty picky with seafood but this was absolutely amazing, and with brown rice it made the meal taste all the better.now I'm mouth watering for some more... yummmm
