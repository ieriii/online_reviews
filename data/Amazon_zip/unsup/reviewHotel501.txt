Good location, right near Navy Pier. Great view from our room facing the lake. However there was NOTHING fancy about the room, it was the exact one you get at a Country Inn & Suites suite for a lot less. It was weird to have to take an elevator to the lobby, then another to the room. There were kids everywhere. Too many kids, you would think there was a water park in it or something. I'm a Mom myself but this was a kid-free (our own at least) girls trip with 4 of my friends (we all fit in the room fine btw) and I wasn't in the mood to deal with apparently orphaned kids running amok, with parents nowhere in sight. A group of 4 or 5 kids decided to sit on the floor in the hallway in front of their room 2 doors down from us and hang out. At 10:30 p.m. We went to use the Jacuzzi, it it was full of..you guessed it, kids. More like teenagers but still kids! Also at 10:30 p.m. I called the front desk, who said they would call security and make them leave since kids weren't supposed to be in there. Went back down and there they were. UGH! We never did get to use it, or the narrow tiny pool (also brat filled) Waited FOREVER to get a drink at the manager's reception (didn't mind though since we brought our own drinks from the room, and by the time we got to the front they had been drank.) The drinks were gross, my friends' apple martini was disgusting! And I have never been known to turn one down. I slept through breakfast but my friends said it was good. Nice building and location, but I wouldn't go back.
