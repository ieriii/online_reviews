I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my day and the Talbott Hotel was by far one of my best experiences overall in ages. The service was impeccable, everyone greeted me by name and had great recommendations on local fare that really help out-of-towners like myself. All of the staff always had a smile and were eager to make sure I was having the best possible stay from check-in to room service. The room was huge, bigger than my old 1 bedroom apartment in LA, and was equipped with apple tv which made my evenings holed up in the hotel doing work much more enjoyable. The bed was spacious and comfy and the bathroom impressive with separate bath and shower and vanity. And to put the cherry on top there was a keurig coffee maker in the room for good early morning coffee! I was traveling to and from the mccormick place convention center which cost me about 15 bucks in cab fare each way. Not too shabby. If you're ever staying in downtown Chicago and need a nice place to hang your hat, definitely give the Talbott Hotel a try, I highly recommend them!
