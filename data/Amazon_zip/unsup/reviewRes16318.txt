So seriously if I do this * does that count as a 6th star? Love love love Violet Hour, stopped in here again on Saturday night for the perfect nightcap (Blueberry Caipirissima) and had an amazing time as usual. The line was pretty crazy at 9pm but we skipped ahead of the line because no one wanted to sit at the bar, which the bouncer offered. Um, YES PLEASE. Never once had I sat at the bar here, I've sat in the back with the couches, near the front with the high backed chairs but never once by the bar. And trust me when I say, best seat in the house. Okay maybe second best (after the fireplace). But we sat right at the bar and stared for a good 2.5 hours at our mixologist who concocted cocktail after cocktail. She was pretty badass, my sister and I watched in awe at the level of detail she gave to each drink. I wonder if she thought we were crazy, probably not since she gave me my birthday cocktail for free. 6th star just for her, this place can't get any better.
