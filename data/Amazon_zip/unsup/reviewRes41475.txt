Perfect place for a casual, inexpensive date. Delicious, fast and fun. Sort of reminds me of my middle-school cafeteria, but the ambiance is less to do with the physical structure of this jam-packed dining room and more to do with the fact that everyone is there for the same reason- a giant bowl of piping hot Pho. Worth the short wait, for sure.
