While the sushi here won't blow you away as the most outstanding in Chicago, this place strikes a nice balance as a place to eat pretty decent lighter fare while people watching in Boystown on the outdoor patio and enjoying some pre-bar cocktails. The full bar connected to the restaurant is a good option should you need to wait, but do be careful of that tasty but clearly overpriced $14 specialty mojito. Also, be aware that BYOB is only inside, and not out on the patio. My Kirin light there on Thursday was on the warm side, but I will stifle the desire to downgrade. Just don't let it happen again; life is too short to drink warm light beer.
