I LOVE The Gage! It was the first restaurant that my boss took me to eat when I moved to the Loop a year ago. I love the food, the service, the energy and the dedication to locally grown and raised food. Everything is fresh and the service is friendly but professional. I don't eat dairy and the sorbet is homemade and amazing.
