I have been 3 times. The first 2 times everything was excellent. Really good food and service in a very nice environment. The last time was very different. The food and service were still great but the music was too loud and there was a large group of young men who were also VERY loud and kept going in and out to smoke. It was really hard to even carry on a conversation. I will definitely go again, but if I see the large group again I will walk out!
