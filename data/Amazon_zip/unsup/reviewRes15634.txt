Everyone seems to love Calo Ristorante beyond what is seemly. I'm not sure why. I think, no, I'm almost positive, that it's because they have the half-price rib deal on one night of the week. The ribs here are one of the last reasons that I would go to Calo. They are mediocre at best, often fatty, dry, and underspiced. The real reason to go to Calo's is for the simple pastas, which are surprisingly inexpensive and served in Brobdingnagian proportions. I especially like the spaghetti and meatballs here. It tends to hit the spot everytime, even though the sauce seems a wee bit sweeter than it should be. Fettuccini is also fantastic, as is the penne with sweet Italian sausage. Oh, and the braid salad is divine--chunks of salami, arugula, and mozzarella cheese layered atop French bread and sprinkled with vinegarette. Calo's also has a wonderful, darkly romantic ambience, the kind of place where you could canoodle with your sweetheart over a couple of bottles of wine for hours on end. Service in my experience has always been solicitous. Worth a trip, but far from the best Italian restaurant in Chicago.
