Not that this place needs another review... I've been to Chicago Diner now for both dinner and breakfast. Dinner was fantastic. I had a banana chocolate shake that was to die for and the Buddha Burger which was really amazing. It was a great take on a veggie burger.  I like the atmosphere of the place and how the servers are so casual and relaxed. However, the breakfast I had there was just godawful. The best part were the eggs, which I could pretty much get anywhere. I could see maybe if you were a vegan the breakfasts would be good and you could get a lot of selection, but as a vegetarian, I can get far better food other places.  I mean, really, one of the worse breakfasts I've ever had out. And the coffee was so-so.
