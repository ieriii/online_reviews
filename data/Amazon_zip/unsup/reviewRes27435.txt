This was an excellent dining experience. Just a couple quick impressions since the other reviews do such a good job of covering it all. - The popcorn is a fun treat. We had dehydrated sour cream and it was the best movie popcorn ever. - The service was very good with one small hiccup, that kind of dropped it down a bit. Our waiter was wonderful. He gave us good wine pairing ideas, explained everything on the menu concisely and yet still had fun with it, and brought out a wonderful complimentary ice wine to have with one of our first courses just because it would pair well. However, he brought out the wrong entree. This wouldn't be such a deal except that I ordered the entree specifically because he raved so much about it. Then when he realized it was wrong, he immediately tried to convince me that the entree he brought was actually better. To their credit we got to eat the wrong entree for free, but I don't like being manipulated like that. - The pea bisque was incredible. I never imagined I could enjoy pea soup as much as I did. - The foielipops are a hoot. Definitely make sure to start with those. You'll never look at pop rocks the same way again. - The Kung Pao Sweetbreads are sneaky hot and spicy, like the thymus glands of a ninja. You don't taste the kick at first, but then suddenly someone has started a small fire in your mouth. - The decor is fun. The angled mirror walls with the artichokes were a ncie touch. I like how casual the place is. I enjoy fine dining, but I'm not always looking to dress to the nines to do it. Sometimes I want to eat good food in comfy jeans and not feel like a slob doing it. I would like to go back and not order quite so much. We had something like 12 plates between 2 people that we split. I could easily go back and enjoy a couple appetizers and desserts. If I could give this 4.5 stars I would, as it has a few small kinks to work out, but it was extremely high quality and will bring me back in the future.
