Pros: -Churros to die for -Excellent guac  -Shrimp/Bacala sandwich special was also scrumptious.  -Portion sizes are great. Ordered $20 worth of food (app, sandwich, dessert) but was enough for 2 people.  -relaxed environment, self serve filtered or sparkling water tap Cons: 1 hour wait was kinda brutal, expect this anytime between the hours of 11-2.  Need to return for hot choco, afternoon soups, and to try some of the housemade beverages. I'm all for the refined Mexican street food concept. Hope to see you again soon Mr. Bayless!
