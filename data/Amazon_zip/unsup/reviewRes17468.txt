I went here for my birthday this weekend, and I thought it was fantastic. A lot of that had to do with the atmosphere. This place is insanely beautiful and I loved how open it is. The service was excellent, I must have asked the waiter a hundred questions about what to get. The ropa was probably the best thing I ate. It is basically steak over a fried plantain mmm. The ceviche was ok, kind of lacked flavor. We got the sampler of three which is probably too big of an order for two people. I got the tuna, which was pretty good, but the steak with goat cheese puree was sooooo delicious. Also had coconut bread pudding which was delicious. The mojitos were pretty good too, although kind of small for the price. I got the raspberry one which was awesome. I'll definitely go back for a special occasion, since its pretty pricey.
