flip the card to organge and expect: A LOT OF MEAT IN YOUR FACE constantly. although a great dining idea, I was so distracted by the bombardment of skewers of meat and the men all up in my grill that I didn't have the best meal of my life by any means. come to think of it, I don't think i'll ever be visiting Brazzaz again
