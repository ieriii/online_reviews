The Hopleaf gets 5 stars just for their mussels. Possibly the best mussels I've ever had. I would go just for them but Hopleaf also has a huge Belgian beer list. Almost all bars in Chicago now have huge craft beer lists but while most are content to settle for 75 different IPAs and 30 Stouts, Hopleaf is one of the few providers of good Belgian beers. The staff is great but there can be an occasional wait. Last time I went Popperings Hommelbier and Mussels!!
