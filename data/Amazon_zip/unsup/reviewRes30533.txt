Two stars only cause i like the Pad Thai I ordered, other than that, the only thing i can say about this place is i left with my butt hurting Maybe it was our fault for not having a reservation on a Friday night, three of us went and the hostess told we had to sit at the "High Top Table". Not knowing what that meant we were directed to the front of the restaurant to this long wooden high top with stools. Let me back up, the hostess station was such a cluster we didnt know who to follow to where the stools had no backs no bars on the bottom so your legs kinda have no place to go so you are always readjusting because the stool is not padded and your butt starts to hurt. got edemame and dumplings for appetizers, they were good, nothing to write home about, i mean come on its edemame I ordered the Pad Thai, friends ordered sushi my Pad Thai came almost 10 mins before their sushi came so i waited for them to get served and by that time mine was cold. it was over priced, wont go back
