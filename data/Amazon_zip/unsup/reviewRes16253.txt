I love this place. It's beautiful inside. See if you can get a table on the second level. This way you can do some serious people watching. The food is delish. The one complaint from my friends was that they don't offer enough options for non-beef eaters. I didn't care cause I'm all about the meat. Try the empanadas (there's beef inside). The guacamole is good too. Yummo
