This venue is really awesome, and has great history and art. I loved it. I had such a fantastic time there watching Mama DigDown's Brass Band- who had the whole room feeling funky and awesome. Great music. I have to complain about one thing though: the bartender with the attitude really upset some of us. The girl I brought asked her politely "Do you have any fun martinis you make?" to which she simply could have said "we don't have a list but I recommend my cosmo" or something, instead she made a curt face and said "I can't make your decisions for you, you have to figure out what you want." and then moved on to the next person. It was 8pm, hardly a wait to get drinks, but this lady had no time to waste on my date. My date didn't deserve to be treated like that. Maybe she just was having a bad day, but it put a damper on my night knowing that for the rest of the night I needed to avoid this bartender. Green Mill certainly is very cool though and is a definite highlight of living in Chicago.
