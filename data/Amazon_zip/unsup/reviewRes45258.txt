I am a big fan of Anteprima and have dined here a few times. We came out last Friday night to see a good friend off on his new journey in life and had a nice time. There were a few misses but overall the food was good and the service was decent. We started off with a sampling of several appetizers serviced from the meze counter that shares equal billing with the bar. The items on the meze were good and most certainly very healthy. We went with the octopus with potato and chile and experienced a very inconsistent hand in the seasoning of the dish. There were mouthfuls that were just right and then there were tastings that were flat out salty to the point where it was inedible. The tuna carpaccio was excellent. Very well seasoned and fresh! We ordered two of the seared blue fin entree specials, the halibut, a pork chop and the orecchiette pasta. All of the entrees hit the table with the exception of the halibut which was probably never fired by the kitchen staff as it was finally served about 10 minutes later. Mistakes happen. Our waiter was stuck in a tight spot but we understand that mistakes can happen. The halibut was cooked perfectly with a great seasoning, golden sear and a succulent mouth feel. The rest of the plate was forgettable as the set had some ramps and a puree of needles of some sort that was far more ambitious in thought then in execution. We were looking for the trout but it was not on the menu even though our waiter thought that it was, The pork chop was given a big thumbs up as well as the orecchiette pasta which was described as "one of the best pasta dishes ever eaten" by a dining companion. We indulged on the lemon panna cotta and the hazelnut chocolate tart and BOTH were incredible. Overall- food was good but some lapses in execution and the service was decent which was a bit odd considering the fact that we were there when the dining room was only half full.
