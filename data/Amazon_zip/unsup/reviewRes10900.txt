Fabulous!  My friend and I dined here on a Thursday morning and were seated immediately. Our server promptly brought us our beverages and refilled my coffee constantly. Their menu looked sooooo good. Lots of funky creations--crunch bar pancakes with fresh bananas??? Holy crap. That was delicious!!! (This was my friends dish and I swiped multiple bites). My dish was the croissant sandwich with bacon, egg and cheese. The sandwich was great--the potatoes on the side were overly herby (I made that word up).  I now understand why people wait an eternity to snag a seat at this Bucktown hot spot. It effing rocks & I will be back to eat some trendy pancakes.
