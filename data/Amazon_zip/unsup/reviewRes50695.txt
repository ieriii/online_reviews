I am a fan of this place. Not only is the art work pretty cool and unique but the people are so nice. We go here for breakfast once a week, the wait staff already recognizes us, the food is great at a regular price, the neighborhood is great because you can do some shopping after you eat. Food - I think i have had maybe 80% of their food on the brunch/breakfast menu. I was not disappointed with anything I have had at all. The food tastes yummy on a hung over morning/afternoon, the portions are reasonable ( you get full but don't overeat yourself) and the coffee - oh how so important - is awakening :) I like it - I like it a lot :)
