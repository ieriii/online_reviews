Sexy as hell.           It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of          thing. It's kinda cool. It's like          you're in on some kind of secret. You          tell a chick you've been some place, it's          like bragging that you know how to find          it. The only way you could know where a          place is is if someone who knows brought          you there. You have to have someone come          before. There is a direct line          connecting you back to the original,          unequivocally cool, club patrons. It's          kinda like Judaism...          Mike from "Swingers" Not quite, because they have a listed address and 1000 reviews on Yelp but.... I'd say if I was single, I'd take every girl I was trying to bed here, in order to more properly facilitate the lovin'. I think that Violet Hour coud be renamed Panty Dropper But I'm married, so I'll just take my wife and a friend. Haha, just kidding.  But no really, went here with my wife and fellow Yelper Britt C. after an epic day of day drinking. Me and Britt were uber-jazzed to get our drink on but I was a little apprehensive because I knew of "the rules" and I didn't feel like I was properly attired. Maybe also because I was already happily buzzed and excited to finally walk through the velvet curtains....and didn't want to be let down by myself. So we find the door and walk in, lucky for us, there was no wait. Allow the curtains to be parted! Seated shortly at a small table with giant chairs we ordered a charcuterie plate, the spiced nuts and a couple rounds of cocktails. All cocktails are $12.  Short history lesson regarding cocktails - This is from a book I have called "How's Your Drink - Cocktails, Culture, and The Art of Drinking Well. The earliest mention of the word "cocktail" in print was in a publication called The Farmer's Cabinet, which only mentioned that cocktails are "excellent for the head". The book also mentions a certain political candidate during the early 1800s who had a propensity for throwing elaborate drinking parties, and a local newspaper at the time tabulated the types of drinks he was serving, which included rum-glogs, bitters, gin-slings, and cock-tails.A reader inquired as to what a cock-tail was, and the editor of the paper wrote back, "A stimulating liquor, composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water and bitters." I ended up ordering a Halfway Cross Town - Bourbon base with lemon, raspberry shrub, egg yolk, and cherry bitters. The egg made my drink smooth and velvety, almost like chocolate milk, but not even close to being as thick. Tart and strong flavored. Very good. Also had the Violet Hour Old Fashioned - Bourbon with angostura bitters, syrup made from Turbinado sugar, and an orange peel. Strong like bull. Drink these if you want to put some hairs on your chest. The thing I love about these cocktails... They're well flavored and well thought out. Inventive.(at least to me, because I'm no cocktail maker). I love the ice. Giant ball of ice in my glass? Don't mind if I do! They keep your drink cold and watered down as little as possible, so you can taste the full flavors of your cocktail for 10 minutes or so. I also love that they make me want to drink them, no matter what they are. Britt C. ordered the Coffee and Cigarettes..wtf? 10 years, that was literally my breakfast on the way to school/work. Figured I had to taste it. It was like a time warp in my mouth, but with a touch of elegance and minus the stale smoky after scent.  Also have to mention Aubrey, our hot server, who referred to me as "my darling" and "love". Old school mannerisms, I'm sure she might have been playing a part, but whether she is or isn't does not take away from her attractiveness and facial symmetry. Just kidding about the symmetry. I'm not obsessed at all. Or am I? As a lovely parting gift, she brought us a round of artichoke bitters on the house. Sounds bad, but sweet and syrupy with a coffee-like finish, I could imagine drinking that over ice.  I'm going out on a short limb and say, I will return to Violet Hour. I want to conquer this menu like Alexander the Grape! I'm going to lay waste to the liquor, and show it who it's daddy is. Like a boss!
