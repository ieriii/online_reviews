I'm glad I was only here for one night! The place is advertised as a four star hotel, but it felt more like a 3star to me. Maybe that is because I had just checked out of the Westin in Minneapolis and had a truly 4 star hotel to compare to. Don't get me wrong, the place tries--they have minibars and 24 hour room service, as well as a fancy remodel. But they just can't help that the building they remodeled is old and dumpy, and some aspect of that character still shows through the remodel. The spa and fitness club were a couple of rooms in a dark windowless basement with low lighting and no locker room I could find--not at all spa like. The rooms were clean, though, and the place was generally fine. I guess I just expected more--but hey, you get what you pay for and hard rock is a pretty cheap option in a city like Chicago.
