To Nick the waiter. Next time a group of people come in after the Ovarian Cancer walk don't ask if " anyone caught cancer at the walk?". Chances are that there is a person with cancer at the table (there was) or cancer has affected the lives of the people you are about to serve. If 18% gratuity was not already included in our bill ,this is the only tip I would have given you. You are an idiot.
