My parents were in town and we walked to Nuevo Leon, because I'd heard such good things about it. Meh. I've experienced better is right. Rude wait staff, mediocre food (it's telling that I can't remember anything that I ate). They got my mom's order wrong (they brought her enchiladas instead of tamales) and then argued with her that what they brought was what she'd actually ordered, til finally she caved and ate what they brought, which was fine. Not at all great. Just ... fine. Wouldn't go back at all.
