I went to India House last night on the recommendation that it was the place to go for the most authentic Indian food in Chicago.  The restaurant certainly lives up to this high praise--each of our entrees was the best Indian food we had ever tasted. The nann was also quite good, and the "baby nan" they serve as a free appetizer comes with a delicious tomato cream sauce for dipping. However, this place fell short of 5 stars for their service, which seems to be a problem in looking through other reviews of this place. My friends and I were not seated in the order of arrival (two groups were seated ahead of us). When I mentioned something to the staff, I wasn't given the friendliest of treatment. Our server was fine, although it was slow since the restaurant was so busy. Overall, great place to go for great Indian food. I may try the suburb locations next time to see if they are not as busy--perhaps service will be faster and friendlier...
