I have NO CLUE how anyone wouldn't give this place 5 stars! I've lived in Chicago all my life... had dinner many places downtown but this one by far, is thee best place I have had dinner, period!!! I left with my pants unbuttoned and couldn't even breathe.. the food was amazing, 100%! The customer service, which I am really big on, was on point. We were never left alone for a second yet, they still let us enjoy our meal and didn't bother us tooo much.. Nothing was left cold on our plate because they constantly made sure we had fresh sides and warm meat. My card was never red ! So i was able to try just about all the meats, which needless to say, is why I left not even wanting to think about food again ! I was totally satisfied.. the bathrooms were spotless, (which is another pet peeve of mine, dirty bathrooms.) It looked like I was the only one to have ever used it!! With valet, dinner and drinks of course, its a bit pricey here but completely worth it! I can't wait to go back here again...
