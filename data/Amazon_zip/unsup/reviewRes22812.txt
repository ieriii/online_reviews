This is probably one of the best restaurants in Chinatown. Their hotpots are amazing! I would also look into other dishes, but the highlight of the restaurant is definitely the hotpots. However, don't expect great service. First, if you cannot speak a word of Chinese, it can be hard to order certain items. Miscommunication has often resulted in wrong dishes being brought my way. Also, on crowded nights, it seems like you have to fight your way to acquiring a table. Questionable service, excellent food!
