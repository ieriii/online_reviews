Great place to eat on weekdays, weekend evenings are occasionally overwhelming. Lots of people content to sit at the bar and wait a half hour or forty five minutes for a table. Ribs are special Sunday thru Tuesday and are definitely worth the price. A great neighborhood presence for many years. Risotto Frutti di mare is fan- f- ing tastic, A suburban friend ate a full meal and ordered another to take home. I like to pick through the menu and have never been disappointed. As a thin crust lover I also really enjoy the pizza. Calo special or special with anchovies kicks some serious butt. Always plan to take some home as the portions are very generous.
