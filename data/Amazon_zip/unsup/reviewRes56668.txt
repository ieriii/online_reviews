After a long wait for the next best restaurant in Little Italy to open, it finally did! The tired La Vita restaurant was transformed into a comfortable, rustic, cozy eatery - Davanti Enoteca! The energy is high, as its staff is eager to please and the chef is making a hit with his creations! Being a party of four, we were able to have an array of Italian fare.We started with 2 1/3 liters of their house selections (a white & a red), and perused their wall of wines, set at retail prices. A novel idea, that is sure to catch the attention of many....picking out your own wine at a great price, with a nominal corkage fee. What a time & money saver for the consumer.Now, for the food! MMMMMM......We had an assorted cheese platter, which was very good, but very similar in taste to each other. I do believe the waiter was trying to make recommendations although we needed to choose a bit more discriminately for variety - next time!The appetizers were great to share, the 1st being a polenta with a ragu of pork over it. The polenta was a bit runny (oozed off the plate), but the flavors in the ragu were delicious, if a bit salty. We had a mushroom, cheese & truffle oil pizza, which is not your everyday pizza. Much more savory & decadent! The chef sent out his specialty ravioli, stuffed with spinach & cheese, made with an egg inside that seeped over when cooked. That was amazing!! Our entrees were a spagetti with cracked pepper; linguine with sea urchin & crab; and sirloin, cooked medium. All the food was prepared to perfection, and the fusion of flavors were all pleasing on the palate. Having enough, we managed to order dessert and eat it too! A cannoli sundae is not to be missed and what I thought would be a complicated pudding (maybe for the staff to make) was light and airy, with a beautiful sweetness.I am bringing 8 people next week to this new favorite neighborhood place...oh yes, that's the best part....it's in MY neighborhood!
