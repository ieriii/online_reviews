If you follow a few of my posts you will notice i stop in for drinks a lot, so it wont surprise you to know that I stopped in here as well, for drinks. Determined to hit this spot before we left, on a recommendation from a server at Laschet's Inn (Great German food a few blocks away) and she was right on. Their beer selection is fantastic, original and tasty mixed drinks, as well as you can tell they really pay attention to where their food comes from and the freshness of the ingredients they use. I really wish i hadn't eaten elsewhere before stopping in here because the menu looked phenomenal.
