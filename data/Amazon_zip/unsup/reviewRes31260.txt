Nana is traditional organic with a nice Latino twist. Really enjoyed my breakfast on a gray Sunday morning. Was slightly confused when we got there... is there a host, or seat yourself? Work that out, Nana. Our waiter was great; he warmly welcomed us and explained the menu and specialties. I had the huevos rancheros and really enjoyed them! Nice, modern and delicious take on a Mexican staple. Then again anything that comes with a fried tortilla is damn good! My bf had the nanadict, which was also great. After trying his meal, I am a firm believer that everything should have chorizo in it. Both came with an awesome chile poblano sauce. Yum. This place is totally family owned, the whole fam was hanging around the place. Nice and warm feelings... I took away one star bc even though the waiter was warm and sweet, he began to address my bf more than I throughout our meal. Didn't appreciate that, especially when I'M the one paying for the meal. Helloooo! Other than that, happy this place exists, especially on the SOUTH SIDE.
