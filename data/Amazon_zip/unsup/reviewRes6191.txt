It had been a while since my last visit to Wildfire. Last week when I went for Restaurant Week, I was reminded why. We had a reservation and were told we'd have to wait a few minutes after a two other tables were seated. This has happened to me at a couple other places, and I've never gone back. What is the point of a reservation if it does you no good?? The food was good, but nothing to write home about. I had the vegetable soup, filet & chocolate creme pie. To me, it was just standard steakhouse fare...filling and tasty enough, but not amazing. I was starving when we arrived and left without room for anything else, so it wasn't bad by any means! I just won't be in a rush to visit Wildfire again anytime soon. If it's another couple years, this time I'll remember why.
