I recently went here 'cause I'm a big fan of Rick Bayless and this apparently is the place to go. So much so that we had to wait about 1.5 hours to get served! Normally I wouldn't have obliged myself but I was with friends and we were having a good time just waiting and I didn't really have anything better to do (except see the new wing of the art institute which had to wait till after this experience). In summary the food was as delicious as expected, I had the pibil torta which is roasted pig, pickled onions and a pretty hot habanero sauce on the side. The churros and espresso chocolate were indeed amazing. My friend had the short rib torta which was also amazing. And I got to see Rick himself tending the line. In summary, food is top notch, but go after 3 pm when they serve soup!
