Great family-run restaurant. Be sure to order a Caiparinha while you wait for your table - if you come on a Friday or Saturday. If you're with a group order the Picada Colombiana per every two people, you'll have more than enough protein and your bill won;t be too bad either. All in all a good place to have good drinks and great food. Enjoy!
