I am, first and foremost, very honest. My review is seasoned with that of both customer and previous employee. If the massive amounts of good reviews aren't enough to send you directly to 4441 W. Irving, then please read on. Food: impossible to find Italian cuisine with more flavor. Rarely will you order from a menu half it's size. I've tried, but have yet to find a menu with a fraction of the Veal and Chicken choices. If you like the show, order an item prepared at your table, but know it takes more time, care, and attention. Portions: no matter what you order, it's going to be huge and you should plan on a doggy bag. Drinks: order a bottle of wine. Unless you know the bottle, less expensive and surprisingly good house bottles are safe bets. Staff: I agree with other reviews that list Wait Staff as the downer. There are servers that have worked here for 20-35 years. There are others that are barely getting through their first night, week, etc. I can offer this solution - find out who should be waiting on you. Go for drinks early and socialize, ask and get the inside scoop on who should wait on you. Tell the Host it's your first time, a special occasion - if the Host likes you it's 99% more likely you'll have a better Server. Best Night: weekdays and before 7pm. Don't go to one of the biggest Italian restaurants in the city on Saturday at 8pm and think it will be anything but packed, slammed, and crowded. Menu Prices: Soup, Salad, Side, and Entree for any less can only be prepared in your own kitchen - maybe. Parties: There is a nice Banquet Room upstairs with it's own bar. The price you'll pay for a large group will be so reasonable it may cause you to faint. My Favs: Veal Braciole, Spinach Gnocchi, 4-cheese pasta dishes, Chicken Parmesan, any/all soups. If you order Dessert, Bananas Foster.
