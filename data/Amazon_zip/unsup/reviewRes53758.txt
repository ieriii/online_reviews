3 stars for the ambiance only.I went there with my fiance and we sat at the bar. Bartender was in my opinion very rude? well here is why: we ordered drinks and she was serving us like she was angry that we were there,no emotions on her face just very angry looking face. I appreciate a good customer service and in this case i wanted to leave after the first drink! At least say hi and smile.(you work for tips don't you?) we decided to stay (just because the jazz band that they had that night was great) and the second time we wanted to order, she wasn't even paying attention to us,mind you the place wasn't so packed yet, by the bar. and also why cant they hire a better looking bartenders! with more energy! and a smile on their face lol for Gods sake! the guy that was helping barback) was friendlier then the actual bartender! I never want to go back,but my fiance loves the place(just because AL Capone use to hang out there,and the jazz bands are good,ehhh guys thing i guess) but next time i wont be siting by the bar! Next time i hope will have a better service at the table...
