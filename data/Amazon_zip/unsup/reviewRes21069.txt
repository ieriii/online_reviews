do NOT come here if you are a vegetarian.  There are 2 vegetarian options. One is a brick of mashed potatoes that tastes like ham ($20). The other was a gigantic portion of mushy onions and cheese ($20). The waiter recommended we get the "borsch" soup. This was a large bowl of pink salt water with 3 almonds floating in it ($12!!!!). This was possibly the most disgusting meal I have ever shared with someone.
