Great pizza! If you are in the Ravenswood Area, definitely pick up a couple of pies. The wood fired flavor comes through and the pizza's take two minutes to make. We ordered the sausage and basil and we were not disappointed. The sausage was spicy without being over bearing and the basil was large leaf with great flavor.  The sizes are perfect to get two pizzas for two or three adults. We live in the suburbs and try to stop in when we are in the area. It does get crowded, but they taste great at home too!
