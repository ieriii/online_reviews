my fiance has been on a big pizza-making/-eating kick. and not just any pizza, the real deal, neopolitan-style pizza. he's searched high and low for san marzano tomatoes, bufalo mozzarella and various recipes to achieve his ideal pizza (to the point, that i had to take a full month-long hiatus from eating pizza because i was so sick of it). in this quest, he heard about spacca napoli and was dying to go. spacca napoli didn't disappoint. if you're looking for a neopolitan style pizza in chicago, this is your place. we ordered the bufalina, funghi and bianca con bufala pizzas. all were fantastic, but the bufalina (basically a margherita pizza) was the big winner. it's delicious. the crust was perfectly cooked in the woodfire oven and the ingredients were all very fresh. the only downsides to this place are that the atmosphere is so so and it's slightly pricey for pizza, but well worth the slight up charge for the fresh ingredients and simple, yet great taste. must try: bufalina pizza
