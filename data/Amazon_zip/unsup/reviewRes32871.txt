I just love Demera. I have eaten at most of the Ethiopian restaurants on the North Side and liked the food but really have not been jumping for joy since I originally enjoyed ethiopian at Addis Abeeba many years ago on clark. Demera has the BEST appetizer and a wide variety of choices, the best messob choices everything is great down to the Bedele beer. LOVE THIS PLACE! MUAH
