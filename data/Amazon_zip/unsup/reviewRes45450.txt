I live in the neighborhood and absolutely ADORE this place. They have great beer (Hacker Pshorr) and delicious desserts. I've tried several dishes on their menu and have yet to be disappointed. The service can be a bit hot and cold, but the food and ambiance makes up for it. Great patio and you can bring your dog!
