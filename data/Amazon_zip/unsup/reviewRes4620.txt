Under-promise and over-deliver, was the way our night got started. We were told it was a 45 minute wait and 15-20 mins later, we were seated. Love it! The cheeses paired with jelly were fantastic. The pork shoulder and mashed potatoes were unreal. I think we may need to stop here again before we leave town.
