Attended a Wedding Reception here and they did a fantastic job!!! From the service to the food, La Villa did a wonderful job and I know the Bride and Groom were thrilled. We spent the whole evening calling the servers "Ninjas". They seriously cleared tables, served water, brought out food, etc...SO fast and so efficiently. They were also all very friendly and welcoming. The food was totally solid, family style Italian. In particular, my whole table love the tortellini soup as well as the fresh farfalle pasta. Not sure if I'll ever end up back here but my experience at the Wedding was great!
