Fantastic! Went there for the first time last night. We were celebrating something very important and wanted good seafood. We had GREAT seafood. We happened to be there for the "all you can eat King Crab Legs". OMG! I'm still in a crab coma. Seemed expensive at first, but it's a bargain when all is said and done. The legs are huge and full of meat. B Before we even had a chance to empty our plate, our server was there to ask if we wanted another round. We talked to Glenn for awhile. He's a great guy. His whole thing is to have great quality seafood with only the best ingredients. He definitely succeeded. It was all you can eat cole slaw (which was really good too),, corn on the cob (which was covered in Parmesan cheese) and legs. We finished off the meal with a Black Cow Shake. I had never heard it called that, but it's a midwest thing. I didn't grow up here. It's a Root Beer float. Don't know where we had room. It was great quality root beer and rich ice cream. I love that it's an upscale food restaurant, but in a casual atmosphere. The staff is normal and not snooty that you get in an upscale restaurant. I'm anxious to go back and try other items. They all looked good. The get busy early on All you can eat nights, so I would suggest making reservations. We didn't. We got there a little before 6 and there was a wait already. We ate at the bar, which was fine by us. There's metered parking in front and if you park 1 block away, you can get free street parking.
