Being on a PBS Hot Dog special that tells everyone what a special snowflake you are in the national hot dog game has got to be daunting. But guys, this place was awesome. I got Superdawg with everything, which I thought may not be my style. Turns out it was totally my style. I didn't even know my style until I met Superdawg. You should also try superonionchips because my head is still spinning from how great they were. Not greasy at all, and a good crunch despite the frying. The only downfall to this place is trying to access this place without a car. Even when you take the Metra, there's a stretch of road that is not walkable for pedestrians. We ended up grabbing a cab for the stretch of road, but we felt really ridiculous doing it. Also! Being able to stand in line inside an enclosed glass Florida room type device was good for walk ups not utilizing the drive-in portion of the place.
