I really enjoyed this place. We went for a work outing of about 14 people (and were probably quite annoying to the other diners) but I really enjoyed my experience. It was pretty empty for a Tuesday night so we were able to hear all conversations at the long table. Service was great, our glasses were never empty and thank you to all who recommended the pistachio crusted chickent because it was to die for. I will definitely be back at some point for a more intimate visit. Easy street parking makes me that much more likely to go back.
