i am 98.9% in love with this place. honestly it does not get better than this. if you are looking for unlimited amount of perfect cooked excellent quality meat, fogo de chao is you place. for $50 per person you can get as much meat as you tummy can sustain. sides and drinks are not included. you get a basket of bread, salad bar, some sort of fried something which is delicious, and fried plataine, and of course unlimited amount of all types of meat. if you do get drinks it does bunk up the price, but for me which would treat myself to it maybe 3 times a year is just fine. when i go with my boyfriend we spend about $150-$180.
