Like beer? Get thee here. Bitching and gripes are about the crowd or food, that is not why you go to Hop Leaf. I haven't been here in a while now and I don't know what Check Please is (management change?) but you honestly can't go wrong. Be wary of the lifelong ongoing dick-waving beer snob contest complaining about beer being mishandled or serving glass size. BEER IS GOOD, you can drink it here, they serve some of the best. Go.
