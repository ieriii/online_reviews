THIS MAY VERY WELL BE THE BEST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!!!! It is a MUST for anyone traveling through the area vegetarian or not! The vegan Country fried steak was AMAZING as well as the mac and cheese! Please, do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant at some point in your life!
