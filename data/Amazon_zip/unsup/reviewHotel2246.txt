Loved, loved, LOVED our stay! We are Ambassador members, so we expected a lot from the get-go, but the Intercontinental went well above and beyond. The location is stellar, of course. Check in was perfectly smooth, we got a nice upgrade to a bigger room in the historic tower (which meant we had a 27th floor view of the beautiful city), and we were treated to the news that internet would be free for our whole stay. Hooray! Housekeeping was great, and I really loved the bath products they provided. One day, we were chillin' in the room and heard a knock on the door. Avon calling? Nope, it was a complimentary bottle of wine (I suspect because we had been having issues with our A/C, which they fixed quickly). Another night, we returned to our room to find a plate of chocolates and two snifters with Bailey's. I ordered room service at 4 AM just so they could heat up my pre-marathon food, and they had me ready to go in under 15 minutes. The only minor glitch was a somewhat inattentive server at the bar during our last night. I was really sad to leave the Intercontinental - can't wait to go back and stay again!
