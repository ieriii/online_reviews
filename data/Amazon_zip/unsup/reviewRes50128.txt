Having heard good things about Big Jones, I made reservations through Yelp for brunch. Strangely, I get an email a few days before my reservation saying that it was canceled by the restaurant. When I called to inquire, the first person I spoke to said she couldn't find my res in the system (ummm...likely because it was CANCELED), then put me on hold...forever. Until someone else picked up the phone and I had to repeat the same conversation, including the part where they confirm my res isn't in the system. Fortunately this second person had enough common sense to put my res in again. I came in on a Saturday for brunch and it wasn't very crowded at 11am. Really liked the airy feel of the dining room. While we were studying the menu, we got complimentary beignets buried in powdered sugar. The beignets were nice and warm, and surprisingly not cloyingly sweet. We ordered the eggs New Orleans, bacon & onion omelet and cajun pancakes.The eggs New Orleans were fantastic with runny yolk and flavorful crabcakes. The omelet was standard fare. Cajun pancakes were a tad sweet, with all that powdered sugar and maple syrup. I think I'd come back to try more of their savory dishes, but will steer clear of the sweets (this coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth is saying something). The food gets 4 stars, but I docked 1 for the disorganized staff.
