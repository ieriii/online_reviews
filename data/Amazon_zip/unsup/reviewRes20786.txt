A refreshing new place, great for those that work in the Loop! They have a good lunch menu, great happy hour scene and dinner menu is nice. When it first opened the service seemed top notch, but the last time I went for dinner (group of about 8, work-related), the waiter was annoyed that he couldn't get everyone's attention to read the specials and seemed to stiff us by the end of the night. Food was excellent though.
