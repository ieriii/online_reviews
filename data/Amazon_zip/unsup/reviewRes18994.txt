Wish I could give this place 2.5 stars. 2.5 sounds better than 2. My fiance and I wanted to try something new and we stumbled upon this place. Looking at the menu, nothing really jumped out at me. To start we ordered and split a salad with lettuce, pears, cherries and cheddar cheese. Was okay, needed more dressing. Wasn't bad, but with no meat in it, wasn't really worth $10. I played it safe and ordered the pork chop, medium. My fiance ordered the same but medium rare. Was OKAY. For $33 for a porkchop, I'd expect it to be great. Porkchop came with a couple little slices of potatoes, some salad with tangerines and some bacon powder. Both our porkchops weren't tender and hard to cut. Server was great. Really friendly and knew the stuff on the menu. Menu was limited. Food was okay, won't be back. I could find a lot more other restaurants to spend $100. $100 for 2 porkchops, 2 salads and 2 beers, tip not included. Not sure why this place has such high reviews.
