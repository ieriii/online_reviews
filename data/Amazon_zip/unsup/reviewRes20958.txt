Recommended by a colleague who joined me and another colleague - Gage was a hit! Cool menu of courses 1-4 + dessert. We didn't do all 4 :-)... but what we had was great - including a few appetizers mussels vindaloo, fava mousse (a surprisingly great little dish - and not one I would have picked on my own), and sausage stuffed peppers. Entrees selections Fish and Chips (Guiness and Vodka dipped - sold!:-), Risotto, and home-made sausage. Shared dessert topped off a great meal. Worth checking out - as an alternative to DD Pizza.
