I loved this place! Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. Simple and yet delicious ingredients. Friendly staff. So cheap. Complimentary salsa and chips, pickled, spicy veggies, and we even got a little bowl of soup! You can feel the history of good food in that place and family love for the business.
