This place is busy on Saturday mornings! You walk into this packed (but truly nice green) dining room to a very long line.  We stood in line and a hostess got us set with a table and then you continue standing to wait to place your order while our table sat empty. I just really wanted to sit down so we could have fun, engaging conversation instead of that awkward, "So...long wait....look what they're eating...etc." kind of thing. Maybe it's me that is awkward,,,who knows. That was the only thing I did not like. But then we ordered really good Intelligentsia iced coffees and headed to a cozy outside table. The sandwiches were so tasty and satisfying--- from what I saw I am pretty sure you would not go wrong with any of them. I had an avocado sandwich and I think my boyfriend had a turkey reuben...nice crispy chips, a good pickle and a good start to our day.
