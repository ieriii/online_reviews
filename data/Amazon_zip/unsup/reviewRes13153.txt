I am comparing this place to Fogo de Chao and it's so so. I went for dinner with a group of friends on a Friday night and the place was half full. The salad bar had a great variety but nothing really stood out as amazing. The meats were pretty good but I must say that they are a bit too salty for me. Oh...there was this reeealllly tender piece of steak. I have no clue what it's called but I remember there were two large bones sticking out and the server carved the meat from the top versus the meats being carved from a sword like contraption. Look out for this as it was yummy. Personally I think this place was a bit overpriced. I went with a group of 7 and the bill came out to $60/person and that's with a 25% coupon. Oh sign up on their website to recieve a 25% off coupon.
