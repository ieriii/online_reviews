Everything is great, or at least super good. Food is american style but vegan by default. Try the milkshakes, supremely yummy. "cheez" stick are so much better than the real thing. Cake is a great excuse for your birthday and they're so rich and decadent. Haven't tried anything I didn't like. However, some of the sandwiches/burgers/hoagies are too heavy with bread plus breading, so I will stick to lighter options from now on. Oh and the service is always awesome and the female servers there are so beautiful! They don't take reservations but one one occasion, accommodated our party of 10! Everything was flawlessly taken care of and no one got flustered or upset as had been my experience at other restaurants. A birthday that went to the right location.
