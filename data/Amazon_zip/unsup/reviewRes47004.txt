The vibe here is great -- cozy but spacious, with good live music. Our waiter was awesome: amazingly attentive, even though we didn't have a full meal. As we were leaving, he even gave us a to-go cup to finish up the rest of our tea in.  The sweet potato fries were great and I got a good amount of them. This place is definitely pricey, but I feel like the atmosphere helps make up for it.
