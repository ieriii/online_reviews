PHO 101 This is the place to take people who are new to Vietnamese food. It's clean, well lit, the servers are more polite than your average Vietnamese joint, and the crowds will make the newbies feel better..safety in numbers I guess. For the well seasoned, however, this place just is just meh. Thus I declare... Give me my pho or bun for $3 bucks and change! Give me chopsticks that I have to inspect and clean with a paper napkin just in case! Give me a place where there are three generations of the family that own the place sitting in the restaurant! Give me a place that doesn't close on a random weekday! Give me pho with broth that tastes like it's been simmering for days! Give me someplace that isn't plagued by the Check Please effect! Give me someplace else besides Tank! P.S. Their bubble teas suck. I'll just wait until I'm near Joy Yee's for the real thing.
