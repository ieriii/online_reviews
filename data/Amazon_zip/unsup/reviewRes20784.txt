I love weekend brunches and am fastidious when it comes to reviewing restaurants in this particular category. The Gage flattered to deceive. The white table cloth, gastropub may be great for power lunches/sun down socializing but didn't quite impress on the leisure brunch front. The only thing leisurely was the service - appallingly slow,except when the check was due(it helped that the guy waiting on us was rather cute so didn't mind that he needed to make multiple trips to get it right!). The menu, while sparse had some rather interesting options but about half of them, I realized were just pretty descriptions. The "strawberry stuffed french toast" turned out to be a bunch of cream laden slices with strawberries on the side and the giardiniera omelet was well, your average american eggs topped with tomatoes and cheese. My first mimosa went down well (at least before I looked at the price!) but the teapots looked better than the infusions inside. Granted the Gage may be quite the rave in the loop, but you may just be better served for brunch elsewhere.
