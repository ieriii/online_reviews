We used a Living Social voucher for our one night stay. We had a couple issues getting here, it was hard to find while driving since the sign for the hotel is at the top of the building and not by the awning outside. We also weren't sure which parking garage to park in for our parking to be validated. We could have had our car valet but the valet spot in front was small and taken up by taxi's. We just drove around and pulled our car into the garage ourselves. The lobby is small but nice looking. The diner was closed each time we came by the front desk. There is a bar right there and it was warm and inviting. All the staff we encountered were friendly. The standard room is just that, standard. The room was tiny, no coffee pot and certainly not as clean as I would have expected it to be. At first glance, the room looks clean but the bathroom looked like the only thing that had been done was fresh towels added. The counter that runs along the top of the sink was dirty, not dusty but dirty. There were pieces of "something" just laying there, not even wiped off. The same with the floor, didn't look like it had been swept. We spent most of our time in the city walking around and seeing the lights. Therefore, the lack of cleanliness wasn't a prime factor in our visit. We were here long enough to get dressed for dinner, sleep and dress for the next day. We took advantage of the late checkout to keep our bags in the room instead of walking around Chicago with them. The Living Social voucher also came with 2 free drinks. We had to ask for the coupons because they were not given to us at the time of check-out. We asked the bartender for the two free drinks and it turned out that it was a fruity drink with Malibu rum. Not bad, but not what I was expecting. Overall, for the price and location on Magnificent Mile, I would stay here again. I would probably ask for a bigger room this time and would like my bathroom to be clean.
