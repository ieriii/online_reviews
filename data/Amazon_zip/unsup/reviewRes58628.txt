First off, I consider myself somewhat of a Greek Foodie Connoisseur...and with good reason, as I've been to the real islands multiple times, as well as the best restaurants throughout the country.I went here on a busy Saturday night. First impression of this place was that it was very big and bustling...however, the table I was seated at did have room (I was with one other person). The second thing I noticed was the smell...there was a permeating odor of strong, musty....foot...seriously though, it was bad. The wait staff was very impatient and pressed to get our order.The bread they put on the table was ice cold, and I got the impression that it was reused...They forgot to bring napkins throughout our whole meal (they weren't even on the table).We ordered the Athenian salad (a Greek staple that SHOULD be excellent), however, it had FAR too much red wine vinegar; overbearing to say the least.The cold spreads were probably the only good thing, however, you have to order pita, as it doesn't come with it.I also ordered the chicken shishkabobs...when they came it out it was quite obvious that they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while...probably before we even ordered it. The vegetables on the plate were CLEARLY hours old; not even remotely fresh. I returned the dish...quite unhappy.Needless to say I will not be back. I tried Santorini a few days prior, and had a much better experience.
