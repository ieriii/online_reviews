I hear that this place has a line around the corner on the weekends, and I believe it! This is a great place, filled with cool, stylish, hipsters and very friendly and organized staff. While waiting in line, they ask if "that table over there is good" and then hold it with your order number, smart! The food, ummmmm, umm yummy! Hello?! Why are you reading this, get over there already (unless you are mobile and right outside of course), geez!
