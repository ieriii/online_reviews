The food is really good but the staff is SUPER annoying. It's a small place so when the employees are behind the counter throwing wet nap packets, yelling and talking in their outside voice, it's a downer. Several times while my friend and I were eating, we commented on how obnoxious and loud the staff was. It's too bad because I really like the food.
