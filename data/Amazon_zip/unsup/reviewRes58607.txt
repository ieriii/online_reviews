I woke up this morning after eating at The Bad Apple with my lady last night and my first waking thought was how incredibly delicious and pleasant this place was. So I came to Yelp about it.As we walked in on a Saturday night. We were told the wait would be about 25 minutes for 2. So we go to the bar and order a couple of beers and to our surprise, the hostess came within 10 minutes and sat us at a table.I, for one, could not pull my eyes from the extensive beer menu (24 on draft, 150 in bottles, and 13 in cans.) And the beers on average were about $5. Including imports and micro-brews. We ordered about 8 different beers in total.Onto the food. As a guy who enjoys a burger, I went straight to the renown burger page. I ordered the Red Dragon w/ truffle fries and she ordered the Happy Belly sandwich w/ spicy chipotle fries. I enjoyed every bite of the juicy, flavorful burger. There was never a dull moment.The waiter came over to ask how our meal was. My response, It was fucking incredible.
