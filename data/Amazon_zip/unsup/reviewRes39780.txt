Yuck. We went with a large group and sat at the long uncomfortable table on the right as you come in. It was raining and the roof leaked through the vent dripping black greasy water all over us and our food. The grumpy waitress moved us to the other large table where the vents did not work at all. I also thought it was quite expensive for gristly, poor quality beef. Won't be back
