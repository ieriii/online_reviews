I loved Violet Hour. What a cool place! I was skeptical about what I thought the experience would be like given some of the reviews on here. You really feel like you're transformed into another time and I felt like I was in an apothecary from the early 1900s with all of the vials and eyedroppers on the shleves. We sat at the bar which was nice to be able to talk to the bartenders and learn more. Ours was a little reserved but warmed up after awhile. I know many reviews on here say there is a wait; on a Tuesday at 8:30 when I went there were many tables open that never were filled that night, possibly because of the nice weather. We ordered the gnocchi (amazing) and olive plate which came with bread, tapenade, olives and olive oil (which I called olive juice after a drink). My drinks were Juliet and Romeo (very refreshing) and Plumb on the Soul (whiskey/orange) both of which were amazing and you don't realize how strong they are! So fun to have a drink carefully created in front of you. Really loved this experience and would definitely go back.
