I think this place is completely overrated. Everyone raves about their cupcakes and honestly I think they were crap. I would give them one star but I don't think it's fair to base an entire 'bakery' off of some cupcakes so I'll be generous and give them two. First off this place is a rip-off. Over $2 for a small cupcake is redic, or it better taste heavenly. They did not. I tried the red velvet and another hazelnut one and both were dry and somewhat tasteless. I didn't even finish either of them b/c it felt like a waste of calories. Don't belive the hype and if you want a bakery with truly great cupcakes try Sensational Bites on Southport - $1.30-2.00 a cupcake and they are sooooo yummy!
