To me the most important meal is breakfast, and this place has excelled in that department which is why I'm giving it five stars. They do other things, and they do them well but my focus here is on the brunch. The only thing I don't like about going to Longman & Eagle is having to wait for a table, but that shouldn't count against anyone considering it happens when a place is doing something right. Eggs are a subtle art, the nuances of which are something I am very sensitive to. When a menu offers all kinds of wild creations like duck egg hash or chorizo strada, one might wonder why someone would order regular (chicken) eggs and potatoes, or as L&E calls it, the PBR breakfast. The way I test an establishment's ability to prepare breakfast is simple, order the eggs and potatoes with bacon or sausage and see how they treat it. Out of all the places I've been since moving to Chicago, this place in particular has really passed the test. The PBR breakfast comes with two artfully prepared eggs. I like over-medium, which shouldn't be hard, but shouldn't run all over the plate and they seem to get it. The potatoes are full of large chunks that fall apart nicely, mixed with bacon and chives. The large helping of bacon is high quality and arranged into a little (maybe not so little) floret, which is an amusing touch. It comes with a can of PBR which somehow works, though I often opt out of that part. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with toast. It's not enough to sway me though. I've also had the chicken and waffle, which is fantastic. The best fried chicken I've ever had. I've tried the crab benedict, very good. The market omelet with little ferns is wonderful as well. The bloody maries are different every time. I've had gherkins added as well as chunks of cheddar. Overall it's always a treat. I hear the drinks are special too..
