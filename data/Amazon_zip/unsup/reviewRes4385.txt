This falls under places to try, but not my cup of tea. I'm not a huge fan of poetry let alone angsty poetry, but the person I was with wanted to come so I tagged along. I'm glad I went with, but not sure I would return for nights with angsty/ Jay Leno esque poetry. It's just not my thing, but people enjoy it- so good for them- to each their own. I would maybe check out some of the other musical acts if the opportunity presented itself again. The artists the night we were there were decent, told a lot of Jay Leno- esque jokes that were kind of funny layered with their banjos, but overly bitter about a lot of what they were speaking about. I'm not an overly sensitive person by any means, but their angst and bitterness just got overly redundant and old for the hour or so we were there. The Mexican restaurant right next door was the highlight of my evening. If anyone knows the name of that would love to know. They had thee best Mexican Shrimp cocktail on earth.
