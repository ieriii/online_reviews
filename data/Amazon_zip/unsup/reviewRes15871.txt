We began to go to Calo about 5 years ago when we moved into the area. The food is great and you can always count on consistency in the food quality. The salad, while a bit plain, is probably one of the freshest in the city. It is crisp every time!  Now, other than the food, there is another reason I recommend going to Calo. They are perhaps one of the most family friendly restaurants on the Northside. Every time we go, the wait staff comes and visits with our daughter (now 2 1/2). The management there, especially Sakib, are top notch. They make you feel like a million bucks every time you come in for dinner.  If you want a place to take your kids for a NICE dinner and not feel like a burden, then this is the place!
