Best steak tacos on the planet & Ms. Pac-man under one roof. You just can't beat it. Better than any Taco Burrito King/House//#2/#3. Hands down. If you want quick & simple tacos, hit the one on the east side of Ashland. If you want the whole deal, go the the southernmost one on the west side of ashland. It's a sit down & order environment, & you can get your fave dish with all the garnishes. Chips & guac available, too. Mmmmm so good!
