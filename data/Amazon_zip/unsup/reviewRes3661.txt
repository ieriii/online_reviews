Sorry, Crisp i have to take a star away. I'm still a fan, but I guess your novelty is wearing off a little. Don't get me wrong I still love the buddha bowls and wings. But it seems like a bit much to be paying almost $20 for a big buddha bowl and 5 wings. After eating those deliscious wings, I wish I had a wet nap to clean up my sticky fingers. and it doesn't help that there is only one bathroom per gender. the last time i went there was a little wait for the women's restroom. And all I wanted to do was to wash my hands. I was at a Mexican restaurant in San Diego similar in size and they had a sink outside of their bathroom. And this was a pretty nice restaurant not some hoe-in-the-wall joint.
