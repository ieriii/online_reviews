I guess I expected from this place something different. All I can say for now, it is interesting! The interior is very nice, great decor, I truly loved it. The food is where is comes to being interesting. Some food blends that the chef used - were extraordinary. The seafood salad was very good. Soup was interesting, I was somewhat disappointed that it was cold. But pretty good overall. The entry was good, but to my taste the meat a bit too chewy, And also the fact that it was served with popcorn?... Not a fan of that. It is BYOB which is great. Staff was very nice and did a good job describing and explaining what was served. Overall, a solid 4. However, I will not be back w/o another groupon.
