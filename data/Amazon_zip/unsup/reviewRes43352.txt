I moved to Wicker Park with a few restaurants in mind - places close by that I knew would serve a consistently good meal. Milk & Honey was on top of that list. Their food, coffee and service was great. But something happened over the past year, and now the food is mediocre and the coffee has this overwhelming metallic taste (it's not an overtone, it's an undertone). The service hasn't really changed, so I'm still happy in that regard (but the service isn't enough to bring me back). They have basics that you can't really screw up, like the lox and granola. But the French toast and huevos rancheros have been on the decline. Bland. Unimpressive. Paradigmatic. A catalyst to look for alternatives. The coffee used be be good, but now I'd say this isn't a coffee shop at all. That's it. If you're in the WP area, I'd suggest The Bongo Room or Toast. If it's brunch/lunch, the options are much greater.
