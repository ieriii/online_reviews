Hot Doug's isn't just a place that sells Hot Dougs. It's a place that sells dreams. And by sell, I mean at a discount. And by dreams I mean rabbits. Or alligators. Or elk. Or Kangaroo. I've had experiences at this place that almost made me cry-- that's how happy I was. The line might seem long but the mix of toppings will change you. The service is impeccable because Doug Sohn is a world-class host. The cheese fries are the best anywhere and the decor and environment is so much fun, it's great for repeat visits. He plays his own eclectic mix of music and the crowd is a who's who of Chicago luminaries, in addition to enthusiastic tourists from around the world. Hot Doug's may not be the cure for sadness and depression but it sure can help.
