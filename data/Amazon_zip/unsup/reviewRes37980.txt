Hopleaf is nice, but a lot of what other people site as problematic I can see. It's pretty packed most nights and if there's a mistake with the food you order, better get ready to eat the staff's mistakes as I did with a messed-up order of mussels. Still, I absolutely see the merits of a beer list longer than my arm-span and can't truly put the dis on anyplace that has framboise, much less on tap. My boyfriend is all about the Atomium, which isn't found many other places either. Plus their fries with aoli are awesome-tasty. The other thing I like about this place is totally random and has nothing to do with how it's run and everything to do with its patrons. I like the bathroom graffiti. It's oddly inspirational. Some quotes include: "You are the future. Take care of it." "Trust yourself; everything else will follow." and, my personal favorite. "Do the best you can. Love your friends. Drink beer."
