The food was good, very tasty, excellent spices, however, I feel like we were completely ripped off - we had a groupon (2 groupons with value of $70 total) for pre fixe dinner, however, our bill was still $257 without ordering anything special. We were overcharged for desert which was suppose to be included, we were charged double cork fee for a Tequila bottle (without being notified ahead of time). Although our total bill ended up being $97 after groupon was applied, we paid taxes and gratuity on $257. Although the food was good, I would not come back.
