We went there sometime last year and had a great dining experience; we decided to come back since we were around that area again. Their services are as awesome as usual and so does the food! Still remember the first visit last year, it's so packed because there had a bday celebration for a table of 15 ppl. We feel annoyed since it's not a big dining place and the owner came by to apologize guests in each table. He is a super nice person and then gave us a free desert. Few weeks ago, we experienced the nice service, great lunch, and a great deal. Their lunch special includes a drink, soup, salad, and entree.I think it's around $12 with tax. Food quality is unbelievable nice and I can feel the owner puts a lot of efforts on his restaurant. Simply It gave me a wonderful impression and I feel happiness when dining there. It's rare to feel the owner's consistent service and food quality when dining in. This restaurant gave me happiness. Thank you! Simply it!
