There are already plenty of reviews here about the beautiful outdoor area and the delish food. No need to repeat those. But I would be very happy to come here again, with friends and family. If you normally split the bill and your friends are having problems in the current economy, wait until they are back on their feet, ok? Or else just come here by yourself -- this is not the most expensive restaurant in the city, but $20-25-ish for entree might be steep for some, especially as you have the add-ons like wine, apps, dessert. On a Tuesday, my group and I were surprised at the well-dressed crowd. Some designer duds and "wow, look at the best necklace I own!" on display here. The place was full for dinner. Clearly a popular place as every table was occupied in the middle of the week. The only gripe I would have is the _tiny_ women's bathroom. They certainly did what they could with the space they had, but if patterns collide, there could be an unseemly line of ladies crossing legs in the bar area. The restroom is only a two-fer, and a pretty small one at that. I only include this point, because it was kind of a surprise at this place where everything else was first-rate. I am unable to comment on the men's room :o)
