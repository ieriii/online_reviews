Came here from yet another work lunch. We were a very large party (over 25 people), so were seated in a semi-private room in the back which was very nice. It was too cold to be on the patio, but I can't wait to come back and hang out there! Food is delicious - we started with various appetizers - my favorite was the calamari. We also had the Cecina Fitta (great for sharing) but I personally don't like rosemary, so would not get that on my own. I started with the Caprese Primavera - it's a little small for what you pay (you get 3 pieces of mozzarella, basil and tomato) but still delicious. My entree was the Calzone which was great. Not as cheesey as other places, but the spinach and mushrooms were very good. My other lunchgoers had (amongst other things) the Margherita pizza, Tortelloni and Lasagna which all looked great (and were eaten up quickly). For sweets time, I ordered the "thousand layer" something or other with banana and chocolate chips - it was a mousse-like consistency and very very good. I ate most of it on my own (selfish!) but it's great for sharing. The other desserts are a little smaller, and can be shared, but if you aren't in the mood, that's cool too. Wine list is extensive - I had a few glasses of red (Chianti) and it was very good. I would recommend this for a romantic dinner or somewhere to wow out of town guests. The back room would also be great for a rehearsal dinner. Transportation wise, they have valet if you have a car. Taxis are hit or miss in that area, so I would recommend the Blue Line which is right across the street for the building.
