Visited once before. Less than stellar, but I'm always willing to give a place a second chance. I'm not sure that a third visit is in my future. Here's my beef - If you want to be known as a steakhouse in Chicago, you better serve prime beef. I ordered the 12oz "Dry-Aged" New York Strip for $38. The flavor was there, but it lacked the tenderness that only a prime cut offers. Why not raise the price by $1 and serve a prime cut? You already charge what most would charge for a prime cut.
