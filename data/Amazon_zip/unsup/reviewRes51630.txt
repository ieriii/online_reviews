By far my favorite neighborhood restaurant to sit and grab some good, cheap Mexican food. Although Garcia's is rather crowded on a Friday or Saturday night, their bar area tucked in the back is quiet and warm. Margarita's are very strong and fairly priced, food is good with large portions (especially the combo meals) but not knockout outstanding. I remember liking this place more when I was in college, I still enjoy my time at Garcia's, but the wow factor is gone and now it's better than alright.
