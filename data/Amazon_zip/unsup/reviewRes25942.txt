They did a good job of accomodating us as a large walk-in group. We even had a couple unexpected people show up, and were able to squeeze in. The food was good, although I would have enjoyed mine more if it was what I ordered. There were, I think, 5 or 6 pizzas total. Ours was the lone thin crust of the group, and when it arrived... it was also a deep dish. Deep dish is not really my thing, but it was ok.  The service was only okay beyond the erroneous order. Our server took the first pizza order of our 15-17 person group (1 large pan pizza--certainly not enough for all of us), and quietly asked if there was anything else and stepped back from the table. The group was all talking, the room was full & loud, and I thought "Hey, stay a second & really find out before you go put that in!"  About 10 minutes after we finished, another server was clearing our table and we asked her for the check. She didn't bring it, but about 20 minutes later I saw our server at another table & flagged her down to get the bill. I'd been before & our service was more attentive, and they were quite busy at the time, which probably had something to do with it.
