This is a great bar...the dark, mysterious ambiance is hypnotic. We didn't stay for dinner, but enjoyed a slew of drinks as well as the steak tartar. Soo0o amazing!! From the glasses our drinks were served in to the dimly lit bulbs hanging from the ceiling...not a detail was forgotten. I'll definitely continue my love affair with Gilt.
