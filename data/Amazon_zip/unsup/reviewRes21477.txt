This place rocks. The servers are extremely friendly and attentive. Wonderful chips, salsa, margaritas, etc. Very cozy atmosphere, with extra seating in the back. Even though it's almost always been busy when I've gone, I've never had to wait to sit down. Have ordered the chorizo and cheese appetizer with corn tortillas, it was amazing. The burritos are VERY large and delicious, I get steak every time. Have also had the tamale, tostada and chile relleno combo to get more of a variety. Definitely good if you want to try a little bit of everything. Huge portions for a wonderful Mexican food price... cheap.
