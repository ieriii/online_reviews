This place seems to specialize in organic ingredients. I ordered some kind of eggs benedict with beef and spinach. It was quite delicious with some homemade hash brown concoction that was also tasty. Yes, the place from the exterior looks quite dull, but when you enter the establishment, there is a more urban eclectic feel to this restaurant. It has that earthen bohemian feel to it. Parking was somewhat scarce so I had to find one outside.
