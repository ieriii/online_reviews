CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU PAY! We ordered three entrees, Edamame and received a "free" appetizer with our order (Gyoza). Our food was ready on time, but when we opened two of the entrees, the protein was missing. We had asked for the garlic sauce on the side for the Broccoli Lover and the Veggie Delight because we thought it would be too spicy for our kids...so they left off the chicken and tofu as well! The dinner was ruined. Our kids ate only rice/noodles with steamed veggies for dinner :-( The Seafood Madness was delicious, but $38.95 was a bit much for two incomplete entrees!
