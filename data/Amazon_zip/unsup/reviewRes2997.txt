tru is hands down my favorite restaurant in chicago! and perhaps top 3 out of anywhere in the world. an elegant restaurant with astoundingly delicious food. my first time at tru was almost 4 years ago for my 18th birthday & they even printed up a personalized menu for me! love love love love. cannot say it enough.
