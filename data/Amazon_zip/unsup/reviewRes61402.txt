Went here with a huge group for my birthday and again for a friends birthday. This place is amazing. Service was exceptional both times and the food is etherial. It's a do-not-miss foodie location in Chicago. It also isn't terribly expensive and BYOB. The empanadas are wonderful and so are the entrees.
