Another Chicago Classic! Okay.....it is a borderline tourist trap. At the same time, it's been a Chicago staple for such a long time that it deserves all the praise. The Chicago style hot dog is the epitome of what we are famous for - all the toppings, mutant green glowing relish, mustard and of course no ketchup. They are each packed into small boxes with crinkle cut fries as filler. The place itself gives off a nostalgic vibe; it has a take out window for each vehicle a la drive in's in Karate Kid (Sweep the leg Johnny!). I'm not sure if they have waitresses on rollerblades bring your food out but we all have to sacrifice somewhere. Add two of the biggest weiners on top (wait, where have I heard that before?) of the building and you get instant gratification.
