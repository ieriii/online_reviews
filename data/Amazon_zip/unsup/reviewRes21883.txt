Expensive dogs. Had to get that out first. Great tradition. Great food. I always get the dog with everything and a chocolate shake. Ooooh the shakes are good. Crazy thick. If you have never been here you have to try it. I don't care if it's a long drive it's a great experience. If you live out of town and you are visiting Chicago be sure to stop here at least once. There is one in Wheeling now too.
