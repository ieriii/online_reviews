Oh Milk & Honey, I would love you so if only you were a little more polite. I love the food. The granola is truly fantastic. But the overall atmosphere here is lacking. Don't get me wrong, I have zero problem with waiting in line for a yummy brunch. But I do not like all the hovering over those already seated that tends to happen here. There isn't really a way to get around the hovering as the tables are nearly right up to the counter. Kind of kills the charm for me that I wanted to see in this place. Service also lends little in way of adding charm. But, that said, it really is a yummy brunch even if it is loud and people might be hovering over you while you eat. I still go here; I just go prepared and buy a bag of granola to enjoy at home.
