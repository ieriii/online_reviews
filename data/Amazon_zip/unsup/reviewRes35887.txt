Oddly, some of the best sushi in Chicago. Probably because their turnover is HUGE, therefore they have some of the best and freshest seafood in town. No, they do not have an extensive sushi menu, but what they've got is good. Had their lobster roll which was excellent (I asked them to go light on the mayo). I've had a number of dishes here- the seafood is always fresh and excellent. They lose one star because the last time I was there I had a poorly trained new waitress who did not know the menu, did not know you can request the Oyster bar food if you're ordering a meal, etc. Hopefully, they're not slipping.
