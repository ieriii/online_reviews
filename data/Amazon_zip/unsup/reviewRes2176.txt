Yes! My first Yelp review and I had to write a review for this place. I just came back from Chicago this past weekend and I can't stop thinking about Hot Doug's. It was a scorching 90 something degrees when we went there. We were told the wait was 1 1/2 hours and almost left, but something told us to stay.  I had the foie gras and sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli and it was unbelievably delicious. I love getting anything with foie gras so this was an obvious choice. I highly recommend getting it char-broiled. I also had the fries cooked in duck fat (only available on fridays & saturdays!) and that was extremely tasty also.  The prices were not expensive at all too...ranging from $1.25 (for a regular Chicago hot dog) to $9 (foie gras duck sausage hot dog).  If you're ever in Chicago or if you live in Chicago, PLEASE PLEASE go to Hot Doug's! It's totally worth the wait.!
