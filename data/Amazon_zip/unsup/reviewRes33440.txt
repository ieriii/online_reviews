With so many raving reviews, I can't add much. But, I do want to say, thank you for providing such righteous eye candy to accompany our stellar and frugal dinner. Srsly, the best falafel found in Chicago. But, I was disappointed to find Sultan's was out of lamb shawarma before 8pm on a weekday. But, back to the men. The eye candy is tall, well-dressed, and remarkably non-douchey. My two girlfriends who accompanied me to dinner couldn't stop laughing at my less than subtle ogling. However, when do three women ranging in height from 5'8'' to 6'1'' get to feel petite? It's rare. Isn't it, ladies? So, would anyone like to join me in a scientific poll? We could do a traffic count of tall, attractive, employed men who enjoy a bite of superior Mediterranean food between the hours of 6-9pm while enjoying the best that Sultan's has to offer.
