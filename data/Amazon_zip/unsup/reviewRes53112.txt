I have to say that compared to their location on Clybourn, I was so disappointed in the food here. The food was served cold, the bean soup had no beans, the yuca frita was pre-cooked and not freshly made. Even after I commented that the food was not hot nothing was said or done. The ropa vieja was horrible. It had a spoiled taste to it. The maduro special was pork that had to have been at least a day old because the tips were old and hard. I probably won't go back to this location. I agree with the other comments that the service was not great. The waiter was more occupied running around and being socialable and checked in with us twice. It was a very weird vibe. For me to go back, the manager has to answer my email where I sent the details of my visit. Having spent $64 for a meal with my family, I probably won't go back for now.
