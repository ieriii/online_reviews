This place was awesome. I went there for the first time from a suggestion from a friend who read reviews on yelp and was visiting from out of town. We went for the Art's Meaty Delight Pan pizza and it was one of the best I've had in Chicago. After packing up my left overs and walking to the "L" stop, there was someone on the platform that asked if it was from the Art of Pizza and when i said yes, they offered to buy my leftovers from me!! I had none of that, since i had to keep it for myself!!!
