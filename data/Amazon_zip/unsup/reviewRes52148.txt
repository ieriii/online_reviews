I was really excited about getting some deep dish style pizza from Chicago. I was a bit disappointed when I tasted the pizza. Not only that, the wait for our food was extremely long, even though we were seated pretty quickly. It took over an hour before we were served.  However, the dining area was pretty neat with the red bricks and the writing on the walls. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm going to try another place and hopefully that will be better.
