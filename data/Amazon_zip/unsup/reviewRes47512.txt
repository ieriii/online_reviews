I arrived at this place half in the bag after the Goose Island Stout Fest but certainly sober enough to know that I was there. I didn't get the place it was like a bunch of yuppies tried to create Kumas Corner and ended up with the Red Headed stepchild. I've been into metal since Black Sabbath started and I've been to tons of metal shows so I'm not a Metallica "Black Album" wannabe metal man. The servants were nice and attentive. I ordered a burger, but don't ask me which one because I was bobbing and weaving on my stool. But I do know it was pretty decent. I remember asking my buddy how many metal bars he'd been to that had fancy chairs and granite table tops?  This place was like Kumas Corner and Exit gone yuppie to me, I just didn't get a comfortable vibe like I'd want to hang out here on a regular basis. I mean I don't need a dozen TV's with Kirk Hammett's face on them to listen to Metallica.
