I heard many a great thing about Pequod"s, and thankfully they were all true. This place has the best deep dish pizza I've ever had, and probably will ever have. The pies are deep, but not too much. They're just right! The toppings are plentiful and thick and the way the cheese and crust bake around the sides will make you salivate or you don't have a pulse. The portions depend on how much you order. Most would say a small will feed two. Not in this city, babe! Unbuckle those pants and order up a medium or larger! The service was friendly for a place so crowded and popular. Folks from joints like Great Lake should take note; this place is succeeding where you are failing. Pequod's is certifiably good, Yelpers! Don't hesitate; grab a group for fun or sit alone and lament into food that will stop you from jumping into traffic.
