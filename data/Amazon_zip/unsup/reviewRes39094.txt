Another stellar review for Longman & Eagle. One word of advice though, I do not recommend L&E for a romantic date night! While it's cozy and super intimate, it's also very loud and crowded. Everything on the menu is super heavy, decadent and delicious - if you're looking to indulge, this is the place to do it! Good crowd. Great cocktails. Can't. Wait. To. Come. Back.
