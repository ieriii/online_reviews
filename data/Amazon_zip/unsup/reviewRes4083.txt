I have read so many of Schwa's wonderful reviews so when I was invited to attend by Yelp's ever so wonderful - Rob L. to join him and some friends last Saturday, I was literally on a calendar countdown. Small and intimate, great music (sorry if you are expecting Beetoven) it's far more hip - subtle hip/hop. Service like no other place I have been to before - the chef's serve you themselves!!! This is a culinary treat and adventure. Two choices: 3 or 9 course meal - we opted for the 9 courses!!! I loved everything placed in front of me and a few times really did want to lick my plate clean. They did an outstanding job pairing the wine we brought (I probably lost count though since soooo much wine was brought). I really appreciate what Michael and his crew have created and can't wait to go back!
