I want to start off by saying that I struggled a bit with this rating. I have been here now on two occassions, each a completely different event/experience, and they both had their merits. However, when it comes down to the food, I had to go with 3 stars because I have simply had better at Brazzaz and Fogo de Chao. The first time we came here was for NYE. This was a wonderful New Years experience and I highly recommend it. You really cant beat the price on this particular night out in Chicago, and the drinks were top notch! The energy was great on NYE, and there were plenty of people, but the the place never felt overcrowded nor did we ever have to wait for a drink. They offered fun cocktails and passed apps (plus champagne), and the bartenders were awesome!! Definitely 4/5 stars! I also came here last week for restaurant week. We had about 8 girls, and our server was really nice. However, I just didnt think the salad and food bars were that great. The cheeses and breads were awesome, but I wasnt too impressed with the soups or with the mixed sides. The meats were okay, but because it was restaurant week, we were only offered 3 choices. The salmon was by far my favorite, it was cooked perfectly. The moroccan chicken like thing was good, but it was an interesting choice of flavoring for me at this type of joint. I initially liked the setup of the long tables extending from the central fire pit, but partially through the meal our guests who were seated close to this were extremely warm from the fire pounding on one side of their face the whole night. Overall, I still like the vibe of this place and I'll most likely try the rooftop when it gets warmer.
