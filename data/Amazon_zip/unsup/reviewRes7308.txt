A Lincoln Park gem! I had, of all things in an Italian restaurant, honey and milk braised ribs, and they were pretty damn good. They could have used a little more bite, in my opinion, but that's a pretty minor grievance. The friends I ate with also thoroughly enjoyed their meals (osso buco and a spicy seafood dish). The waitstaff was very friendly and pretty efficient for a busy night. Small, personal ambiance, too - a great place for a date or dinner with close friends.
