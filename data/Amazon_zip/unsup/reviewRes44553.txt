Definitely a gem in the Lakeview East neighborhood. My husband and I have been coming here for years. The waitstaff is attentive and more down-to-earth than their style might suggest. The rolls(especially the Wakamono or Godzilla) are delicious, but I would also suggest coming early and having a pre-dinner cocktail at its cozy yet eclectic bar.  FYI: It is still BYOB but the wines offered are delicious and inexpensive.
