They Rock SooO hard here!! I've never actually spent the night, but I've celebrated a few friends 21st and 22nd birthdays here! Hands down the best party Hotel I've ever been too! We usually get all dressed up in the room, pre-game it up, and then go out and paint the town Pink! But this past weekend while pre-gaming it in the birthday room, we heard another party going on a few doors down-WOW OMG CRAZY!!! We just walked into the room and everyone in this other room was young and drinking and freaking watching hardcore porn! it was just crazy and i just felt like sharing this place is sooo much fun ta party in!
