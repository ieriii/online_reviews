I stayed here a few months ago and I thought it was a pretty good hotel. I know the Drake has a lot of history to it and many celebrities have stayed here over the years but that does not make a superb hotel IMO. The room I had was a King room facing Oak St Beach. The room was very clean. The bathroom was great with a wonderful shower head. The bed was really comfy. No complaints about the room. It was nicely decorated, clean, and had comfortable beds. Some things that did not endear the Drake to me: 1) No free wifi in the rooms for the regular Joes of the world. You have to be a Hilton Honors Gold or Platinum member to get free wifi in the room. Otherwise you will incur a cost of $12.95 per day or $7.50 for 1 hr to access their wifi. 2) Valet parking was an astounding $55 for overnight parking! 3) It cost me $249/ngt for a standard King room during a slow time of the month. 4) I thought the lobby was not all that others claim it to be. It was nothing spectacular. Many other hotels have a more appealing lobby. The staff are very eager to please and are all friendly and hospitable. Also, I did enjoy the gym. The gym is huge with 3 rooms filled with lots of free weights and machines. I love the location of the hotel. It is steps away from Michigan Ave. And it is right across the street from Oak St Beach! I would stay here again for the location alone.
