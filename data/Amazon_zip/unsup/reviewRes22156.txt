So we came here after dining in Chinatown (which I will also write a review of) so sadly, we didn't each much, hence why I didn't give full review....but what we had, was amazing, and the service was great, so I'm giving it the next best review. My mother is Costa Rican, and so I've spent years traveling to Costa Rica and eating authentic food....so going with two women from the country and myself, this place had a lot to prove. But we were all very pleased with what we had! I had cafe con leche, which was good...our friend had Tamarindo (which was great and she loved), and my mom had the Avena (oatmeal) shake. I've seen the Avena shake before, but it never looked appetizing so I never tried it....but I decided why not? And took a sip, and boy did I wish I ordered that instead of my coffee! It was SO GOOD. We also had the Chifrijo appetizer...black beans mixed with fried pork, as well as diced veggies served with chips....really good as well. We were joined by our friend later who had empanadas....what can I say? Good, good, good. Sadly, that was all we ate. But it was really busy for a Wednesday night...and what was great is that it was BYOB (I've never seen that in LA) and so all the guests brought their six pack or bottles of wine....which is a huge save since alcoholic drinks can get really pricey at restaurants. Our waiters and hostess were all really nice as well. Next time, I'll order patacones and the classic gallo pinto....and I will DEFINITELY be ordering the Avena shake. Yum!
