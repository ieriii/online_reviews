Chicago for sushi.  It's a cause for concern for someone who comes from LA, where sushi joints and "fusion" restaurants outnumber liquor stores. I don't pretend to be a sushi snob, but I can tell the difference between the places that sell you fish and the places that sell you the restaurant. This was the latter. Went for a friend's birthday. Tried a roll or two, which were alright (though everyone from Illinois was impressed), my teriyaki salmon ( I prefer shioyaki) was almost fast food bowl fare dressed up as fine dining. And I realize now that the hamachi carpaccio, which was oversalted and overseasoned, seems sort of antithetical to the concept of sushi. Okay, so maybe I am a bit of a sushi snob, but I actually like the taste of the fish. The GOOD thing about this place is the BYOB policy, which is limited to wine, beer, and sake, but really all you need when you eat sushi. This is the nicest BYOB place I have ever been to. You can get TOASTED here and the wait staff was very accommodating for it. And honestly, when you're going to get that drunk (like many of us were trying to) good sushi is sort of a waste, and 'good enough' sushi will do just fine. Except that you pay a premium dollar for it. We all still had a good time. The verdict: LA's "fusion" punches Chicago in the mouth in the sushi contest, but Chicago is too drunk to care.
