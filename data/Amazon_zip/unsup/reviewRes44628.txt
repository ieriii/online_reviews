My husband and I were visiting Chicago for the first time and were really looking to have some Chicago Style Pizza. We went to one place that our hotel recommended however, we ended up leaving after being there for 10mins. We went to Giordano's hoping their service was going to be better and that the pizza was going to be good. IT WAS!!! Our server was super sweet and everything was so good! We got Fried Zucchini as an appetizer- so good! and we had gotten 1/2 cheese, 1/2 Pepperoni Stuffed Pizza. It was all so wonderful. There were alot of people in the restaurant and there were alot of families and children. Everyone was happy. and we were full by the time we left! We had gotten a medium sized pizza- for the two of us...we each were stuffed on the app and 2 slices each and we now have a late night snack. we would def. return!
