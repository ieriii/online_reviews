So...What's up with this street...Everything that opens up is so out there...This place is funky with a slight hint touch of Whigger.You know...Jamie Kennedy "pound it"White guy acting black...So... sipping on my 40Patio is great, but I don't understand half of these concepts on this street. Only in Chicago...
