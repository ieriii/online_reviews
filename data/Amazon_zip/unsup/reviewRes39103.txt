Outstanding food and service! We arrived at about 6 PM on a Friday night and the restaurant was still relatively empty. We chose to sit at the bar and the bartender, Chad, went over and above explaining to us differences among bourbons and even made us a custom flight! We also tried the Shruberry (just okay) and Ransometta (quite good) cocktails. For food we had the meatballs (amazing!), pig head (wow!), and lamb sausage (pretty good). We probably should have ordered more food for the two of us but were trying to make it a light meal and keep the cost down. The only downside to me was the space. Other patrons were crowding us at the bar - our fault for choosing that area - but I noticed that even those who had tables had their space invaded by customers trying to get drinks at the bar. The quality of food and service were equivalent to a restaurant like the Girl and the Goat, but so were the prices, and without offering the same relaxed dining experience.
