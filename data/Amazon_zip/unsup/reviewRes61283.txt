this is a great place! the value to me is not as good as texas brazil, but this food is definitely quality. the salad bar is great! service is professional. i have never had to wait more than 15minutes to get a table here. even with coupons, my bill for two people always seemed to get near $200. if you like meat, this is a great place to definitely goi have been back many timesthey have many coupons you can get if you search online and also i receive them in the mail from time to time
