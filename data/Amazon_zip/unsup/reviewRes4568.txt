I work blocks away and had been wanting to trying the place out for months but the wait is always SO FREAKING LONG! So we came here for lunch, just after they opened and they were already starting to run out of tables. Bone marrow smear -- so famous right? But it didn't taste like pork at all, like slightly herb-y oil... disappointing. My mom makes tastier marrow. The JLT and milk braised pork shoulder, however, were really good. Sumptuous, even. The dishes look kinda small but they're so rich we were stuffed sharing these 3 for a quick lunch. We'd definitely come back to try some more porky goodness!
