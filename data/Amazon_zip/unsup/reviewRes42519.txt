So I've had this pizza twice now - stuffed pizza both times. I have to say that I loved it the first time and was only mildly impressed the second time. I think the most important thing to remember here is to make sure that your slices or pizza is hot and hasn't been sitting out too long. The bf and I made the mistake the second time we went to get the slices that were already in the warmer rather than waiting the extra 7 minutes for the fresh slices. So morale of the story is that it tastes great as everyone has said, but get it while it's hot.  On a somewhat similar note, next Sunday we are going to hold a taste-off between Art of Pizza and My Pi. my friend Meredith and her bf LOVE art of pizza and my bf loves My Pi so it should be a great, FILLING day - at least we are doing the Wrigley Run that morning so I won't feel too guilty. I'll post the results later...
