This is probably the best Thai place in the Chicago area. They're food is so tasty and filled with spices. And if you're not a fan of spicy food, you can always instruct the waiters to have your food made a bit less spicy. Best of all this place is super affordable. And the portions are huge too. Everytime I have gone here, I have had to have my food packed to take home. Count on getting a great, filling meal for a very reasonable price at this delicious restraunt. If you're a thai food fan, you're not going to want to miss out on this one!
