Alinea is amazing in every sense of the word. Dining at Alinea is not just a dinner-- it's an *experience* that awakens all your senses.  As my birthday present, my boyfriend took me here and we dined for nearly six hours until 1:00 am. (You can have your dining experience last as long as you want-- you'll never feel rushed, and you're treated like family. I suggest that you savor every bite because the molecular gastronomy technique is showcased at its best at Alinea, and you should immerse yourself in the total experience for as long as you can.) My boyfriend and I each got the 23-course dinner and paired it with wine. It was absolutely amazing-- we loved every bite. The potato "soup" was delicious and the "steak and potatoes" dish was ingenious. I don't think any review can even come close to describing how DELICIOUS and out-of-this-world the food tastes, but please know that all the five star ratings that Alinea earns is a true testament to its culinary art. The atmosphere is intimate with the restaurant sectioned into little intimate, dimly-lit areas that house only a couple of tables. No one takes flash pictures because no one wants to disturb any other diners. At the end of the dinner, you will be invited to tour the kitchen. Definitely don't miss this opportunity to see the chef at work and to see how the kitchen is a spotless, well-oiled machine. Everyone knows his/her job and everything is done efficiently and quickly. You will not be disappointed, and you will be simply amazed by your dining experience. Go on the website: (http://www.alinea-restau), enjoy the pictures, and definitely dine there if you are in Chicago.
