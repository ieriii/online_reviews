I was excited to head to the Publican last weekend for dinner with some friends and must admit I was slightly disappointed by the experience. We had reservations at 9:30 but still ended up having to wait for our table maybe 30 minutes. At least they checked our coats when we headed in so we didn't have to lug them around while we waited with drinks. I had to leave a credit card and was told I would be charged if we canceled our reservation. I am ok with whatever policy they have, but I was not expecting this. We ordered a lot of things. My favorites - the mussels, frites and pork belly. Honestly, I was disappointed in the pork rinds that everyone else raved about. Maybe that just isn't my palate. Overall, fun evening though!
