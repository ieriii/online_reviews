Went there for a birthday and this place was really cool. The day that we went it was really hot, but it was okay because the drinks were cold and the crowd was really fun. The drinks were awesome and priced for the area. I can't wait until the weather warms up and the patios open in the area because it is so much fun!! Chicago is so lucky to have such a fun area that has pretty much been kept to the locals so far. The Fifty/50 just adds to the overall coolness of the Damen/Division area. Haven't tried the food... Will update review when I do.
