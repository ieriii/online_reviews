in the simplest of terms, I liked XOCO better. It's cheaper, faster, and with a simpler menu. For the eater that's on the GO, head to XOCO. I guarantee you won't have HOT PLATE, I hate HOT PLATE. Liked the mojito, loved the ceviche. If you have a client meeting...take them to Frontera Grill...it may just help you close a deal.
