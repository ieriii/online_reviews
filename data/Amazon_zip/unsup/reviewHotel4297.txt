When I walked into Palmer House, I felt like I was walking into a movie set. It was so luxurious and beautiful. Grandiose and amazing. I paid a pre-negotiated rate for $85 and never was I treated like someone who paid a negotiated rate. I took advantage of an upgrade to a double room in the executive suite on floor 23 for an additional $55. The room was wonderful. I am a HUGE fan of two beds/two baths. The room had two closets, safe, bathrobes, a flat screen and IPOD clock. Amazing showers and pressures. The beds were very comfortable. The only thing that could have made the room better was free wifi.... HOWEVER on the exec floor there were computers available. Also on the exec floor was a bartender, free non alcoholic beverages, snacks, appetizers, and breakfast. The parking is ridiculous but we paid overnight parking up the street for $12. The hotel is next door to Miller Pub which had great food for the value and a wider variety than I thought for pub food. Location.....wonderful for sites and shopping. I DEFINITELY will stay at Palmer House again.
