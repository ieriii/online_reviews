Big Jones is AMAZING! My favorite neighborhood joint. What I love about this place, aside from the fact that their food is incredibly fresh, quirky, inventive, and delicious- is their stellar service! Andy is the sweetest guy and a great server. I am vegan and I cannot tell you how wonderful they have been and how many times they have gone out of their way to accommodate my diet. They have some great things on the menu that are vegan or can be altered to be vegan. They have made me special dishes when I let them know I am coming in advance. Most notably, the chef made our table vegan snicker doodle cookies one night after having a nice three hour evening there. He came out to the table and explained to us that he realized he was out of soy flour and decided to make them out of pulverized almonds instead. I mean, really? That is amazing. And thoughtful. Warm vegan snicker doodle cookies made from fresh pulverized almonds on the fly? Please patronize this restaurant. They deserve to stay around for years and years to come. You will not be disappointed. The menu is seasonal, the iced tea and cocktails are great, and in the summer they bring boiled peanuts to your table when you sit down. It's like a drive halfway to the gulf coast of Florida and stopping on the side of the road for boiled peanuts heaven. And being from the South, I appreciate their food and service even more. A great place to dine with friends and people from out of town. Big Jones, I love you, and me and my Mom will be there for Mother's Day.
