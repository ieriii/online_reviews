I came here with a few girlfriends to get some drinks pre-sushi dinner.  We couldn't find the entrance at first..oh look a graffiti wall BUT there's a light at the entrance! How secretive. So we walk in and shut the door and it was pitch black in the little hallway entrance. Oh crap, we're lost. After pulling out our iphone flashlight apps we find our ways through 2 sets of dark heavy curtains and find our way inside(ps you're not supposed to use cell phones inside, house rules) The ambiance inside was amazing and so swanky. It was dark and intimate with pretty glass chandeliers and cozy little booths. You really do feel like you're in a different world, in our opinion, the Gossip Girl world ;) We ordered the Juliet and Romeo, Dark and Stormy and the Standing Six Foot Four. The drinks on the menu are split up by alcohol type and the waitress told us that the drinks get stronger as you go down each section. The drinks were the best ones I've had in a while, they were all interesting and unique. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Bathrooms have Malin and Goetz rum soap, I wish I could steal this and put it in my own bathroom. In sum, go here before dinner when there's no wait. Drinks are 12 dollars. No cell phones.
