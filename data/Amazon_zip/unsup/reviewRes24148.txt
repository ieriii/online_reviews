If you've never eaten in Chinatown, you have to start here. Like many other authentic Chinese restaurants around here, the menu features a thousand or so different options, so prepare yourself. I went on a weeknight and my buddy and I ordered, probably, ten different things and paid $25 or $30, it was insane. I can't remember everything we had, but the Hot and Sour soup stood out and the food was deliciously spicy. Definitely one of the top spots around.
