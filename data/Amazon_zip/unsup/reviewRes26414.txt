Tapas are my life. I loved these. The leeks felt like silky bacon wrapped onion-like flavor that only can be described as the drums of the earth. great, I enjoyed the flatbread, although it was greasy. The stake was so good I ordered seconds. My lamb was superb and the surf and turf blew my mind. How does a scallop taste sweet without being disgusting, or steak be spicy yet subtle? ONLY IRON CHEF GARCES KNOWS!!!!!!
