Ordered the dinner combo..spicy chicken shawerma, hummus, cucumber salad, and a falafel....and was treated at the hospital for food posioning. I was debating on even writing this review but honestly, i've been feeling real S($&ty since that day...and i honestly have to say that the place in my opinion is to dirty looking, which is why i really feel the food posioning really happen....1st time there and last.
