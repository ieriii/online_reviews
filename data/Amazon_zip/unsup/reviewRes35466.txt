I am TOTALLY laughing my ass off at Erika G.'s review (think she liked the duck?). I had the wonderful fortune of dining here with the "Super Elites" for Amaliya's birthday, too and, as such, ate all the same wonderful yumminess described in Erika's review. But here are the things that really stood out for me: 1) The special shrimp with bacon appetizer was TO DIE FOR! I could've easily made a meal out of that alone (came close). 2) OMG! The Peking Duck! I LOVED the duck. GO HERE NOW for the duck. This is the BEST duck! The duck is amazing! Have I mentioned the duck?;) Seriously, though... Your server carves the bird table-side and arranges the meat on a plate for you and another person to assemble your duck buns (heh..heh heh). While they suggest one duck for every 2 people, I think the servers tend to underestimate how many people one duck will feed. Considering the buns, sauce, veggies and rice or noodles a $28 Peking duck come with, I think one can easily feed 4 people. That said...screw the rice (though it is good) GET THE NOODLES! Amy says they cook them in the duck fat and they are DELICIOUS! Mmmmm, good AND bad for ya! (I wonder if you can order duck noodles without the duck...MY GOD! What am I SAYING?!?!) 4) All the other food was very good (though I'd say stay away from the seafood combo - kinda bland). But, most notably, the portions are GINORMOUS! For $5 you get a giant heaping plate of food that, IMO, is enough for at least 2 meals. 3) The service is stellar. The young woman who took care of our large-ish party was patient, informative, funny, GREAT with our two 3 year-olds and an all-around good sport. The only bad thing about Sun Wah is that the place is kind of a dump. However, if they're sacrificing ambiance for the pricing and quality of the food, HOORAY! I cannot wait to go back here.
