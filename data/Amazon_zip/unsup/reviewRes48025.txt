My friends and I had a meal at the Publican on our recent visit to Chicago. We all enjoyed the meal very much. Service: The service was good. Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well. Ambiance: The restaurant is a little loud, and much of the seating are community table. However, they have some booth available. The booths are unique in that they are closed off with doors. Food: The food was delicious. Everything is tapas style so they suggest you get 2-3 dishes per person. We ordered.... Pork Rinds [http://www.yelp.com/user - Decent, but nothing special. Steak Tartare [http://www.yelp.com/user - The steak tartae was good, but I loved the deep friend boiled egg on top more! Jamon Serrano - Nice and simple. Fresh shaved Jamon Serrano and bread. Yum! Duck & Foie Gras Terrine[http://www.yelp.com/user - A good combination of duck meat and foie gras. The meaty duck help offset the richness of the foie gras. Ramps - Pretty much what you'd expect, but very flavorful. Softshell Crab [http://www.yelp.com/user - This was OK. A little on the salty side and not as crisp as I would have liked. Sea Bass [http://www.yelp.com/user;userid=3hWhXTkU83jsm3jIA-rkIg]- Moist and Meaty. Cooked very well. Pork Belly [http://www.yelp.com/user - My favorite dish of the night. Not too fatty. Glazed well, caramelized on the outside. Meaty with a nice salty sweet crust. Fish Stew [http://www.yelp.com/user - Perfectly cooked seafood. Mussles, Octopus, Fish, Clams, and Shrimp. Everything was cooked to perfection. Even the Octopus which I expected to be a little chewy was super tender. You could eat it without any teeth! Chocolate Cream Pie [http://www.yelp.com/user - YUM! My favorite dessert of the trip. A nice thick chocolate cream pie. Went perfect with the salty pretzel crust. Absolutely delicious! I definitely wouldn't mind eating here again. The food was great! There wasn't anything I did not like!
