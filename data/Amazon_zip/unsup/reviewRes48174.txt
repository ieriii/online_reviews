With close to 1000 reviews, I don't know how much I can really add here.. but hot damn. The Publican is serious about their meat and serious about their beer. It's loud inside, with communal tables, so it's not the best place for quiet conversation, but it is probably one of the best temples of meatiness I've been to. My favorite meat there was the steak tartare. Tangy, slightly spicy, with melt-in-your-mouth delicious raw steak, it's raised the bar for me on what steak tartare can be. And at just under $100 for 3 people with a couple of drinks each, it's not the cheapest place around, but I'd say it's a pretty outstanding value for the quality. Worth including in any carnivorous visit to Chicago.
