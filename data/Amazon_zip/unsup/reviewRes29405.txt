I LOVE the Pasta Bowl. I usually order the farfalle pollo or the pasta bolognase - both are outstanding! The food is cheep and they give you gigantic portions. They have a good drink selection and the resteraunt is never too loud or too crowded. I sometimes order to-go, but choose to pick up my food instead of having it delivered, as it takes around an hour for delivery. Really everything on the menu is yummy and I keep going back!
