I can name 5 vegan restaurants in the USA that make me want to pull my pants down, run around in circles and say HELL YEAH! Chicago diner is on that list. This is my second time there - and I'll be back in Chicago in 3 weeks for business... guess where I'll be? Everything I've had there was A+. The serving staff is always mega friendly. Its not the healthiest place to go, but if you want some amazing food without any guilt - this is the place to be.
