Hot Doug's gets the elusive 5 star tating. Where else can you get rattlesnake sausage, grand marnier pate and cheese-stuffed pepper toppings, and (my favourite) DUCK FAT FRIES? A HUGE part of the charm is Doug himself, who is responsible for the wild concoctions, the hilarious decor, and the friendly, witty service. He always mans the register. For people who can't handle the hours, would you like to work an extra 6 hours in addition to your regular shift each day? Doug is there all day long, 6 days a week. Give the man a holiday once in a while, and evenings and Sundays off. I personally don't want another manager behind the counter.  It wouldn't be the same without him. A helpful tip is on the restaurant's website itself: "We take a ton of holidays off. Call to make sure we're open first." Not incredibly difficult.
