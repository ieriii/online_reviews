I went here for a business dinner and thought it was pretty nice. Everyone I was with enjoyed their meal. The service left something to be desired though. It was not good, but the place was new and maybe they worked out some kinks. I am giving it 4 stars, but that is on a scale adjusted for restaurants in the loop. Not a whole lot of good places down here. It just may be my favorite in the loop for right now....until I get the chance to go to Everest I'm sure. lol. If you have to eat in the loop it is worth checking out.
