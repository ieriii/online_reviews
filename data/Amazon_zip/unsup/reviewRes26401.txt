Jose Garces has taken his Philadelphia act to the windy city! Jose always does a great job with his sangrias and cocktails including Chicago's own HUM liqueur. I strongly recommend the Charcuteria and Queso plates to start (similar to his offerings at the Garces Trading company in Philly.) The chocolate-hazelnut and marmalade dipping sauces that the cheese plate comes with are particularly scrumptious. Additionally the waitstaff is very knowledgeable about the menu and seems to enjoy their job which makes for a fun atmosphere regardless of the dining occasion.
