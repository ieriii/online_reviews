Great Thai food! This place was recommended to me as the 'best' Thai in the city. I got takeout and it arrived VERY quickly and VERY hot.  The quality of the food was great- super tasty and very unique in flavor. I will definitely order takeout again. Though I can't say I am tempted to eat in the restaurant- I've walked by and it seems to lack ambience.
