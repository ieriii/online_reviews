I've now been here twice so feel qualified to review... once for a glass of wine and some cheese, and once for the burger since it was featured in Chicago magazine and one of our bosses decided this merited a team lunch - who am I to argue! First off we went for wine on a Thursday. It was meant to be a gap filler - i was en route to O'Hare and needed a drink to make it through the labyrinthian hellhole - ahem, sorry - but I ended up wishing i had a whole evening there. This might be because at the time, they were doing a ridiculous deal where some wines were $10 a bottle... so ridiculous, we felt bad, and ordered some cheese. The selection of cheese is phenomenal, the server was very good and informative while patiently ignoring my irrational cheese foibles (turns out 'i don't like anything stinky' is both untrue and not terribly helpful). We had some unbelievably good feta, and... i can't remember the others. I do remember not being a fan of the dried bread cracker stuff that came with - proper bread and crackers for me, please, not an attempt at both at the same time. But, that's a minor detail, and I did like the grissini being on the table anyway. Second trip for the burger at lunch: 9 of us show up, they seat us immedtaiely, they take 9 seperate burger orders, all with different cheese, cooking instructions and relishes. They are delivered speedily and without fuss to the right people. I'd say mine was a bit more than medium rare, verging on medium so a little dry to my taste, but dammit it was still goooood (3 extra O's good, remember that). Fries also very very good, crispy and salty. I am most excited to go back and try their 'best grilled cheese in Chicago' given the standard of this meal. Negative - not feeling a lot of ambience in the restaurant for lunch, and STOP FILLING UP MY WATER. Hovering near my head while I take a sip only to then splosh the stuff all over the table? Stop it stop it stop it.
