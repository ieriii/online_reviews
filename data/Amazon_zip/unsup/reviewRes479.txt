Best meal of my life, won't say more because there's plenty said. Regarding previous comment about the wine pairings -- yes, for the 12 course the pairings were mostly whites and only 1 red, but these were some amazing whites. I'm not a big white wine drinker myself, but after this meal I'm going to start exploring whites because the pairings were genius. The aromas were absolutely tantalizing and I almost didn't want to drink because I just wanted to keep inhaling.
