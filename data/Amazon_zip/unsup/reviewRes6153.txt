Recently, I dined at this restaurant with 3 friends. While waiting for a table, we ordered a bottle of wine at the bar, to share. When presented with the bar tab, we were charged a $7.00 corkage fee, for the wine which we bought there! Perhaps this is a new practice at some restaurants, but I will not be dining at any place that pulls this kind of scam, nor will my friends. It ruined a nice evening, and made no sense, when the hapless bartender and waiter tried to justify it.
