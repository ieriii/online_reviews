I was sooo excited to eat here, but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. I usually don't eat at fancy smancy restaurants, but this was our "late" v-day dinner. Came here on restaurant week and they were pretty busy. The wait wasn't too long, but we still decided to grab a drink at the bar. It was crazy busy and took about 10 min to get a drink. The rasberry mojito was really good, but not worth the $10 for the size of the drink. Finally got seated in a tiny table. I felt a little squashed between the two couples next to us. The restaurant was beautiful and vibrant though. Ordered the chicken empanada app. Ehh it wasn't even a real empanada and again was not worth the money for the size. I had the pollo and the bf had the pernil. The pollo was delish. The breast part of the chicken was a little dry, but they flavor of the sauce was good. The pernil was good, but the arroz con gandules was not good at all. I think the chef needs to take a trip to humboldt park and taste real arroz, because his did not taste good. Anyway i would give this place another shot.
