Artopolis is a gread little cafe to sit and sip Greek coffee drinks or even alcoholic beverages for that matter. But the best is their food. Quite tasty pizzas, although not the typical Chicago-style. Their sandwhiches are delish but make sure to try them with the most amazing pasta salad ever! The artopites are great, I like the cheese the best. And of course, there is desert! I recommend skipping anything that looks like a cheesecake or custard...they are way too eggy tasting for me. The chocolate cakes are great and the Greek honey cookies amazing!
