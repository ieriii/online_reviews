I have to second Ashley F. on this one. How can yuppies and hipsters both be blamed for the Hopleaf's recent surge in popularity? Denegrating a particular social group on Yelp by way of a bar review is the very definition of pathetic. That being said . . . the Hopleaf has been extremely packed lately. I know they are expanding next door, but if you came up to Andersonville just to go to the Hopleaf and you can't get a table don't worry, there is more than one bar in the neighborhood. The Edgewater Lounge and In Fine Spirits are good alternatives for great beer and tasty food, albeit with their own vibes. Symons, Farraguts and Charlie's all have a good beer selection too. If you want pizza, super friendly service, turkish beer and an extremely eclectic crowd just head next door to Konak. If you absolutely have to go to the Hopleaf do what the locals do, come early and come often.
