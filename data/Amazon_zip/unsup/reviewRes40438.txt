This review is a little late, but very well deserved about Tank Noodle, on North Broadway in Chicago. A friend of mine today asked me why all my reviews are always so positive. I replied I choose what goes up on here, and every review is a way of "educating the public" so to speak, either on great hidden gems, or to warn them what they need to stay away from. Tank Noodle is a positive review, without a single doubt in my mind. To be fair, I'm not exactly an expert on Vietnamese cuisine, though a friend of mine did recently study abroad there. However, I can say with confidence that Tank Noodle is worth the title of Best Vietnamese restaurant in all of Chicago. Here's why: authentic flavors in every dish. My friend L and I went on quite the adventure (Gay Pride Parade 2012, they closed most of the roads around the restaurant) but once we got there, fast service and fantastic food! To start, we ordered the Vietnamese Sizzling Crepe as an appetizer. When it first came out, I was kind of perplexed. You break off the crepe and use it to wrap up the filling, using lettuce to wrap it all together and then you dip it into the sweet and sour fish sauce. Weird, but delicious. I had a million different flavors all exploding in my mouth at once, and I have to say, once I got over the weirdness, it was really good! Next up, I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup (known as Pho) which was just out of this world. I mean, this giant bowl comes out, and my mouth just drops. The bowl takes up a good portion of the table, because of how large it is. It's hot and steaming, filled to the brim with beef, noodles, and lots of broth. In my mouth, each slurp and bite was better than the first, somehow. Flavored with cilantro and various other spices, the unexpected was delicious. I know Vietnamese food is not for everyone, but if you like an adventure when dining out, check out Tank Noodle. There is a very good reason it's the best Vietnamese Restaurant in Chicago!
