I'm not even going to bother talking about the food here. It's obviously pretty amazing. I'm giving them five-stars for the adventure of trying to foil their impeccable service. By the time our food arrived, my companion and I had been seated, served and swaddled by no less than a dozen precisely coordinated dervishes. I'm a pretty low key dude, so all of this attention kind of freaked me out (in a good way, mind you; I mean no disservice to the incredible experience they provide). Of course, given that my bladder is the size of a morel-infused poached fava bean, I inevitably had to use the little pilgrim's room. I waited patiently until all of the visible members of the troupe appeared to be swirling around other patrons to make my break. I made it to within 3 steps from the restroom door when someone LEAPED OUT FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN to show me the rest of the way. Needless to say, it took me a couple of minutes to calm the notion that someone was going to leap out to assist me at the loo, too. That said (tongue-in-cheek, of course), the staff at Tru did an amazing job at removing the pretense and pressure typically associated with fine dining and injecting it with fun and flair, resulting in a fabulous experience neither my friend nor I will soon forget.
