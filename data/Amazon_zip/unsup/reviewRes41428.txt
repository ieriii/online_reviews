so we came here tonight expecting something really great, given all the reviews. I was really expecting a wow factor. I was telling my husband how much I was looking forward to this restaurant. The food was just okay for me. Service was excellent. The chef was at all the tables and the waiter was constantly asking if everything was okay. We had the 5 course dinner and I was really waiting for the wow factor out of one of the dishes and I really did not feel any. Now I am a gourmet cook at home but I would have liked to say that one of the dishes were fantastic but unfortuanately I could not. Boo hoo
