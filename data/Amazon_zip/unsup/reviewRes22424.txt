I've been here twice - for Kim A's birthday dinner two years in a row. She picked the same place twice, so it's assumed this place is great. I don't understand why people think the service is terrible. Both times I've been here, it's been with a group of 20+ people. The servers were constantly coming around to refill waters and our chip bowls. After taking down our orders, it seemed like a few sips of BYOW before everyone was being served their order. Recommend the Costa Rican sandwich, the Vegetarian Burrito and the empanadas- too many to choose from, all yummers.
