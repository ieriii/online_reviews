Had lunch here with my 1 year old and my girlfriend. Totally underwhelmed. Aside from the bartender who doubled as a hostess, the service was terrible. As I said, the bartender was great at getting us going with a highchair and drinks, but our waitress was never around. Our burgers were ordered medium but were bloody in the middle. All in all, not good. On the plus side, the fries were good. The beer selection was good. But there are way better burgers out there that have way better service.
