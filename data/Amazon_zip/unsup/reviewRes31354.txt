I've been wanting to get to Nana forever and finally made it on a perfect October evening. Our table was in an open door to the sidewalk and it couldn't have been nicer. I won't rehash what many others have said about the food, let's just say it was wonderful and I can't wait to come back again to try some other dishes.
