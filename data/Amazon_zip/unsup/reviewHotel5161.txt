When I walked in, I was taken aback because it looked like a club during happy hour. It took me two laps to find the concierge and check-in (go straight back, to the left).Pros:The king bed was super comfy and I didn't want to get up in the mornings.The music and club atmosphere I actually enjoyed. It made the experience different, new, and memorable rather than the typical hotels with the granda-esque drapes, blankets, and carpets that make you feel like you're in a 1950's hotel or your grandma's house.The concierge was friendly. He made reservations at a local restaurant and called a cab for us.They have Bliss Spa products in the bathroom!!!Everyone there were young professionals. Its definitely a popular happy hour spot. We started at the lobby bar, went out for the night, and ended up back at the lobby bar for a night cap. Then I just walked to the elevator and up to my room. That was too easy :)Cons:The train is half a block away and could wake you up.There is a halogen light outlining the bed with its own light switch, kinda neat but kinda annoying. I thought the glam factor was a bit overdone in the rooms. They should keep that in the lobby.Watch out for the $8 Fiji water's in the room! There's a 7-11 next door, dunkin donuts and subway across the street.They charge for internet/wifi ($15/day) unless you have a corporate deal.The bartender's didn't seem to have a very broad knowledge of drinks, but they were accommodating to our requests.There is no Bliss Spa at this location :(Overall:I will be staying here again next time I visit Chicago.
