The Garlic Wings are heavenlyyy and it's not just those tiny wings, it's pretty big. Luv them luv them, also get tasty side dishes, like the fried mushroom balls, onion rings and fries. I was curious of the Bim bim Bap so we ordered the Big Buddha Bowl and this is one of the reason I didn't give full 5 stars cause the Bimbimbap is so cold :(, I know they didn't use hotpot, but if they could just make the beef and the rice hot, I think the overall would definitely taste sooooooooooooo much better... Service is awesome, the waiter and owner are so friendly, great price 2. Plus one thing that made me feel even better, I saw the sticker that this resto has been yelped!!! :P
