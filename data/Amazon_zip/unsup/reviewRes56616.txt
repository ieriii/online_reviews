Mastro's definitely delivered on ambience and service. We started out with the Oysters Rockefeller which were a tad bit hot. The warm spinach salad was amazing and the Chillean sea bass was good. (surprisingly large portion of fish) I had heard about the warm butter cake and was inclined to try it, but again this dish was served a bit too warm for my liking. Perhaps the temps were a bit off that night, nevertheless I will probably go back to try it again.
