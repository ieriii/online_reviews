Great Hotel! One of the most impressive lobby's I have ever experienced. The rooms are very comfortable and cozy. I was won over by the great service the staff offered, especially when you have requests at odd hours of the night. The location is unbeatable as well, just a few blocks from the EL makes for easy commuting to just about anywhere downtown.
