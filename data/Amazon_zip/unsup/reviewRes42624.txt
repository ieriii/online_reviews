Let me just preface this by saying that the food here is fantastic, but the drinks are seriously outrageously priced. Two scotch on the rocks - $34 - and this was not some 12 year or 16 year aged stuff. A large bottle of cider - $14. Crazy. That being said, I loved the food- I had the steak tartar to start and the husband had the bone marrow and both were delish and served with like half a loaf of bread. He then had the pork belly and I had the rabbit pasta. Both were delicious, although the husband said the pork belly at Topolo is better (duh). No room for desserts and their website menu needs updating because the menu online does not match what was actually on the menu when you sat down. I might go back for dinner, but would limit my drinking!
