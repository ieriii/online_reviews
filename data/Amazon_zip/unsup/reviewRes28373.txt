I wish that i had liked this restaurant more than i did. My expectations were set very high because of the multiple culinary awards and praise that the restaurant has received. Perhaps this hindered my experience in some respects. I feel that the most important thing i can tell anyone interested in trying the Frontera Grill for the first time it this: The food served here is authentic Mexican. This authenticity results in very basic, yet flavorful dishes. I ordered guacamole, fried plantains, and chicken tacos. The guacamole was my favorite part of the meal. It was simple and perfect. The fried plantains were quite good, and i encourage people to try them. There flavor is very sweet, and when complemented with the cream offer a very bold flavor. Unfortunately the tacos were the most bland part of the meal. My realization is this: This restaurant has wonderful atmosphere, interesting selection of foods, but in the end left me wanting more. Obviously this restaurant is not for everyone. I encourage everyone to try it out, but keep you expectations in check. P.S. try the Agua del Dia, it is a very original and creative mix of flavors that create a drink unlike any i have ever experienced, and it complimented the meal perfectly.
