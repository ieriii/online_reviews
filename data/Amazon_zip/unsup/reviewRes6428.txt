Pretty good Italian. They don't take reservations, but you can go to the wine bar across the street and the hostess will call you when your table is ready. Once your group is called, sit down and enjoy the feast. I recommend going with a group of at least 4, but no more than 8 based on the table sizes. The dishes are meant to be shared, almost in a Spanish tapas style. So order a round of appetizers, share and enjoy - my favorite was the focaccia - really light and creamy. Order some main dishes - make sure to get at least one of the giant raviolis. We also enjoyed a couple of the pizzas - I particularly enjoyed the mushroom and leek pizza. Overall, this was an excellent experience. The only negatives: no reservations and the wait staff was a little - for lack of a better word - out there. Enjoy it!
