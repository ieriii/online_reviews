My glass of OJ was $7. This is the most outrageous thing I have ever encountered. Service wasn't bad considering the waitress told me in front of all my buddies that she didn't want me paying the bill because she was not confident that I could tip her well enough considering that I was outraged by the price of my OJ. I had the Huevos Racheros. If you don't know how to make a Mexican dish, then don't put it on your menu!
