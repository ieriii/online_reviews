I would not trust your credit card here. I was here two weeks ago on a Friday and got a $6 beer but they charged my credit card $26. I immediately called them and went to Sarah's voicemail. She called me back & left a mes. I called her back on Tuesday and she took my CC info and said she would call me back in 15 Minutes. Never heard from her. Called this morning and left mes for her. Got out of work and called again and Gretchen- answers the phone- who told me "no I can't tell you when Sarah will be in. I have her your message and you'll just have to wait to hear back from her" in a completely unprofessional tone. Listen you stole $20 from me and/or committed fraud by adding an extra tip. You should be apologizing. I will continue to follow up until this is resolved and also file a claim with discover card to resolve this issue. Update: I received a $20 refund to my discovercard this morning which was the amount overcharged. I never heard back from the restaurant for them to explain how I was overcharged for a beer - I can only imagine someone added an extra $20 tip in - how else would that happen. I am happy it was resolved but this is very shady business practices !!! Also still annoyed with how I was treated on the phone by staff member Gretchen
