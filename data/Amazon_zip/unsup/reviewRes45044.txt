This was my first visit to this restaurant.  When we arrived to be seated for our reservation, they told us there was not a table available and to go to their sister restaurant 2 buildings over for a drink and they would come get us in 10 min. Half hour later, I had to go back and check on them. The hostess told me that she was on her way to come get us. Funny, when I think of a reservation, I would think they would hold a table for that time.  As for the wait service, we watched everyone around get water and bread, but we were neglected and had to ask them to bring it to us. We were not tucked away in a corner or anything, we were right in the middle of the restaurant. Then my girlfriend asked about something on the menu and the waiter told us that he didn't care for it.  After we got through the service issues, the food was pretty good. I had the rainbow trout which was very good and my girlfriend had the rosotto and she enjoyed it as well.  I was very disappointed when the bill came and nobody acknowledged any of their service and reservation mishaps.  They seemed not to care.  All in all, food was good, but I'm not going back.
