Worth the wait! Went here with my dinner club a couple months ago and I wasn't sure it would live up to the hype, but it did! Get there early... have a glass of wine at the bar while you wait. The place smells amazing. Don't forget the truffle egg toast - as everyone says - it's absolutely rich and delicious. Pizza, pasta, everything we tried was amazing. Can't wait to go back.
