This place is cool. It says a lot that I can admit that b/c I was predisposed to disliking Sunda after I learned it is owned by the same guy that owns Rockit (I detest Rockit...and not just b/c I have banned for life from that dbag hole). Anyway, I've been here for lunch twice and both times got the combo lunch for $18. Both times I had way too much food and got a second meal out of my leftovers so in reality I think it's pretty decent value.  The decor is very artsy and modern, and the place has a very open feel to it. I'm a fan, despite my best intentions.
