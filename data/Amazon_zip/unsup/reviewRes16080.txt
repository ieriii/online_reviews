My friends and I all agreed that this was one of the most unusual bars we've ever been to. Upon arriving (sans reservation) we waited in an external hallway for 10 minutes, after which a friendly host led us into a very dimly lit room that can only be described as something out of Alice in Wonderland. Extremely high-backed (read at least 5') chairs were clustered around tiny, intimate, candlelit tables. The bartenders looked like they could have been working at an ice cream parlor from the 1920s. Soft, dreamy music played in the background. The whole vibe was very whimsical. The focus at Violet Hour is obviously on the cocktails, so naturally, the menu was full of alcohol I'd never heard of. I ordered the Vodka cobbler. It was just okay. I was actually a bit disappointed with the drinks - presentation, etc. Still, I give Violet Hour points for originality, atmosphere and friendly staff. It seems like a great place for a date or an intimate night out for friends.
