I spent a good chunk on of a Wednesday afternoon here having munchies and wine with a friend. Both being vegetarians, we stuck to the veggie sides and schmears. The food was pretty tasty, though sometimes was a bit on the oily side - not a place to go when you're trying to be healthy. They have a long list of wines available in glass, 1/3 bottle, 1/2 bottle and full bottle. It seems like a great selection, though the menu is a bit lacking in that it does not describe any of the wines. I could be wrong but I think they are only divided by red and white, not even sweet, dry, etc. I picked a wine and googled it, then ordered a bottle and it turned out to be a winner. The service was good, attentive but not hovering - though for some reason we seemed to have three different servers in the time we were there. The place doesn't seem very big, so if you go during a busy time there will likely bee some waiting involved. Perhaps in the summer they'll have outside seating. It's worth a try.
