OMG have I died and went to skirt steak heaven?? I came here this past Friday with my girlfriends to celebrate a birthday. We had a party of 11 and called ahead for reservations. Good thing I did because the place was packed! All of the entrees are huge and start at around 19-20 bucks. You get so much meat and side dishes (I love the plantains). When you order medium, expect medium rare. I think it depends on the cut of meat you get too. Because I ordered the rib eye and asked for medium rare, but it turned out well. Unfortunately, you'll get charged a 5 dollar sharing fee if you do decide that it's way too much food for you. I say go for the gluttony. We also downloaded an online coupon for free sangria, which was surprisingly yummy. The cheese empanada was so good too. Probably because I love cheese. At the end of our meal, we all got free colombian coffee which was a delight. The service was great, but it was a little slow. Probably because it was so packed! Honestly, I just want to go back for a piece of the skirt steak.
