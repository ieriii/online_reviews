Saw this place on check please a while back and have wanted to go and check it out. The food was average and the service was average. Average is not a bad thing, but I would not venture out from the suburbs to eat here again. I ordered the kefta and chicken combo and my wife had the lamb and we both had the dill rice. All the meat was cooked well and the rice was well flavored, but nothing memorable unfortunately.  There are a number of places that do what Noon O Kabab do but much closer to home. If you are in the neighborhood go ahead and try it, but do not make a special trip out for the restaurant.
