I love this place...why? 1. The atmosphere is great. I love the interior design of this place. The music was great as well. Waitress is always checking to see if we're doing ok. 2. The prices are not bad at all especially for sushi. 3. The salad maki rolls are amazing with the ginger puree and I also fell in love with the sweet potato maki rolls!!! Simply love this place and everytime Im craving sushi and am in the neighborhood I go to Wakamono.
