I've said this more times than anything else this past year. "I'm so tired of mexican." My fiance didn't hear a peep during brunch. Maybe sounds of delight. I don't remember exactly what went on at brunch because my mind couldn't comprehend the awesomeness of the food flavors thus preventing me from doing anything else than eating more and drinking my mojito. Can you black out from food? Best mexican that I have ever, Ever had. I hate crowds and brunch was the answer to that. I ordered the Tacos al pastor. Yes, this simple yet flavorful dish blew my mind. I have a crater in the back of my head where the explosion took place. Oh yes, and the ceviche was amazing.
