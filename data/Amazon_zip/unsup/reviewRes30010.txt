If this is what vegans are allowed to eat, then I could easily become a vegan in a heartbeat. Had a friend in town who's a vegan and I had heard from others that this is a must visit. So we decided to head over. FYI they don't take reservations but even with a small line we only had to wait 25 minutes. I started with a chocolate, peanut butter, banana "milk" shake that is hands down the best shake I have ever had. It is my number one and I will recommend it to anyone. We then split the "wings" which were seitan strips flavored with a smokey/buffalo flavor and served with "ranch dressing". Very good. I then had the "meatloaf" dinner which were large pieces of seitan flavored just like a meatloaf and served with mashed potatoes and gravy. An excellent dish. Had a great time and the staff were all very friendly. Looking forward to going here again and trying all the crazy concoctions.
