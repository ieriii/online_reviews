I brought my girlfriend here for dinner for Valentine's Day and couldn't have been happier. Our waiter was awesome and knew about everything on the menu which is always helpful when trying to decide what dish to order. The staff was very quick at re-filling our water and cleaning our table. Food was excellent and I really loved the atmosphere.I enjoy eatintng out and love to bake so the only thing I wish they would improve on is the dessert. I got the chocolate molten cake and it wasn't very warm or chocolatey. I thought it needed to have more of an intense flavor like Valhrona chocolate. My girlfriend got a special that had that looked like a bowl of chocolate soup.  I would go back minus the dessert.
