I have been Sapori in the past but never took the time to write up a review. I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this restaurant except that street parking in the area is a little difficult. The food is always good and the portions are large enough that you will be taking home some leftovers. We went there for a birthday party and they actually either took the time to print up menu's with his name on them or they had extra menu's lying around with the name Brian on them. We did not have any appetizers since a lot of us knew the portions were so big. I had the spaghetti with veal meatballs in a rich red sauce which was excellent. I don't think one person didn't enjoy what they had. They also brought out two large plates of multiple desserts for the table. That was also good. The service was good, the wine and beer selection plentiful, and the price was reasonable. I will definitely be back at some point.
