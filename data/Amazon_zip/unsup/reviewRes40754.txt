I was disappointed in ,our experience. First, the service was very basic. Uneducated servers who you needed to pry info from about each course. Second, the food was un inventive and mediocre at best. There was one course that was a stand out, the king scallop. The rest of the entrees were very easy to forget and there was a long, long lag time between courses. This comes from a SLOW eater who is happy to spend the evening taking her time.The price tag is far too high fo r this sort of experience. I thought this was a complete waste of time and money and I would hard pressed to ever go back again.
