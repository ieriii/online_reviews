Great Italian restaurant, definitely recommend. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday and between the two of us we got: - Crostini di Avocado: Basically this tasted like four huge heaps of guacamole on crunchy thin slices of bread. Also known as heaven. - Insalata Mista: Big enough for two, your basic greens salad. Get the balsamic vinagrette on the side as they used quite a bit of it. - Pumpkin ravioli: Just like the server described, sweet but filling. Very nice. - Lobster ravioli: Seven gigantic ravioli stuffed with lobster in a very delicious tomato sauce. - Tiramisu: Gigantic slice that could have fed six. Heavy on the marscapone cheese.  Server was VERY helpful and friendly; when he pointed out the stuff he recommended on the menu, he didn't just zero in on the most expensive dishes like most servers do in other restaurants. Great experience, albeit not mindblowing.
