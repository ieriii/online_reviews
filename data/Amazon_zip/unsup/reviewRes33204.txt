Sultan's Market is the definition of hit or miss. Their sandwiches are cheap and awesome. I'm not a falafel fan, it's almost always too dry or greasy, but I've had the falafel sandwich more times than I can remember at Sultan's. It's just great. It's also kinda healthy, filling dinner for under $5. Ask for the spicy salsa and you'll really get a kick out of it. The chicken shawarma sandwich is really good too. They're both served in a pita pocket with some veggies and stuff (Jerusalem Salad, tahini, I think hummus, etc.). The pita can break apart because of the liquid in there, so be careful, but I still think it's worth it. Now, if you get a normal meal there, like a normal chicken shawarma dish, then you're in for one of the worst meals of your life. How is this possible? I mean the same meat goes in the sandwich as goes into the dish. Yes, but in the dish, there's no real sauce or anything else decent to dress it up. The rice is bland, and, just ugh. I wish I could explain it better, I really do, but I can't, so, just trust me. For your own sake, trust me.
