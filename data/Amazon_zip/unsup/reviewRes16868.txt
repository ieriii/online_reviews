Hmm, Hmm, Good!!!!  Do you like mixed drinks that will never, ever, ever water down? Then you better make this on your top 10 list of lounges to visit...and guess what? The Violet Hour is in my opinion filling the first 10 spots of the top 10 list. I stopped by there for the first time last Friday, and I was more than impressed. Other lounges better stand up and recognise...there's a new player in the house -- and it's here to stay. I will most definitely be back!!!! dj pauly
