Move over Lou Magnattis, Gino's East, Giardanos, and any other great pizza place you can think of. If you think you've had the best pizza than you haven't been to The Art of Pizza! This place although not fancy but what pizza place is is an absolute amazing place. The taste of there pizza cannot compare to any I have been to before. I wish there were more The Art of Pizza in and around the Chicagoland area. Whether your looking to sit down and eat or on the go this place is ready to serve your needs. My business partners and I have had a couple of our meetings there just so we can have a pizza. I always get the deep dish and it is delish. Pricing is very affordable and a bang for your buck~
