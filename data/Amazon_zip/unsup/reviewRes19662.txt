After YEARS of people telling me to go here, I finally did on Saturday, with some old college friends - and it was, indeed, AWESOME. Problem, though - they were just featured on "Check Please" - so now they're even busier. Good for them, bad for patrons.  We came at 6:30 on a Saturday with no reso, expecting to have to wait - which we did, but an hour & 15 minutes is not so bad when they let you drink your wine in the waiting area. Nice! Literally, though, starting at 6:45 the waiting area became standing room only, so if you're gonna try to go on a Sat without a reso, go early or else. Thank you fellow Yelpers, because you were RIGHT ON with the "White Dragon" recommendation, and the "Red V".  In fact, we liked the White Dragon so much, we ordered another round of it. Yummmmmmm... Successful night was had by all.
