Opart Thai is my absolute favorite Thai place in the city-so much that it's programmed into my phone! I have never actually been in the restaurant, I always have it delivered and I have never been disappointed. Their delivery is always prompt and the food is always hot upon arrival. Upon my first order, I found something that I loved so much that I haven't tried a lot of their menu. Ttheir Peanut Sauce Lover (with any kind of meat), vegetable fried rice and crab rangoon are all delicious. Portions are big and leftovers are always guaranteed. YUM!
