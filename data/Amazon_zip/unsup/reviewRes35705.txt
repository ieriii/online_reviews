This was a very cool place to go for an after-work drink with my boss. The atmosphere and service were exactly what a "Crab House" should be, and of course, the seafood was excellent. That being said, although I love seafood, I despise oysters, and this was of course what my boss decided to order and force upon me... I gagged a little and recovered with a quick sip of beer, but I'm sure that was only a function of personal preferences and not a reflection of the oysters (I hear they're some of the best in town). I'd return on my own terms...
