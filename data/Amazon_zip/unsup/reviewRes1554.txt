People complain about the line. People complain about the prices. I'm not going to. Sure if you're in a hurry, go to Al's beef or something. There's a line because the guy taking your order actually takes the time to be a little personable with customers. He seemed to remember regulars and was an ace at small talk. Go with friends. It makes the wait in line seem shorter. I had a blue cheese polish w/ almonds and some apple-sauce type stuff. Sounds weird, but it was totally delicious..and HUGE. I almost didn't have room for for my Elvis dog. Almost. Those two dogs and a small fountain drink...."Eh $10 should cover it" is what the man charged me. I could barely walk out the door because I was so full, so I don't feel like it was that expensive. If you get the small fries, there's enough to share w/ 2 or 3 people. I think the pacing of the line also allows enough turnover time to get a table inside. They have cool bubble-like mirrors. Woulda been five stars but w/ their hours only time I can go is on Saturdays. I'm bitter because I want more. 7/52
