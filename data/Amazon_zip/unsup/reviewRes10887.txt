I'm not an expert on brew pubs in Chicago, but this in the only brewery making good beer in Chicago (see my Goose Island review) that I've visited. The service is usually excellent. The pizza is delicious. The salads have a lot of room for improvement, but I really have no complaints about this place. I think the price is just average, but given the quality of the food, it's great. My only complaint is that it's basically a sports bar. Lots of big screens, and I could do without that. Four Stars
