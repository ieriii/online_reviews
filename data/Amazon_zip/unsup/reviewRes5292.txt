Came here for dinner over the Christmas break. Very crowded but luckily we didn't have to wait long for a table of 4. This place was highly recommended to me and I was very eager to try it! :: Food :: Salt-Roasted Beets, Shaved Brussel Sprouts, Fried Brussel Sprouts with Thyme, Lemon & Chili Flakes, Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs, Jamon Serrano, Oyster Mushrooms, Fried Egg with Grilled Bread The food was tasty, simple and rustic. But why did I only give 3 stars? 1. The food was simple and tasty +points! 2. Service was impeccable - very accommodating and gave great wine recommendations. +points! 3. My bf and I got stomach cramps after eating the pigs ear! -- points!!!!! I was hoping it was just this night... but my friends had also suffered the same fate on other occasions. I REALLY wanted to like this place and REALLY wanted to give it more stars because the service is great, the menu is diverse and creative, but getting ill afterwards really killed my excitement. Should I try again? I'll have to think about it, but when the number of great restaurants in Chicago and my limited time there, maybe not!
