let me start by saying i love the feel to this large-scale cocktail lounge in wicker park. beautiful surroundings, a cozy feel to a large space, and a gracious doorman controlling the crowd. we finally made it inside after waiting a meek twenty minutes in line, and you better believe i was ready for some killer cocktails. maybe i had my hopes set too high after getting rave recommendations from those i consider in the know when it comes to cocktail culture, but i felt violet hour missed the mark when it came to not only the quality of it's product, but even a few miscues in the execution catagory. our server was polite enough, but not nearly as knowledgeable as i had expected. we went through five cocktails before one really blew me away: the guillermo sour. don't think i've had anything like it before. it tasted of sandalwood which just blew my mind. unfortunately it was so bitter, i couldn't finish the entire drink (understandable considering it was in the bitter potables catagory). outside of the guillermo, i wasn't too impressed. i also caught one bartender weakly dry shaking an egg-white cocktail, the iron cross, which arrived at my table with more of a rocky head than a beautiful merringue. wish we had the opportunity to sit at the bar to see what the bartenders had to offer... hopefully more than our server did.
