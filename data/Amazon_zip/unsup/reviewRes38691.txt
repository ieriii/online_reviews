I came here tonight for dinner what a bust!! From the beginning we had crappy service at the bar, bad attitude from the bartender...okay then Maybe it was just him. A girl also bought a bottle of wine and he made her carry the bottle and three wine glasses to her table without offering any assistance while she stumbled to carry everything to her table. So we order. We figure we'll try something other than pizza BIG MISTAKE!! meatball sandwich is flavorless, and no cheese??, and bread isn't crusty just bready because they didn't need to heat any cheese of course and side salad with no dressing??? Also came with flavorless minestrone..my mom said it tasted like campbells vegetable soup with beans in it..4.5 stars, really? The waitress was inattentive and lacked personality as well. ugh
