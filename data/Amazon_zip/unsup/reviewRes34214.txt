Just the BEST, The BEST mid-east food in chicago, thats all. Its cafateria style ; the down-side but the rest is the Best. Great tasting , fresh mid-east food. I tried the pizza looking egg and cheese pies. They were great. The lentel soup was a good portion for a bowl and tasty too. the only draw back was that you have to buy extra pita bread to finish the big portions of everything they serve you. Also very friendly, helpfull about explaining the ingredients of everything! You gotta gotta go try it out! I'm coming back. A plus , they recycle everything. I want to give it six stars!
