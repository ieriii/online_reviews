My sweetie and I found Meli while looking for someplace to eat in Greek Town. I walked away very pleased and impressed. It's well-lit without being too bright. You could have breakfast in there with a hangover and not feel blinded. We were greeted almost before we walked all the way through the door and were seated immediately. Fresh flowers on the larger tables--a touch I like. I didn't know where to start on the menu, there's a variety of breakfast, brunch and lunch items ranging from skillets to sandwiches. Our server didn't mind giving us an extra couple minutes to look the menu, and unlike some places I've been, did not disappear completely, but came back after a short, reasonable wait. Kengo G. ordered a steak sandwich, I ordered a crab cake benedict and we both had salads. The salads were a plentiful portion of mixed greens with a light dressing, perfect for a starter. The crab cakes were so delicious, they didn't need the hollandaise sauce. Delicately spiced, yet full of flavor. The eggs were poached perfectly (to my tastes, anyway) with the yolk still having a little bit of run to it. The potatoes--the menu calls them baby reds--were absolutely delicious. I had a bite of the steak and whatever they used for marinade made the meat tender without overpowering it. Our server was attentive, we never had to wait for a drink refill or the check. I left definitely wanting to come back and try what else was on the menu--the crepes sound fantastic!
