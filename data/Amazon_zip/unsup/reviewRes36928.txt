Indie is awesome. It's far enough north that it doesn't get swamped and too busy to get a table, they have excelent thai and sushi, and the decor is great too. I'm almost glad I don't live closer, as I would probably eat there too much... but great for a date, or dinner with friends, or even just carry out.
