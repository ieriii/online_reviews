While visiting Chicago recently, a friend and I decided to meet some people at the Violet Hour. I noticed a set of rules posted at the entry, and thought that the place was a little.. pretentious. Still, we decided to give the Violet Hour a chance. I see that some reviewers have complained about a lengthy wait, but we were seated with our friends after just a few minutes in line.We were seated in the back near a fireplace, and I did like the decor. But everything was too dark and too quiet. It definitely didn't seem like the place to go for fun on my last night in Chicago. After waiting around 20 minutes for a waiter, I chose a cocktail called Goya's Cous de Gras. It was definitely worth the $12, BUT not worth the $12 and the 30 minute wait to actually get my drink. By the time my friend and I finished our cocktails, we asked for our check and started saying our goodbyes to the rest of our friends. We had to wait another 20-30 minutes just to get the check.In a nutshell, I think the Violet Hour could be the place for an intimate get together of a few friends who have the entire night to sit around and drink expensive cocktails. If you want to have FUN.. like, rip-roaring, dancing and drinking fun, the Violet Hour is no good. Clearly, this place just wasn't for me.
