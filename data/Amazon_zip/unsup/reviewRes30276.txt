Personally, I've never really loved anything from here. I've ordered almost every category of food, been there for brunch, had the vegan shakes, had the desserts, appetizers... etc. nothing has ever wowed me, once. ever. The food is EXTREMELY overpriced for what it is, seriously. The only good cake that they had, the espresso torte they took off the public menu. The brunch is ok. The service beyond one good server that works there is horrid. It's almost impossible to get anyone to take your order, and when the food comes out it's frequently cold. Really all of the hype about this place makes me understand why people think vegetarian food isn't that great. This place is giving it a bad name. I do like the patio and also not feeling rushed to leave after I finish a meal. Otherwise the cakes are dry, the food is bland, eh.
