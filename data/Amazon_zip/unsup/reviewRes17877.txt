If you are looking for an expansive burger list, this is the place for you. Hubby and I and our one year old were here a few weeks ago and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service. Hubby had the Chupacabra burger -- goat chili on top and he thought it was fantastic. I had the belly burger (topped with pork belly) which was also delicious. It was a bit heavy (duh, given that it was a slab of beef and a slab of pork together) but the flavors were good. Needless to say, I didn't come close to finishing it, but it was good.  We were seated promptly when we arrived for lunch and service was good. We were seated in the family area (which was fine, given that we had our baby with us). My one complaint -- the music was a little loud (although, that may just be my age talking).
