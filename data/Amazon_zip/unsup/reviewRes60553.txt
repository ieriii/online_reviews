I went with a large group (13) while on vacation and we all absolutely LOVED our entrees. My boyfriend and my best friends boyfriend each got a different kind of steak and they were sharing with each other across the table because it was so good! I got Chicken Medeira which was scruptious! The menu is huge. I loved it.
