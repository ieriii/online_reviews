We love Indie for both Thai and Sushi. In a neighborhood with plenty of Thai/Sushi Indie became our go-to place from the day it opened. It's not particularly creative, but the quality of the standards is high and the prices are completely reasonable. We get a lot of deliveries from them. They're fast and friendly. I don't think we've gotten Thai or Sushi from anyone else in the neighborhood in the last 4 years. I'm nuts for the Crazy Basil Fried Rice by the way.
