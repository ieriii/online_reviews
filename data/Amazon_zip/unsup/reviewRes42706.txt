Dang it! I was sure I'd be the first to review this place. It'd only been open for 6 days. You Yelpers are outta control :) Although... I'm reviewing Fogo 2 Go, which is the actual name of the business at 926 W. Diversey (as opposed to this Fogo 2 nonsense)... so, that technically makes me first. This place was awesome! The pizza uses a great cheese called fontina and you can really taste the difference. Their italian sausage is fresh and cut up/grilled right before they make the pizza. The price for a slice (which is a good size) and a soda is $4.61, so very nice. They have a large variety of gourmet pizzas to choose from, with excellent ingredients. Also, if you are Brazil, then stop in and practice your Portuguese with the owners. I will definitely be back. mmm
