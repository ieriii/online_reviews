Great food and great atmosphere! My wife and I went here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed. The food is quite pricey and the quantity was a bit disappointing, but the quality is unmatched. My wife is not a seafood eater, but I got here to try some lobster and she was amazed of the flavor. She had the filet and was very happy with it. Thanks to Shaw's I may be able to get my wife to eat seafood again:)
