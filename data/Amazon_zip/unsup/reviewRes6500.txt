Favorite restaurant in the area and best Italian tapas in the city! I love the way it's decorated as well as the service! Great wine and phenomenal food!!! The only possible downfall is that it's a bit small and doesn't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. All of the food is great and don't be afraid to go out on a limb and try something new here. But if you'd like suggestions, my personal faves would have to be the the polenta and ragu as well as any of their cheese platters. (I'd skip on the bruschette although it's good and a comfortable go-to. There are just too many other great things to try on the menu; many of which also include bread.) If you're stumped, the servers are always great here with providing suggestions for food and wine!
