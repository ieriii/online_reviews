I didn't actually get to stay at The James but I did attend the opening party (Mixart) and I got to see a few of the rooms that were open to everyone at the party. The James is a lovely hotel and the rooms are amazing though I'm sure you'd have to pay a pretty penny to get one. The beds looked like the linens were spun from clouds and all of the other furnishings were modern and sleek (hello, flat screen tv!). One suite even had an additional room that featured a bed which was more for lounging than sleeping. The best part was the projector set up to show movies on the wall while you lounged. Fancypants! The drinks and appetizers being served at the party were incredible! The "steak and egg" was a light egg mousse topped with little pieces of steak, all presented inside an egg shell... ooh la la. Also served were these tasty, tasty pate de fruit and mini sundaes. I'm sure everything seemed about 50% more fascinating because I was drunk off of free booze but I'm sticking to my recommendation.
