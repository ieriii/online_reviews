I've been here 4 times so far and the service is never short of 5 stars. Lettuce Entertain You restaurants have. it. DOWN. Wonderful place for a small splurge for: Couples, family gatherings, dates looking for somewhere special but not overly dressy, girls night out, you name it. Bread lovers will rejoice here. Upon seating, you will get 2 types of oven fresh warm bread. A white onion loaf bread that is "SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIEEEEE!!!" (Despicable Me anyone?) and a rye bread studded with raisins. My man and I always end up eating 3 loaves...sometimes more. Everything comes with whipped butter. Something else to rejoice for. Appetizers: - Crab Cakes ($10): 2 pan fried small crab cakes that are a little on the heavy side studded with corn, celery bits, and green peppers. Can't say this is the best crab cake I've ever had and the crab definitely isn't fresh. Flavors are great, but I probably wouldn't get them again. - Chicken and portabello skewers ($9): Sounds exactly like what it is. Breast meat and pieces of mushrooms on a skewer, roasted till drippy. Good to share, otherwise you get tired of the shroominess real fast. Salad: House chopped salad ($13 for a small): This salad was HUUUUGE. After all the bread and apps, I managed to wolf down half the plate. The cook was stingy on the chicken as well as the avocado. The dressing might have been the best part...oh, and can't forget the bacon bits. 3 star salad, coulda been much much better. There used to be this AMAAAZING warm Chinese grilled chicken salad that is now discontinued. I am still in Mourning. So...i realized that it appears my 4 star review is based mainly on: (1) the service, (2) the bread. Food can be improved on.
