Seems Heather & I were both victims of Too Many Customers Using Their Groupons. We had eaten dinner at Cafe 28 and had a wonderful meal, so were extremely disappointed to have had such a unsatisfactory experience yesterday for Sun. brunch. We were prepared to wait awhile for our meal when the waiter warned us upon ordering that the kitchen was backed up, but we thought our food would be worth waiting for. We were sadly mistaken. I sent back the Cafe 28 omelette after 3 bites: over -cooked eggs filled with meager, tasteless vegetables accompanied by a large portion of wilted, undressed lettuce. The potatoes were absent because they had run out of them. If I could have washed it down with my mimosa that may have helped, but the mimosa was also very bad and not worth drinking. The waiter was apologetic and comped my omelette, but after waiting over an hour for such poor quality food I will not return to Cafe 28.
