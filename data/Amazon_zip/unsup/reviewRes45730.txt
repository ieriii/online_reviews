Dined at the bar this afternoon. (It's always interesting to listen to wait staff belittle management and convey their overall unhappiness with work/life.) The decor is genuine, warm, cozy but the room is loud. I think it has great potential once they work out a few kinks. I had the suggested fish & chips with a pint. The cod was cooked perfectly and the breading equally so almost a tad doughy. I'm finding the difference between a "good" restaurant and an "excellent" restaurant is truly the staff's caring effort. And I believe this stems from management's philosophy or direction. This is a good restaurant, pub, meeting place or hang out. With the right management, strategy and direction, it could be great.
