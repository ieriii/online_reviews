Yea, the Gage is expensive. I see a lot of chirping about that throughout these reviews. But for a business lunch in the loop... this place is perfect. It's got a unique (and rotating) beer menu, some top notch gastropub fare and some great ambiance/decor. Quick tip, you wanna present yourself well in front of your client? Order the brisket sandwich. Its not as messy as it sounds. You eat it with a knife and fork (thus keeping yourself presentable) and damn, it's a fine sandwich. The rest of your party will be jealous.
