The Gage is a great spot for lunch or for after-work drinks. However, this review is being posted for one purpose only: to warn people against letting themselves be seated in the back room area! I hate when they seat me here. It's right by the kitchen and so you end up smelling like grease after sitting there for awhile. I had to bring all my clothes to the dry-cleaner. Make sure to request to NOT be back there when you make your reservation. Actually, I shouldn't be telling you this, or I'll never get a good table again! Ummmm you should request to be right next to the kitchen and the odor of grease wafting through the back area.
