Yet another fantastic brunch spot in Chicago! We got there around 11 on a Saturday and it wasn't too crowded. I ordered up the Montana omelet, which was very well prepared and just the perfect mix of ingredients. I wasn't too keen on the hash brown patty though, it was too greasy and overcooked. My friend got the challah french toast, which I tried and can attest to its deliciousness. We topped things off with the mint hot cocoa which was phemonenal! Also be warned, it's pretty much in a bowl you drink with two hands ;) Rham Emanuel also decided to drop in while we were eating there with his entourage and some of the media. Fortunately, the wait staff did still pay good attention to the patrons, including our table. ALSO: they have a parking lot. I paid to park on the street before I noticed it, so I figured I'd help you all out.
