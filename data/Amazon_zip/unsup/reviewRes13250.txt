I came here with my husband and daughter on a Sunday for brunch. Everyone was very nice! There was a 20 minute wait which was no biggie since they have a designated area for people waiting to be seated. We were seated within 10 minutes which was nice since the little one was getting hungry.  I love veggie reuben's and I saw it on the munu, right away I knew I had to get it! I used to love Earwax's vegan reuben sandwich but since they have closed I have been on the hunt for a replacement. Sadly, this is not the place. Don't get me wrong the cheese, sauerkraut, and 1000 island dressing were really good! It was the temph. It tasted more like barbecue sauce flavoring. The texture was off and just looked unappealing. :( The hub ordered the farmburger but had it with chicken breast instead of a burger. He said it was really good just messy. He also had a salad as his side and said it was amazing. The kid had a side pancake which was really good! The waitress gave her crayons and sheet of paper to keep her occupied. They were actually very kid-friendly and we liked the atmosphere.  We will be back for sure! I will definitely be trying something different, though.
