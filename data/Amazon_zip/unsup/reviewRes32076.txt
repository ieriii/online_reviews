I have been to Sunda a few times now and always leave with a smile on my face. First of best Uni I have found in Chicago hands down, and I've had it at lunch and dinner. The duck hash salad will change your life, my mouth is watering right now even thinking about it. I also love the rock shrimp tempura, perfectly crispy with a bit of spice to combat the sweet of candied walnuts(I think). The drinks were nice too and the avocado mouse was out of this world good. I don't care for bananas but a friend of mine said the fritters were 'an orgasm in her mouth' and it showed.  I have always had good service here, the last time I went Cara recommended everything I got and my meal was perfection.
