I have eaten at Caro Mio about half dozen times now, and I'm a little torn. It's BYOB, which is great, and the service is excellent, but the food is very hit-or-miss (which is why I took away a star). The whole place is full of plants, so you feel like you're eating in some sort of dark botanical garden. The ambiance is very nice at night with all of the candles. Their servings are huge, like most Italian places, so you have another meal to take home. Some of the heavier sauces are very salty, which is where I think I go wrong. The fresher, simpler dishes tend to be a lot better tasting. The roasted vegetable appetizer is very good and so are the desserts. Their seafood entrees are also great. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. My husband and I went there before going to a musical and we were running a little late. They rushed our order so well, that we were actually early to the theater! Overall, I would definitely recommend the restaurant.
