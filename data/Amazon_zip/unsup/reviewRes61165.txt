I just had lunch with some friends at the Gino's on Superior. We sat at the bar and ordered their mozzerella sticks with marinara. Delish! i asked the bartender and he said that they were made in house to which I replied they tasted like it. We then ordered a deep dish spinach with garlic and asked if we could get the pepperoni on top cause it would come out crispy. I guess it's the bartenders favorite and well it should be it was awesome. I think it is now my favorite as well! I just have to say that I will be coming back no matter what my waistline says!!!
