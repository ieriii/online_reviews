Our favorite Sushi joint in Chicago.Great place to bring your friends that do not like Sushi because their Thai Food is amazing.Like EEL? I recommend their "Catapillar" and "Popeye".And they're incredibly friendly. One night while we were there with friends drinking. They asked to "Vacuum around us if that's okay?". Then we looked at our watches... they had been closed for an hour but they were still cool with us being there. So sweet!
