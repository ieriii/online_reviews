How have I made it through almost 24 years of life without trying Saganaki? Why hadn't anyone even suggested to me that I'd love Saganaki? These are the kinds of questions I pondered as I visited Greek Islands for the first time on Sunday night. Greek Islands is beautiful....I've walked through Greektown before and stopped in some cafe/cookie places, but never any of the restaurants rich with history. This is one of the most unique and romantic restaurants I have ever visited in Chicago and I would suggest eating here to tourists, Chicago natives and non-Chicago natives like me. I am a very picky eater, but my date knows my taste and ordered food for me without even looking at the menu!! He said I'd love Saganaki and I replied, "I don't like seafood." When the plate of cheese came out, the waiter lit it on fire and said, "Opa." All I could think about as the fire rose into the air is, "Don't bring that plate near my hairsprayed hair because I'm flammable!" And then, to my surprise, my hair not only remained safe, but the plate contained cheese that smelled SOOO good and looked SOOO delicious that I almost just used my hands to eat it. Instead, my date cut me 3/4 of the block and poured lemon on top. All I can say is I WAS IN HEAVEN!! He then told me it was goat cheese, and guess what....I was only grossed out for 3 seconds! Then I ate the rest with such delight and I've been dreaming about Saganaki ever since. Greek food truly has my heart! I then tried their salad with these green things my date also promised wasn't seafood. I ate it and then he told me they were dandelion stems. WHO KNEW?! I wish I could tell you what my main course was called, but since we didn't look at menus, I can't. All I can say is that my chicken was extremely delicious and tender. The rice that came with it was also the TASTIEST rice I've ever eaten. Greek Islands, you get 100 stars!! Saganaki, you get 500 stars!!!
