Purple is making a comeback. Pigs are making a comeback. Purple+Pig=long ass wait (but worth it) After attempting to come here once, but wanting to come here every day, the wait on a Friday night at 6:30 for two posed to be quite accurate- 1.5 hours. We hopped over to Eno for wine and cheese and came back just in time. We started with the shaved brussel sprouts with parmesan, moved to soppresetta and jamon cut meats to milk-braised pork shoulder, mussels, and pistachio gelato. The food (pics included): Shaved brussel sprouts--awesome and light with the perfect amount of cheese Cured meats-delicious and salty Milk-braised Pork shoulder-soooo tender. covered in mashed potatoes if I remember correctly. I could have eaten 4 plates of this...and I don't even like pork. Mussels-flavorful broth, semi small portion Pistachio gelato-big portion, but nice and light Other notes: Our service was great. The beer selection was very small. Communal tables available, and two seaters If you're willing to wait, put your name in and go shopping at Nordstroms or grab a drink or 5 at the bar. You might as well get your fill of Purple Pig now, because once the weather gets better, your wait time might double!
