I don't need to go course by course ... but our table was awesome... in the front dining room. Our wait staff was PERFECT. They were playful and witty and they had superman hearing... seriously... they could hear everything... I didn't find them patronizing at all. Just playful. I was a little overwhelmed when I was escorted (twice) to the bathroom... but the second time we had a little laugh about it. I went there for my 30th birthday (dined on Saturday May 14)... and will remember the night forever and ever. Chef Achatz wasn't there because he was at Next that evening, but Chef Matt Chasseur came out for the final dessert and it was awesome. He was super fun to watch - and very kind. Go with someone you like... I mean really like because you are there for 3 1/2 hours and the more you can talk about what is happening the more fun you will have. It doesn't have to and shouldn't be stuffy... have fun and enjoy it. The experience is incredible! Thank you Alinea for making my 30th incredible!!
