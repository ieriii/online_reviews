LOVED this place. We went here for my girlfriends graduation dinner. We didn't want to spend too much as we'd already gone to mhenry for breakfast but we wanted a nice setting where we could get some asiany food. Upon entering we were greeted by this wondering guy who was essentially an asian game show host turned restaurant host that instantly put a smile on all of our faces. The... I guess it's a foyer area is very deceiving when they take you next door its a very relaxed setting with good lighting choice and interesting decorations. The food itself was great, I'd recommend the lemon beef appetizer, any of the soups (make sure to add the sauces to them to your flavor it changed the whole soup) and probably one of the clay pot meals. While we were there, we say their lunch specials which were normal prices but came with like 9 different things. I'm definitely going back to try the lunch special.
