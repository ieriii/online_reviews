One of my closest friends was visiting and stayed at this hotel. I ended up drinking a little (or a lot) too much and crashed here for the night. I think this is a great hotel for families visiting Chicago. It's not trendy or hip, but the lobby of the hotel is grand and a great presentation. Plenty of snack and food options in the lobby area... I almost felt like I was attending a convention as I walked through the lobby in my party dress and fancy shoes. The rooms are very comfortable. They are pretty standard and a bit boring, but have great views of the city. The bath amenities are nothing special. The bed is SUPER comfortable. For a standard size room, it was pretty big. There was a little sofa and a chair. The television was huge.
