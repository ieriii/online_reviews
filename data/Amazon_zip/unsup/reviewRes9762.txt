Exquisite attention to flavor profiles in each dish. The wine pairings were sometimes surprising, but always spot-on. The rabbit and lamb main dishes were astounding. The corn bread pudding with caramel sauce and kettle corn (yes, popcorn!) offered a balance between sweet and a touch of savory. In a weekend of Chicago fine dining (our own "taste of Chicago"), Sprout was, by far, the best restaurant in terms of cuisine and service.
