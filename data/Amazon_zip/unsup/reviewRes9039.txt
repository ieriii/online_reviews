For a person that used to frequent Reza's more, this is a comparative alternative. It is certainly tighter and they try and jam in some cheesy quasi Western/Middle Eastern decor that may come off tasteful. Hmm, don't sit by the door during the cold months, apparently limited in space, they don't have a double door. Funny, they try to be pseudo elegant and weren't willing or were to stupid to give up a table for a double door. Anyway, not pleasant trying to eat a decent piece of meat and have a glass of wine with a brush of cold air every few minutes. It ruins the whole experience, go during the summer months or ask to be seated in the back. The Food, if you had Middle Eastern before, it is the same shtick. The sides are fine, but the meat is the attraction for me. Since they have a new take out kitchen by the tracks were the parking lot is, it makes it so tempting to forgo the the sit down. I pass by frequently and you can't miss this place with the extremely slow traffic. The other places in the neighborhood are more ethnic, less of an Americanized menu and more foreign language interaction going on. You don't have to look hard to find alternatives that are comparatively just as good or better, cheaper, clean, more authentic, will not be viewed as a kebab dive. Sorry, you might miss some decorative trim work.
