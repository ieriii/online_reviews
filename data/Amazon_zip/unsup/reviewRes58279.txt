The food's great and while the sandwiches can be considered pricey to some, the flavors are unique. You don't usually get the type of ingredients that they put into their sandwiches, so as long as you can appreciate it. On the other hand I'm sure there are plenty of people who would say I don't get the hype or I could just get a deli sandwich or $5 footlong - why bother for a sandwich. So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro. While I agree, it was probably the best churro I've had to date.For me, I really like the place, definitely think it's worth it (especially considering the premium you have to pay for either Frontera or Topolobampo) and will definitely be back. Be prepared for a wait if it's during meal times and you have to get a table before you can order your food, which is a little weird. Finally, if you don't care about sitting there, consider the to go option, where you can skip part of the line.All in all, Xoco's a winner, unique flavors, gourmet sandwiches, relatively reasonable prices.
