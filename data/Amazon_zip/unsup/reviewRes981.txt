Went to Hot Doug's for late lunch around 3pm- place was packed like always- i had a Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel ... only one the best hot dogs i've ever had. for real.... also had the chicago dog just called the dog here and it was great also...
