Overall the experience was good, but very pricey. Caesar Salad - very ordinary, but I suppose you can't really make caesar salad that much more special Bone-in Filet - 12 oz was a really good size. It was cooked a little more rare than I would have liked it, but still very good. Lobster Mashed Potato - hyped up to be the best thing to get. It was good, but not amazing. The mashed potato and the lobster didn't seem very cohesive like lobster was cooked and just dropped on top of the mashed potato. Warm butter cake - the BEST thing hands down I had that night. MUST try if you eat here.
