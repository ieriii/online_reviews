This was not the first visit for me at this well-known establishment but it may well be the last. The bar area has a better ambience and a more jolly atmosphere than the main dining area which is cramped and uninviting. If it was not for the art, the dining area would have no ambience at all. I could expand on this point, but that's not what prompted me to write this review. One can always make excuses for bad service, but on this occasion there was no excuse. It was a Tuesday night and the service was appalling, possibly the worst I have experienced in a long while from an unattentive, nonchalant wait staff that, quite frankly, could not have cared less. Perhaps Rick Bayless should spend less time spinning his take on organic food prep and authentic recipes and take the time to discover the fundamentals of running a restaurant where service is a key component of good business.
