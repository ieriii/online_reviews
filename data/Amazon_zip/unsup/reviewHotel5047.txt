I visited Chicago for the first time last year and I made a good choice by picking this hotel via getaroom http://bit.ly/l3aVjSGreat location near Michigan Ave. I agree with Julie that the breakfast and service is outstanding. My room was clean and comfortable. I'd say this place is worth the price.
