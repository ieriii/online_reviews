I love the idea of brunch. I tend to romanticize the mixing of sweet and savory and many times even a bloody mary or mimosa gets in on the action. However, sometimes the reality of the brunch doesn't meet my expectations. We went to the Bongo Room last week and it was just "A-OK". The menu is pretty small during the week. There are tons of inventive and yummy tasting sweet entrees but, nothing really grabbed me on the savory side. I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito and as soon it came out I was lusting after my mom's meal. The eggs had a good flavor and I liked the avocado. But, the potatoes were bland. Luckily we ordered some red velvet pancakes for dessert. They were terrific and even inspired me to finally make red velvet waffles at home. So, we'll call it a win.
