We were a group of 9 celebrating a birthday a little after 8pm. We got seated all the way in the back in front of the kitchen near the bathrooms. We approached the hostess and requested a better table and she explained that we would have to wait 20 minutes which I think should have been told to us from the beginning as oppose to after we were seated again in area that seem isolated. Our waitress looked confused and didn't really attend to us. I think because it was a given she was going to recieve a minimum 18% tip because we were a group of over 6, she didn't have to attend to us. The food was outstanding though and that's why it gets three stars. Also, I am not racist but a member in our group noticed that everyone seated in the main dining area were white and we were the only hispanics that were seated all the way in the back again in front of the kitchen.
