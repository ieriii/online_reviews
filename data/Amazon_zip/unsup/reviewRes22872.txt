Fabulous, perfect, wonderful restaurant. I don't mind the lengthy wait time for a table, the time it takes to have one's order taken, none of it. The food is that good. The Food Is THAT Good. The last thing I ate here was the skirt steak, which is topped with grilled green onions, and includes sides of black beans, rice, plantains, and cabbage salad. Everything about this meal was perfection. Amazing steak, cooked a perfect medium, with massive flavor. The cabbage salad (I am both salad and steak obsessed) was fantastic. The plantains were genius. The friends I ate with and I ordered the fried yucca topped with sauteed garlic as an appetizer; it was amazing. Indeed, a strong garlic flavor, but alas, what can one expect from something explicitly topped with garlic? Twas fantastic. My friends both ordered the potato tacos. They both had enough left over to take home. Later that night, a housemate offered me half a cold leftover potato taco. It was fabulous. Cold and fabulous. I am guessing they are just as good, or even perhaps better, when warm. I shall eat here again, and again, and again. And again.
