Sad to say, I used to live near this Wicker Park gem for over a year and a half and never tried it. I always heard about how cool the place was, but the line outside the graffiti laced walls a little ways south of the Damen Blue Line stop never appealed to me. I am a guy that refuses to wait in lines. I found out about an event for the Michelin Food guide that was taking place here so I immediately RSVP'd. The line was not too bad and it moved quite fast. I enjoyed myself with friends old and new and enjoyed the swanky scenery and great drinks. I enjoyed it so much that I thought it would be a good idea to come back on a regular night. Me & my entourage showed up on a Saturday night around 8:30. The line outside was not too bad, but this time it did not move so fast. We stood outside for about 20 minutes and once we made it inside we were stopped right at the door with another line on the inside. We stood there for about 15-20 mins. We got lucky because they had room for three @ the bar. We wanted to get one of the cool, funny style seats/booths, but we were happy that we were able to get a seat and drink at that point. While we were being seated we were told no talking on the phone, but it was ok to text and tweet. All of their drinks were great and the bartenders were very attentive...they made sure we got a nice buzz. Dimly lit place and has a sexy vibe to it. Definitely worth the wait in mild weather
