Authentically Italian. Just got back from Tuscany and I have to say this restaurant does it right. The food was very good, but some dishes were better than others. I went with a group of girls on a Sunday night. So between the 5 of us we tried a lot of things on the menu. We all had the prix fixe dinner which was great. They allow you to order off the specials or menu which added up to a lot of choices. I had the grilled octopus app, orrechiette with lamb sausage, and ribs. Also on our table were the halibut, special tagliatelle, polenta, risotto, New York strip steak, and also the strawberry rhubarb tart for dessert. The winning dishes were the grilled octopus, halibut, and tart. The octopus dish tasted exactly like the frutta del mar I had in Cinque Terre. Very tasty. The halibut was delicious, flaky and well-seasoned, without being overdone or salty -- so PERFECT. And the tart was sweet, but not too sweet. Delicious. Unfortunately, a couple of dishes I would skip next time. The risotto is vegetarian including the stock, which left the flavor a bit flat, which was very sad. The orrechiette with lamb sausage was VERY spicy, according to everyone at the table, which included a few seasoned spicy-food lovers. For them, however, the dish was considered a success. We had asked the waiter before ordering the dish, and he said it was only mildly spicy.  The ribs were also missing a little something, maybe salt. So overall, I'm a fan. I'd go back. For the price, it was reasonable and the service was wonderful. We stayed a very long time and had about a billion questions and our waiter was very knowledgeable and accommodating. Great for a big group or intimate date!
