I go to Calo's because it's walking distance from my apartment. Given that, it's more like a 4 star restaurant. But if I had to make any kind of commute, I don't think I'd really go. Some of their food is good (ribs, pizza) and some of their food is pretty boring tasting (spaghetti). My favorite thing is actually the foccacia bread served with your meal and their creamy garlic dressing. There's really not room for appetizers or dessert because of this. The new-ish renovation is nice, and the interior is now updated and more modern. Anyway, it's a neighborhood joint that attracts an older crowd who come for the weekly specials. If you're already planning on going, I think you'll enjoy yourself. If you're looking at reviews to figure out where to go for Italian food, this wouldn't make the top of my list.
