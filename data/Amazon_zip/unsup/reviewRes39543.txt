This place is amazing and has converted me into liking Korean food. I can't tell you half of what I ate, but it was all great, and there was a hell of a lot of it. The must have been about 15 different little dishes tossed out in front of us on the table, not including the meat we ordered. The BBQ itself was really tasty as well. Big Kirin beers and sake...I'm sold. They are open till 5am, which sounds insane to me, but I can imagine it gets pretty crazy here some nights. There were a lot of Koreans eating here as well, so you know it must be the real deal. It was so good, I wanted it again the next day.
