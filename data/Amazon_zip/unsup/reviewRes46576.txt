I don't know how I didn't review RJ Grunts before, but I love this place, big fan of salad bars, and the food to order is great too. Just high quality bar food, nothing fancy, but everyhting is made with care. The buffalo chicken nachos are normally the app we get to go with the salad bar and it's a favorite everytime. The chocolate chip cream cheese is like crack on a salad bar. So many good choices on the salad bar with top notch produce just make for the perfect meal. The only downside here is that sometimes it's a long wait, to be expected at such a great place.
