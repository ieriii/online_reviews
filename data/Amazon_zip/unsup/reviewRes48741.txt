I've been to The Publican a few times now and I must say it is gooood. Their brunch is one of my favorites and that is due, in large part to the bacon. Mmmmmm Bacon... I digress. I highly recommend the weiswurst and the red wine poached egg. While the menu changes often, those two dishes seem to be staples, as they have been there the last couple times I've been in. I'm also stoked on this mysterious, elusive Seafood Tower. You need to order it 48 hours in advance so they have time to prepare it. As I was informed by one of the managers, it takes about 45 minutes and a few cooks to put it together. It also takes 45 minutes a a few people to eat it, so if any of you peeps wanna get down on it with me let me know, ok? The seating arrangement is cool, or at least I think so. You either sit at one of the very large communal tables that form a square around the center of the restaurant or in a 4-top wooden booth with these rad little doors that close you in. I've sat at both and they both work. If you end up at one of the large communal tables, chances are you will end up talking to the person or group next to you. I love communal eating, to me that's what meals are about.; friends (old and new), food, conversation and of course good alcohol. I dig it, you may not. Just FYI. All in all, I really do enjoy Publican. Oh and they are opening a butcher shop across the street too. I'm not exactly sure when it is to open but you can surely bet that I will be a customer. Super high quality organic pork sourced from Dyersville, Iowa. I'm sure they will have some La Quercia prosciutto since it is all over Kahan's restaurants.
