We ate here about 2 weeks ago; it was our second dining experience at The Gage. We were about 30 minutes late for our reservation so it was our fault, but we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant - at the very back right by the kitchen. It was REALLY loud. We had a great bottle of wine and great salads, but then my pork chop came and it was so raw in the center it had to be refired. Our waiter was sort of offended at this request, which bugged me. Also, our service was REALLY slow at every stage - - - I would go back to The Gage someday because our first experience there was great, but this visit was disappointing.
