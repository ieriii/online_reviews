Mmm, cake. Vegan cake? Sign me up. Best carrot cake I've had maybe ever. I've been here twice and the BBQ sandwich was pretty underwhelming but the sweet potato something or other the second time was nicey nice. Really, the stars are for the cake and the fact that I can order anything I want on the menu. Brought a carnivore friend here who was very pleased with her meal also, which is a plus. The staff is nice (and let's face it, attractive) but the prices are high and portions are getting smaller.
