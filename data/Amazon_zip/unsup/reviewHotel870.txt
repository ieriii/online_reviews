This hotel has a special place in my heart as my now fianc and I stayed here the weekend we got engaged. I chose this hotel because I got the impression from other reviews that it was both classy and cozy with a great location. We were fortunate enough to get a corner suite with a view of the Chicago theatre on one side and Millennium Park on the other. The room was tastefully decorated in blue and gold tones (with a somewhat regal feel). In terms of hospitality, the staff knocked it out of the park. Among other things, the hand-written note and complimentary bottle of champagne were very nice. If I had to nitpick I would say the gym is limited and the lobby is a little cramped (although to be fair, it is relatively small hotel to begin with). Also, I have slept on more comfortable beds. However, the free papers (including the NYTimes) and coffee in the lobby made up for it.  If one wants to experience classic dcor such as marble stairwells and crown moldings with outstanding hospitality, then I highly recommend this hotel.
