I definitely agree with Hillary in needing to temper these positive reviews. I am the "Jen" in Hillary's review* and I don't need to rehash everything that went wrong. (However, I think she omitted the part where my menu folder had no menu and my roll of silverware had no fork.) This wasn't the first time I've been disappointed in a dining experience, nor is it the first time my order was wrong. However, it is the first time I was given an excuse instead of an apology. I'm sure (or hope) the other kinks will get worked out and this will eventually be an OK place in the neighborhood. I definitely don't see myself going back of my own accord--too many major things went wrong and there are just too many other great options in the area. *see full story from Hillary S. 8/13/2009
