Packed in tightly and seated at a small table i smiled at my dining companion. It was great to have time to catch up and just laugh. The smell of pasta, meats and wine were in the air. Our faces were lit from the candle light flickering on the table. A soft, subtle glow. We poured over the menu as drinks were being poured. Would we get an appetizer or only salads? Did you want to share something or should we order separately? After deciding we settled in to wait and also to chat. More wine, more beer, more laughter. Food was plated and served. Everything fresh, homemade and smelling delicious. The scents lingering in your nose, intoxicating you. Suddenly my dining companion leans across the table. What is he doing? Is he going to kiss me? I watch him spear a piece of my lamb. "You weren't going to eat that were you?" Laughter again and I do the same.  The waiter jokes with us and offers suggestions for dessert. Too full, too much laughter. We head out into the snow, hopes high and bellies full.
