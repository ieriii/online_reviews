No I have not had this much food or pizza this week... But being in YBL3 and not actually EATING good stuff much for the next chunk of time, thought it would be good to catch up on great places i have been. Maybe if I think of how full I was after I went here I'll be full so here goes... When I think of Chicago Stuffed Crust / Deep DIsh pizza, this is the bar by which everything else is judged. It might be overplayed but there is a reason for that. It's fantastic. I've had delivery, I've carried it home and I've eaten there. Each time better than the last. And as is true for all great pizzas, its almost as good cold as it is hot. Challenging to wait long enough for oven to warm up when reheating. If it weren't for the fact that my arteries would be clogged I'd probably come here a bit more often. The other thing that really amazed me is that despite my usually endless appetite, two slices and I was full. That's a rarity sadly. My father had been in town, on business so he left me the leftovers which I turned into dinner for two more nights. It's very rare that I can do that with anything. And it wasn't easy resisting the calls of the pizza within the box until dinner time either. are there better? probably somewhere, but im a fan and until i find it when i need a reliable pie I'll be getting it here.
