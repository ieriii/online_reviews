Booking the Hilton was sort of a crapshoot for us. The location ended up being perfect and all the amenities matched or exceded its 4-star rating. The pool was pretty nice but overchlorinated and not quite big enough for the demand. As far as the style of the place goes, this wasn't my type of hotel. First of all, it is MASSIVE, a conventioners hotel for sure, and stylistically took its dedication to swank a little too seriously. Too gilded, elegant, old-school. Nothing personal or particularly comfortable (except the bed - no complaints there. In fact, we WAY overslept) about it.
