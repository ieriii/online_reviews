I'll just start off by saying I'm not really a "pizza person" I mean, I'll eat it if that's what everyone else wants but it is NEVER my idea to get pizza. That being said, I LOVE Pequod's Pizza! The caramelized cheese crust and the perfect proportions of cheese, sauce, crust and toppings...Pequod's has turned deep-dish pizza into an art! I always get the sausage and green pepper and am never disappointed!  The house salad is good too! Service can be a little slow but who cares when the pizza is this good. Here's a tip: call ahead and they will start the pizza for you so it'll arrive at your table shortly after you do!
