Ha Ha!!!! Finally The AW has made it to Dougs The build-up: After having conversations with the following: Ralph C, Love S, Ryan L, Paige W and countless others, I started to feel like I was missing something by not making it here. On a Saturday evening, I decided to go at 5pm. I didn't check the time because I thought such a booming establishment would be open on a Sat evening. WRONG!!! I got there and I saw some kid in there mopping the floor and putting up chairs. DAMN! Yesterday afternoon, I went at noon and as I rode by I saw the chairs up on the table and no long line like I had been hearing about. He had a sign up saying he had been closed for a few days. WTF!!! TODAY: Took off of work today and decided this time I will call and to my surprise someone answered and it was Doug himself. He told me to get up there because he opens at 10:30 and the line will be out of the door. I jumped in my car and made it there in 10 mins. As I rolled up I saw a line just slightly out of the door. That was not gonna stop me! I got in line and got hungrier as I got closer to the front. I told Doug I was the guy on the phone and we had a good laugh about my failed attempts to sample his food. He recommended I get the day's special, The Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Sesame Seaweed and Sriracha Mustard. I got that along with the duck fat fries. If anyone has ever seen Harold & Kumar goes to White Castle, the moment when they finally got their sliders, that was me today. There was even another first timer there as well and he told me he drove all the way from Midway Airport to get there. That was a great meal and if I didn't mind standing in lines I would go more often. I have a rep for being impatient when it comes to waiting. The duck fat fries was nothing new to me. Growing up on the southside, we have always had those kind of fries, in different restaurants they just weren't called duck fat. Will definately be back, just don't know when.
