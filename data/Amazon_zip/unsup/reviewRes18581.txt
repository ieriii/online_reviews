Went back last night for the second time. This time, we didn't order any food but sat at the bar for a couple glasses of wine. While the wine list is not expansive, the glasses we ordered got the job done. Besides, who goes to a bar specializing in beer and expects a fancy wine list? I look forward to returning to venture into the quite expansive beer selection. I am a big fan of the atmosphere here. I love the clean decor, the red lighting, the dark wood. Most of all, I LOVE the music- sounds like it's right off of my iPod. I will be back. Bowman's better step up their game because Bad Apple has it going on.
