The main issue I had with this place was the wait. We waited over an hour for a table and they kept telling us it would be just a few minutes.... The food was good, not mind blowing and it is a little pricey, but I don't consider it to be outrageous. The wait staff was awesome though! I would go back, but not unless I had a reservation.
