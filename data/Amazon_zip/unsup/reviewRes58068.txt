By far one of the best restaurants in Chinatown.You will see a great variety of people dining here. It serves authentic Sze Chuan cuisine. It disgusts me when people go into this restaurant and order stuff like egg rolls and fried rice. Skip it. If you want that, go to Panda Express. If you don't know what to order, ask for recommendations. Every single time we have dined here, we have had great service and amazing food. Highly recommend the Three Chili Chicken (Chef Specialty), which is somewhat powdery(?), spicy chicken with just the right amount of oil. Pure heaven. Lao Sze Chuan also serves the REAL orange chicken and orange beef which is simply amazing. Nothing like the frozen crap served at places like Panda Express. They use real orange peels and it has just a hint of crispiness.Now if you can handle spiciness, you will enjoy this restaurant. Otherwise you will be missing out on the true gems of this place. One of my all-time favorites is the (Spicy Fish Stew?). Very spicy, very numbing, very delicious. I love it! Try the hot pot if you've never had it!
