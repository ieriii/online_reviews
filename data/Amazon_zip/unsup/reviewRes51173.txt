I love, love, love the Wishbone. I've been going to all of them off and on for several years. Their food is fabulous, ranging from healthful juices and salads to decadent southern style comfort food. I love the juices, homemade soups, salads, black bean cakes, red eggs, broiled salmon and cornbread muffins. It's a great family restaurant and extremely kiddie friendly. Always great waitstaff. reasonable prices. just great. A Chicago must!
