Very solid deep dish. Quite satisfied... service was on the money. Not over attentive, but totally satisfactory. But back to the pie... we went deep dish of course. The gold standard, of course, in pizza is Papa Del's in Champaign Urbana. There is simply nothing better. Until you taste it, and I your fav, let's not argue. Just take my word and that of 100,000 other Illinis... And Gino's east is approx 85% of the way to Papa Del's, I would say. Which is a great compliment. Cheese was a 4 of 5, tomato sauce adaptation to pizza a 4 of 5, crust about a 3.5 out of 5. Smell/aroma was about a 3 of 5. Overall, I'd give it then a 4 of 5. Def check it out. disclaimer: I have not tried many other Chicago deep dish joints for comparison... I just know you won't go wrong here.
