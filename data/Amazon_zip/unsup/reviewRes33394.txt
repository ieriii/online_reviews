Took my wife there for an early valentines day dinner. Awesome food, reasonably priced all things considered. My wife ordered the salmon and I got the veal. Both were extraordinary. We also got the calamari and bruchetta for appetizers, I can't speak for the bruchetta since I've never really liked it (from anywhere) but the calamari was easily the best I've ever had. I had to take away one star because of the seating arrangement. It's kind packed tightly in there so you end up sitting really close to a bunch of strangers... And of course your over hearing their entire conversations, and they yours. If the tables were a little further apart it would definitely get that extra star, but I would still recommend it.
