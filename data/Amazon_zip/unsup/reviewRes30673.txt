When my friend who lives here was taking me out to lunch he mentioned (as he dropped me off in front before parking the car)' that I hope you don't mind Organic Healthy Food. My body feared my worst possible nightmare of eating with friends and not enjoying the food. Well, I wish there was a Nana's back home because the lunch was to die for. Flank Steak cooked to perfection, Yuka Chips and a veggie that I can not remember it's name, but I loved it all. Service was friendly and welcoming in a great setting. Those who know me will never believe that I ate in a Organic Resturant. Can you imagine them hearing about how great an experience it was!!! Nana, please come north and make more believers in good food bought locally and cooked so well???
