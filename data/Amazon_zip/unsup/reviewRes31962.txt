If you were raised on meat and potatoes and occasionally feel like eating something to tickle that itch, then you have to try the country fried steak. It is my top most favorite dish on this planet! I would get it for my last meal....vegetarianly speaking.  I have dreams of it.....:)  Super win! I want it now!
