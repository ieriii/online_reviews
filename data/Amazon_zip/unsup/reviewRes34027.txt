I decided to give Yolk a try after hearing great things about it. I'm not big on brunch fare, but this place was pretty good. Our server was nice, which always makes the experience more pleasant. I would recommend ordering one of the combos that are variations of french toast, eggs, and sausage. It's the best bang for your buck, and it seems that this is Yolk's forte. I ordered orange butter crepes, and it wasn't that good. But the french toast and pancakes are definitely delicious, and the over-easy eggs were more runny than usual, which I like. I'm not a big fan of brunch food, but my experience at Yolk was pretty good, minus the epic wait. Go on a weekday to avoid the wait.
