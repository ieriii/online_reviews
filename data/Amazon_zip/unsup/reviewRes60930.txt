Food and wine are great, but the reason for the 5 star still reflects from the summer of the bingo party, I had the best time. There were great wine reps, and the owners were there. My gal was throwing out bingo numbers!!! I will never forget the bingo of 2006!! Please do more. It was the best!!! If I missed bingo of last summer than shame on me. It was the best! Love Bingo!!
