This was such a wonderful experience for me and my girlfriend. We were celebrating a special occasion, and they definitely help to make the night special. Upon sitting down, they had a nice conversation with us: teaching us about fondue, the menu options, and some history of the restaurant. Our server, Jason, was a delight. So kind and helpful. It was a first time with fondue for the two of us. They made it so simple and elegant - yet lots of intimacy with the food. T'was the perfect portion sizes, great timing between courses, and a great atmosphere. We will be making this place one of our future haunts for special events. Such a gem and one that we were glad to have experienced!
