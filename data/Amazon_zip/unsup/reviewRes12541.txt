All of the meats. All of the vegetables, too, though that's a little less impressive (my usual Texas de Brazil salad: prosciutto and three pieces of fresh mozzarella). Even the pieces you wouldn't think would be all that special are fantastic; I have a weakness for the homemade sausages, and little mini chicken drumsticks are outstanding as well. The beef cuts need no real build-up; they are fantastic. Dinner prices run around $50, which is great for the amount of food you get (all of the meats, remember?) but you can usually get a deal if you keep your eyes peeled before going in. One of the great group dining experiences in Chicago.
