I went for the first time on a Monday around noon, so it was almost empty. It was a perfect day so I opted to eat on the patio, which is perfectly shaded for the pale among us. I got the Warden burger and paid extra to have mac & cheese as the side. The burger has garlic, shallots, leeks and cheddar inside, making it like a sort of gourmet meat loaf, plus leeks and shallots on top, it comes on a pretzel roll and they gave me a cup of dipping sauce. It was delicious, big but not completely daunting for a grown man who skipped breakfast anticipating a gastrointestinal challenge, and it was perfectly cooked medium as ordered. I can't get over that there wasn't a trace of grease whatsoever. If I didn't know better I'd think they baked it in the oven. When I bit in some juice came out, but most of it stayed inside and every bite was moist and tender. In fact it was the tenderest burger I've ever eaten, so much so that I kept looking at the meat wondering if they had some special grinding process. The mac & cheese was good but no better than the frozen kind from Trader Joe's. I'll try the fries or salad next time. I'll definitely be back to try the Elvis and turkey burgers. With tip and no drink I ended up spending $20, which I think is pretty pricey for even a great burger meal, but as a treat it's definitely worth it. I haven't been to Kuma's, but if I can get something this good without the eternal wait I'll stick with Lockdown.
