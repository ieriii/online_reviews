All I wanted was some guac. Thats it. Perhaps a little margarita on the side. AND I GOT IT!!! I yelped "Guacamole" and got a few choices, none really telling me what I wanted to see. So this is for all the guac fans... Garcia's is a tad north for me, but the adventure of a new mexican food place was no problemo. The service was great! It was a Friday night, 7:30, we were seated as soon as we walked through (apparently, new doors) and there were so many people eager to please us, I felt like I had read the wrong reviews on yelp.  BACK TO THE GUACAMOLE- Heavenly and creamy (since its summer, the avocados are in season, so it seems to be creamy everywhere). We got the $4 smaller size and it was larger than the $8 guac at Salud, the market priced green mush at Tecalitlan, the $6 varying sized Irazu, and just a whole lot better than those not worth mentioning. We couldnt even finish it, granted there were only 2 of us, but still...I think if you opened a vein in my arm, avocado would come out- I live on it... therefore, I was surprised at its glorious weigh in. Flavor: nummy. Not to oniony, hints of tomatoes, could possibly matured with a touch more spice but who''s complaining? Not me.... For the rest of the meal: Needless to say, cheesy, yummy goodness.  my vegetarian platter was covered in cheese (Salsa Verde enchilidas, beans, rice- thumbs up) And I took home a to-go box. One should not be filled with that much dairy in one sitting. This place, for me, since I dont eat meat... is your middle of the road greasy mexican spot. Its tasty, kind to your wallet, the margarita wont give you acid reflux (fingers crossed), and the bathrooms are super duper. That seemed weird writing about the bathroom... Kudos to Garcia. and all you lovers of the goddess avocado.
