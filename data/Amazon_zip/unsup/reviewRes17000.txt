India house has very good food and nice ambience. My only complaint is that the wait-staff seems a little .... out of it sometimes. Like, they're either weirdly timid, or overly chatty. It's always something. But, it's not a big deal and the food, wine, and great location more than makes up for it. I recommend. UPDATE 11/28/07: Went there two weeks ago and the service was terrible. Plus, my friend and I were seated on this this little terrace that was like 10 degrees hotter than the rest of the restaurant. We were completely sweating. Gross! It will be a while before I go back.
