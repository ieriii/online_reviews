"We are the Sultans. We are the Sultans of swing." Check that, "We are the Sultans of deliciouscheapfood and iaminlove." Continuing our "ballin' on a budget" pledge, we hit up Sultan's Market for a cheap Friday date night dinner. Not exactly the most romantic place, but we snagged a table in the corner and let the aromas of middle eastern food envelop us in love. Plus with a bottle of wine we picked up from W Grocer across the street, it put the "date night" feel in the night. Sam J.: Lamb schwerma with rice and lentils. Kate W: Chicken schwerma with curry basmati rice. The lamb with rice and lentils was so savory and hearty. My chicken with curry basmati had just enough heat. We polished off our pitas with hummus, but still had enough left over between the two of us for an entire extra serving of hummus, schwerma and rice. Can't wait to go back and try that $3 falafel, their soups and other dishes! Budget baller status: achieved. Take that, Dire Straits.
