Living here for so long and I never thought to try it out, expecting it to be touristy and generic. After being invited, I am a a 3.5 star fan but will round down and keep the review conservative. Started with the grand cheese and meat tasting platter with the Bin 36 flight. Its a bit expensive, and since I am no wine and cheese fanatic, I thought this was all right. A bit on the expensive side, but the waiter provided good recommendations. For the entree, we had the special tartrine, amish chicken, and steak with bone marrow. Tartine was over salted and the worse option. do not pick this Amish chicken, breast cooked perfectly, moist with crispy skin.. best dish i tried steak and marrow. Steak was ok, bone marrow was the highlight. Overall, expect to spend about 50ish per person. Depending on your choices, you may or may not enjoy your meal...not all dishes are created equally
