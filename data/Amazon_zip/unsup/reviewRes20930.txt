Coast is good, definitely over-rated though. The fish was high quality, but nothing to write home about. The place is extremely crowded, no matter what night you go. When I have sushi I prefer a smaller place with less than 30 people. I felt rushed. I ordered the sashimi which I get everywhere- it was good, but there could have been more on my plate! I would take New Tokyo over this any day.
