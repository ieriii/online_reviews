Sun Wah is a good mix if you are feeling like having some Chinese comfort food. The noodle and dumpling bowls are quite hearty and you can not beat the price super cheap!! The service probably a "C" grading but real Asian diners know you don't go to "real" East Asian dining places for the customer service its all about the food here....lol But next time I go here I am ordering whatever the staff are eating ...cause on their breaks cause they seem to always get AWESOME food!
