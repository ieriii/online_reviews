Prior to dining at Demera, I had only eaten Ethiopian food twice. I never gave much thought to finding good Ethiopian restaurants, as I didn't think there were any in any areas close to me or areas that I frequent. A friend lives two blocks away from Demera and we decided to dine there on a whim. It was delicious. We ordered some kind of platter that had lego tibs, doro wot and ye-siga aliche (lamb, chicken and beef). It was so good that we went back the following week and then I went back the week after with another friend.
