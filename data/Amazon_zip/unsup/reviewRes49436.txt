We go to Bin Cafe in Wicker Park ALL THE TIME because we love it, so when some friends were staying downtown for the weekend we decided to give Bin 36 a try. The food was lovely and there were more flights available that at the cafe, but I left regretting that we hadn't dragged them out to Wicker Park instead. The service was pretty bad. We sat for almost twenty minutes before anyone approached out table. The server got my order wrong and never came back to check on our meals so I never had the chance to say anything.  I guess I'd say unless you are downtown for something special take the time to head out to the Wicker Park cafe for much, much better service and ambiance.
