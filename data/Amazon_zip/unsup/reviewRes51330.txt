I've heard a lot of hype about the Lincoln Square staple. I've been there twice now, and the place is always packed. The service is slow and terrible; the waitresses make you feel bad for asking questions. The food is just ok. I've tried the asada tacos...nothing special. The burrito al pastor was alright. The meat was a bit too fatty and chewy. It was mighty expensive, but maybe that's because it was the size of a small child. Bigger isn't necessarily better.
