Edited 10/28/2007 I went back to Cafe 28 for dinner last night and had a much more pleasant experience. The blackened duck was excellent, but my companions' Cuban roast pork and vegetarian comal were merely adequate. My pisco sour and camparinha were both well made. The service was subpar, though not as bad as my first visit. I'm in no hurry to go back, but that duck did get most of the bad taste of the first visit out of my mouth. *** I went for brunch a month or so ago and had a mediocre experience. The food would have been pretty good, but our server was terrible. Abandoned at our table, we got slow service on coffee and water, slow refills, she was slow to take our order, our food took an age to arrive, and our waitress seemed afraid to check in on us. Six parties of 3 or more came in after us and were served before us, and when we finally did get the food, 2 of the 3 plates looked like they'd been under a warmer for an hour. This was especially frustrating since our server seemed to be deliberately avoiding our table. I'm pretty sure that something must have happened to the third dish in the kitchen, but that could have mitigated by an explanation, a friendly smile and some refills on the coffee. I'm tempted to chalk it up to an inexperienced server and try again, perhaps for dinner.
