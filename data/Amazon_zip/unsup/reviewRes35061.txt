Not bad! I like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Fancy and hip! My fiance and I came here on Valentine's Day. Made reservations to this place 2 weeks in advance since they tend to book up so quickly. I would say the food is decent. Service is good, too. We ordered the lobster avocado roll as a starter. This is delicious! Didn't think an Americanized place can make sushi as tasty as a Japanese restaurant. Give it a try especially if you like lobster. We also had the Maryland crab cake. This was okay. I preferred crab cakes at Joe's much better. Nothing special with their crab cakes here. Then I had the New England clam chowder soup which I thought was delicious. My fiance thought it was a bit too salty. He ordered the lobster bisque. He liked his but I thought his was a bit too salty... Soup was good, but it was a bit salty, I guess. We had a side of mac and cheese. It was tasty but it was pretty expensive for a side. I ordered the griddled shrimp with seafood rice. This is tasty! I had craving for it hours after I got home. I would definitely order it again. My fiance ordered filet mignon. He thought it was okay...it wasn't worth the price he paid. In the end, we had a good experience. If you were to compare this place with Joe's I like Joe's more.
