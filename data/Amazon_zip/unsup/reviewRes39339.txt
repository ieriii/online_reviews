Is there anything in life better than sizzling meat over a pit of fire? I think not. Sure, the service is a bit lacking, but you're not here for ambience. You're here to fire up your raw meat and gorge yourself silly! The marinated kalbi here is fantastic, as is the pork and chicken kalbi. Skip the bulgogi - not because it's not tasty but because it's sliced so thin that it sticks to the grill and tends to shred. The seafood pancake appetizer is also crisp and delicious. The prices are not super cheap, but it's decent, especially if you come with a large group. Make sure you wear raggedy clothes, because you WILL smell like smoke and charcoal for the next 24 hours. It's a small price to pay for entering meat nirvana.
