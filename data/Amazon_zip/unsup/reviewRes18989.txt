Escargot. Get it. One of the most delicious dishes I've had in a while. The atmosphere is really nice and the staff is friendly as well. Try to not sit in the back by the kitchen because it gets REALLY hot. I also dined on the curried lobster which was good... but nothing compared to the escargot. The chef special salmon was delicious as was the soup of the day (can't remember what it was). The place is pricey, but overall I'd say it's worth it. Nice night for a fancy girls night or a date. DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS! It is inconsiderate to others that are paying 50 bucks for a bottle of wine.
