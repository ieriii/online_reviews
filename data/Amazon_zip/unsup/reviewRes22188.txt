OMG. I have to defend the restaurant. I have been a loyal customer since 2008. The food has always been consistent, and I am always bringing friends to try it out. I have never been dissatisfied with the food nor have I ever had a "rat experience". The staff knows me well and they are always attentive. When you sit down, you get an appetizer; spicy cabbage and the best unflavored tea ever! I would not put sugar in it, it defeats the whole purpose. My favorite dish is the Chefs Special Chili Dry Chicken which is spicy and out of this world. DISCLOSURE: Bring Pepto with you, even as a Hispanic who is used to eating spicy food; its blazing hot!!!! But I love every burning sensation when eating. Warm sake is amazing, and the orange chicken too. Best place ever, and worth the wait.
