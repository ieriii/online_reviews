All I will tell you about my first trip to Ruth's Chris was that it involved a St. Patrick's Day, a cab ride and a fifth of Jack. Needless to say, I wound up having a great time that day thanks, in part, to my delicious prime filet. Warning, if you've never been here before, do not touch the plate once they bring your beef out. It is not cold. You gotta love a steakhouse that serves up their prime beef with sizzling butter soaking into that beefy deliciousness. Their scallops are also excellent. I recommend pairing them with the filet. Throw in that fifth of Jack and you're on your way, my friends.
