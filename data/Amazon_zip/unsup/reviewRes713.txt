Go with an open mind, empty stomach, and eagerness to turn yourself over to experience. Yes, iIt's slightly intimidating despite kind staff, but Do it! Most generous wine pairing I have ever experienced. Embrace the frivolity and the amazing tastes. Enjoy the surprise. Marvel in the new while referencing the past. No pressure to love every bit - it's not all equal per your palate or execution but it's better than 90% of anything else you'll ever enjoy.
