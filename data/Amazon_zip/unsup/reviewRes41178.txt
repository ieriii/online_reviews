The hospitality industry starts with the word "hospitality." An important part of fine dining is assuring customers of a comfortable experience. With too many tables for a too small place, comfortable was far from what I felt. Also, the chairs weren't really conducive to sitting through an 8course meal, and so by the end of two hours or so, it ended up being more of an arduous experience rather than a pleasant one This restaurant is trendy, it looks right, it's decorated well, and the menu is inventive,.. but it is not fine dining. Some of the dishes were quite good, but for the price, I expect my entire experience to be a good one, not just a couple of courses. This restaurant feels like it's run by some young 20something kids just trying something new rather than by knowledgeable restaurateurs who understand the nuances of good service.
