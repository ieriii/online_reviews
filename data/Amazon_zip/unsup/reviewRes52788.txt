Came here on Friday night for dinner with a friend and the wait was 45 minutes. I didn't think there was a lounge area and I thought we would have to sit and wait at the door until the gentleman said "Follow me and I'll take you upstairs to the lounge" and then he had me hooked. What a wonderful maze. Walked through the small dining room on first floor, up some stairs to the main dining room and through a door and up some more stairs to what looked like someone's apartment. I loved it!!!!! We were given a wine opener and some glasses and we settled in on the comfy couches by the window to drink and catch up. *There is a 3 dollar per bottle charge* We ordered the tostones rellenos and empanadas which were not that great to me. Tasted kind of like pre-packaged frozen food that was just warmed up. I had the ropa vieja sandwich with platanos maduros and the avocado plate which was fabulous and that redeemed this place in my eyes. My friend had a garlicy shrimp dish which was also very good. Great lively atmosphere, BYOB, fun decor, super friendly staff and pretty decent food. Seems like it would be fun to go with a big group. I will be back soon!
