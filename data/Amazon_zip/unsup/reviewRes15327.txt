Oh Calo I had such high hopes for you after reading these reviews. And while your food did not disappoint your server sure did. After perusing the beer list- holy high heaven they have Gumballhead- we decided to order us each a pint. The server comes back to the table and tells us they are out! One of my dining friend's asks is there another IPA type of beer you can recommend? Server chops at the air with her hand while snapping- "I told you there is NO BEER! There is no IPA!!! Unfortunately this set the tone for our service for the rest of the night. Every time she came to the table you could feel her resentment of us, we were afraid she was going to snap on us. Is it because we sat for dinner at 9pm? And until she picked up her tip did she smile and relent. Enough about her let's get to the good part!!! I pretty much hate focaccia bread. I reluctantly decided to try a piece because the Italian bread looked boring....sweet jesus am I glad I did. Light as air, crispy on the bottom, tomato goodness on top. You've made me a believer Calo. Everything, literally everything on the menu sounded so good. It was sooo hard to decide, but angry server was rolling her eyes so hard I thought they were never going to stop. I ordered the something Italia- shrimp, broccoli, linguini, garlic, wine and olive oil. Pasta-cooked perfect. Shrimp- huge, lots of them. I tried someones mushroom ravioli- and there suddenly were violins playing and a soft rosy glow. I regret not trying the Tartuffo for dessert but there just wasn't room. Crabby server you will not prevent me from returning!!
