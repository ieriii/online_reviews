overpriced for what you get, lackluster, and exceptionally mundane. I have no intense complaints about the food outside of the fact that its bland, and pretty uncreative....good service though. I think people go here robotically..."well i'm hip and its saturday morning.....time to go to the bongo room". if youre looking for a good brunch on the weekend you should go to rodan.
