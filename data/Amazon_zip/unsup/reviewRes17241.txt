Upscale in appearance but does not fall short on kindness and professionalism. The staff really focuses on you and the food...well if you love Indian food, this is the place to go. They'll even make as spicy as you want it and did I mention it was all amazing! The Tandoori Chicken which to me is the ultimate test of an Indian restaurant was not only tender, and juicy but had this amazing smokey flavor and subtle spiciness that was oh so savory. The curies were on point, but the Tandoori Chicken is definitely worth a try!
