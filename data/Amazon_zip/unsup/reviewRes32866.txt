your palate will be stimulated! i'm usually very wary of asian fusion restaurants--my taste buds end up confused and unamused. however, sunda does an excellent job serving up asian dishes with flair. you won't be disappointed. we started with "toast and jam," rock shrimp tempura, and longevity garlic noodles. for the main course we had burnt watermelon and unagi nigiri and roasted duck hash. the unagi was a bit on the fishy side and tasted more like anago than unagi. however, i LOVED the duck hash! YOU MUST TRY THIS DISH! i especially loved the way the daikon was prepared. the ny strip steak wasn't anything special--be more adventurous and try something else. our server was excellent--he was courteous, patient (we were a large party), and professional. the FOH staff--hostess--however, could use some work. when i called to inquire about a reservation we made a week prior, she curtly informed me that no such reservation existed and did not attempt to assist me to rectify the situation. her tone implied, 'you never made a reservation so quit wasting my time.' for an upscale dining establishment, sunda's hostesses need some refreshing and refinement. since she was not a server, i would most definitely overlook the "friendly" factor to once again savor sunda's unique flavors. we did not make it to dessert this time but definitely will next time!
