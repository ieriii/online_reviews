I have been here many times. There are definitely some misses on dishes here but there are some really great wins as well. Last night we did the crispy pork belly with watermelon, duck confit salad and the burger. The pork belly was outstanding. Perfect balance in this dish that I will be doing some research on so I can mimic it in my pwn cooking. The duck confit salad was good not great. The greens and the dressing seemed to miss on this dish. The burger, well I will put up Revolutions burger, particularly their workingman burger, up against any burger in the city. Always perfectly cooked, very flavorful. Their burger is a master stroke. Their beers are always top notch. I have been going there for over a year and don't think I have ever had a bad one. Their coup d'etat was my favorite of this evening. On a side note their service is always just ok to me never great but then again they are almost always slammed. All in all a typical evening at Revolution. A couple of great dishes and one that is meh. Will keep coming back though, that is for sure!
