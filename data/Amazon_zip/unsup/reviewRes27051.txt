I highly recommend this place for deep dish pizza! The menu was simple and everything was very fresh. We ordered the Pequod's salad and a large spinach and fresh garlic deep dish pizza-the perfect size for four people to have two slices each. It was heaven with the caramelized crust and a nice ratio of cheese/sauce, fresh spinach and sauteed fresh garlic on top. Heaven!!! I will be back soon for more!
