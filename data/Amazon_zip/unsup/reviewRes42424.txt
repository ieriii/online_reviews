I came here for dinner with a friend a month ago. It was on a Tuesday. Food is awesome. I had the mushroom and truffle pasta, delicious. But the gnocchi my friend ordered was AMAZING. Love it. Service is ok. The waitress was very busy but she did her best. But the staff who were in charge of reservations and assigning tables could have paid more attention to the customers. They were clearly not on top of their game. This is to the owners: this is obviously a very popular dinner place, which means the waiting area (the bar) can get very (over)crowded during busy hours. I saw a lot of people waiting by the window, the door or outside the restaurant because there were not enough seats at the bar. These people could have been loading themselves with overpriced (*wink*) alcohol if the bar were a lot bigger. Think about it, profit stream. ;)
