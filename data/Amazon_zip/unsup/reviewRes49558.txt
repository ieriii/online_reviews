I have now been here twice and certainly enjoyed the experience. Question: is it socially acceptable to like the plate? If so I need a re-do. I am a creature of habit and have ordered the same thing twice - their signature steak entree. Delish. Love the plaintains, margaritas are the best and friendly service that does not push.
