Must say that I'm nuts for Nana's. I've eaten there three times in the last two weeks - once each for breakfast, lunch and dinner - and have had three first class meals. The food is intelligently conceived, well executed, and the Mexican influences are welcome but not overwhelming.  Having lived in Phoenix for 12 years I've eaten my share of huevos rancheros and Nana's are right there with the best, along with their queso fundido which should frankly be made against the law. But the real revelation was dinner - grilled skirt steak with chimichuri for me, quail for my dinner companion - both of which seemed to exemplify what Nana's is all about. Beautiful food, complex flavors, no pretense. My only regret is that they aren't in my neighborhood. If they were I'd be there every day.
