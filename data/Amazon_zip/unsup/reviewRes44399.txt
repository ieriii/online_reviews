Amazing cupcakes! I usually pick up a 1/2 dozen or so to bring to birthday gatherings (get a few varieties, cut them up and share). My mom absolutely loves the chocolate macaroons and I am now required to pick them up for her every time I head out to the burbs for a visit. The sidewalk cafe is a great place for coffee, a bagel, and newspaper on a warm Saturday morning. Bring your dog and he/she will get lots of friendly attention!
