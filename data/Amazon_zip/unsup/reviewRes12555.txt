So after much talk, I came here with a few friends. The atmosphere is a modern rustic feel - it's a large place with about three rooms.  First off, the bread and the butter they serve at the beginning of the meal is awesome! The butter has a sweet garlicky taste to it. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer which was okay. The goat cheese made it decent, but the actual calamari was subpar. I ordered the halibut as my main course, which I had high expectations for, and it was probably something I could have made at home. My boyfriend, ordered the Rosa Viejo, which he felt the same way about. The spiciness of the meal did not meet either of our expectations. On the other hand, our friends ordered the Blackened Duck and the Pork Chops, which they both loved.  All in all, the place is good, but not exceptional. I wouln't go back unless I had a Groupon!
