LOVEDLOVEDLOVED the scallops over some delicious chickpea spread. Well cooked, great flavor and excellent value (4 total scallops). LOVEDDDDDDDDDD the pigs ear-duck egg-mushroom. I don't know what it is about a duck egg that is so genius. And by the way, pigs ear tastes alot like the cured meats you get a wine bars or in spanish sandwiches. The ingredients are quality, but I just wish it didn't cost a whopping $10. Ofcourse, as expected, I liked the milk braised pork shoulder. Tender and tasty. Things that I liked unexpectedly.... - The chicken thigh: 3 small thigh tenderloins served per skewer, 2 skewers total. Served on a plate of tzaziki sauce and crispy potatoes. I NEVER order chicken at restaurants because it's usually too boring, but I would recommend this one. - Deep fried chorizo stuffed olives. I typically hate that kind of thing, but the shell was perfectly crispy and didn't taste heavy of oil. - Insalata Bianca - There's a crunch at the end of each bite from the Arborio rice, and overall it's just a really tasty and refreshing dish. The OK's and meh's: - Antipasta Beets - not too innovative, but they were good nonetheless and served in a vinaigrette. - Panini's are... well, panini's. Duh. I would skip, not too exciting. - Pork Saltimboca tastes like a salty, compressed porkchop. Decent but I would skip this next time. - Sea Bass was not memorable and not chilean. Read: tastes like halibut, and not very flavorful. Skip. - Brussel sprouts. Ew. Who eats brussel sprouts these days? They serve this chopped/sliced thinly so it looks like slaw. - Their desserts weren't too impressive. I got the banana nutella marshmallow panini which tastes exactly like how you might expect, but not as good because you just can't imagine how sweet that combination is until you take that first bite.
