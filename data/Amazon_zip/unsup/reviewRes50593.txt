I was sad when Augie's closed, and I probably will always be a bit nostalgic about the place. BUT Big Jones was excellent right off! The service was fun and friendly, we all loved the food - I had the Eggs Logan ( I think that's what it was called): poached eggs on top of potato cakes with pulled pork and this super-yummy, vinegar-y spicy sauce. YUM! My friend had the Andouille and sweet potato biscuits, which we all also loved, and the boys had Fried Green Tomato BLTs - loved! I really loved the yummy crunchy fried bits that came with the sandwiches. The beignets were good, and we also all got Ginger Dimples to drink - OH YUM!! Love it, glad they're in the neighborhood! A welcome addition to Andersonville and our new favorite breakfast spot! :))
