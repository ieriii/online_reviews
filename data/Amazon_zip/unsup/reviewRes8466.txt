Excellent pizza, good service, nice people. Out on a walk with the missus we stumbled upon this joint, sortly before stumbling on a great church nearby. We were not hungry, but were so charmed by the nice pizzas, simple wine list and Italian news on TV that we swore we'd come back. Flash forward 4 hours and a friend calls wanting to know where to go for hos B-day. We tell him to come up from the South Sofe and 12 of is descend on the place. Each Pizza is better than the last, and each evokes the idea of a cleaned up pie right from Napoli. The wine was solid and stood up to the food. It even came in reasonable unstemmed glasses, just like in Italy. The staff were patient, all 12 pizzas came out hot and at the same time an we were in awe of this somewhat hidden gem.
