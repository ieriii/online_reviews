I just went to this location recently for my anniversary and I had an excellent experience. We arrived early before our 9pm reservation, enjoyed a couple of martinis. Were seated right on the dot. We had Stacey as our waiter and I must say I have never had such great service before. She was very witty and professional and so quick to check up on us. The food was delicious and the atmosphere is much classier than the one in Schaumburg. I had the parmesan crusted filet mignon that was mouth watering followed by a slice of their Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie which left me in a food coma. You needed to roll me back to my apartment I was so stuffed. I will always make a request for Stacey because she made the experience all the better. No question.
