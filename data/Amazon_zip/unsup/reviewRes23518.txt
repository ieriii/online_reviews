Yeah dude!!! Crepes rock!!! If I could be a food, I'd be a crepe. We got some algerian tea with mint and honey. That was so yummy on a cold winters night. The staff was really nice, also. I split a raspberry crepe with nutella with my buddy.  It was pretty good, but the crepe itself was a lot thicker than I'm used to. I needed a steak knife to cut through the thing... but since I didn't have steak knife, I used a butter knife with a sharp edge and put some elbow grease into it. Good thing I pump the iron. The inside of the crepe was DELICIOUS, raspberries STUFFED inside cradled by velvettttyyyy nutella.  The whipped cream was so tasty, I could have eaten a whole tub of it.  The crepe comes with ice cream and we chose green tea because...we like it.... BUT I warn you, don't get the green tea ice cream unless you like green tea ice cream that doesn't TASTE like green tea ice cream. I still ate it (why i don't know) but it really was odd. I can't even tell you what it tasted like... maybe... melon? I like melons but not when I'm expecting green tea. moral: when life gives you melons, make green tea ice cream.
