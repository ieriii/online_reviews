I have never written a review before, but after eating at Nana a few times I felt compelled to let everyone know what a little gem this place really is. I live in Wicker Park, and have many wonderful places to choose from within walking distance, but I just can't get over my craving for the organically grown, flavorful, beautifully plated meals I've had at Nana. Whether it's breakfast, lunch or most recently dinner, you are in for an exceptional meal. The service is friendly and relaxed, and the atmosphere is comfortable.  My breakfast favorites so far have been the Nanadict (I would drink the poblano sauce if no one was watching), the Biscuits and Duck Confit Gravy, and the Stuffed French Toast is heavenly. I've ordered the Smoked Salmon Platter to share as an appetizer twice, the combination of the salmon with buckwheat pancakes is absolutely brilliant, and beautiful! For dinnner I tried the Crispy Fried Quail. I have never had anything like that and I have caught myself daydreaming about it since. Perfect. Tips for new diners at Nana: they freshly sqeeze all of their juice, try the apple, it's amazing. Also, they offer a few simple dishes that you can find at other restaurants but if you try some of the more adventurous dishes you will be so glad you did!  Now I'm hungry . . .
