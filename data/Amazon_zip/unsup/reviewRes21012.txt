Well the lunch menu definitely has less to offer than their dinner menu, and no they wouldn't server their dinner menu at 3. The most interesting items to me were apps. So we got the Scotch Egg, hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage, breaded, and deep fried. Interesting and huge. Not bad with the mustard, but probably something you wouldn't get too often. House Poutine....you better love CLOVE, which in moderation is good, but this was way too much. The elk itself could be found yet made no appearance in taste, hmm maybe the clove masked it. The best part of this dish-should have been the elk, was the cheese curd. Fried chicken livers were good, wish everyone else would have disagreed and then I could have had one more bite. Ah the N-17 Fondue....maybe I'm slow but why N-17? Anyways you had better lover brie. Which I do so this was actually tied for favorite. There was very little spinach which I found sad, and we had to order more bread- no biggie. Then a side we got was the goat cheese grits, AMAZING. was so surprised how strong the goat cheese presence was and it was every bit welcomed. The grits and fondue were the best part, and worth going back for alone. I probably will try to stop in for dinner once, but not sure when or how soon.
