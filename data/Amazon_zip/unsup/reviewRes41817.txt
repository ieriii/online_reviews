Took our close friends visiting from San Fran here last night. It was my second time here, but first time during peak dinner hour. We actually arrived a lot earlier than our reservation time but they were able to seat us immediately. Still not a big fan of how dark it is in the restaurant, but I do like the chandeliers, even if they don't provide much lighting. We had the same server last time and he was very matter-of-fact, not really too friendly. Last time he seemed annoyed when my friend asked for the salt shaker, then immediately took it away after she used it. I noticed this time around they don't keep salt and pepper shakers on any of the tables. The food is very rich and heavy. We started with the bone marrow and onion jam. Very decadent. My friend and I had the ricotta gnocchi with pork belly and preserved lemon. It was just the right portion and super savory. Hubby had the steamed mussels. For dessert we split a tart of fresh raspberries, blueberries, and almonds that was delicious. We were completely stuffed by the end of the meal. Don't forget to check out the bathrooms downstairs. I loved the vintage decor and rain shower type faucets!
