My first visit to Indie was my first restaurant experience in Chicago. I visited Indie the first night I made it to Chicago, took a car ride from Detroit, picked up a date, and found my way through the crazy and amazing city, and I have to say it was a great introduction and dining experience, much to do because of my date, but the food was impeccable as well, and the combination led into what turned out to be an amazing beginning of my trip. I love Sushi, my favorite cuisine, my next favorite is Thai, and when I researched restaurants for my stay, this one read well to my appetite, and usually when I visit a new sushi joint, I always just order their specialty rolls. Well Indie did not let me down. Very tasty! From the impeccable service, to the cleanliness, and of the decadent art displays, the food presentations were displayed as art as well, and I must say, the rolls tasted as good as they looked, and no soy sauce was needed. The only aspect that surprised me was when I ordered sake, I asked for a recommendation, and the waitress recommended the house sake. I was on an obvious date with a girl, and I thought the waitress would have gone for the up-sell, but no... even when I asked how the more expensive bottle was, she still favored the house, which was about the cheapest. Much appreciation towards her for that, as the house was just perfect. It was my dates first time with sake, and she enjoyed it. Overall I give it 4 stars, but likely on my next visit I'll try more or their Thai dishes to have a better opinion on the overall concept of the restaurant. But I do highly recommend it to anyone, and I will be back. Salut!
