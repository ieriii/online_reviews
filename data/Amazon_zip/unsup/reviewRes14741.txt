I am rarely impressed enough to Yelp about ANYTHING, so this is big: Sabatino's is delicious. The restaurant embodies all of the Old Chicago charm depicted in movies, but rarely encountered as a resident of the city. They don't need a flashy downtown or "hip" neighborhood location to draw in business, and I believe that alone speaks volumes. The food is amazing. The ingredients are quality and fresh. The staff is attentive, friendly, and have a lot of personality. We will definitely be returning... SOON! I would absolutely recommend Sabatino's to any and everyone looking for delicious Italian cuisine in Chicago.
