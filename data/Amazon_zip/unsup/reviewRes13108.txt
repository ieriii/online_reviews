Holy Cow. Watch out Fogo... you got competition. First was Sal and Carvao... FAIL Then Brazzaz... semi fail but now I believe TdB can give Fogo a run for their money. As a former employee of Fogo de Chao, I have some loyalty that isn't much forced since the quality of Fogo is top notch... and let me tell you the back of the restaurant is just as clean and sanitary as the front. Anyway, how do you overthrow a churrascarian giant? Give them the same quality and service and then some. I first want to say that TdB's salad bar is very good.... almost too good to the point where I could end up getting full off of it (and I'm sure that's their plan). Their meats are just as good as Fogo... except for the lamb chops - needs more lemon pepper. The service was also excellent... Also, they have great specials from time to time where they give you 50% off coupons.... all you have to do is subscribe to their email listing. I'll be going here again whenever I feel the need to overeat and immediately regret it as I'm walking out the door while saying to myself "I'm never eating this much ever again."
