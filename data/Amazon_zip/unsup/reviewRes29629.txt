I went to the Pasta Bowl based on the gushing reviews I read here. I don't know what I expected, but I found it to be just OK; not bad, not good. I was a little perturbed that the same order would have been only $6 (with a drink thrown in!) if it was take out. A lunch special should be a lunch special. The server was nice and bar area was comfortable. Good place to grab a quick bite to eat if you're in the neighborhood, but not a destination restaurant.
