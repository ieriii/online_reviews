well well. i love crepes, and it's not just because i'm french. well okay maybe it is. i don't know. but as far as i can tell, algerian crepes are slightly different from french-french (or in my case, canadienne) crepes... not in a bad way, but just in a different way. i did love me some crepe this evening, however. these crepes (we had the chicago crepe and the iberian crepe) are very light (particularly compared with those from le creperie) and have lots of veggies. i liked it, but if i was going to pick the crepe to end all crepes, it would probably be either the goat cheese and chicken or the curry crepe from le creperie. i was particularly happy with how light icosium's crepes felt in my tummy, and how guilt-free they are as far as crepes go (considering that if i made my own crepes i would drench them in butter and maple syrup....). also, the veggie puree soup was very good. the service was fast but nothing special, and the food was very good for the price. i'd definitely go back here, it's a nice change from the usual, and was a nice, light crepe-fest for this french girl. =)
