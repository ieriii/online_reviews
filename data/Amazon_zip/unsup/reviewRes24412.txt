This place is very very very tasty. I went there with 8 people at 7:30 on a Saturday (very bad idea). It took 1.5 hours to get a table, which is easily the longest I've ever waited for a table. The staff was really friendly, though, and I'm not going to blame them for my friends' stupidity in planning to take a large group to a no-reservations restaurant during prime going-out time. I got the casado, and it was AMAZING. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of plantains, but I never thought I'd like cabbage salad, and it was fabulous. The meat, the beans and rice, the chips and salsa... good good good. Despite the wait, I will definitely be going back.
