First trip to Chicago and I knew I wanted to try the famous stuffed Chicago pizza everyone was telling me about, so naturally my fellow native Chicago friend told me we had to go to Giordano's and she knows I am quite fond of cheese, and that is an area where Giordano's does not fail! We came in (party of about 6) and pre-ordered our pizza and were told there was a 45 min wait, which sucked at first, but we pre-ordered any way out and were seated shortly thereafter which was surprising after reading all the yelp reviews about the ridiculous wait time. But any who we where all seated and in about 15 mins they came in with this mammoth size pizza that was beyond anything I've ever seen. And it was awesome. We ordered stuffed with Canadian bacon, sausage, green peppers and olives. I struggled to finish my slice but could not live with my self if I didn't finish it., slowly but surely I did. May I suggest they have wheelbarrows? So they can be rolled out after eating such a stuffed pizza. Just a suggestion. :)
