Wow. Love this place. I have come on two occasions now- once to dine in the dining area and once to grab late food barside. Love the energy and atmosphere. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the perfect sized proportions. It is not overkill filler like a lot of mexican restaurants. I always feel like most are just cheese, and carbs and you leave a bloated mess. Not here. Here, the most fresh ingredients are used, creative combinations, and everything I have tried has tasted fabulous. From the guacomole, Blue Agave Margaritas, portobella mushroom fajitas, the other veg. entree (Milanesa de Verduras) to the flan I was in heaven.  The entire group was impressed both times. Liz Martinez the manager was extremely accomodating and amazing as well. Cheers!
