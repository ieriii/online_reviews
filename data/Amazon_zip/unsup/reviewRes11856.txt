I love this place for its delicious thin-crust pizza and its awesome homebrews. I came here on a really hot day to escape the heat for a while and ended up staying for hours and having a fabulous time. The atmosphere is a little weird with the sunken couch area and the uncomfortable bar stools, but clearly that doesn't stop the droves from coming. The wait can get a bit long here, but it's worth it. The only negative is that when we were here, a lot of the beers i wanted to order were actually out due to their enormous popularity. Guess i'll just have to come back! :)
