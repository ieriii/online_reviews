I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. Invariably I always get the same entrees. As soon as you are seated, the wait staff bring you a spicy cabbage appetizer. The cabbage is crunchy and spicy!! The potstickers are good, they seem like any potsticker you might get in any run of the mill chinese restaurant. I suspect restaurants buy them pre made and pan fry them. The boiled pork is awesome, I absolutely love ths thin slices of pork that soak up the fiery sauce. The boiled fish is excellent, the sauce is the exactly like the boiled pork, but fish for some reason does not soak up the sauce. The salt and pepper ribs as well as the salt and pepper fish are excellent. The Yangchow fried rice is very good. Ok I must stop now, my mouth is watering and I have to clean up the keyboard!
