another restaurant that a lot of people talk about, so i must try and see for myself. its pretty small inside and lucky it wasn't that busy when we went.. i ordered 10 wings (5 Seoul Sassy / 5 crisp BBQ), Seoul steak bowl, and small fries.. it didn't sound like a lot of food when i order but once i went up to pick up my food, i realize that is enough to feed like 3 people lol.. the portions are pretty big! the chicken wings was delicious! the skin is crispy even with the sauce and the meat is tender.. the Seoul sassy and crisp BBQ sauce compliments the chicken really well.. the flavor was just right! oh and the wings comes with the drums too! the Seoul steak bowl has a lot of meat in there which is a plus! yet it also has enough rice in there so it is pretty balanced... it tasted pretty good with hot sauce and this "atomic" sauce they have there.. the fries is just your average fries.. but the portion is pretty big for a small order.. i probably would not order the fries again and just try something else next time like o-rings or magic mushrooms or something.. this place is great and is a must try if you haven't! a little pricey but i cant wait to come back here to try the other items on the menu like their burritos..
