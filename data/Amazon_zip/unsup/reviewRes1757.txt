Oh, Doug. I am a true believer. I've been to Hot Dougs several times, and each time I have something different. The menu changes on a weekly basis, so there's always new goodies to try. There's also always about an hour long wait that wraps around the outside of the building if you go at peak meal times (yes, even in the freezing cold) so go prepared and dress appropriately. Also, I've never had their regular Chicago dog or the permanent menu items. I figure if I'm going to wait that long, I need to be waiting for something I can't get anywhere else. I think the duck fat fries are a little overrated. They're a little too greasy for my liking, and the regular fries with the cheese sauce are so delicious I don't see the reason for paying extra for something that I can't even taste the difference in. Keep in mind it's cash only. There are many times the group ahead or behind me noticies the "Cash only" sign at the register after waiting for an hour and have to run and find an ATM (which isn't available onsite). Doug is always maning the cash register, and he's always super friendly. I mean, you would be too if your customers are forking over $8 (worth it)for a hotdog...in cash. I really just love this place. It's definitely a place you have to try at least once.
