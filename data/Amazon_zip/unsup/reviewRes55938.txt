The first time I went here, I had the chicken piccata - I almost didn't go back - it was terrible (too much garlic). I am glad however that a friend talked me into going back. I like the BYOB aspect, it is never more than $30 pp with apps, entrees and desserts. I tend to stick with what I know here: homemade rigatoni with parm is always the special and unbelievable! The lasgna is GREAT too. They always 'act' like they are out of tarimisu - that excuse is old...they should just take it off the menu.
