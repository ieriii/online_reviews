Great beer menu. No doubt about it. Been long on Unibroue Maudite for a while now, so pleased to see it on tap here. On the food side, great looking menu. Went with the sloppy joe. Meh. Texture-wise, it takes you back. Flavor was fine but not great; expected more from the jalapeno in it. Not like this was a Manwich or something, but really nothing special at all. My buddy's burger and fries looked good but also really greasy (as was my sloppy joe). Buffalo frog's legs for a starter? Meh. Ate here at 9pm on a Monday night so at least didn't have to deal with any crowds. Service was quite good. Wouldn't go back unless in a big crowd that involved a lot of chances to sample different things.
