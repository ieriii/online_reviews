Went in for breakfast on recommendation. The menu had lots of unique delicious sounding items. I ordered the bean cakes with red pepper sauce, eggs, cheese grits and a corn muffin. I think the bean cakes and sauce could have had more of a kick to them but they did have a really nice flavor. I ordered my eggs poached and regret not asking for them to be cooked medium. They were basically raw. I like my yolks runny but the whites were mostly liquid too. Service was good. Prices were good. I will definitely go back again to try something different.
