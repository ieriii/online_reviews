Comforting, tasty, if simple food on the table (which seems right). Tried everything from the lamb roast special of the day to chicken soup to a simple plate of dressed avocado. My personal favorite was the quince empanada. A darling waitress. Intriguing if lively decor that did well to convince that we were not in Illinois in January.
