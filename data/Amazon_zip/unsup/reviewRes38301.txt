Superb Belgian beer and the food is good too. The menu changes often so it's hard to find a favorite except for the mussel's and pomme frites. Most of the things I have tried on the menu have been stellar but one time I came before the kitchen closed and ordered a steak and it was quite possibly the worst cut of meat I've ever paid for. That's the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. Other than that my experiences have been quite good and the service has ranged from decent to very good.
