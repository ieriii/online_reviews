Sheesh...from the outside I thought the inside was bigger. They really cram the tables in this restaurant...makes for a very uncomfortable experience. Service was okay...not great. Food was okay...not great. I ordered a BLT and after a few bites I had to open up my sandwich to make sure they didn't forget the bacon. The two shriveled up pieces of B was way too little for the amount of L & T they put on the sandwich. Soup was good so that's why I'm giving RJ Grunts the two stars.
