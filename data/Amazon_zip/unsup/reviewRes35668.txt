Because of its proximity to Ba Le, this place garners almost instant credibility.  I first went with a couple of close friends, not really knowing what I was getting myself into.  I had always passed by, but never realized how cavernous this place really was, an ocean of massive round tables reaching back to where the kitchen would normally be.  The kitchen is right up front, great exposure, great vibe. There's really something primal about taking massive hacks at steaming carcasses of meat with a cleaver as big as a coffee table.  And when the roast pig or duck arrives at your table, silverware will not be necessary. Start picking kids, the skin is where the fun is at, the rendered fat, etc.  We had some fish as well, with bean paste I think. It was good, but it certainly wasn't crispy duck skin, or pig fat for that matter. By the end of the meal, I was in some sort of lazy Suzan-induced euphoria, all this beautiful food rotating in front of me.   The beer is as cheap as you'll find, big tall bottles for around three dollars. Sign me up. If I ever have out-of-town guests who aren't impressed by Chicago's scenic vistas, or the strange smell coming out of the sewer system, I'll take them here, so that they can marvel at the glistening, roasting, crispy animal bodies being cleaved to smithereens.
