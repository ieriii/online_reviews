WOW!!! Did I hit the jackpot with the tasty Hickory Smoked Cajun Pork Sausage, served with Muffaletta Mustard & Oregon Blue Cheese drizzled with Honey. Once the order was placed it arrived to my table in less then 4 minutes. You can glance around and see other hot dog consumer's eating selections because you just might have to try something new each visit, so take notes :) Hot Doug's is the sausage superstore and encased meat emporium of Chicago. With odd hours MON-FRI 10:30AM-4PM closed on Sundays. Also famous for having the longest lines that wrap around the building and down the block. Luckily for me I was fourth in line and the rest just had to wait!
