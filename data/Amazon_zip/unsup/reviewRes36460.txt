I'm not surprised by the relatively-consistent four star reviews I see on Indie's page. The food is surprisingly good, the location is accommodating, the waitresses are cute, it's byob and I hear the delivery is fast. Anyway, drunken noodles and veggie maki are my fav, so when I saw Indie's menu I got really excited. My friend and I were surprised to see the main room packed on a Sunday night. I noticed that this place appears to be very couples-centric. Tables-for-two line the back wall; candles and white xmas-ish lights glow in the dimly lit room. I also found it odd that the waitress appeared to be swamped and running from table to table while a gaggle of employees fraternized by the front door. On to the food: Indie is super accommodating to vegans. Most of the noodles and curries can be made wo egg and fish sauce and there is an entire page of veggie maki(!!). There is a mango, avocado cucumber roll! Kanpyo! And oshinko! We ordered the drunken noodles with tofu, "Indie signature" curry and avocado maki. The sushi was straightforward and yummy. The soy sauce is served in a neat pitcher/cruet. The noodles were greasy, but they were filled with crunchy vegetables and were pretty delicious. The presentation of the Indie Signature Curry was lovely... it was adorned with a strange and tangled fried ball of noodles, basil and meticulously cut squash of some kind. The curry was nutty and more like a Panang than the Mussamun that the menu specified; it was filled with potatoes, squash and cashews and was realllly heavy but totally enjoyable (though I would be overwhelmed if it was the only thing I ordered). All in all, the service was kind of slow, but the food was great and affordable. I'm a little bummed that I am right out of their delivery range, but I will definitely be back soon.
