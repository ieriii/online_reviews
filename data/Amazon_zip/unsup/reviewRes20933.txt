Can someone please explain to me what I'm missing about this place? I am really thankful I came on a Friday night around 5:30 and didn't have to deal with the crazy crowds that are there for lunch. Even so, by 6:00 or so, the line was sneaking out the door. I can't for the life of me figure out why, and I can't say I'd be inclined to come back to figure it out. I ordered the Gunthorp Chicken Torta. I got through half of it before I could no longer convince myself it was just "different" rather than covered in a sauce I could not choke down. My dining buddy ordered the Milanesa, which was slightly better, but nothing I'd ever want to deliberately eat again. The chips and guac were good, but so are the chips and guac at about a million other places. So that would never be a reason to me to wait through a 40 minute line. Same goes for the churros. I had one just because I figured I wouldn't be back and that I should give it a try while there. Meh. Maybe I made a mistake in not going for the soups instead? Beyond the food, the set up is bizarre. There seem to be two separate lines for people who are just coming in, with another one for those who've been there and want to add more to their orders. When I went back up to order a churro, I got nasty looks from people in the bigger line. There is no crowd control so sitting in the restaurant to eat isn't exactly pleasant (but I won't hold that against them as I get that they were going for a nice dining-in experience) although I DID enjoy the music, which reminded me of a day at my favorite Mexican resorts.  Not impressed. But at least now I know :) MAYBE I'll come back another time to give other categories on their menu a try, but you couldn't pay me to wait in a long line to do so. Guess I'm just not a Bayless fan, but I can live with that.
