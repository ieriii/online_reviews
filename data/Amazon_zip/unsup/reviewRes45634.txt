I enjoyed the coziness of this spot as much as the others did. It's very warm, and masculine. We sat in the "library" right next to the fireplace. I thought the table/chairs were a little awkward for eating, but it was still not an unpleasant experience. I didn't really want to sit at a booth. Perfect place for Christmas time. It was actually #1 of 20 things to do to get in the Christmas spirit (courtesy of the RedEye) I really had a tough time deciding between the meatloaf, chicken pot pie, or shepards pie. I really like homestyle cooking and this place gives you more than just your regular pub options. The meatloaf was great, large portions. I'll be back for sure.
