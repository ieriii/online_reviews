This place was confusing, congested and a lot of work. When I eat out I like to relax and be waited on. After you line up, place your order, pay your tab, grab your table service, napkins, doctor your coffee, find your seat, while holding purse, coat, etc.you feel like you just made a train you were running late for, exhausting! While in line to order you hover over diners who must feel like an animal in the zoo as everyone glares. The food was good but there is a lot of good food in Chicago with a better experience. The staff appears stressed just like you! Some changes needed, and quick! Not a restaurant but a workaurant.
