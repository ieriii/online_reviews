Hopleaf definitely lives up to the hype. There is limited seating, and given the immense popularity, it is a must to arrive early for dinner. My husband and I arrived at 4:15 on a Saturday and there were only 2 or 3 tables left! We started off with the sweet potato and fennel latkes. This appetizer comes with 4 latkes, and they are heavy and delicious. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with a little chew. The spices are balanced and give a little zip. There are small, diced pieces of apple, which pair nicely with the latkes. Too much creme fraiche, but you can just skim it off. For dinner, my husband had the duck reuben with frites and I had the CB&J which comes with pub chips and mac and cheese. Both of our entrees were reasonably priced, large, creative and delicious. The CB&J is a fig jam and cashew butter sandwich with melted cheese and sourdough bread. Its amazing - must try! The pub chips are nice and crispy, lightly seasoned, and the mac and cheese is made with a blue cheese or possibly Stilton. Delicious as well. My husband's duck reuben was incredible, and it came with a heap of delicious frites. For dessert, we had the banana fool dessert. Banana pudding, homemade vanilla wafers, peanut butter mousse. Incredible. And of course, the selection of homemade suds will make any craft beer aficionado very happy!
