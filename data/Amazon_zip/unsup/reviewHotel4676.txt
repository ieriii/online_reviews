This has to be the best hotel I have ever stayed at. From the wonderful service, to the modern rooms, to the warmest staff this is a hotel that got it right. The rooms may be tiny but what the have can accommodate anyone. Plenty of storage areas and beautiful decor. This will be my first pick when staying downtown Chicago.
