Lively atmosphere and great food!  This place is fun, lively, and boisterous. I love the bright colors on the walls and all of the decor. The food and drinks were awesome. The mojitos, margaritas, and sangria were all delicious. We enjoyed the appetizer (chicken empanada) and our entrees (short ribs and new york strip). The server was very friendly and knowledgable of the menu. We were happy with her recommendations. There were several bachelorette parties there. It's a perfect place for that kind of event. Actually, Carnivale is a great place to celebrate any special occasion!
