Waaay too long of a line... but decent food.  One of the weirdest operations I have ever seen. Its almost like a being in a communist country breadline. I wont be back if I have to stand in that line. I ordered 2 meals just so I could try them both for fear of having to stand in that line again. Also, my chicken tasted a little gamey. Guess thats the free range goodness. Overall good - but weird. Took 90 mins for my whole "street food" experience.
