BEST EVER dining experience! My bff who is Cuban suggested 90 Miles, she sold me w/how awesome the service was and told us ( my future husband and I) to look out for a girl named Margarita to serve us! Lucky for us she was our server for the night!!! We absolutely loved her! Outgoing personality and took care of us like GOLD! So much so, we're possibly planning to have our pre engagement party there! Margarita you ROCK!
