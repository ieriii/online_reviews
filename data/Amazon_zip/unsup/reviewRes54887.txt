It's only appropriate to make this wonderful beer nurd's haven my first review. Being constantly surrounded by vino, its nice to give your wallet and brain a rest and go for the more approachable suds. What better place to do that than the Hopleaf? I have been here numerous times with numerous different people, and enjoyed myself every time. The appeal, as the name obviously suggests, is beer. More specifically, Belgian beer. Hands down, the best selection of the stuff in Chicago. I pride myself on trying something different every time I go, and I have been a lot. However, the last time I went, I went for literally, The Champagne of Beer. No, not Miller High Life. Malhuer, methode champainoise Dark Brut. A $45 bottle of 12% deliciousness that is so balanced, you will have no idea you are getting loaded until you have finished the 750ml bottle (so much for giving the wallet a break!) This is the most expensive beer they offer, and we were celebrating an engagement. In any other case, the beer is very affordable for Chicago standards. Enough of beer (never thought I would say that). The second reason to come here is for the belgian-alsatian cuisine. My standbys every time I go are the Belgian style mussels and/or the cashew butter and fig jam sandwich served with Stilton mac-n-cheese. The mussels are done Belgian style or with curry and ginger, serves 1 or 2 and comes with frites and a garlic aioli. Everything is good though, from the brisket to the rabbit salad. If you consider yourself a beer nurd, or aspire to be one, do yourself a favor and check the Hopleaf out!
