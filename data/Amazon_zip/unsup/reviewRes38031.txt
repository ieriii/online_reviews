I usually don't take stars off for things that are out of the management's control, but the Hopleaf is simply too crowded these days (every night of the week). That being said, it's worth coming early or late to snag a booth and sample the most diverse collection of Belgian beer I've seen in Chicago. The "Belgian-style" food is also good (especially the Steak Frites), but a little overpriced, and a fairly limited menu. Be careful to keep track of the higher alcohol content in Belgian beers and pace yourself or you might end up bent over the unisex toilet upstairs, which is somewhat embarrassing when you exit past a line of annoyed beer aficionados.
