Oatmeal shake? YES PLEASE. I could drink one every day and twice on Sunday. You simply can't go to Irazu without ordering one. It's like, a law, or something. So this past Saturday I did my civic duty by splitting one with my friend and even though I had had oatmeal for breakfast just that very day it still really hit the spot. The cinnamon is so fresh! Seriously, you can really taste the difference between good, fresh cinnamon and the regular stuff. Irazu opts for the former, God blessem. Dinner? Awesome. Got the Pepito sandwich--steak with some melty cheese, sauteed onions and beans. Split some excellent guac and chips with my buddy and had a perfect and so very filling meal. Even though they implement liberal use of chopped cilantro on top of their guacamole and cilantro is my mortal enemy I still love it. Good on you, Irazu. My friend got the potato tacos and the plate was huge! Lots of toppings and sides. Perfect for veggie eating friends out there. The inside space is pretty small which means there can be a wait for a table when it's cold and rainy and the patio isn't open. It's cool, though, because the food is so good you'll be happy to hang tight. I saw a lady next to us get an oatmeal shake to go while she waited for her table. That is SUCH a good call if you're starving or just can't wait for to mainline some oats. She is smart. I just sat, stomach grumbling, and watched the mouthwatering food go by as they took it from the open air kitchen. But once I sat down and ate some warm chips and spicy salsa I knew it was oh so very worth it.
