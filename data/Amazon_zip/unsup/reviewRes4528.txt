I'll relate an anecdote to show my opinion of the Green Mill. I was taking a visitor around Chicago--Chris G. a poet and librarian from Berkeley CA (at the time). We ended a fun but hectic Sunday of touring Chicago at the Green Mill, maybe 9:00. Chris loved the old-time atmosphere of the place--e.g. the dark wood bar. The place was paractically empty and we caught this very mellow trio with a torchy singer. Great experience. Afterwards, Chris excitedly said, "I'm going to move to Chicago, get an apartment nearby, and go to the 'Green Apple' every night."
