The only thing which justifies the forced one star us that this place is right off Michigan Ave. There were large roaches in my neighbors room, which made me worry. The piece of what looked like rat's skin in my own rattled me but I was still thinking this is just a hole to crash in at night. I did not freak out till I found that my room's door was not locking at all. I had already left my valuables and gone out running once before I realized it. And I when I realized it, I was on my way for an appointment. When it became clear that I had to choose between leaving my door wide ajar as the handyman fixed it and being 1.5 hours late for my appointment I had just had enough. Plus by now I was convinced that the one thing one looks for in a hole-to-crash is safety, and there was no way I was going to feel safe at this place. I launched orbitz from my phone and booked the closest decent looking hotel, in this case The Essex Inn which was just a block further south. It turned out to be a much better place, at a better price than what I had booked my room at this Travelodge for. However, this was not the end of it. I got gangsta treatment from the guy (wearing the name tag "Ken") at the reception who banged pens and key cards at the desk, was staring at me and generally giving the attitude that he wanted to jump across the counter and grab my neck, and came close to mouthing obscenities and tried big time intimidation by staring. Good riddance to bad rubbish, and I am never going back to this shit hole.
