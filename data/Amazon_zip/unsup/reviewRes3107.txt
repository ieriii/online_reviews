Okay, if you are not here for their wings you probably should go somewhere else because their Korean style beef is not very authentic and you'll be waiting in line and to get a table for a long, LONG time. Their meals are just a bit over filling but this is probably not the place where you'll be taking leftovers home. It's a bit pricey for what you get too, so that this place would be for a last resource kind of deal. Granted, their special sauce is delicious.
