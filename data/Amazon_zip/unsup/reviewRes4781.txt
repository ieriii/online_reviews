Sausage with lady apples- 2 stars pork shoulder with potatoes- 4 stars brocolli- 2 stars beets- 4 stars The waiter was very nice and helpful in assisting us with the menu. I thought the food was mostly over priced but enjoyed the beets and pork shoulder. I probably wouldn't return here. I think this place is over rated. But I will give it 3 stars because I'm glad I at least tried it to see what the hype was about and wasn't left feeling too disappointed.
