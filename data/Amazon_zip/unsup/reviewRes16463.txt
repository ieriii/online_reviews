I had a very good experience here the other night. Went with a couple of girlfriends and we started out with the Tacos de Pescado and they were delicious. The salsa that came with the tacos really added a kick and complemented the fish very well. I got the Churrasco and man was it good. My friend got the fish special and that was delicious as well. All in all a very good meal. Bonus points for having fairly cheap valet.
