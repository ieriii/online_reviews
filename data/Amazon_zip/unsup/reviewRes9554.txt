Bottom line? We'll be back, probably more often than we should. The pre fixe menu was a great mix of variety and portion size, although understandable for some to question the value (a bit pricey, but excellent prepared entres help). Had a great cocktail called the Hollywood (named after one of the bartenders who works there and goes by this nickname...) * Bulleit Bourbon * Tawny Port * Maple Syrup * Vermouth * Served over ice, stirred, with a brined Michigan cherry. Would have been better with some rye added, but did the trick. Oh, the aforementioned Brittany (sp?), the manager, was working the night we went. Zero complaints - she was helpful answering questions while I waited at the bar and ran a tight ship throughout our meal. Everyone on staff that night was friendly and eager to help (nobody hid in their sections or got territorial at the customers price).
