sure, it can get packed, but really, what is better than some pho on a freezing or rainy chicago night? start me off with some veggie or shrimp spring rolls, maybe mix it up with a beef/rice dish. i always feel cozy when i walk through their doors. girlfriend loves the #65 soup. i love miscellaneous mix of asian pop and us top 40, and descriptions like "sweetie green bean."
