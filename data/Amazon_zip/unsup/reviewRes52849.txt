What can be better than sitting on their lovely patio sipping ice cold mojiots? Going to be on eof my favotite summer spots this year. The food is full of flavor and the portions will have you feeling full and sleepy by the end of the meal. here are some of my favorites: 1. fried plantains....yummy! Served with a garlic sauce for dipping. This sauce is potent but oh so addictive. I'd eat it with a spoon if it was socially acceptable. 2. Avocado with salt, pepper and lime. 3. Empanadas: They always have some special flavors, but my favorites are the chorizo/goat chees, and garlic shrimp. Amazing! It's BYOB so if want the mojiots, just bring your own rum. They will make you a picher and you poor your own booze to taste. What can be better than that?
