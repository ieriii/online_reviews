*SIGH* Mr. Doug, I adore you. I love watching those programs on the Travel Channel about food places across the US. After seeing a particular episode on hot dogs, I was very taken with this place, and the lovely owner as well. I was already enamored with the idea of Hot Doug's, but then I started hearing so many great things from friends in Chicago, and that just made me more excited about it. This summer, I went to Chicago on break with friends, and I finally got to make my dreams come true (wow, that came out really cheesy!). The walls are covered in really fun trivia and decor, keeping your eyeballs working before, during and after the meal. Mmm, the Kiera Knightley (Fire Dog) was so amazing! Spicy and meaty, and so good with the toppings! And although I wasn't able to get the duck fat fries, I'll have to say, the regular fries were really great anyway! I'm a big fan of fried potato products, and that just worked for me. FYI: The restroom was spotless and really... cute (for lack of a better word at the moment), and a clean restroom is a good sign, for sure! :)
