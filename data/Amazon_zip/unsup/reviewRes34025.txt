Been here a few times now, and the food has not failed to deliver yet. The service has been generally prompt and friendly. They pack the tables a bit close sometimes, which can be kind of awkward. The patio is nice in the summer. The four cheese pizza is incredibly delicious! Haven't tried much else.
