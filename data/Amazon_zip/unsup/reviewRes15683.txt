First impression when walking into the restaurant is "damn, this place is big!" Besides a huge main dining area, Carnivale has multiple smaller dining areas that I guess offer a more "intimate" dining area. I started off with the guacamole and it was incredibly fresh in that you could literally taste all of the seasonings without taking away the taste of the avocado. My girlfriend had the porkchop with sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts and not only was it a huge portion, but it was probably one of the best tasting entrees that I have had!  The only reason I did not give Carnivale 5 stars is because of my entree. I ordered the halibut special on the recommendation of the waiter and although good, it wasn't mind blowing. I understand that you cannot dress up fish too much, but still...at the end of the day, I was hoping for more than a piece of fish with some snap peas and two pieces of shrimp. As far as drinks, the traditional margaritas were strong, but smooth! My only complaint as far as drinks is that it is not much of a value.
