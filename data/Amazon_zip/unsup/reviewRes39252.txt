WHAT I LIKE: I can satiate my Korean BBQ fix at 3 am ... Their meats are top notch in terms of flavor and the portions are decent ... They have a great variety of panchan (the Korean side dishes) and they give you lots of them, at least more so than some of the other Korean BBQ places I've been to ... They recently expanded the place so now you don't have to wait as long while you breathe in all that grilled meat goodness ... Big bottle of OB (Korean beer) washes it all down oh so well WHAT I DON'T LIKE: The pot of burning wood chips that provide the fire for your grilling can be hit or miss -- last time I went, we got a weak fire, which greatly lengthened the amount of time it took to cook our meat ... Service is not always the best, especially if you get a server that doesn't speak English that well or if you don't have a Korean-speaking person in your party ... WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW: While the restaurant does technically have a parking lot, it is a tiny one that fits maybe 10 cars max. But street parking is pretty easy to find and reasonably close by. WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW, PART II: To eat Korean BBQ the "traditional" way, put your grilled meat in the lettuce leaves that they provide you and add the thinly sliced vegetables, rice and hot sauce (also provided to you). Wrap it all up and then try to shove the whole thing in your mouth in one bite (operative word being "try"). WHAT I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD ME EARLIER: Pass on the kalbi and bulgogi (boring but certainly good) and try the chadoebalki (thinly sliced brisket). The meat is unmarinated but it comes with a sesame oil/salt/pepper concoction that tastes fantastic!
