Loved this Chicago hotel When in Chicago, I spent two nights at the Avenue Hotel, and enjoyed it. I got a room on the 20th floor looking over the Magnificent Mile. Very quiet hotel considering the prime location, and I am sensitive to noise. The room was big for a downtown city hotel and plenty of space for 2 people, even in the bathroom! The room was clean, obviously newly refurbished, and of high standard - love the Zebra chair, what a cool touch! The staff all around the hotel especially at the entrance were extremely helpful with baggage, ordering taxis, and giving advice on sites to see and restaurants to try. I found the staff refreshing and polite. The Avenue is situated just steps from the Magnificent Mile and definitely within walking distance (weather pending) from some of downtown Chicago's hot spots. If the shopping is your first priority, exclusive shops are just around the corner. If I am to visit Chicago again, I would stay at this hotel again
