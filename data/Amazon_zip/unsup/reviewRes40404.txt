Since moving to Chicago in August, I've been desperately missing California simple Mexican food and flavors. Before my move, there was a cheap place to get Carne Asada tacos on every corner, but now it had been months since I had anything similar. This is as good as any Mexican food that I knew and loved in Southern California. I've had the Carne Asada burrito twice now, and the steak is hot and juicy, and the tortilla is perfectly chewy and fresh. The cilantro and onions provides just the right flavor I've been craving. Since the restaurant's atmosphere leaves a little to be desired, I've only ever ordered to-go. However, its just as delicious in the car or at home. The green salsa sauce they provide is delicious and spicy. La Pasadita also offers tongue. An adventurous friend convinced me to try it, and despite my instinct, it was not bad. The texture and flavor was similar to pot roast only fattier. The experience was one of my more memorable since my move here!
