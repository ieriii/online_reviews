My boyfriend and I nabbed a room here at a great price (thanks, Hotwire!) to celebrate Valentine's day. Pros: - lovely room, lovely view - giant bed - H20 bath products. Score! - fantastic location - complimentary coffee and gourmet tea in the morning Cons: - miscommunication between management and staff about room availability. In other words, it was annoying when some random mechanic walked in, thinking it was empty. Get it together guys! - NO CABLE. This must be the hotel's way of trying to squeeze more money out of customers: offer terrible options on the TV, force guests to pay for something decent. Not cool guys!
