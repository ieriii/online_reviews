Ok I finally did it. I went to Superdawg. After seeing it on countless food/travel shows I went out of my way to stop and I'm glad that I did. It was a little hard to get to being on some oddball corner. One other thing this place in TINY. It looked way bigger on TV. I'm not a big eater and I don't usually order french fries, so at most places a couple dogs are about right. Big mistake at Superdawg. I realized my error after I ordered and saw everyone else order just one. I didn't know they came with fries and the dawgs are huge. Oh well. After sitting down in the dining area I notice a huge spatter on the window in front of me. I thought that was kinda gross, but went on my way. So I open the box to find a tomatillo wedge, yum I thought and I bit in to it and it squirted all out the side and on to the window.....huh...must be a common thing. So I taste the dog and it was great. Fresh, hot and a flavor of dawg I've never had before. So I bite in to my hot pepper and it squirted too. (they really need to fix this squirting issue). I try to finish the second one and just can't do it. If I'm in the area again, I'm heading back.
