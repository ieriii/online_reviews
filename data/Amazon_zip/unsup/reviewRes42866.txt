When this place first opened, it was so great. Over the last six months or so since the owner has not been present, it has regressed to just average. The crust is too doughy and the baking just is off. To be honest it unfortunately is nearing the quality of the place it replaced, papa Romeos, with fancier toppings. The service there has fallen off too. I'll still go there regularly just hoping it will come back to the way it was, but I think it's lost it's place as one of the great thin crust pizzas in Chicago.
