After walking about twenty minutes in the wrong direction and another 30 minutes carrying the pizza home, I began to question whether or not my trek to Art of Pizza was worth it.  OMG. not at all.  I am no stranger to good Chicago deep dish pizza, I've pretty much tried them all- Lou's, Gino's, etc. (except pequod's), Art of Pizza is definitely now my favorite.  So I may have been super hungry by the time I finally made it home with my two slices but I told myself that I would save one for the next day considering the substantial size of each. Woops, that didn't happen.  Both the pepperoni and sausage were topped perfectly with equal parts cheese, meat and tomatoes (which I could have eaten by themself). But that crust, oohh so good.  Sure, the men behind the counter weren't the most hospitable but whatever, they are serving the goods.  I cannot wait to get my hands on another slice and if this is any indication of how good Pequod's is, then I will be all over that the next chance I get.  Yep, they definitely got the name right. This is pizza art.
