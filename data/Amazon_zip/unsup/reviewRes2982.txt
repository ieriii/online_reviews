We went to TRU this past Monday night for my boyfriend's birthday. I wanted a luxurious,delicious, perfect evening. TRU vastly exceeded all expectations!! From the moment we arrived the staff was superb, wishing my bf happy birthday (a personal birthday message was also printed on our menus) and completely attentive all night in an unobtrusive way. They were like friendly, knowledgable ninjas. We started with a trio of caviar with a chilled vodka which came in a stunning presentation and was fantastic. We ordered one of the 6 course tastings, but added a rabbit dish from the prix fixe menu, and one nine course. We skipped the house wine pairings as our server helpfully explained that they were primarily whites and we are red people. We chose a few reds on our own and they were lovely. The pacing of the courses was superb, we had time to open a few gifts and were never rushed. Each presentation was gorgeous, and everything was so delicious it was like having an opera in your mouth... The rabbit, the fois gras, the pork belly... Every course wowed our palates. It was a perfectly magical evening. I had been nervous after reading some negative reviews here, more it seemed than for other restaurants of this caliber... But I found the ambience understated but very elegant. I didn't feel like it was for older people or stuffy at all... Just simple, chic, and perfect for a special occasion. If you get the chance? Go. We have eaten in NYC, LA, London, Paris, all over, we travel a lot and LOVE food, and for both of us this experience was the BEST meal of our lives. Thank u TRU for an unforgettable evening:-)
