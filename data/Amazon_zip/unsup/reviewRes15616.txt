I can't think of a single bad thing about my experience here. Good service, fun atmosphere, DELICIOUS food, yummy cocktails. We even had a celebrity sighting (Tony Little ... well, sort of a celeb). I think my only complaint was that it was pretty loud. But we were at a business dinner. If it was any other social night that loudness would have been appreciated. I would totally recommend this to anyone, if you don't mind going a bit out of the way (not walking distance from the "main" tourist area of Chicago).
