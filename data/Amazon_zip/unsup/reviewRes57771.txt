I eat here at least twice weekly and the service is fast and excellent. Daily homemade soups that are really good. Entrees and sandwiches come with a choice of soup or salad. Their salads are fresh and filling. Try their Diablos tacos! The cafe is a great place to meet people, read, relax, study and they don't mind if you stay awhile. Don't forget about breakfast! It is busy, but you can get in while others wait at other restaurants for hours. They show local artwork on the walls.
