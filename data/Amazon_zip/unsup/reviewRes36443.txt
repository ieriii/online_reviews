This time I tried the chocolate morsel pancakes and they were absolutely decadent! White chocolate and chocolate chips over chocolate battered pancakes with chocolate chips in the pancakes, whip cream and honey on top and your next trip to the gym is much needed. My boyfriend had the chicken saesar wrap and he said it was okay. Thoroughly enjoyed the coffee and the bill was around $25 and left the waitress a generous tip because she was very attentive and enthusiastic.
