Disappointed I couldn't get my cow's penis but I was satisfied with my beef tendon. I love soups, even more so on cold day and this place will warm the heart and soul. There's no way you'll leave here feeling hungry. If you're an adventurous eater there are definitely things to try here... hence the penis mentioned above. The best part of coming here was there willingness to accommodate 20 Yelpers and get everybody's bowls out on time and no hiccups involved. At least not at our table. There's no way that this will be my first and last visit. Oh and don't forget that they are BYOB.
