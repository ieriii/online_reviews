This is like the Neo nightclub of Sushi, and well I'm a fan of Neo so... yay! There is a nice spread of veggie rolls so I tried my first spinach one tonight and it was pretty yum. Their portion of edamame is generous as well. I did have the urge to come in and put another coat of paint on the walls just to make things look a little less dingy, but the artwork, music, and anime movie playing did make for a cool vibe.
