who would have thought that upscale & bbq go hand in hand?!? they start you off with amazing bread and butter pickles & bbq chips - to DIE for. in my opinion i don't think you really need to order an appetizer.   i love there mac and cheese and baby back ribs. the place is decorated very nicely and the service is excellent. the portions are huge- i have always had leftovers.  if you have room after your meal they carrot cake is excellent.  highly suggest this place, you wont be sorry.
