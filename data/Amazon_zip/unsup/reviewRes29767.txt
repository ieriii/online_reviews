1 star for false advertisement and rude staff. I was psyched to see a place that offered meatless biscuits and gravy. The false advertisement is the word "biscuits" - all they give you is ONE (1) biscuit, split in half. Um, what? And they charge $6 for it? At first I thought this was a mistake (this can't possibly pass as a meal for anyone), but the waitress just said "oh, well, it's usually a side" and rushed off to another table without offering me anything else. Lame. Quit lying on your menu, Chicago Diner.
