Whenever anyone asks what my favorite restaurant is I smile and say Sultan's Market. I've tried almost everything on the menu and loved it all. I've taken probably 20 friends there over the past few years and they all love it. The staff is extremely friendly and it is a family owned business with charm. Best dishes? Falafel sandwich is always great but also try the vegetarian combo, tilapia, baked egg and cheese fatia, or the always fresh salad bar. BEST PLACE EVER.
