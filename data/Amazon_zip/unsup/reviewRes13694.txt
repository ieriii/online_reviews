After an 11 mile run, there is nothing so welcome as the friendly waitstaff at Glenn's, who made sure we were seated immediately (runners always appreciate that because we're HUNGRY!). Coffee was promptly served and we were never made to wait for a cup. I've been here once before and they have delish French toast. However, I needed a protein boost and opted for Classic Eggs Benedict, which come with Canadian bacon and a potato pancake. They were lovely - not as good as Bongo Room's but very nice. The potato pancake was cheesy, which I didn't expect but good. Aside from really good food, I really like the great service I've received both times and the atmosphere,which is very inviting - love the cereal boxes on the wall and the HUGE chalkboard with all the specials and the coffee canisters on the table, which they use for salt, pepper, hot sauce, creamer, etc.  Cool spot, very good food, great service.
