An excellent taste of Bayless cuisine without reservations or super-long waits. I tasted the chips and salsa (excellent) and Carnitas (a hearty soup) and both were phenomenal. For foods that are prepared this fast, the taste is amazing and Xoco does not disappoint. Be prepared for a line, but once again you are only waiting approximately 20-30 minutes for gourmet qualify food. An excellent experience and will definitely return!
