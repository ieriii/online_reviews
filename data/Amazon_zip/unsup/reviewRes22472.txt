This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of the U.S.  I haven't been there since I moved to Seattle from Illinois, but I can't find anything on this side of the country that even comes close. All of the traditional Sichuanese food here is awesome, and they have my favorite fried dumplings in the world (and that includes all the dumplings I've tried in China also). They are HUGE, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and filled with a slightly sweet ground pork that is beyond delicious.  There was also a super cute, friendly Mexican bus boy there who I had a huge crush on, and he would always give my 12 year old brother extra fortune cookies. Not that that last part had anything to do with the quality of the restaurant, but on that note, I remember the service being pretty good also.  The atmosphere here is also great and just how I like it - small and dive-y with gaudy, cheap decorations everywhere. That is exactly what I like to be surrounded with when I eat Chinese food.
