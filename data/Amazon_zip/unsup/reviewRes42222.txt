Gilt Bar- 3.5 Stars, rounding up to 4 for atmosphere. I don't really remember Gilt Bar since I was catching up with my long lost cousin. I do remember that it was very, very dark. That didn't bother me, since my hand mouth coordination is stellar. I was able to get the most of the grub where it was supposed to go. Everyone who got drinks raved about them. Service was commendable, steak tartare was DELICIOUS, and Cuong loved his generous portion of fois gras pate.
