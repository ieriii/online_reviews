I love Westin hotels. They r some of my favs due to the Heavenly bedding & modern design. This one did not disappoint. The location is wonderful. I recommend splurging for the waterfront room. Nothing beats chillin' in my chaseounge looking out over the river! It's just wonderful! We r traveling w our 11 mo old & they have been very accommodating. I'd highly recommend this hotel for great location & beautiful room!
