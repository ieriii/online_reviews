I visited sushi X for the first time last week and I am definitely going back! They have some of the best rolls in town and I heard the Sushi Chef is one of the best in all of Illinois. I ordered the Godzilla and a philadelphia roll and a bowl of miso soup. The service was prompt and the sushi was mouthwatering and very tasty!
