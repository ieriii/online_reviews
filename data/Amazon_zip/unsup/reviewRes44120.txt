I'm really suprised by the great reviews for this place. My experience was awful. My husband and I have a running joke - after trying "someplace new" one night and being really dissapointed we started reminding each other "when we want to try someplace new, we should try someplace old". I finally figured out that for us, it really does apply to sushi in Chicago. We adore Toro - yeah the wait can be long but we have never spent more that $40 for a ton of food and it is always amazing. We should have just gone back there instead of trying Wakamono. We were seated immediately for an early weekend dinner. Our waitress gave us plastic cups for our wine - classssy! - and brought us some tasty nibbles. Sadly, these were the BEST part of the meal. The jalepeno miso was nothing special and it only had two small pieces of tofu, which is my favorite part. Our rolls were awful - the salmon roll was falling apart when it reached the table and the pieces of fish it in were disgustingly huge. Okay, I like raw fish, but I don't want a 3 ounce piece of it in my mouth with no rice. I shouldn't have to unhinged my jaw to get a giant piece of sushi roll into my mouth, only to find out I am now left with a huge gob of raw fish in it. Like I said, I eat sushi (both rolls and nigiri) so it's not like I don't like the taste of raw fish, but I actually gagged three times before I managed to swallow that beast. For the quality of the sushi (horrible) this place is way overpriced. But then again, I wouldn't come back if you paid me.
