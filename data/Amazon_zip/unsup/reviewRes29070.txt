I'm giving this 4 stars because it's my second favortie pizza in the city. My favorite is Art of Pizza, which has a deep (dish) place in my heart. The carmelized cheese is what makes this so tasty and unique. I love the sausage and jalapeno and they have some tasty beers on tap. If it's your mission to try as many Chicago Pizza joints, this needs to be on your list! The only thing that stinks is the street parking, can be a little difficult in that neighborhood.
