Great restaurant. I've been twice and the food and service were excellent both times. The second time I went with a friend who is extremely hard to impress and she was blown away. We asked to not have a certain cheese on our entree because of an allergy and when they accidentally brought it out with the cheese they did everything to make it right. They remade the dish, invited us to sit at a better table, and let us order whatever else we wanted on the menu on them.
