My husband and I finally treated ourselves to Alinea last night and I really enjoyed the "experience." I was never much of a foodie, but lately I've realized that you're not really living a "life" unless you're up for new and eye-opening experiences. We've gotten a lot more adventurous with our culinary palates and if you have the money, it will be well spent here. We did the "tasting menu" and paired it with 3 different glasses of wine (white, red, and dessert wine) based upon the suggestions of the sommelier. I was impressed with the presentation and combination of flavors in all of the dishes. Some dishes definitely tasted better than others, but I appreciated the attention and detail that was required of all of them. The service was impeccable, but I was disappointed with the ambiance. It's a small bright dining room with 5 tables all right next to each other. It felt very industrial. I was looking for something a little more mellow and intimate. Otherwise, my palate was pleased and I'll remember this dinner for years to come. Be prepared to be amazed!
