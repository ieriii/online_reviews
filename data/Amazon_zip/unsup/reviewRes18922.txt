Well, looky there. I've finally returned for something other than churros. One thing to remember about Xoco-- it's immensely popular in River North. So popular that if you go at lunch time, there WILL be a line and you WILL have to wait a while for your food-- whether takeout or dine-in. That said, it's worth it. While it's a bit expensive, the Xoco salad was a great item for lunch. The chicken, while I wish it had been grilled, was fried lightly and nicely, and seemed more like a panko breaded schnitzel-style chicken. The caramelized onions were absolutely delicious. Beyond the salad, the empanadas are to die for. I've already spoken on the brilliance of the churros.... thus, this update ends here. Over and out.
