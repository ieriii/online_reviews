Wowwie Wow Wow! Calling all colossal burrito eaters! You want super size? You've come to the right place. I thought Taco Burrito King had some big burritos but nothing compares to La Pasadita's. Order the steak burrito~$11. This log of a meal measures out about 16 inches and 4 inches in diameter~ 4pi x 16 inches = roughly a volume of 208 in. It's filled with seasoned rice, guac, refried beans, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese and scrumptious steak. Go easy on this one big boys. Even the manliest of men cannot devour this beast entirely!
