Sunda take 1 - The first time we came here it was my fiance, my mom and I celebrating birthdays. Despite the attentive service, we all felt the food was just SUPER salty. I actually felt a bit stiffed, especially when you come here with these grand expectations, only to be drinking down tons of water to get the salty taste out of your mouth after each bite of food. We did mention that we thought the food was salty, but we didn't complain about it...and nothing was really done. Sunda take 2 - Now....move ahead a year and a half later and I'm brought back to Sunda for a company holiday party. Sadly, no spouses, but I felt he could come along and have a drink a the bar ($75 later...). Anyhoo - the food I had this time was really tasty. indo corn fritters chicken and mushroom siu mai lemongrass beef lollipops - AWESOME! Also, there were a number of sushi rolls, noodle salad and ahi tuna. My hubby had a great tasting hand roll called "no you didn't...the ultimate handroll" and pancit canton - a nice noodle dish with pork and shrimp. He also could not help himself and ordered a dessert! He opted for for some kind of pineapple upside down cake (a special) and it was really tasty! I actually had bites of everything he had. So our opinoins have changed in regards to the food. As everyone knows, this place is a total scene. The bar is packed and everyone looks at one another and you may see someone famous, or someone trying to be famous, or someone whose company has been paid for that evening...but that is all part of the experience here. The food really goes hand-in-hand with the scene "experience". Get pretty and go to Sunda.
