I was surprised to see such a high amount of low and so-so reviews for this place... but maybe I just got lucky? Anyway, in my few experiences this place has been wonderful. The food is always very fresh and the dishes are pretty creative. I have tried a few teas and liked all of the wait staff's suggestions. So far, I have not experienced these insane lines/waits that everyone keeps talking about, but it's possible I am just lucking out with lunch hour as opposed to weekend brunch outings. But the place is pretty tiny, so I can see where you would have to wait on a weekend. M. Henry (down the street) was the same way until they were able to expand a few years after they opened. The price for food is not ultra cheap, but the portions are more than enough to share, so it's a good way to cut the cost a bit. The waitresses are also very friendly and seem to have great suggestions. I really recommend giving this new little spot a try. It seems like it will be a nice addition to the neighborhood.
