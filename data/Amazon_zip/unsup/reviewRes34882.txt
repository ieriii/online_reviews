The decor is contemporary and attractive without seeming ostentatious which cannot be said for some of the conversations I overheard. ("...How much was your flight to Singapore? Oh, you should really check out the resorts in Uruguay...") The maki rolls are intensely flavorful. I recommend getting something you would not normally try. My friend and I were brought out a tray of "godzilla" rolls which we did not order but the staff told us to keep/eat anyway if we wanted. To my surprise I was quite taken with tempura shrimp in sushi.  The omega roll is my fave with tuna, avocado, pepper mayo, and tempura flakes. The rolls are huge-- so a bit daunting to eat in one bite but certainly not problematic. You know you want to shovel into your mouth anyway, so get over the unladylikeness of it and enjoy! Save money by getting one "mega" roll ($14-17) which is plenty of food for one person and miso soup ($3.)
