Fondue can be great...on certain, rare occassions. And last night's meal at Geja's was fairly good - but not something I'll need to repeat anytime soon. The fun of cooking your own food at the table wears off fairly quickly. Now, Geja's offers a most excellent array of dipping sauces for your entrees, but there's just so much to keep track of ("how long has my chicken been cooking, versus my mushroom? Sh*t, I just dropped my broccoli in the oil, now I have to fish it out..."), it's hard to actually enjoy conversation at the same time. And isn't that the main reason we go out to dinner in the first place? I do want to point out that the cheese fondue is delicious (an excellent mix of gruyere and swiss), and the service was excellent throughout our entire meal. Unfortunately, another miss for this place is that you leave REEKING of grease. And when I say reeking, you stink to the high heavens. Everything, your hair, clothes, coat (that was hidden away in a closet for crying out loud) has been permeated by the stench. Even if the food is decent, it's not worth hardly being able to stand the smell of yourself afterwards.
