This place is always excellent no matter what you order. Only problem is their wait time is ridiculous. Once you get past that, order anything and you will be pleased. Some of my fail-proof recommendations are the chicken piccata but I order it over mashed potatoes instead of fries. Try it you'll LOVE that. Also excellent is the Indo-chine chicken and shrimp. WOW. Amazing, exotic flavor. Dessert- try the molten chocolate cake and the pineapple upside down cake was my latest surprise favorite. SO FRESH.
