i went there the other night because small bar was too loud. it was just random that we decided to go into the place next door. we got a drink and ended up with some sliders and ribs. (yes, you can get a single rib.) the sliders are something special. the ribs were good, too, but the sliders are special. we sat at the bar and i made my way through a few of the beer cocktails. they were great, a bit sweet, but that's what i dig. also the guy tending bar was really nice, a good guy. i said my wife would like the beer cocktails and i'd bring her in.  well, last night my wife and i closed on our new place. it took forever. anyway, usually we go to smokedaddys or j alexanders when we're feeling good (or bad) and hungry. last night i took her to fifty/50 and got a table. we started with the smoked chicken nachos. we were starved and they didn't stand a chance. they were good, the cheese tasted real. she ordered the burger and i got the skirt steak sandwich. i loved my skirt steak sandwich. but i also had a bite of her burger. i think it may be the best burger in town. the one at irwins is good, but i think this is better.  also, the service was great - especially the fact that they give you hot towels.  yes, i've been there two nights in a row. i can't imagine i'll go back tonight, but the problem is that i could.  i have to imagine they'll set up some patio thing for the summer. i hope this place does well. it's noticeably good. check it out.
