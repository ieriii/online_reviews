Visited Chicago this past weekend and my friend who lives in Evanston recommended The Publican. All I have to say is "Thank you, Ma'am. May I have another?" [distracted by other people's comments/posts to the right of this text box] Just read a few other reviews about the ambiance and it never occurred to me that I was meant to feel like a pig (the main ingredient on the menu) but....mission accomplished (in a good way)! Ever seen the Miyazaki's "Spirited Away"? My friends and I probably looked like the parents when the food came out. Everything was delicious and one just couldn't help but to move from plate to plate...shoveling its contents into our already stuffed faces, repeatedly. [Ha! Yes, quite the sight! Sexy. ;-) Nothing a perfectly mixed bloody mary with Tito's vodka couldn't fix.] This was the perfect place to go after a late night out and about the town. My friends did the ordering, so I don't remember everything but the following: bloody mary with in-house pickled garnish plus glass of beer (I appreciate the interesting combo as well as the extra garnish they brought me -- can't go wrong with Tito's vodka) red wine poached eggs on toast with proscuitto and bitter greens salad (solid brunch fare) side of bacon (WOW! Wow....! ) side of hashbrowns (I wanted to order a second one because it doesn't go very far when split five ways, but even still...so glad I ordered it. Fried to perfection. Didn't even need ketchup, it was that good.) intelligentista decaf coffee (prefer the soy latte at their shop, but that's me...not a coffee drinker) I'm sure there was more but all of the above was delish!!!
