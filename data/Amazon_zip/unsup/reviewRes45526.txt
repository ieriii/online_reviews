The ambiance is great, but this place is way too expensive. $12.95 for a buffalo chicken sandwich? Really? Plus, whenever I go there, there's an inordinate amount of mommies with strollers, which is always kind of a pain in the ass, considering it's a bar.  I guess I would go here for a beer or two ... they have some pretty good microbrews, but other than that, for what you pay for, you can go somewhere better.
