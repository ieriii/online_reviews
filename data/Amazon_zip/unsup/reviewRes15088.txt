Violet Hour has a swanky atmosphere with its discreet entrance (the door is on the north end of the wall with graffiti) and its velvet interior. The cocktails are delicious and are all $12 each. My friend and I waited in line for about 30 minutes before getting in, and then we got an awesome seat in front of the fireplace. We both tried two (stiff) cocktails each, and given that we spanned the major categories on the menu, I feel that one can't go wrong with any of the drinks here. If you plan to come here, I recommend the following: 1) Don't be in a rush - you'll probably have to wait in line for a while. 2) Make a reservation if you have a large group
