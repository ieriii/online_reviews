A lot of really cool and unique stuff here. If I had more time I could have spent a whole hour here looking and reading and thinking about whether to buy, buy, buy!!! We were on a hunt for dessert and since Hoosier Mama was closed, we decided to come here to find sweets. I found a small apple pie which was pretty affordable. Most things here are expensive! The pie tasted okay. Not as great as Hoosier Mama. They had some pesto sauce and broths that looked really good. They have a deli here and a cafe. Might have to make another visit here soon! Service was very friendly. If you purchase $20 or more, you get free valet. Otherwise, you'll have to find street parking which can be difficult.
