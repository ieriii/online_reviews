I work down the street and am amused by the long line that I see, rain or shine. I guess it's worth the wait for many, but if you really want to make it worth it, gather a group and call in your order (at least $20 worth) to pick it up without waiting in line. There's always friendly service and the mood is usually upbeat - it's hard to miss with the close quarters everyone sits in and the loud music.
