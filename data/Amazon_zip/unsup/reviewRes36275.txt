Disappointing sushi. I ordered salmon and seabass nigiri which were actually quite good although the cuts were uneven - too thick on one end and paper thin on the other. The fish tasted nice and fresh, though. The rolls with tempura were terrible! I got the dragon roll (shrimp tempura in the middle) and the sweet potato roll. The tempura coating was thick, hard and flavorless...definitely not light and fluffy like it should be. It made the rolls actually difficult to eat both because of the nasty flavor and the excessive, jaw-numbing chewiness. Also, the shrimp used in the dragon roll were tiny, pathetic little things.
