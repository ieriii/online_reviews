I just got back to my hotel following dinner at schwa. My ears are ringing. They're ringing loud and nonstop. My voice is raspy from having to shout to be heard during dinner. 80% of what the food runners said to describe a particular dish couldn't be deciphered above the roar of their music. Talk about high stress dining.... 3 hours of deafening music, helter skelter service, and quite frankly, surroundings befitting a bomb shelter. Further, the music makes no sense. It's blaring for the benefit of the line cooks yet it's directed toward the customers. I'm not sure if there is much truth to their reservation inadequacies. I called the restaurant this afternoon. The phone was answered promptly by a pleasant young lady. I asked about a reservation for the same evening and she asked if I preferred 6, 6:30 or, 8:30. I selected 8:30 and that was that. The host and busboy for our meal was the head cook's brother. A very nice guy. Wired pretty tight, but nice all the same You can read a dozen other reviews for details on the succession of courses. A few of them were very good. A few of them were forgettable. All of them are miniscule. Too many of them have some sort of foam or dried out sauce streaked across the dish. One of the foams actually tasted like soap suds. That which stood out, on each of the 2 or 3 times it occurred, was when something was served that offered some substance. Something to actually bite and chew, rather than just slurp and swallow. Most of their food is baby food soft. When something finally comes along that has some body, sadly, it's just a bite in size. Even their lamb, for example, was served in miniature. 4 slices, maybe 1/8" thick and smaller than 1" x 3/4". BYO. No soft drinks offered. No bread offered. No coffee or tea offered. Overall- I have to give Schwa 1 star- based on the simple truth that I would never return. Not even as somebody's guest. Life's too short.
