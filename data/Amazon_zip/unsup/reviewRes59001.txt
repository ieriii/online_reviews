My group had their holiday outing there yesterday and it was very disappointing. The food and service were terrible! The sushi was not fresh, the beef was too chewy and the miso soup was too salty. Several were also disappointed with the rock shrimp and sea bass dish. It took forever for us to place our order and get served each course. At times, we felt like the server had forgotten about us. Also, they put MSG in their food and do not include that on the menu or tell you unless you ask. I'm glad I asked, though almost didn't, cause I'm highly allergic to it. It was shocking to me that a place of this caliber that is on the expensive end would even have MSG (a low quality, artificial ingredient) in its food. Even Panda Express no longer makes its food with MSG.The waiter was clueless as to what items had MSG and what didn't and had to go back a number of times to the kitchen to find out if each item I asked about had it or not. This held us up. And, then when I finally placed my order, he got it wrong! I do not recommend this place and would never go back to it! There are too many awesome restaurants in this City to eat at with much better service and better quality food!
