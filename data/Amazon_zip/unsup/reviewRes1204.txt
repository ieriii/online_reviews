Yeah, I know that Doug's is the most Yelped place in Chicago, so why even bother writing another review of it? Because it really does deserve all the praise. I had a friend in from out of town who was a long-time, very dedicated vegetarian. When he came to Doug's, he decided to throw all of his beliefs out the window and eat a rattlesnake sausage. That is what Hot Doug's has the power to do: turn you from a whiny, limp-wristed, plant eating sissy boy into a genuine, bad-ass, snake eating mother fucker.
