I went to Mastro's with a client, and will never repeat the experience. The restaurant was, as other reviewers mentioned, extremely noisy and very dark. Flashlights were needed to read the menu. I ordered the bone-in filet, which was touted by the waiter as one of the signature dishes - it was one of the worst steaks I have had in a long time. Dry and tasteless. The appetizer and sides were mediocre. The service, however, was fine. However, given the prices, one would expect really excellent food, not mediocre to bad.
