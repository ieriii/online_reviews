So I went to the Gilt Bar with a couple of friends last night, around 8:45 for dinner after an event. The interior is nice, rather cozy and has some interesting lighting. The bar was moderately crowded but we waited 30 minutes for a table so we could sit own and eat. Our waiter was friendly and the appetizers came out fairly quickly (the beet salad and the triple cream cheese platter were both pretty tasty) but after that we waited nearly another 30 minutes for our food to come out. We didn't get checked on - not a "Your food is coming right out" - during that time and that was moderately annoying. I had what the call "The Purist" which is basically penne in an alfredo sauce with shaved parm. A lot saltier than it needed to be but I was starving at that point so I ate it. Of the other three people with me, two also had pasta and one had meatballs so it wasn't like there was anything too crazy. In general, it was all just ok - not somewhere I would seek out unless they worked on their timing and getting food out more quickly and they also need to work on the seasoning.
