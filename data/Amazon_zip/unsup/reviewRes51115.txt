I came here for brunch with a large group. The service was great and pretty fast for the large group we had. They were very accommodating.  I had the light spinach omelet with home fries and corn muffin. They were great. I felt super full but not greasy full. The banana bread also looked really good (a couple at my table got it), but I didn't try it. I think I would definitely come back and try other things. I also liked that it is located near a brown line stop and a lot of buses.
