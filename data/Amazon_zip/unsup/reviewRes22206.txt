Great dawg but they are kinda pricey. The green tomato is interesting and flavorful. The fries are a little too soggy for me at times though. Burgers are good as is the polish. Excellent shakes and malts. It seems a lot of times when I go there the pop machine is 'broken', I personally think they just want you to order the more expensive shake. The atmosphere is great. The classic drive in feel is wonderful and there are a few tables to sit down both inside and out. Great for late night dawg craving or after a little league game. Remember to tip the waitresses.
