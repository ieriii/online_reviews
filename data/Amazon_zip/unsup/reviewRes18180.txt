Eww. What an overrated place. I'd been really excited about trying out XOCO, knowing that it was one of Rick Bayless' places. I was so disappointed. First off, walking into that crowded, oddly laid-out place, there was no one to greet us. It felt like I was walking into a McDonald's or something - a mess. It literally took 5 minutes to get someone to tell me who I needed to see to get a table. That could've also been more polite. Also, the regulars in there were rude. Now to the food. The tortas were OK, but I could have also been eating at any deli in town. The caldos were bland and not filling. There just wasn't anything special about the food. If you really want good tortas (and with the most amazing sauces), try out the La Adelita truck instead. So much better food and service.
