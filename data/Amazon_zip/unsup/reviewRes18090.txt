Ravenswood seems ripe with hole-in-the-wall restaurants that mask the hidden jewel within, and this is no different. Forget the rest of their filthy food, walk in right now, and demand Tiramisu. To be a little more serious, the food is nothing less than succulent, as long as you order the right thing. It seems like every day they have a different special or five, and each one of them sounds like some obscure delicacy. I was never let down by their handmade portobello mushroom ravioli in bolognese, or any of their chicken dishes, but I was sadly disappointed by the shrimp risotto. Sadly enough, they are also located next to an obnoxiously stinky and rarely emptied dumpster half a block down next to the L track, and sometimes you can actually smell it in the establishment. Considering the quality of the food here, this is a great disservice that can detract from an otherwise exquisite meal. Take my advice here: if you can smell it outside, it may be a problem inside as well. This only happened one of the times I went, so my warning may be unnecessary. But the real shining jewel here is the Tiramisu. They are family owned and operated, and the person waiting your table may have contributed somehow to your meal, so keep that in mind. More than once, our waiter was the resident Tiramisu chef, and he's so modest about that fact, it's hard to believe how shockingly divine it tastes. This is something you'll want to eat slowly, and enjoy every second. The rest of the food, no matter how delectable, doesn't exist so far as I'm concerned so long as I can order plates of this dessert. If you do nothing else, treat yourself to this. It's really a shame they're between the Damen and Montrose brown-line stops. It's a really out of the way location for a surprisingly good bite to eat.
