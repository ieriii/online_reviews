What?! There's only 5 stars? Here's the problem for me with reviewing Alinea. It was probably the most amazing dining experience I've ever had and strangely personal. You can read 5,000 reviews detailing the food (I'm not going to do that here) but you really need to experience it first hand. What I will say is- from when you walk down that hallway and pause before that sliding door to when you hand the valet your ticket for your car to go home- you will have had the most unique experience that is worth every penny. Service- exemplary. We thought for sure the servers were going to be stuffy and all pip-pip. But they were funny and knowledgable. Smartly dressed. We were there a good 4 hours and laughed the whole time. Why is everyone so quiet? Why is there no soft music? I don't know and frankly it doesn't matter. Food- not only did I taste things that blew my mind but VISUALLY things blew me away. It was like eating, art, and performance art...yes it's possible! I loved getting a copy of the menu at the end of the meal! Wine- hmmm beware of the wine pairing. While delicious there is a lot of it. LOTS. Okay fine I had to start giving mine away. Sooo save save saves. GO. If you feel about food the way I do- it will be life changing.
