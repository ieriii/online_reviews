I'll start off by saying that I wouldn't compare this place to Kumas. The location is just fine for me, right across the street from the Empty Bottle is awesome. The people working there were very friendly which I like. I had a good burger at a fair price with no wait for a table which is fantastic. Being a beer snob I think there good selection of beer helped my rating. I had some Bell's Two Hearted which is damn good beer and some other selections. Watched a HUGE AC/DC Concert on the flat screens they have there. Overall this place is not a bad choice!
