Very touristy - good food but not worth waiting in the cattle coral for over 2 1/2 to get a table... better yet, call ahead and get your pizza to go if you want to "experience" the club like atmosphere...or better yet have it delivered The bruschetta not worth ordering...too many onions and too much garlic (yes it is possible)
