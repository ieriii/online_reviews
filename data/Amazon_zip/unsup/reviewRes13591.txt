Yes, I would/will probably go there again. We had a group of 6 or 7 on a Sunday evening and were able to get seated with a bit of a wait--nothing terrible. Drinks were fine. I don't like beer but apparently they have a v. nice selection. Bloody mary was spicy, some good crap on top, a little too transparently made with a mix. The food was decadent, as a rule-rich stuff. The hamburgers are probably the shining point. That shit is going to take a little time off of your life and you won't mind it. The flavors were interesting and left your mouth demanding another bite even when your stomach was screaming 'enough!' Usually I think it's petty and of little use when people tell some n=1 story about their own terrible experience with the wait staff on here. But I should acknowledge that my experience was sullied by the waitress who got all snippy at the end of the meal about how we were dividing up the bill. She was definitely attentive throughout the meal--most of the servers there were. But there seemed to be a hyper-attention to profit-making at the expense of customer experience that rubbed me the wrong way. This was also the case when we were waiting to be seated and had 5 of the 7 people there and wanted to order drinks and appetizers without the last two. I dunno..maybe it was just the super-hipster countenance rubbing me the wrong way tonight. I think I'll go back and try some other stuff and give it another shot.
