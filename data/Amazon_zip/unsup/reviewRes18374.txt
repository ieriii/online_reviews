This place makes me jump for joy. I can't get it out of my head. I had some sort of Chicken Parm special and I kept eating and eating.... I don't like Italian places so much b/c most the time I feel like I could make the same thing at home. My partner had the gnocci. I have never been a fan of gnocci.... until now.  Go here. For your own good. BYOB
