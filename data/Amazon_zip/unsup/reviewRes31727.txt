My favorite restaurant EVER!!! The food is to die-for, I mean who else makes vegetarian comfort food?? My favorites are the Country Fried "Steak", the BBQ "wings" and the "Gyros" salad. Seriously the best vegetarian food out there- it even beats non-vegetarian food! I've taken many non-vegetarians there and even they love it. Everything tastes super home-made, the staff is friendly and attentive, as well as knowledgeable and the atmosphere is fun and unique. I go about every two weeks, that's how much I love it. Sometimes there can be a long wait, but that's just a sign of how good it is! Can't say enough good things about this place.
