The food experience at this restaurant was very nice - highlights included the octopus starter which had fresh flavors to tempt the palette. Another highlight was the beef main dish which was nicely flavored yet light. The scallop starter had a very nice mushroom ragout, but I found the scallops alone to be too salty.  Unlike other reviewers I found the portions to be a good size, however do not expect this to be Maggiano's with enough food for you, the person sitting next to you and to bring home for later. It's a good value for quality food. The biggest downside to the restaurant is the noise. We went on a Saturday evening with my parents and sat indoors following a graduation; the noise was so loud that we could barely hear each other and had to nearly yell to talk to the person across the table. The restaurant has made an effort with some insulation under tables and on the ceiling, but the wood floors and metal ceiling which make the ambiance so inviting also amplify the noise. The service was good, but not as great as other reviewers have noted - perhaps since it was a Saturday night. We also experienced the restaurant being out of a few dishes on the menu despite ordering around 7:30pm. All in all, I probably will not go back unless it is on a mid-week day since the noise made the experience un-enjoyable.
