In my opinion, Pequod's pizza is completely overrated. While the outer crust is indeed very nicely done, the middle is a soggy mess. The sauce was super salty, and this is the only time in my life EVER that pizza was not better the day after. I mean really how does that happen? It is one of the foundational laws of all that is good and right in life, that pizza is always better the day after. Well not at this joint. I've tried their pizza several times now, and just don't get it. And not for nothing, it's not inexpensive either, two pies $50.00 with a couple of toppings?  I know Pequod's is popular and all, but not with this girl.
