At the recommendation of the girl at the counter, I had the Cuban sandwich. Was the best version of it that I have had in the city. The tostones were also good, with a TON of garlic on top of them. A little different version than I was used to, but good nonetheless. With only seating at a counter for about 7, it can be a tight fit around lunch time, but I was lucky. Not sure how you'd do dinner, but likely carryout. Nice place, good food, nice people.  I will be back to try another item on the menu now.
