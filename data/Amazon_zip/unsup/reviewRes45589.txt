I live in the area, so I don't know why I haven't gone to Wilde's until last night, but I'll definitely be going back. First of all, the atmosphere is great--perfect for a snowy winter day. It's all dark wood and low lights and a real honest-to-goodness library that I covet intensely. The bar is well-stocked and relatively reasonable; you're paying more than you would if you wandered down to Friar Tuck's, but for good reason. We arrived before 6, and were able to snag a comfy booth near the back. As we were leaving around 7:30 most of the tables were full, and I imagine there's probably a wait on the weekends. The menu had a lot of great choices ranging from burgers to sandwiches to tradition Irish bangers and mash, and we all had a tough time deciding on what we wanted. I ended up with the most delicious plate of gourmet mac-and-cheese I've ever dreamed of--it was all garlic and bacon and thick noodles and real melted Irish Cheddar. It didn't come with any sides, but there was plenty to eat (and great left-overs for lunch the next day). Another member of our group got the bleu cheese burger, and it was good. Not outstanding, but a standard enjoyable high-end burger. The last member of our group got a huge steak Caesar Salad which was essentially a head of Romaine lettuce chopped in half, dressing, cheese, and slices of beautifully seasoned seared steak. I can see that it would put someone off if they were expecting a more traditional salad, but we loved it. I'm excited to go back and try some of their other offerings, even though their service could use a little help--we ended up waiting a good 10 minutes for the bill, but in cozy comfortable place like that, we certainly didn't mind.
