Here's my deal. Any place may have great beer, great food but when a bartender chooses to lecture as opposed to educate it looks bad. With so many beers/ ales/ lambics etc (which is great)...My friend ordered wrong. She felt terrible, she tried to drink it but it was to acidic for her. I approached the bartender, explained situation and he replied we don't do that aka help you out here. So I bought my friend another drink. Gotta be honest have not been back since.
