I have been dining at wildfire for years but this was my first visit to their city location and it was the best experience I've ever had at any wildfire! Our server was Stacy and she was great! She was very personable, attentive & efficient! She almost took my martini back to the bar because it wasn't filled completely to the rim, I barely noticed but that's how much detail she paid attention to! I'll be coming back to the city location from now on and definitely requesting Stacy's section only!
