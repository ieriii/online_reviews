Definitely one of Chicago's best pizza places. Relaxed atmosphere (although a bit loud), amazing pizza, and really good house-brewed beer. The pizza is thin crust, with just the right amount of greasy deliciousness. Both the red and the white pizzas are great. My favorite is probably a red pizza with pepperoni, banana peppers, and basil. A strange combo, but really good!
