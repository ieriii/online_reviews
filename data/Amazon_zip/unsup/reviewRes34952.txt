I've only ever ordered delivery from Sushi X but I won't go anywhere else. In the past 6 months, I've probably had Sushi X deliver about 20 times. The fish is consistently fresh and fast. They always tell you delivery time is 45 minutes to an hour but they are usually here in 30 minutes or less. One time the delivery guy forgot my Diet Coke - he apologized and took it off my bill. A few hours later he showed up randomly with a whole six pack of diet coke and let me know he just felt really bad and he was really sorry. My favorite rolls are - spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, and red dragon. The wasabi mashed potatoes are great too. Best presentation and when you call in they have your previous order and information saved.
