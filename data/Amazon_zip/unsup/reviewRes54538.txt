The most fresh falafel you will ever taste ,great home made food and such reasonable prices.You can always count on leaving satisfied.Friends from out of town come back and would choose Sultans over a fancy steak dinner.Try Chicken and lamb combo with rise with the hummus.And Yes the salad bar is a must as well.
