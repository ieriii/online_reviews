This is SUCH GOOD FOOD. I don't know how to write about it in a new way with being redundant to all the already positive notes! I'll give you my favorites: Drunken Noodles, with chicken and the crispy noodle upgrade.....and depending on the day extra spicey! And of course, the Red Curry. It probably doesn't matter what you get - just remember to follow up the meal with some Mochi Creams. The chewy outside is the bomb and out American mouths will get through anything for some ice cream! I'm going now! Mmmmmm!!!!!
