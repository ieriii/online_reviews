I've been here three times, each with a yearning hope of greatness. I want to like it so bad, but I think I settled on giving up this last time around.I want to mention that other than the 15 minutes we waited for a server, the service has always been consistently great and accommodating, even when they are training someone. Always very knowledgeable and friendly :-)Though the burger was great, cooked nicely at Medium Rare, loved the pickled onions. Also a fan of the sweet potato fires with goat cheese fondue, but the fondue is hit or miss, salt-wise. Usually severely under seasoned.This has echos of a place I was a cook at back in the day where the chef had what seemed like an allergy to salt. The steak was average, no hint of horse radish in the condiment it is served with, the basic fries are odd. The compound butter lacked salt as well. The fried smelts were good quality seafood, but lacked flavor in the batter and accompaniments. The greens are seasoned with... I'm not sure? Just lemon? I wish they were a little more exciting!I always like the poached pear cake dessert, but this last time around the (always delicious) Black Dog Gelato was the wrong gelato and the cake was a little cold and stale :-/ My friend hates that it's advertised as a poached pear dessert, but has a sliver of pear. I don't mind it though.I only through the two stars out ultimately because of the disappointment. I really like the vibe and concept - I hope things work out for this place! :-)
