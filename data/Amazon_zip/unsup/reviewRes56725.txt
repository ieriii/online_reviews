I heart Sapori. My husband and I were introduced to this place about 2 years ago, and we have been hooked ever since. The chef and wait staff are attentive, considerate, and warmhearted. The food is consistently divine. Some of my fave dishes...- lobster-stuffed pasta- lamb shank- pumpkin/b-squash ravioli- zuppa di pesceDon't forget dessert! The panna cotta, tiramisu, and bread pudding are lovely. Pair that up with some Moscato and you've got a great ending to a memorable meal.Bravo! We're devoted to you, Sapori!
