Hellooooo new obsession! Simply It's Beef Pho is the best I've had so far in the city. I love it! I dream about it at night! There's nothing I love more than a big plate of bean sprouts, cilantro, peppers, and limes and a bowl of steaming hot Pho. This cute little restaurant on Lincoln has never disappointed, and I love going there with my husband. The staff are very attentive and efficient - your water never goes below half full. One weird thing is that their prix fixe menus are taped to the tables... uh, ok? That's kinda weird. The only complaint is that it is pretty tight quarters at night and you'll probably be sitting shoulder to shoulder to the people next to you. The invasion of personal space is totally worth it though to have more of Simply It's Pho!
