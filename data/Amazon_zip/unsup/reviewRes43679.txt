Quaint little place! Milk & Honey offers some delectable breakfast options. I stopped here during the Renegade Art fair in Wicker Park, and was pleasantly surprised. The food was cheap (around $6-$10) for your standard breakfast (waffles, eggs, etc.) and was really, really good. I had the huevos rancheros (which were baked and topped with a cheesy/tortilla crust) and to die for! My friends had a salad and waffles - both of which also looked great. Although the food is very good (and very reasonably priced), the menu was very limited. The service was also mediocre. You order/pay at the register prior to eating - and once you sit down that's it. Good luck getting water, etc. I'd definitely come back with friends for an cute, easy breakfast - but wouldn't take guests here due to the lack of service and pressure to leave as soon as you're finished eating.
