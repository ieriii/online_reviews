Great place for pizza! The service is friendly, fast and knowledgeable. While dawdling after our amazing meal, the super friendly restaurant owner stopped by our table and offered us a free shot of some Italian sweet liquor to turn the table over quicker. We got up, had the shot outside and jeesh, it was well worth it. This is great place to take those picky pizza people and not a bad place for a date either. The specials are always new and interesting. The wine selection is a little above average. And, I'd be amiss not to mention their great desserts - definitely worth keeping a little room for even if you share.
