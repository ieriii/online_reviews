A lot has already been said about Alinea so I'll just add some highlights of the 5 star meal: * I had a lot of trouble getting a Friday night table for the weekend that my wife and I were going to be in Chicago but finally was able to secure a table the day before. My recommendation to get a table: get on the waiting list for your desired time and call 24 hours before to see if there have been any cancellations. Worked for me. * Food was fun, fantastic, and beautiful. There are only 2 menus, the 12 course Tasting ($125) and the 24 course Tour ($175). Very expensive, yes, but worth it (in my mind) for a truly unique dining experience.  If you're in from out of town like we were, I recommend springing for the Tour. If you get the Tasting, you may see some great looking dishes being brought to other tables that you won't get on the Tasting. * If you're on the Tour, don't eat any bread. You will barely be able to finish all the food in the Tour itself. Trust me on this. * The Sommelier poured us some great wine to drink with our meal but it was *extremely* expensive so be careful if you're trying to keep your meal cost out of the stratosphere. I'm talking $22 a glass! * Service is some of the best I've ever experienced. * As you can read in the other reviews, the food here comes in very novel and strange presentations with unusual combinations of tastes - but it's all great. Make sure to come with an open mind and you'll really be in for a treat. * Very cool entryway and door to the restaurant - but sort of unmarked so don't be confused. Cool interior. * They give you a printed menu to take home with you after the meal, which is helpful for remembering what you ate (24 courses is a lot). You can also take pictures with your camera or camera phone if you want to. In summary: I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!
