The location is the best thing going for the Allerton. It's right across from the Apple store and a block from the Garmin store. A veritable nerd's delight. I was there for a training seminar and had a discount rate of around $200 a night, which I felt was reasonable for the level of luxury this hotel offers. I noticed the web rate is like $400-500 a night, which would have been a travesty. I would say this is a 3 star hotel. The entire hotel is small in stature. The rooms are very small. Being one person I thought I would be fine but I noticed I was bumping into things and stepping on things on the floor all the time. Now I know how small animals feel in a cage. The lobby is very small as well, and finally to punctuate the smallness of it all, the elevators were miniature and could maybe hold 4 people comfortably. The rooms are fairly new decor wise. The bathroom was decorated nicely but the area around the shower was starting to show its age in terms of dirty grout and stains. The staff is fairly friendly and the front desk was very fast with the check in and check out. The bellhop was fairly overwhelmed in the late afternoon with the bag check and took a bit of time to get your bags. Would I stay here again? For $200 yes. Anything higher and you'd be better off at the Embassy Suites or Courtyard.
