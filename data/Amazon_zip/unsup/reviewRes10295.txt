Loved this place up to my main course. My wife and our friends enjoyed their main course but I had the "chicken under a brick" and it had no seasoning and was lukewarm.  I literally was looking around for some ketchup to put on this dish. I will go back simply because the patio is one of the best patios I've ever been to in Chicago! I could go four stars just for that, but I think the food needs to be better. When I go back I will skip the main course.
