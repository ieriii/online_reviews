Let me first say that I'm used to staying at mosquito infested dumps on the Mekong delta, and hostels filled with drunk Canadians crashing in at 4 in the morning... so I may be a bit unqualified to rate a place as nice as the Avenue, but I'll be damned if I don't try. As far as bang for your buck goes, I was blown away by this hotel. The staff was friendly, and the rooms were relatively cheap, but still enormous. The standard king sized room that I stayed in had a couch, and a work desk on top of other standards like lounge chairs and TVs. There was a rooftop bar and pool that were a great way to end a relaxing day exploring Chicago. Even for someone used to traveling on a budget, the Avenue doesn't come close to breaking the bank. This place is a great deal, and you get a heck of a lot for your hard earned dough.
