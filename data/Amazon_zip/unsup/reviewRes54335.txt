So against my will i went to try them again (girlfriends idea), she said we should order ahead so when we walk the 5 mins it takes to cross the street it will be there, and we can enjoy lunch and not spend most of it starving. Ok, so at 11:55am i call them and tell them i want to place an order, extra cheese caramelized crust, simple. I ask how long will it take to make it, she says approx 25-30 mins, ok so i tell her i work right across the street and i will walk over there at 12:25. everything seems to be going good, I'm in high hopes. Arrive there, everyone was friendly, seated in a corner booth, for more than 2, not the one we wanted but ill take it. So after saying multiple times that i ordered ahead, they finally understand. so here comes 11:50 roughly 20 mins after we were seated, almost an hour from when i placed the order and no food. I give my gf a snared look and told her she better be the one to ask whats going on, so to put this shortly, my gf asked the hostess why it took so long for our pizza to get there even though we ordered ahead of time. She said they don't make it until people are seated that way if they don't arrive at the time they say the pizza wont be cold, we told her that whoever we talked to on the phone was told we are across the street and will walk over at that time. She then said she would talk to the girl who answers the phone, we both thought ok, makes sense they want to bring out a nice hot, fresh pizza. We bite into the pizza..... and its luke warm!!! REALLY?!?! And i know its not their fault, but there was a nat flying around us the whole time and it just didn't help the whole situation. Second thought, that is their fault!!! So i tried walking in and ordering took 45 mins, 2nd time i order ahead and it took just as long. Once against great pizza ruined by bad service ;-/
