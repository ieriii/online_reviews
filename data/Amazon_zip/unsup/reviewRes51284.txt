TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I really hate to rate this place a one star restaurant, especially since the food is very good. But the service I have received on my past two visits has been so terrible that I doubt I will return. Today, I went in with a friend around 4:30. It took the waitress around 10 minutes to come and take our order. We ordered two margaritas and two orders of tacos. The drinks arrived within 5 minutes, but the tacos never came out. We waited and waited and waited...all while watching 8 (I counted) members of the crew standing around. After almost 30 minutes of waiting (really...how long does it take to make a taco?), I flagged down a table server (our waitress never returned to check on us) and told her we were leaving and needed the check for the drinks. I mentioned how long we were waiting and we couldn't stay any longer to eat the tacos. She walked away and I saw her talk to the manager...and then they both went about their business and started carrying out food to other tables. We threw down cash for the drinks and bolted out the door ... never getting a check! The previous visit was just about the same.... different waitress, but just as inept and rude. We ordered drinks that never arrived... she totally disappeared and we actually had to go up to the bar and get them ourselves. Not sure what is going on with this place, but I went from being a big fan to not wanting to ever return. While the food is great, I would suggest spending your money at a restaurant that actually cares about service and treating its patrons with respect.
