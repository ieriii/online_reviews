In general I am disappointed by the food here. Covering bad cooking with bacon doesn't magically make it good. Also, the waitress practically sat on our table when she was talking to us. My advice: - Get a burger or a basic appetizer - Avoid any dishes that require culinary skill - Drink lots of beer
