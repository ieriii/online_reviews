What a beautiful hotel. Girls night out, and we chose this hotel for many reasons but convience is main one. While checking in, we got ice cream! Our rooms were spacious and roomy. Bathroom a bit small, but what did you want for an old hotel. On the executive floor on 23, lots of tables to mill about, we liked that we could spread out. We brougth caviar and spread with our own wines and enjoyed pre dinner festivities. I guess we didnt need get all that we did because the appetizers would have been fine iwth our caviar!!!
