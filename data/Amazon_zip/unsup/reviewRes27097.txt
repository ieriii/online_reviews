One word.....DIS-GUS-TING!!!!! I've read multiple reviews about this place, and have heard people constantly talking about it saying it is amazing. I just don't get it. Just because the waitstaff are rude and obnoxious, the hostess pretends you need a reservation even though the restaurant is always 90% empty, or that you end up paying at least a $100 a person doesn't make this place GOOD!!! The cocktails are over priced, and watered down. The risotto appetizer was tasteless and boring. The swordfish entree tasted like some overdone wedding meal. The duck entree was literally inedible. It was so tough that I could not cut it with the knife at the table, I had to actually ask for another utensil. Also it should be noted the only other thing on the plate was one brussel sprout cut into 4 pieces, thats it. Lastly, we ordered the pumpkin creme brulee and the reconstructed snickers bar. Umm how can a supposedly high end restaurant dare serve creme brulee straight from the freezer?? No burnt sugar crunching on top, just sloppy runny old pre-burnt then frozen top. HORRIBLE. And the snickers bar was something a 5th grader could have concocted in home ec. This place is seriously a joke. After experiencing such a disgusting array of foods, I went back to some of the people that raved about GE and found that really not one person had actually been there. Its just sad that because of the GE name, people are putting this place up on a pedestal. Hopefully reality will hit soon, and this place will be seen for what it is, a total rip-off!!!
