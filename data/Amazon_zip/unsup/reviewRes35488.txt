My husband and I went to Shaw's last winter (2007). Since we had Lettuce Entertain You gift certificates, we went all out. We ordered two different kinds of fish (grouper and something else) - both were incredible. The fish wasn't too fatty or undercooked. We're both very picky with fish (he hates "fishy" smell) - we didn't have a single complaint. The service was incredible and we didn't have to wait to be seated (we had reservations). If you have some extra money burning a hole in your pocket, I'd recommend spending it here.
