This place used to be a favorite and a top recommendation, but my last meal was very disappointing. I've been here 5-6 times and always looked forward to their mussels. In the past, they were to die for - fat and juicy - big as my thumb - in a fabulous broth that was subtle enough not to overpower the shellfish, but so tasty that you'd want to sop up every last drop with the fabulous crusty bread. Sadly, the mussels were puny and the broth was was so salty as to be inedible (and I like salt!). Boudin Blanc was tasty but the Potee was just OK. The great food in the past made me overlook the fact that the restaurant is uncomfortably warm. Maybe an off night but it left me feeling - Meh.
