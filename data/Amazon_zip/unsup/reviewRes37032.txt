Minus 1 -star because recent reviews show that things might have turned awful since I was last there. I guess this will be a testament to its former glory and perhaps a vision; i hope there isn't really a lack of quality these days. that said.. I MISS this place!! First of all, it is both a fancy market and a cafe so I discuss them interchangeably.. I used to ride my bike here for soy lattes, little treats and meals to go from the cafe. Ok and whose kidding, total splurges so I could make lavish meals for my sis and me. If you can get there and get a nice table by the window then its lovely to stay and eat as well. But my favorite picks in this gourmet shop are the coffees and all the condiments, sweets and meats you could find in this store and no where else. Honestly, I took for granted that I once lived less than a mile from this fine establishment. Ok here's the facts.. Diverse and fine selection of: - fresh fish - mustards - olive oils - chocolates (well, certainly not the only spot in town for this though!) - bakery! breads, chocolates, cookies, little cakes, big cakes, the perfect spot to pick up a little something special to bring for all occasions/ parties I am sure there are many more attributes to this expensive gem of a shop; I say what I know. If you like the things I list above, and like the *best* of the things I list above (think: Robb Report), try this shop before pouring love and creativity into your next culinary adventure from the kitchen. If you want to take your expectations and pocket book up a level, go here. Or just check it out, grab a coffee and a brownie to go and stroll along to NavyPier or along the riverwalk (if your tourist ass can figure out how to get there). It's such a confusing part of town. . yet so magical. Oh memories. . and soy lattes. Mmmm
