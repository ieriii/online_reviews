I absolutely love this place! I've been to a few Italian restaurants in the city but this one is my favorite...not to mention BYOB with no corkage fee! I always bring visiting friends and family here for dinner. the portions are huge so if you can find someone to share...you should. Unless of course, you want leftovers! I always order the half-moon pasta with tomato cream sauce, the calamari, or the linguine with lots-o-seafood and a garlic/olive oil sauce...not necessarily in that order! :)  The wait can be long on the weekends but is 100% worth it. I love the waitstaff, too! Trying this restaurant is a must!
