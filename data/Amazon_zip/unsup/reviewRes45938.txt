Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I know it's a "chain restaurant" but when something's good, it's good, and really that's all that matters. I come here often for lunch, both for work and with friends, and I have never been disappointed. The portions are huge, the food is always very fresh and well-prepared, the desserts are amazing, and the waitstaff has always been incredibly friendly and attentive. The dining room is beautifully decorated and hello, can you get a better view of Michigan Ave?? Their menu is huge, but I highly recommend the salads (the Seafood Salad and Polynesian are my faves), the Miso Salmon, and for any vegetarians their Mushroom 'veggie' burger is phenomenal. I doubt that any of their desserts disappoint but the beignets and chocolate fudge cake are two of my faves. Just make sure you go to the Grand Lux with an empty stomach! New side note: You must must must try the caramel apple martini if you come here for dinner, it's amazing!!!
