I really liked this place! We actually came here with a group for my birthday (reservations made weeks in advance). Tapas are one of my favorites...I really like trying a little bit of everything and this is the best way to try a variety of items. We ordered about 2-3 tapas per person and we were all fine - just ful enough. We got dessert for free (b-day treat) and didn't bother with after dinner drinks. I feel like you can't go wrong with anything they have on the menu. Everyone raves about pretty much the same stuff, so just go and order whatever sounds/looks good to you! The service was good and its fun to people watch as well.
