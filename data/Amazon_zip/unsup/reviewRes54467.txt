Ive been eating here for 2 years now, and I've moved on from vegetarian fare, to vegan fare, & now to RAW vegan fare! yesss, I've evolved! haha. loving the raw vegan options, seems to grow/change every time i stop by. absolutely LOVE their raw vegan desserts!!! yummy & guilt free! gotta give the raw vegan fare a try ! thing is, it ain't too cheap :c
