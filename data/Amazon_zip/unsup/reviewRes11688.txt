What is all the hype about? This place was mediocre at best. AND it's pizza folks....Plain ol' pizza. The beer was good, I'll say that. The food and service were also decent. The music was WAY too loud. The wait was FAR too long. And didn't the book of ethics ban tables within 2 feet of the bathroom entrance - disgusting!! Won't return, but can't say it was a complete bust.
