The food was great I'd definitly recommend this place, nice decour good service and the place was packed. I had the chopped chicken and irish white chedder salad, perfect amount of dressing and a good size. My fiance had the salmon club, good size peice of fish and it looked awesome, which she said it was. My drink never reached empty the waitstaff was on point.
