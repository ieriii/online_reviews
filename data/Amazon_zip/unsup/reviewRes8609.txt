I can't imagine why this place gets such rave reviews. I've been meaning to try this place for a long time and now that I've gone, I wish I hadn't. I love italian style pizza and have had pizza in Italy. Like others have mentioned, it's a bit pricey for what you're getting. The pizza's were both soggy in the middle, the red sauce tasted like pureed tomatoes with absolutely no seasoning, the mushrooms on the Funghi Siliccia pizza were suspiciously similar in flavor and texture to canned mushrooms, and the Biano Nero pizza smelled like truffles but didn't taste like them and overall was very bland.  This place really doesn't have much of an atmosphere, very beige with cold decor, again, not at all what I had hoped for. Two beers, an appetizer and two pizza's cost $55 plus tip. It was just really disappointing overall, won't be back. On a positive note, our server Christopher was very nice and gave us good service.
