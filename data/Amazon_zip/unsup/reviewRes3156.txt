Hands down one of the best chicken places in chicago. The chicken is basically korean bonchon. I'd recommend the seoul sassy flavor with the wings. I have never been able to finish 10 wings.... Which gives you an ideal about the size of the wings they give you. Also their budda bowls are delicious. I'd highly recommended it. Seating is limited and it can get packed in the small store. This is a must try!!
