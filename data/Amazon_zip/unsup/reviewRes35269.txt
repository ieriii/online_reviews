My Gawd! Two oyster outings in one day is just about too much for this girl to handle. But after a hot jaunt on the Wendella Boat Tour on a gorgeous and sunny Chicago afternoon, oysters and cold beer are just what I needed! We ordered a 1/2 dozen Fanny Bays and 1/2 dozen Hama Hamas. Two of my FAVS! Then we had this super lightly fried Cajun shrimp appetizer dish. Both were washed down with two ice cold Samuel Adam Lights. What?! I needed to have something light after all of the gorging on yummy food I had done all weekend. I seriously loved this place. The atmosphere is great. There is a huge fresh oyster bar right in the middle of the room and quotes from Hemingway and other authors posted all around the walls. Cute and fun! And the oysters are phenomenal! I was one happy girl. :)
