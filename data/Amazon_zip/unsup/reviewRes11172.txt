Don't know what all of the fuss is about. I went here with a group of five on a Friday night. We had to wait an hour. We then waited another how for very average thin crust. It was REALLY noisy, hard to hear anything. Valet was expensive. The pizzas were exceptionally big but almost too big. It made it claustrophobic because they put the pizza on these taller platforms. Strange. Anyway, if I'm looking for pizza, I'm just much happier heading to Pequod's.
