Bad Apple is a great spot on Lincoln. I had the Elvis burger....the one with the peanut butter (homemade right there) and it was really good! All four of us got different burgers and everyone loved them not to mention the truffle fries too. Another plus about this place is the beer selection...if you like beers and you like burgers, then this place is for you. Highly recommend.
