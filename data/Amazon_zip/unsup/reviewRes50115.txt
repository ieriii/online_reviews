the experience our group had at las tablas was pretty amazing! we dined on a saturday night around 8pm and it was crowded! were told we had an hour wait so we had bevvies at the bar. about 35 mins later we were seated. our wonderful repast consisted of two orders of the combination empanadas, the combination order of their delictable entrana steak and pollo but also added the langostinos in that marvelous garlic-white wine marinade. i really almost hurt myself with this dinner! had i, it would have been worth the hurt! we''ll be back soon!
