This is unlike any dining experience that I've ever had. Extremely sophisticated food in an extremely unsophisticated environment. It was also one the best dining experiences that I've ever had. The food is probably just below that of Alinea and I didn't have to wear a suit to enjoy it. I love the BYOB, it was also pretty cool of them to serve us a small glass of chef's Alpha King with one of the course's. Even the music was great, I don't think there's another restaurant where you could have a course like quail egg ravioli while Queens of the Stone Age is playing in the background. Just go for chrissakes!
