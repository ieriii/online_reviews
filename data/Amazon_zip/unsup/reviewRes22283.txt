I've heard great things about Irazu, so I was excited to try it out myself! My group and I started out with the guacamole and vegetarian chiifrijo. The chifrijo was delicious! It was great on its own, but even better with a bit of the spicy salsa, yum! The apps were so filling that my girlfriends and I got a couple of entres to share. My favorite was the steak El Tico. It was different and delicious. The gallo pinto was much better and fun than traditional rice. The entres came with a variety of side dishes, and we had tons of leftovers. Don't forget to bring cash (cash only), and some delicious beverages. Shout out to Justin!
