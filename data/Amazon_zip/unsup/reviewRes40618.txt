Thought to self -- why have I been reviewing so many late-night drunk joints recently? Oh well. Up next is La Pasadita. If you've gone to any club/bar/lounge/sat on the curb around Milwaukee and Damen, you've probably heard of, or gone to, La Pasadita. If you drive a two-door BMW and your car was damaged while parked in the La Pasadita lot around 2 am last summer, that was my boy Kevin who hit you. I don't think it was alcohol induced though. Just another frantic person pulling up like a bat out of hell to grab a few La Pasadita tacos. PS - Contact me for his insurance info. La Pasadita is good. But its not so good you need to go 30 mph through their parking lot to place your order. Once inside, expect enough seating to accomodate about 10 people (at the counter), and everyone else stands and waits for their order. I usually get steak tacos, and the guy who makes them does so with the speed of Usain Bolt. He then, literally, throws them in the microwave to warm them, and off you go. While I like the tacos because they are well seasoned and the salsa is good, I'm not really a fan of my food being heated in the microwave, as opposed to being warmed the traditional way (grill, etc). The menu is limited. The tacos are a safe bet of the options, but I think you can definitely get much better in Chicago. Saying they have the best tacos in town is drunken rememberance at work. But late night, La Pasadita is toward the top of the list of mexican food options. Good talk.
