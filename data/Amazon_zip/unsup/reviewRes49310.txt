Sean- you are the best waiter I've had in a long time. The recs on cheese and wine were great, and we weren't surprised with the most expensive wine on the menu. You have a great sense of humor and we never felt like we should leave (even when we were the last table in the room during dinner).  The food was outstanding, and so delicious. I wish I could try every single cheese and wine on the menu. And the donut holes, a great ending. Next time, it will be the chocolate desserts! I love the manager at this place! i could have pulled up a chair at the bar and chatted with him for hours. Such an interesting and nice guy!! Wonder if I can get him to sit with me and my family when we go back on our next vacation.... he's so cool!
