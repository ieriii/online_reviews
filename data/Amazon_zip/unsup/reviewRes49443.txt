Bin 36 - great, crisp atmosphere, light great food & fantastic cheese & wine menu. The waiters I've had when I've dined there have been extremely knowledgable about each wine bottle & the menu - Bin 36 is a great place for meeting up with friends or going on a romantic dinner! If you don't want to commit to a wine bottle, have a flight - they are reasonably priced and you just might find your new fav bottle! Bin 36 is also a great place for brunch - while the menu is not extensive, I was with a group of 7 who each loveeeed their brunch meal - yummy yummy!
