Classy and leisurely brunch spot - Came here with a friend on a Saturday around 1:30 for brunch. The restaurant has a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere with a subtle Southern vibe to match the style of the menu. We had a reservation and were seated right away - not sure that we needed the reservation, but the place was almost completely full the whole time we were there. We shared two delectable entrees and a side of fried plantains, and each got a Bloody Mary.  - Eggs New Orleans - Basically, eggs benedict with a unique crab cake twist; I would have preferred a bit less crab - the flavor overwhelmed the overall dish I felt - but crab isn't generally my first choice to order, either; we cleaned off the plate though, so all-in-all, solid dish  - Bacon & Swiss omelet - Straightforward ingredients, but very nicely put together, this entree was very good; comes with awesome grits.  - Bloody Mary - nice and spicy!  - Side of fried plantains - My favorite part of the meal; light and crisp breading and served with a fruity dipping sauce In general, Big Jones seems to cater to a more mature crowd for brunch at least - lots of tables of what appeared to be groups of old friends and couples out for a long, leisurely brunch.
