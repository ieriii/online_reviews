This spot is about 2 blocks from my new place so me and the b/f checked it out on a Saturday night around 8. There was a 35 minute wait for a table, but we got right in at the sushi bar. Nice atmosphere and lots of happening people.  We had an awesome crab cake with yummy ginger sauce for an appetizer and 3 orders of maki, (the maine, the ceviche and the spicy tuna). The rolls were good, nice flavor combos, but not really highlighting the fish as good as they could. Someone else said that most of the maki have mayo - which is true, but I'm okay with that. We also had fruit and chocolate for dessert, which was pretty straightforward. We received great service from our waitress, who was very fast, friendly and accommodating.  I felt like I didn't get much for my money though. The maki are the same size as a store bought rolls, even the "special" maki came out with less than 5 rolls to the order. When we got the bill the appetizer was $17 for 4 crab cakes (what?!). Kind of pricey (and this is coming from someone who eats sushi at least once a week, so I am familiar with pricey sushi).  I gave this place a 4 because the food we did have was good, but it still doesn't beat out wakamono in lakeview (the place by which I rate all other sushi bars. We will likely go back in the next few months due to the location and good service.
