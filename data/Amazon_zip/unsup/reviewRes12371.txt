Ok - I live in Chicago and I don't care for deep dish pizza - too doughy and heavy for my tastes. I was raised in New England on "New York style pizza" (thin crust, preferably soft enough to be able to fold over, and ideally, just a little bit but not sloppily greasy). After being in Chicago a few years I was going nuts, jonesing for some good ol' NY-style pizza instead of deep dish or crispy-thin pizza! After asking around a bit, a friend recommended Piece. "That's where one of the guys from The Real World - Chicago worked," she added helpfully. Ok, so I could care less about The Real World tv show, too; I just wanted some good ol' NY-style pie! A friend and I headed over on a Tuesday night. Even though it was pouring outside, the place was packed. Service was very good; my only complaint would be that the accoustics were bad so it was incredibly noisy inside, and it made it hard to converse. But, oh!, the pizza! As an East coast transplant, I have to say that this may be some of the best thin-crust pizza I've had! I think they call it "New Haven style" - I'm honestly not sure how that differs any from NY style. To wash it all down, order one of their own-brewed beers - and if you like the beer, you can take a "growler" of any of their 7 microbrews to go. I'd give them 5 stars, but had to knock off for the volume of noise. Located just 2 blocks east of the blue line L Damen stop. Kareoke Thursdays at 9; Live Band Kareoke Saturdays at 11pm. They're open til 2am daily except Saturday (3am), but the kitchen stops serving around 10:30-11:30 depending on the night. http://www.piecechicago.
