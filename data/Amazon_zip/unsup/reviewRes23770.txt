Maybe my favorite restaurant in the city. Among the Sichuanese specialties I heartily recommend the cold beef and maw appetizer (fuqi feipian), the water boiled beef (shui zhu rou), cumin-spiced lamb, the hot pot, the Chengdu dumplings, and the lalala chicken. Delivery is a little expensive but portions are larger than in the restaurant.
