I've been to this place a bunch of times with varying experiences. This is a gastropub, in the true sense of the term. And I LOVE gastropubs. I have had really good food here (chopped salad) and not so good food (chicken pot pie), so that's how I end up at a three. They have good beer selection, though nothing out of the ordinary really, and the atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Other people have said it, but somehow this place manages to be spacious and cozy all at the same time. It's a fine place to grab a meal or hang out for a bit, but it's nothing particularly special.
