This is probably by far the BEST pizza I have ever had in my life. Thanks to my Chicago-born friend Kasey for introducing me to the amazing thick and cheesy creation that is Giordano's pizza. Just wish they would expand to say mmhhmm North Carolina? Too much to ask? Seriously missing pizza like this down here. One - Two slices is enough to fill you up for sure, because this pizza is not only heavy on your stomach, but literally heavy as well. I would know after carrying two pizzas through the airport and onto a plane from Chicago to Baltimore. So worth though knowing my family would get to experience a Chicago tradition too.
