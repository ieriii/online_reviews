It is hard to find bakeries with such variety of cakes, cookies Everything is delicious. I love their coffees, especially the Frappuccino in the summers. My favorite are the almond cookies also like the strawberry shortcake. I've been going there for a lunches and sometimes I come with friends on the weekends. I love their food: spanakopitas, artopitas, salads, and moussakas
