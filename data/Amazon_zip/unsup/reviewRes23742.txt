I don't claim to be particularly versed in the cuisine of Costa Rica, but eating at Irazu can definitely make one feel as if they are soaking up a genuine experience. The place itself is nothing special (it's probably an old filling station), but they have made the most of the outdoor patio space, adding at least one new built in table, or stool, or umbrella concept nearly ever summer the last few years. This food has soul. You can feel the love cooked into this food just as it probably has been for many, many years by someone's grandma from back home. The beans and rice are probably the tastiest I've ever had. The portions are huge, and they know how to get the foodies happy with a fried egg on top. Shakes are great too. Go here on a weeknight in the summer for best results.
