This is where you find the best drinks in the entire city, coolest bar tenders and the people you want to know. VERY pretentious, but if that's what you're looking for-THIS IS THE PLACE! Whether you want to show off to your friends or your date, or just care a lot about making a good drink--this place is for you. Very hard to find unless you know what you're looking for. It's a grey building with wooden siding; siding even extends over the front door. There are no signs, only thing you can look for is a line out front if it's past 10pm. Definitely make sure you know where you are going before you take people there, otherwise the "cool" factor you get by knowing about this place goes away. Once you've found it, rules are as follows: All coats must be checked, cell phone use is strictly prohibited and no one can stand--there must be a seat for your entire group otherwise you'll be left waiting out front for a space to open up. So get there early. If you go after 10pm you'll be waiting. Once inside, you can either sit at the bar or at tables with VERY high backed chairs. This creates a private experience for your group...thus a reason this would be good for a date. The menu is full of experimental drinks including some made with egg yolks--as nasty as that may sound, they are actually quite good. They triple filter all their water, have 6 or more different sized and shaped ice cubes to fit in specific glasses and only the freshest fruits to mix in your drink...don't go ordering your whiskey and Coke here. a.) they won't make it for you and b.) you'll look like a fool. All that said, the slightly more expensive drinks are well worth it. Not only for the fact you get to show off that you know about this classy "speak-easy" but the drinks and other people who hang out here are awesome.
