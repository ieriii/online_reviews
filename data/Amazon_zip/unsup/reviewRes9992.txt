The management is awesome here, everything from the hostess, our server, and the experience was impeccable! the food..........always AMAZING. I forgot what toppings we had on our pizza after a few jameson shots and camel toes. but we had every kind of meat thrown on there and veggies never tasted so good. amazingggg agian! the spinach cheese dip with dorritos chips was brilliant! It had the right amount of saltiness for the cheese dip. i'll be back here whenever i come back to visit chicago, till then!
