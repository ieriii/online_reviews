Went here last night on a double date with our friends. It was awesome! All the food was just delectable. We tried the scallop with bacon appetizer, crab rangoon and several maki rolls. The crocodile roll was the table favorite. Everything was amazing. The service was great too - we called to make a reservation and even though we were more than 15 minutes late, they kept our fabulous table with super comfy chairs in the red room. Such a great experience. And not too expensive at all for sushi.
