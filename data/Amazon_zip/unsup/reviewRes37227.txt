Hit or miss gourmet-esque grocery store. The store itself is not very large, so selection can be a bit limited on some things. They have good produce (though limited), good meat (Tallgrass beef), and a great cheese department. Outside of that, they carry pretty much gourmet specialty type products on the rest of their shelves. Given the upscale vibe they put off, some of their products lack in quality.  The straw that made me walk out empty the other day was their ketchup--or lack of ketchup selection. They have 3 different kinds of regular Heinz ketchup--all which contain high fructose corn syrup.... Heinz does make an organic HFCS-free ketchup, and it's not expensive.. Why don't they stock that? Lame. Instead, the only other option is an $9 jar of "country ketchup" ...Which I'm sure is good, but sometimes you just want regular ketchup, ya know? ... Whole Foods doesn't even carry the HFCS version of Heinz anymore, and their organic ketchups are still cheaper than F&O's non.  As far as the selection of other gourmet items (canned, etc), whole foods has a wider selection on most things... What annoyed me even more than their lack of selection was their lack of staff. I walked around for a good 8 minutes trying to find someone to ask if they carried anything else, I ended up finding nobody and talked to the coffee guy instead.
