This is my all-time favorite pizza place in the WORLD. (and I'm quite the pizza connoiseur!) It also becomes everyone's favorite place once they try it! (ask any of the 8 people I have brought there!) I don't know what I will do for stuffed pizza if I ever move away from Chicago, because there is no way anyone else can compare to their perfectly sweet sauce and doughy, tasty crust. I completely agree with the guy who said that this pizza gives him a mouthgasm (fabulous expression!) :-)
