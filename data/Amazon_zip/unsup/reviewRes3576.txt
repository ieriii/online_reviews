Was first introduced to Bonchon in when I visited New York last year and absolutely fell in love with the Korean fried chicken/chicken wings. Crisp is definitely a solid alternative that is available in Chicago, even though I know it's unfair to directly compare the two restaurants. This place is also quickly becoming one of the favorite places for my friends and I to meet up during the weekdays to recap our questionable antics from the previous weekends. I personally enjoy the original flavor more as the crip bbq or the seoul sassy are both a bit on the sweet side for me. Tried the 10 piece wings for the first time during my last visit and the portion was definitely much bigger than I expected. I do have to give a special shout-out to the manager for giving me the wings anyway despite the fact that I was 2 dollars short in cash (only had a $10 in my wallet at the time). Undoubtedly earned an extra star in my book!
