Is it a sports bar? a brewery? Or is it a pizzeria? Well, in the age of conglomeration, the owners have hit on a real winner: its all three. Well, 2 out of 3. Talk about a risk-free business plan. Starting with the pizza. You can't go wrong here, and it really is a standout pizzeria in a competitive field. Not the best, but certainly unique in its own right. I've sampled a variety of their pizza options and all come through with smiles. I love the presentation - a metal stand balancing the pizza on a baking pan.  Moving on to the beer, I was rolling my eyes on approach. I mean, is this a cute side-project for Piece? Actually, the beer is exceptionally good. This is award-winning beer with real body and taste. So they have expertise in pizza-making, beer craftsmanship...and now this sports bar atmosphere? Well, despite the TV's and proclamations to "watch the games here"...I would advise against it. The place is far too popular, too noisy to make sense of watching any game. Expect to receive some elbows and the feeling of people breathing on you as they try to maneuver around an atmosphere as crowded as O'Hare on the holidays. You have to be aggressive and sometimes lose civility to fight your way to a seat at the bar. And occasionally (though seems more often than not) you will encounter a horrid collection of karaoke singers on stage - seizing the moment in a packed bar to embarrass oneself and add to the decibel. Slight disgruntlement aside, I do love this place and don't frequent it enough. Whenever I do, I marvel at how it is always packed. What a successful operation! Perhaps they print money too...
