I had been highly anticipating Piccolo Sogno, and when the time came, my expectations were met. The ravioli was probably the best I have ever had, bar none. And the wine pours were very liberal and appreciated. Service was fantastic, and the waiter was very helpful in making a first-time diner get the jist of the place. I'm looking forward to coming back, as this place easily landed on my short list of best Italian spots in Chicago.
