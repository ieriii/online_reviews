I seriously wonder what's wrong with people, reading all the glowing reviews of Sun-Wah and seeing how crowded it was tonight. The meal I just had there qualifies without hesitation as one of the most disgusting restaurant experiences in my entire life. The ambiance is awful, the service atrocious - rude, slow and unattentive - and the food (fried wontons and the bbq combination platter) was so bad, I've eaten better in school cafeterias. The appetizer was fatty, doughy and utterly flavorless, only edible slathered with generous amounts of soy sauce. The main course arrived very late and was obviously heated and reheated many times over, but still served cold, rubbery and hardened. Every single mouthful of so-called food had bits of bone, cartilege, sinews and fat and that goes for the rice as well. It was actually as if somebody had deliberately mixed the rice with bone shards, and cut the meat with a chain saw. Granted, prices here are affordable and servings generous - but are those really the only redeeming factors? There are so many many restaurants that are so vastly superior in the neighbourhood, I don't understand the appeal of Sun-Wah at all.
