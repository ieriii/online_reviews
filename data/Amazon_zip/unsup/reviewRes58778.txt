We have been to Opart Thai four times. The first two times they fooled us. Food was actually pretty good and service was fair. The third time, food was terrible and service was terrible. Finally, went again yesterday to give them another try. It will be the last. First when we were seated, we were seated in the worst location. In the corner by the front door. There were multiple open seating and when asked about an alternative, the person seating us stated we have that one (pointing over to a great table in front of the windows), but he states I will have to clean it first and then paused without offering to do that. It was clear he was not planning on cleaning the table. We were then seated at the bad location, when we then spotted a cockroach crawling on the ledge right behind my head. I told one of the staff and she quickly took care of it without saying anything to us. We stayed at the table a bit longer, but already the night had been ruined. Then one of our guests stated that every time the front door opened his chair moved. That was it! We left the restaurant. I also noted that in the 15 minutes that all of this transpired, two tables had not been cleaned, likely the root of the cockroach infestation. Trust me, they have been reported.
