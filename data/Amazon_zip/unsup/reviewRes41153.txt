I am a huge Pho fan and always get the specials at every joint I visit. Went to Tank last winter after reading reviews and seeing how packed it was all the time I thought it had to be good. I was very disappointed. Portions were tiny (gf had a fried noodle dish) and my Pho broth was plain and tasted a little flowery/soapy. The Pho had very little noodles in the big bowl of crappy broth. I had to suck it up and load up on the hoisen sauce and lime. There are plenty of better Pho places in Argyle that I'll have to review later. Never again.
