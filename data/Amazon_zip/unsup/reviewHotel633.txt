My daughter and I stayed here on Tuesday night while in town visiting another daughter who is moving to DeKalb with her husband. The Doubletree had a great special mid-week price of $90. The hotel room was clean and had a lot of extra amenities -- such as Neutragena SPF face cream and cleanser along with the usual shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. Also, you are greeted upon checkin with warm, fresh chocolate chip cookies. Didn't try the workout room, but it looked very adequate. The hotel staff is friendly and anxious to please. The parking was expensive - $41 for about 24 hours - but that is expected in Chicago.
