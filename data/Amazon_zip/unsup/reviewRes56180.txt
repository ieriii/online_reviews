I am a frequent patron of Icosium Kafe. It goes without saying that the food is fantastic - read any of the other reviews to confirm that (my favorite is the Chicago crepe- and the vegetable soup is the best I've ever tasted). But what really keeps me coming back to this restaurant time and time again is the service. The staff is small, so over time the faces become familiar, and I am immediately greeted when I come into the restaurant. I feel like I'm eating with family.So imagine my surprise on Saturday morning when my meal was interrupted with shouting and swearing. I looked up to see what I assume was a manager, feet away from my table and in plain view of the entire restaurant, yelling in my server and swearing at her. He was accusing her of neglecting her tables. I can't speak for all her tables, and I obviously don't have all the information, but I can attest that she provided my table with impeccable, friendly service. Even if she had been neglecting tables, it was completely inappropriate for him to yell at her and use such strong language (I am not exaggerating when I say that he used the f-word over a dozen times), especially in front of her guests. It was infuriating. Thankfully I know that such behavior is not typical of Icosium, but I would be shocked if any first-timers in the restaurant that day ever returned. Who wants to eat at a restaurant where the servers are verbally abused?I don't mean to take up so much space detailing this event. I just hope that someone from the restaurant reads this and stands up for our outstanding server. I've been served by all of Icosium's servers, and have always been delighted. So, if the owners or other managers from Icosium read this, please know that your customers love your servers - they're what keep us coming back. Treat them with the respect they deserve!
