Embassy Suites is always perfect for families. The suites are large enough - two full beds in one room, and a pull-out in the other (yeah - you'll need a back re-alignment in the morning). Microwave and fridge included. They have a managers reception (read free beer/wine) downstairs in the lobby, but it never really appealed to me - lines seemed way too long - no thanks. The cook-to-order breakfasts are a big hit with the kids and easy on the wallet (included).  It gets fairly crowded so you should probably get down there early (8-9 am). The pool is small and heavily chlorinated - so take advantage of the free skin exfoliation. Kids loved it, and if the kids are happy . . . .dads happy. Location is great - especially if you want to walk along Michigan avenue pre-Christmas. Navy Pier is also just a couple blocks a way. Careful when ya travel - especially around holidays and breaks - during these periods make no mistake about it - this is a FAMILY hotel. If you go expecting a nice, romantic, quiet evening - you will be disappointed. It's wide open and loud, and kids are everywhere. That can be good or bad depending on your status.  For us, it's perfect for travelling with kids.
