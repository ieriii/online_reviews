I think this place is pretty much awesome. Where to begin.... The decor is pretty neat; very colorful, fun. The bathroom has the longest row of stalls I have ever seen...I don't know why this is so fascinating BUT they are clean too. The raspberry mojito is amazing. I actually always hope to be seated a little late so I can have more time to get one in my system. The food is great! I've gotten the paella and every other time have gone with the steak. The guacamole and empanadas are so fresh tasting and the fried plantains are addicting. Overall, I have never had a bad experience at this place. Each time I have left wanting more!
