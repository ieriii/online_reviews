Food was great. Wait was about twenty mins on Friday night, but flew by with a cocktail. Be aware that while the food is reasonably priced, the beer is more than you might expect. My 22 oz Goose Island Sofie, which is about seven bucks at Whole Foods, was $15 at XOCO. Thanks for staying in town, Rick! We'll definitely be back.
