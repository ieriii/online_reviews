We went here last Monday, a weekday, so we get there, they said 15 min or we can sit at a communal table, so we sat at the communal table, we were the only ones at the table so that worked out not that I minded if anyone sat next to us...so the waitress comes over tells us they are out of the one salad, which actually sounded good, so we order the hanger steak, the truffle pizza and the sea urchin linginue, all were good, then they give us the dessert menu, and of course the dessert we want is also not available...so 2 menu items not available, waitress service was very slow, however the guy pouring my water was very good, my glass was never empty. The food was really good but I had to knock of a star bec of the service and not having menu items and very small amounts of food for the price...
