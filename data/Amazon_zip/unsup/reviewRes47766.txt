I can't comment on the restaurant aspect...yet...but I did check out the rooftop with a couple of friends. When I walked upstairs, I was kind of taken aback. I thought to myself, "ok this is not what I expected." However, as the night went on, I started to see the charm that goes beyond the decorum. For starters, their drink list is not long...major plus for me! I had the White Peach Sangria (which neither looked nor tasted like sangria...but was yummy) and the Bing Cherry Lemonade. Let me just say that I don't drink bourbon. Never have. This was SUCH a good drink that I'm officially digging bourbon. The seating in this place is definitely not like your typical bar. How so? Because they actually have seats. There is seating everywhere which is a nice change. However, because of this, there is really no area to "mingle" except for by the bar. So if you have a larger group, you should probably get one of the tables. I really can't wait to go back to this place to try the food and to sit up on the rooftop again. I think that its definitely worth checking out if you haven't been there.
