After my previous review, one of the owners reached out to me with an apology and ensured me that my review was read to the staff. I applaud them and really wanted to give them a second chance b/c it's a local business and they obviously care. We ordered the whole chicken dinner - wow! The chicken is really great. Moist and very good flavor. Also had mashed potato and potato salad, they were okay, but the chicken was the stand out here. We did have one coxinha - my first bite I thought, this is good, needs sauce. Drizzling your favorite sauce on it, this becomes excellent! I also really wanted to try another pizza b/c I was still so confused by the high praises for their pie after our fiasco. We kept it simple, pepperoni. After opening the box, it just looked better. It tasted so much better than our first pizza. Do I rank it as my favorite, no but very solid. I do think this is a place you want to try something different. I would love to try a pizza with their chicken on it, I'm guessing that would be fabulous. So all in all, thumbs up. Great owners that care what you think goes a long way. Give it a try, they do have some good specials.
