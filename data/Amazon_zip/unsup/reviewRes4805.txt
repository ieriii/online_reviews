OOoooOOoo I love meat and beer! This place had both! I happened upon the Purple Pig while walking down Michigan Ave; it had just started raining a little harder, and I was anxious to duck for cover somewhere. Before I came to Chicago, a housemate of mine had raved about the Purple Pig, and I was quite surprised to have found it without looking. I had a pleasant, warm experience. I was able to sit at the bar as the lunch rush must have just ended. It was raining anyway, so the place wasn't packed, but it was still quite full. The wooden walls and high ceiling give the little place a bit of a cabin-like feel, and the seating arrangement makes it so that you're brushing elbows with perfect strangers. I was straining to eavesdrop on the guy a seat over, who seemed to be having a deep conversation about beer with the knowledgable bartender.  I personally ordered a glass of Nora, and Egyptian styled one that was quite interesting. I also ordered a plate of milk-braised pork shoulder. I figured I ought to order pig if I'm going to be at the Purple Pig. There were so many interesting things on the menu, though! I had to pull up a dictionary to identify some of the animal parts highlighted. Thank god. I might have been eating innards, otherwise. (I have an aversion to innards) My food was sooo good, though ideally, I'd have a dining partner to share with. One chunk of pork shoulder for one person was a tad much in terms of sodium, but it tasted great for what it was. The dish ended up being a hunk of meat that easily breaks apart, covered with gravy, and placed on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes. Mmm.... While not huge, it was enough to fill me up for a reasonable price. Hopefully I'll make it back here the next time I'm in Chi-Town!
