India House provided the worst service I've experienced in a very long time. A group of friends (including Carolyn S and Bailey H) and I wanted some delicious Indian food and had read all the great Yelp reviews on this place - and, yes, the food was decent, but the service was so horrible that I don't even remember what I ordered (and has forced me to use a one-star rating for the very first time). So, for you, dear reader, who is craving some Indian food, India House has provided three big reasons not to visit them: 1. THEY WILL ARGUE WITH YOU. We ordered several different appetizers and specifically asked for one each (this was after the server asked for clarification). About 40 mins later we receive three of each appetizer at which point we explain again that we only asked for one. The server then begins to argue with us. A message to India House - do not argue with your customers!! Having worked in the service industry, I'm pretty sure that's close to the golden rule of service. 2. THEY WILL HIDE YOU. We were there on a Wednesday night, the restaurant was nearly empty and they sat us in the very back of the restaurant so we couldn't see anything nor could anyone see us. The restaurant is also fairly large so we had to travel to use the restroom, step outside for a cigarette, etc. Why not sit us in the window seats so your restaurant looks more appealing!? 3. THEY ARE SLOW! We were there on a Wednesday night and our dinner took TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!! The services was the slowest I've ever experienced in my life and that is no exaggeration! It even took 20 mins for the valet and we were the only people left!
