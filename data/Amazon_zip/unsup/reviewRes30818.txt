It breaks my heart to give this place a two star rating. If it weren't for spotty service and a bus boy that stole my wife's iPhone then it would have 5 stars. Yes, my wife left her iPhone on the seat as she handled our two children and forgot the phone. This took place on New Years day. No one was sitting by our table because brunch was over and the restaurant was closing so this shouldn't have been an issue. We drove 5 blocks away and realized the phone was missing and called nana (from a different phone obviously) to see if it was there. They said no. We called the phone and it was already off and we know it had a high battery charge at the time. And, we checked the phone tracker and it was off as well, meaning that the sim card was already removed. The bus boy (and it was him) took my phone in LESS THAN 5 minutes time and stripped it down so it couldn't be tracked. There was no one in the room near the phone and no one that would look at the seat other than an employee so I'm blaming the staff! Yes, we forgot the phone so we're to blame but this is pathetic, less than 5 minutes and it was clearly stolen. We went to nana constantly because the food is awesome and drinks delicious but they have no integrity and are staffing thieves. We live less than a mile away and will never return to this establishment. I hope the scratched up phone was worth it.  And since I'm already bashing them I might as well add a message for the owner. Don't park your white VW jetta station wagon in front (33rd St.). You're taking up the spots for your customers. Park it down the street or make arrangements with the lot across the street. It's stupid of you to do that. Adios nana...
