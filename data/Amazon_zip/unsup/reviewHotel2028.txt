The view was amazing from this 20th Floor Bedroom. As a priority Club platinum member, the check in was fast. If you are one of these Platinum menber hoping for an upgrade, don't get your hopes to high, while I stayed more than 130 nights, and the absolute highest status available they have " no upgrades". That's ok. My real disappointment was with the internet. It simply does not work. I could not check email it would time out. You can't visit any pages, even http://delta.com would not load without timing out. This has been thru since I got here. From time to time it works ok ( I guess when there is less users) but it lasts just for a few minutes. While it's a regular holiday inn with a beautiful view, it is horrible for the business traveler who needs to check receive email or anything else internet related. I gave up and went down to a coffee shop (quite a ways out) to work and came back to the hotel later. If you need internet while you travel, Forget it!. Their network just can't handle it! Thanks
