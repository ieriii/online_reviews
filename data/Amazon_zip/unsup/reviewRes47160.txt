This is my favorite place in the world. I hadn't eaten a burger in 10 years until I came to this place. The Fat Elvis is my weakness. There is nothing else that can compare to the sweet and salty goodness. Plus, when you ask for medium-rare they actually listen. I've been frequenting the Lockdown for a few years now and they have never let me down. There are a few veteran waitresses who never disappoint.  LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.
