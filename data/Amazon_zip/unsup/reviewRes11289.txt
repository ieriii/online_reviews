My favorite place for Brunch! Simply put, there's nothing on the menu I wouldn't recommend. Although the menu can change, 2 of my favorite staples are the eggs benedict and the the white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes. The breakfast burrito is also quite tasty. The rule of thumb whenever I've eaten is here is to order a savory brunch item, and split a sweet item with whoever you're dining with. The sweet items are a bit too rich to enjoy alone for brunch, but oh so tasty. I prefer the wicker park location because, while you wait, you can certainly enjoy the nearby shopping. The wait, however, is much shorter at the loop location.
