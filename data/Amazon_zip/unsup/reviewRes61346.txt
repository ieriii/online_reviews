Yuca- AMAZING, Congri- EXTRA AMAZING, Masitas de Puerco- More AMAZING, Empanadas de guava & cream cheese- MOST AMAZING, LECHON- TO DIE FOR, Everything about this place is good. food, staff, atmosphere, It is def. a must try if you havent already. Oh and might I add my awesome awesome waiter (Guy with the long hair) split our tab AFTER he charged it, most places would tell you "No way".
