So, my wife and I ate here in November and had an otherworldly experience with a prix fixe meal that centered around an AMAZING fried chicken, so I decided to go back with a friend recently was decidedly underwhelmed.  I ordered the Grilled Niman Ranch NY Strip and was really disappointed. Their shtick was that the steak was too good to do a traditional chicken fried steak, so instead, they breaded and deep fried mashed potatoes.  The steak was luke warm, surprisingly flavorless, lacked appropriate sear and needed salt. It really makes me doubt that the cut of meat was "as advertised". And despite the promise and seemingly "comfort-food" description of the potato side, it too was bland and heavy in a way that frites, home cut fries or a twice baked potato wouldn't have been.  It only eeked out three stars because I owed Big Jones for the November meal that I never rated. Consistency may be the hobgoblin of little minds, but in a restaurant, it is a must.
