Awesome. Just REALLY good Korean BBQ. Nothing surprising about the menu, serve all the typical Korean favs. The parade of side dishes that come with each meal are more abundant than most places I've been to. Cooking at your table over briquettes (vs. gas flame) is a nice touch. Service is fast and furious, this place is busy all the time and the ladies can be somewhat chaotic at times but totally worth it. Open late, perfect after-bar meal. If you're unfamiliar w Korean bbq, consider a few of these "safe" options: Galbi - marinated beef short ribs Bulgogi - marinated beef prime cuts Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop - Rice wish fried egg, vegetables, beef served in hot stone bowl that crisps your rice
