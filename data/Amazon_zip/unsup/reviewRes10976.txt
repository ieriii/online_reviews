So, yes, the pizza really is as good as everyone says it is. I was a skeptic. I love Chicago style pizza, and I find myself defending it all the time now that I live away from the city. But, this is great non-Chicago style pizza and absolutely worth the trip. (I still think Chicago style pizza is better, but how can you argue with having more great pizza options!) We ordered the "plain" - the New Haven style without the mozzarella. I didn't see how this could possibly be good. It really, really is, though. We had pepperoni and banana peppers on our pizza, and the tanginess of the banana peppers really complemented the salty pepperoni. The selling point, for me, is the New Haven crust. It's thin, but it isn't soggy. The sauce is also absolutely delicious.  We also had salad - which was good - and beer. They were both good. The beer is obviously a selling point for Piece. I especially liked the "Dark and Curvy". (I find it pretty amazing how few brewpubs exist in Chicago. Now that I spend a lot of time in Asheville, NC, it seems impossible that Asheville is a better beer city than Chicago. But, it's true.) We also experienced karaoke (recorded version); on the night that we were at Piece the talent must have stayed at home. It was pretty painful. The karaoke set-up is great, though.  One final thing: When crowded, the noise level in this place is deafening. The vibe is fun and energetic, but don't expect to carry on any serious conversations.
