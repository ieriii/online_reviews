My feelings leading up to Hot Doug's: Day Prior: Really, Hot Doug's is supposed to be that good. I've had sausages in LA and they all taste the same. It can't be that special! 10:00 AM: Can't believe we are going this early for sausages. Why am I doing this again? 11:00 AM (!!!!!) - The restaurant is already packed with a line pretty much out the door!!!! Ummm, is Hot Doug's really that good? 11:30 - Well it does smell delicious, but I can't wait to take my first bite and just think about the bad review I will write. 11:31 (First bite)- WOW! (Repeat every 30 seconds) If you didn't get it from above, let me tell you here: Hot Doug's is by far the best sausage!!!!! We ordered the Kangaroo Sausage (with yellow pepper aioli and feta cheese) and the Philly Cheesesteak (cream cheese mustard, onions, and provolone cheese)! Hot Doug's does such an amazing job designing their sausage sandwiches! They take flavor, color, and texture all into play to create the most delicious sausage combinations. They must have a flavor laboratory that they do research in! You can actually taste the gaminess of the Kangaroo. The provolone cheese is actually stuffed into the Philly Cheesesteak sausage casing. All the flavors were synced in perfect harmony and I could not ask for more. Unfortunately, this was only stop 3 out of 10 of a full day's worth of eating in Chicago, so we could only try 2 sausages. You can come here daily and still not have tried all the sausages they offer. I need to stop now before I spontaneously book a flight to Chicago just for Hot Doug's. Doug - You are such an amazingly, fantastic and phenomenal human being! And I would just like to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart. PS. Cash only
