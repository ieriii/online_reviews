I wasnt going to review this place because I had only one thing...their baklava. I am 1/2 greek and my Yia Yia used to make the most amazing baklava known to man. I did however try a piece of their greek delites and was blown away. The Baklava had a nice coat of greek honey and nicely chopped almonds in the middle. I will definitely come back...for now JUST BASED on the Baklava...I give it a 95/100
