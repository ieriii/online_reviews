We went here last summer and remembered the yummy bloody marys, but alas the quality has gone downhill. I had the most un-enticing and bland breakfast here the other day. A scramble does not mean a big trough of eggs with a bunch of oily flavorless vegetables laid on top. That is just a mess. Why would I pay money for that? My husband's trout hash was fishy and didn't taste fresh - and this is a seafood place! I've had better coffee at a gas station.
