I want to eat seoul sassy chicken strips all day and all night. Don't bother me with vegetables. Don't bother me with chicken bones. I live 150 paces away from this place and I'm addicted. If it was a little cheeper (see what I did there, because it's chicken) I would probably eat here even more. Also, kind of amused by cashier eating every time she isn't ringing up an order. You may say this is unsanitary but I say, honey, I would do the same thing if I was surrounded by delicious chicken products all day. But don't eat here, because I don't like waiting in line behind you.
