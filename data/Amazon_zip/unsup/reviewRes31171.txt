We were seated an hour after our reservation -- but the service, drinks and food quickly made up for the wait.  I had the best filet mignon in Chicago here and the tuna tartar should not be missed. I also recommend someone in your group order a cosmopolitan. It will come out (literally) smoking and will taste delicious. Sit in the bar area if you want a more lively atmosphere. They have live bands that add to the old school ambiance.
