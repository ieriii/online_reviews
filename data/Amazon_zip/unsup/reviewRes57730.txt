I went looking for a nice and small neighborhood restaurant in the Gold Coast neighborhood (near northside Chicago) where I could get a tasty bottle of wine and a 'bistro' meal. I found it with the 3rd Coast Cafe Wine Bar. I had a delightful CA cabernet (Priest Ranch 2008) and a wonderful Italian stir fry. The meal was light (sauge and vegetables) with a little bite. I started with a Caesar salad and finished with an espresso and in-house-made NY cheesecake. The meal was delightful and it finished with a visit from the proprietor, Janet, which always impresses me (an owner at work after 9 pm). I highly recommend when you are looking for something 'off-Rush Street.'
