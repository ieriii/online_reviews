Sun Wah. THE place for duck. And what a place it is. There are times when Sun Wah can get very crowded - the many tables are aligned efficiently to seat as many people as possible. I've had to wait 40 minutes before, but there were plenty of tables on our visit Friday at 6pm. - Beforehand, we reserved the Duck Feast (see website) - a Peking Duck sliced and incorporated in different dishes. The crispy skin and meat highlight was served with white bao buns - sooo goood! Note: additional baos cost extra, I think ~$3.50 for 6 - The soup (Asian-style, very brothy) was alright - the wintermelon was interesting and the cilantro can be strong for those who don't like. - The fried rice was good and ordinary - I was told that the meat would be used in the rice, but frankly, we couldn't find what they did with the rest of the duck. - The sorbet was some sort of mango/ginger? It was hard to distinguish because it was very freezer-burned. - On the side, we did get water spinach which was very good and added the green to our meal. The BBQ pork was very tough, though there was plenty and the skin was crispy. Overall, we had a great time at Sun Wah. The service can get a little hectic if the place is crowded, but if you have any taste for duck, you should definitely come try.
