Cue the meat, cue the sauce, cue the goodness and cue the Q! Oh dear meat Gods, you have come through yet again with some ridiculously yummy BBQ! I was blown away by this place - it's so cute inside (think Martha Steward Living cute) with the white and dark wood overtones. I love the upstairs area and the private dining room would make an ideal spot for a party. The whole place feels like a small castle with nice touches - and the sound level is perfect for dinner. The food is absurd. Smoked chicken + cornbread + mac & cheese? This is comfort food at its best. The beer selection is plentiful, great wine list and a bevy of alcohol. For dirty south comfort food, Q really classes it up. I cannot wait to return!
