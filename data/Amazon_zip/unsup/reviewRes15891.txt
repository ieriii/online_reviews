I like the atmosphere in this place. It looks more upscale but the people in it aren't uppety. We come here on Weekdays to eat and watch a game. The pastas are good. I prefer their gnocchi. However, they are also known for having phenomenal Ribs. Calo's has a great $9.95 Full Slab Rib special Monday-Thursday.
