I stayed here for five nights during a conference, and had a very pleasant time. The room was clean and comfortable with a great view of the skyline (19th floor). The wireless internet was sometimes slow, but I was able to do what I needed to do. Service at the front desk was helpful. I also enjoyed visiting Italiasia (the hotel restaurant) and the Skyline Bar. A few complaints -- the "Business Center" was tiny and charged per minute to use the computers, or per page for print/fax. And while restaurant prices for lunch and dinner were reasonable (including for room service), breakfast was insanely expensive. Thankfully, the food court at Merchandise Mart has a Dunkin Donuts and a Jamba Juice, so if you're willing to take a walk (all inside, through the corridor connecting the buildings on the second floor) you can get your coffee, bagel, and banana for less than $12. The location was great -- easy access to CTA and some restaurants, right on the lovely Riverwalk, and within a cheap cab ride of everywhere I wanted to go. I'd recommend it to others who are visiting Chicago who.
