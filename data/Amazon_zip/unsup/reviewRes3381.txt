Mother of God, take me away. Crisp totally dominates. We had no idea what to order so we got a few things to share. The Korean BBQ wings are not only huge, they are probably the best wings I have ever eaten, anywhere, PERIOD. Perfectly sweet and spicy these wings are like no other and I will order these every single time that I am here, no matter what. If I had just gotten wings, I would have given Crisp 5 stars. Amazing. Next up was the chicken Buddha bowl. Again this was fanFUCKINGtastic. I got the small one (which was still a lot of food) and it was the perfect mix of rice and vegetables topped with a fried egg, mixed with their sauce. Seriously really good and I could eat this once a week for the rest of my life. Again, 5 stars. Third was the steak sandwich. This was seriously disappointing and after sampling the other items, I was a little shocked. My Korean friend that ordered it was also bummed. Anyway, Im really freaking about those Korean BBQ wings...like, cant sleep obsessed with the things. I dont live anywhere near this joint so it will unfortunately be a while before I can slather my face in their sauce and roll around like a wild hog in heat.
