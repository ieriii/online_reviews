It's an invasion! I was at Sun Wah today with my mom and brother, who were visiting from Michigan, and it was packed - oddly enough, with white people (they weren't scared by the ducks hanging in front?) who had made reservations (you can do that there?). I've been going to Sun Wah for years and had never seen it so full of white people - it's not the most well-decorated place, and it's certainly off the beaten path unless you're Asian to begin with. I'd also never seen anyone bring wine in there (apparently you can BYOB, another thing I'd never have guessed since they do carry a variety of bottled beers). We found out from our server (who is one of the family members that owns the restaurant) that Sun Wah was featured in the Tribune for Peking duck. It was a good write up - no wonder so many people were there. All joking aside, I'm glad that the best place to get roast duck in Chicago is getting some attention. Check it out, and try a few things you normally wouldn't - I've gone through a fair amount of the menu, which features fantastic, authentic dishes for an extremely reasonable price, and as far as I can tell, everything is good.
