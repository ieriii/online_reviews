ummm...awesome. If you are used to light, greasy, cheap chain pizza...head over to Giordano's. The atmosphere is as inviting as the food. Have a drink or two and wait for your beautiful Chicago za to hop off of the farris wheel style oven onto your plate. This Chicago stuffed pizza is loaded with cheese's from it's great friend Wisconsin. The edge of the crust is a side dish...like a crispy on the outside chewy on the inside bread stick if you will. And the cheese is so goey and chewey with quality ingredients sunken into the cheese like a goat skateboard in a mudslide. The pizza is rightfully topped off with a deliscously bold sauce...adding the great touch of red sauce to bring it all together. It's hard to keep your eyes open while eating this...mmm
