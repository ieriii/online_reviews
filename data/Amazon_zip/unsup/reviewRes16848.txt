Okay, yeah. I love this. If the idea of drinking expensive, weirdass cocktails in the middle of a room that looks like the black lodge from Twin Peaks sounds awesome to you, then you should go to Violet Hour. It is very possible I may love Violet Hour only because of the secret entrance door. If this is indeed the case, I kind of don't care. It's still great. Make sure you go on a weekday, or else get reservations, because otherwise you'll be waiting in line forever.
