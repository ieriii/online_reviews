i rather like gage. in the sea of bad restaurants that is the loop area it is a bit of an oasis. the service is good. the decor is lovely. the drinks are strong! the prices are great considering where you are and what you get. on my last visit i had the soup and sandwich combo. the sandwich was wild mushrooms with radicchio and truffle oil, a yellow watermelon soup with micro greens and tuna tartar and a small side of fries. a great deal at something like $13. always an excellent choice when my husband and i are out shopping.
