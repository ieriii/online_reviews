Hot Doug's didn't disappoint. It was everything I wanted plus some. I was getting annoyed waiting in a line at 10:30AM, but it was well worth the wait. We ordered 8 dogs+ duck fat fries for three people. Yeah, we are fatties. I had to order a chicago dog just for the heck of it. The best out of the 8 were the Duck sausage and foie gras, Ribeye with horseradish cream sauce and raclette, and the game of the day (alligator). I asked if they had a buy 7 get 1 free deal and he had a EXTREMELY loyal customer show me their Hot Doug's tattoo. (They eat for free as long as Doug is alive). I'm not that loyal, but we were thinking of picking up more dogs before our flight home to Houston. This will definitely be a place I visit when I have time, but I wont be getting a tattoo anytime soon! I'm sure Doug will pass before I do.
