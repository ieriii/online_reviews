This pizza was terrible. The crust on our pizzas were soft chewy doughy, not a hint of crunch to be found. This ultimately led to limpy soggy quality that required us to roll the slice up to eat it. The sausage was sub par and the pies overall lacked any flavor. The wine was not good and the servers hadn't any real knowledge of the wine selection to help in our selection. The place was packed and gets rave reviews. I ate there a couple years ago and thought it then was ok. Maybe the dough had a bad day. Stuff happens. I like many different styles of pizza. All I'm looking for is great flavor. The best I've had is Pizzeria Mozza in LA, by Mario Batali and Nancy Silverman. New York has the best thin crust. My favorite of all time is Pagliai's in Macomb, IL by Papa Don Knox. A little nostalgia here, as it was my first job at 11 years old, but the dough is at the same time crunchy and chewy, the sauce peppery tomatoey and the sausage and other ingredients fresh and delicious.
