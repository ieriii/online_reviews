This place is great. From the exterior, interior down to the friendly professional staff to the delicious food.  My fav are the oxtail potstickers and the duck...what...pork? small dish with lots of flavor. It's definitely a place to eat and people watch, no wonder lots of A-listers come to eat here. Can't wait to come back
