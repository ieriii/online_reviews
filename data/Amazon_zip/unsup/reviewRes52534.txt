So this place only gets ANY stars because of the food. Let me tell you about our experience. My boyfriend and I came here one night last summer and were seated after a 30 minute wait or so at a table shoved in a very small corner. The table was so small and in such a small, dark corner that it was actually uncomfortable. The food started coming on the skewers, and honestly, it was quite good. We were served our drinks after the food started coming, which was odd seeing as how it is pretty much the main waiter's only job, but that was only the beginning. 45 minutes after we turned our cards to red and were clearly finished, we had not seen our waiter and did not have our check. I flagged down several other staff members with no luck, and even asked for a manager, who blew us off. It got to the point where my boyfriend actually wanted to just leave because we could simply not get anyone to bring our check. Finally, I talked to the manager in a very stern tone, and we got our check. We did not have any money removed, but they gave us one of those goofy "gift cards" they send to everyone. THANKS! I can honestly say I will NEVER, EVER be back here, and I am surprised to see that there are not similar reviews.
