Went to Carnivale to celebrate my birthday- I always see it on the highway but had never been there. Let me just say that I love the neighborhood! We got there about 5 PM, and the place was nearly empty, but let it be known- an hour later it was packed and people were lined up waiting. Guacamole was off the chain, some of the best I've ever had. The fish tacos (don't remember what they were called) were off the chain, the FIRST I've ever had. The mojito smoothies were off the chain....the Arracherra was so damn good I wanted to finish it all but I couldn't. Finally the brownies with the Dulce Le leche ice cream- yeah, off the chain....I don't even know what off the chain means for real, but for the purpose of this review it means DAMN GOOD.... Would totally come back in a heartbeat...loved the bright colors inside and the place is huge....must be popular for bachelorette and birthday parties, we saw a lot of those going on....loved it, loved it, loved it....
