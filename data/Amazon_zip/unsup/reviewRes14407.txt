Came here with the boyfriend last night after class (Thursday around 930pm) and it was quite busy. I hadn't eaten since 2 that afternoon so it was torture having to wait an additional 30 minutes for a table but all is good. The wait wasn't bad so as soon as we sat down, we ordered the bacon fat popcorn. It wasn't as fattening as I thought it would be (or maybe I'm lying to myself)... haha. But anyways, you can't go wrong with bacon and popcorn. We also had 2 of their beers which were pretty good. I told her what I liked and she recommended them and were right on target. We also had brushetta and we tried one of each topping. I personally liked the beet topping the most. I don't think it was anything special though, so I would try maybe the wings next time. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which is technically why I even came here. I was CRAVING sloppy joes and the next best thing was a pulled pork sandwich so I searched around and saw that Revolution had them. It was yummy. The bun was soft and big. There was this spicy coleslaw on top of the meat. I had some on its own and it was way way spicy so I didn't understand how it would work with the sandwich but it did, and I was wrong. It was sweet, tangy, and spicy. YuM! I had fries on the side and they were good too. The boyfriend got the same thing, but with a burger patty. It was a lot of meat but he liked it. What I liked the most was the atmosphere of the restaurant. I loved the lighting, the floors, the walls, and the whole concept. I'll be coming here again =)
