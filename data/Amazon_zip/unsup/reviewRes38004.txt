All the "it was better before 'Check Please'" bs is amusing to me. This place exists because Andersonville yuppified, and as such it makes perfect sense that its popularity has increased as Andersonville's increased. And it's not like this place was a hidden gem--it's in plain sight on a busy stretch of Clark. Personally, I love this place because I love pomme frites and aioli.  I usually get the mussels, and I find it's a pretty good value for my penny-pinching ways.  The food menu is small, but the beer menu is large and something to see in and of itself. I try a different beer each time I go, keeps life interesting. It does get very loud even in the back room on Friday and Saturday nights, so trying to hold a conversation there is impossible. The last time I went with a group of people we kinda just smiled and nodded at each other across the table. We were kept pretty busy with the food.
