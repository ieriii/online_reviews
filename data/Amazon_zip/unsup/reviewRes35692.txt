Wow. I had not been here for about 15 years and the place is still around. It was here before Joe's, which has been my place of choice for the last few years. Great menu, bar and drinks. I forgot how fun this place can be! Tried the grilled fish tacos and they were cooked to perfection with the right about of tang and three different finishes sauces depending on your palate preference. YummY!
