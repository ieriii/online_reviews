Phenomenal food. Seriously, you should try their Pepito: Braised Tallgrass shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack cheese, black beans, pickled jalapenos all for $12.00. Although this is pretty steep for a sandwich I will not hesitate to pay it as long as it's as mouth watering as I remembered. You know when you eat something so incredible you are almost in your own world, not noticing what's around you or side conversations? Well, that was me, eating my sandwich at Xoco. However, once I snapped back into reality I noticed a few things that were some what bothersome. 1. Their prep kitchen seems to be at the back of the restaurant, so anytime new plates or food was being exchanged, workers had to walk through the whole dining room. NOT cool. 2. The lady at the cash register was NOT helpful at answering any of my questions and was having co worker problems which turned her attitude a little sour. 3. My boyfriend sent back the seafood soup because of various reasons, however when the manager came over she did not apologize but tried to correct and school him on the nature of the dish. NOT cool. Other then that, the reason I loved it so much and recommend it to others is purely for the quality of food they provide. Also, if you save enough room try their hot chocolate, apparently they have 6 different kinds and import their cocoa beans from Mexico and roast/produce final product at the restaurant! I will be back!
