The food here makes up for the lack of atmosphere. Try the the plantains and the empanadas. They've got some great vegetarian options but for meatlovers like me, they also have the Costa Rican steak dinner. Try one of their shakes - they've got some funky flavors but keep in mind that they run on the sweet side (I request mine minus sugar) but the more interesting ones include guanabana, papaya, passion fruit, and tamarind
