2 stars b/c of the customer service My friend ordered two sandwiches and she was charged for sides, too. It took about 10 min to get the manager, void the transaction and order again.  While dining, I went to the register to order a pop with my friend. The guy rings it up and then proceeds to hand us an iced coffee drink. I said "I didn't order this" and he says "Are you sure?" Me: "Yes" Him: "Oh...maybe they're outside..."   One of the orders we had was the red snapper, which is listed as a dinner, served with rice, beans, etc. There was none of that served. We asked about it and the waiter/cashier bluntly said "It's not served with the snapper" and we said "but it's a dinner and all the dinners are served with it." Waiter: "it's not served with the snapper" Maybe if the chalkboard menu was exactly the same as the paper menu that they handed us when we walked in, there wouldn't have been confusion.  The chicken soup was TOO SALTY (and I love salty foods!) - stay away! We told the owner when he asked how we were doing and he said "OK, we'll tell the chef." Um...shouldn't I get a new bowl of soup? This place gets more than 1 star b/c their food was decent. Not the best cuban sandwiches but still freshly made with good ham and cheeses. The pork sandwich was tender, albeit less flavorful than the cuban sandwich.
