I live across the street. Star! My first time at Caro Mio, I didn't know what to order. Well, I knew I wanted something with chicken. The server (who I know realize was one of the owners) grabs my menu and brings out the best lemon chicken dish I've ever tasted. STAR! BYOB! Chicago, I love you a little more each day for introducing me to the joys of BYOB. STAR! If you get there at the right time (just before 630p), there's no wait. Even for a starving, fun loving party of six.  By the end of our first bottle- err, course, the place was packed to the gills. There was a nice man observing my entree over my shoulder. Funny, the food was so good that I wasn't annoyed by this in the slightest. Wait, no that was because said boy was adorable. Moving along... The remaining stars are for the great atmosphere. The design of the place is inviting and warm. Even the artwork on the walls is fantastic. I could (and have!) easily make this my spot. You know, the place you always go for major events like Tuesday.
