This place lives up to its reputation. The food is just great, the atmosphere is unassuming, the service wonderful and friendly, the drinks and desserts amazing and there is even a little parking available. The downside is it can be a loooong wait on a busy night and then they run out of the one thing you were waiting for! They could use an additional location!
