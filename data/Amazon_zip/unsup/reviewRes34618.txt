generous portions, tasty selections, and it doesn't put much of a dent in the wallet. been there a few times during lunch during the week. there's a line, but it moves pretty fast. so, no complaints there. i've always opted to carry out since the dining room is a little on the small side. i'm partial to the chicken schawerma and lentil soup.
