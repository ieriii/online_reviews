We went for dinner on a Friday night after searching the area for a restaurant that had immediate seating. They give you naan with a dipping sauce (a little spicy, tastes like tomato soup) when you sit down. Our waiter seemed young and perhaps inexperienced, just very quiet. I had a vegetable dumpling masala (I forget the Indian name, but basically it was a fried vegetable fritter covered in yummy spicy masala sauce). The sauce was delicious. Quite spicy though, and when I mentioned it to the waiter he promptly brought me a bowl of yogurt to mix in. You have to order rice on the side, well worth it. Delicious flavors. I thought the portions were huge...I ate half of mine and I was absolutely stuffed to the brim. My only complaint was the fact that there were no vegetables mixed in. As always, delicious mango lassi.
