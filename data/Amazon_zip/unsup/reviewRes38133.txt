Not only was the pizza gross (sorry....representing NY on their pizza) I got a deep dish cheese pizza and took the majority of the cheese out....can you say heart attack?? It tasted like a pot pie with a crap load of cheese and sauce thrown in And best yet....the waiter hardly even came to our table...upon being seated, we waited 5 minutes to even get our drink orders and when my water finally came out there were like 2 cubes of ice in it and it became warm immediately. During our dinner we had to ask the bus boy for napkins and refills and when our waiter Finally graced us with his presence, he didn't even ask us how it was!! It's ok we left him a little message on the receipt telling him how customer service should be! Work for your tip boy!
