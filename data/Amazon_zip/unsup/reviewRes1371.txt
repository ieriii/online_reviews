There's not much to add that hasn't been said about Hot Doug's. Super long line - be ready and willing to stand out in the sun, or at least have one friend willing to do so while you hide under a tree/shade (I saw one guy bring one of those camping chairs with him - genius). Cash only. Green River (yay!) and duck fat fries on Fri/Sat. I liked their regular fries as well. The foie gras dog gets all the publicity & is very tasty (and rich. SO RICH) but my favorite was the ribeye steak sausage w/Black Garlic Aioli & double creme brie. The black garlic aioli...oh my god. Just. wow. It's a wait, but it's worth it.
