Everything about this place was awesome (except maybe the long wait to get in, but even that didn't bother me because it was worth it)! We went late on a Saturday night even though we saw that it was crowded. The wait was about an hour. Since the weather was so nice for January, we chose to walk around a little, but there was also a heated tent to wait in. It was hard to decide what to get since so many things looked good, but I had seen Yelp reviews saying how good the black bean burger was, so I just decided to try that. And it was AMAZING, so thank you Yelp. I got it with avocado too, which I would recommend. We tried spinach dip as an appetizer and the peanut butter pie for dessert - both were excellent. I can't wait to go back sometime!
