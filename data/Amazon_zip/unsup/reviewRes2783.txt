Extremely Good. Chicago Really has more than its fair share of fine dining experiences. TRU is formal and a bit of a old business type crowd but the food and service were exceptional. You leave having spend a crap load of money without any remorse. Just a body perfectly filled with highly technical and wonderfully executed food. All washed down with a superb complement of booze. (Note - If it were my restaurant I might work on the decor slightly)
