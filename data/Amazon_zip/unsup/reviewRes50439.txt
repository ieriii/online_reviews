I have now been here for both brunch and dinner. Both experiences were great! Dinner was more recent, so that is what I am going to write this review about... We made a reservation on Open Table and were immediately seated upon arrival. Our waiter quickly greeted us, offered drinks, and described the sea bass special. We decided to start with the pimento cheese and crawfish boudins (rice and crawfish balls fried and served with yummy sauces) and to follow with the fish special and the fried catfish. We were also served complimentary corn cakes with honey butter. Each of the courses was delicious and the presentations were lovely (they also have a nice variety in the shape of their dishes). They also have a prix fixe lunch here for $20 where you can order any appetizer, entree, and dessert off of their menu. This is available Monday-Friday starting at 11:00. THE FACTS: $20 three-course LUNCH prix fixe Available Monday-Friday starting at 11:00 AM
