I used to think highly of this place. It is open late, but the few times I've had the horchata, it tasted like crap because the machine that mixes the horchata wasn't working. I sat on gum too. The food is good, but after sitting on gum/ the yucky horchata... it kinda loose my appetite. I'll give them credit. That dark salsa is the only redeeming factor. Oh yeah.. there's a hot waitress there too.
