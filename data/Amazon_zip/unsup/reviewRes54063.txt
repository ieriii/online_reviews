Seriously, dont waste your time here....Unless, you like being treated like a 12 year old. 1st, my gf and I waited for an hour outside. We thought with all the hype it would be worth it. 2nd, the drinks are all $12 and they are not good. 3rd, they have a list of rules when you walk in. 4th, its extremely pretentious. We waited in a line outside, then waited inside behind a huge curtain, then had to wait behind another huge curtain before being seated. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE.
