We visited Wildfire again and had the same amazing experience. Justin was an incredibly charming and attentive waiter and the food was excellent.  After talking at length with my friends about why we like Wildfire so much we landed on the fact that they make you feel welcomed and pampered. The atmosphere is open and warm, you can have as much or as little interaction with other diners as you like. They are staffed heavily, but eveyone seems to have a very defined role - no one is stepping on each others toes, the customer doesnt get forgotton and because of all the support behind the scenes the wait staff is able to speak to and get to know their tables.  When you come here expect to be reminded what it used to be to go out to eat and embrace the attention .... Also, the coconut banana pie is to die for!
