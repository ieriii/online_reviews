Well, I would first like to point out that I am a New Yorker and definitely prefer my thin pizza over the deep dish pizza that I ate here. On that note, this was my first experience with Chicago deep dish pizza (as this was my first time to Chicago - where I am moving soon). My experience there was great, but not perfect because the deep dish pizza wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. The service here is immaculate. The waiter was very friendly and came to our table several times even though he was outrageously busy. It takes roughly 45 minutes to get your pizza, so I wish I took advice that I saw online and pre-ordered it so that when we arrived we didn't have to wait as long. But, that wait wasn't bad at all, compared to a lot of other places I have been to. The wait was worth it because as you sit there you get to see some of the history of the place. The writing on the walls, the pictures, etc. etc. etc. The food was really, really good. But, it wasn't what I was expecting from deep dish pizza. There was a lot of crust for a pizza. More crust than toppings. As for the toppings, there was a lot of cheese and not enough sauce and pepperoni for my taste. I am lactose-intolerant (even though I still eat dairy), but I'd much rather not eat a pound of cheese in a few slices of pizza (haha). But, for what it was - it was really good. It was well worth it for me. It was overall a great experience for me and I'm glad that I finally got to compare and contrast on which is better: NYC or Chicago pizza? Sorry, but I'm sticking with my NYC pizza.
