Here's the thing, I really wanted this place to be spectacular. Living in Chicago, one should know, if you can't make reservations, and the place generally gets rave reviews, there will be a wait. That was not an issue for our party of three on a Wednesday night. We were sat outside a mere ten minutes after walking in. The "bar" seating outside faces the street which was actually kind of cool, didn't feel like you were on the street. But onto the main event. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, maybe it was an off day, or maybe people just eat too much damn sodium, but holy guacamole was this food salty. I had the short rib soup, my mother the pork belly soup, and my brother the veggie soup (it was my birthday dinner). The best way to describe the flavor, is not particularly glamorous, but here goes. When you eat a steak taco, and the delicious, concentrated, flavor and grease run down your fingers, and you lick them, that is what this tasted like. The flavor was there, however, the salt just overpowered the actual taste of the soup. The ingredients in the soup including the squash and what appeared to be yucca as well as the beef tasted good, but again, the salt was just sopped up within these starches. I would definitely go back and attempt a sandwich instead, but I was pretty bummed. There are so many fabulous Mexican and South American restaurants in Chicago, I was hoping for this celebrity chef hot spot to blow me away; I was sorely disappointed.
