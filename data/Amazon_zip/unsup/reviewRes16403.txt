This review is exclusively for the lunch buffet. I have been here several times over the last five years and the food has always been delicious and consistent. I feel like the value is tremendous, especially when compared to the dinner menu. We always skip the soup/salad bars and focus on the appetizers and the main dishes. The Samosas here are outstanding, and they go well with all of the dishes (try dipping them in the various sauces). As for the main dishes, there are about 10 to choose from, with about 3-4 that are exclusively vegetarian. My favorite dishes (that are always here!) are the Matta Paneer which is chunks of cheese served with green peas in a delicious sauce and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Normally I have to limit myself to about two plates or else I'll be carrying around a massive food baby for several hours, even though it's well worth it! Lastly, they have three desserts to choose from, my favorites being the mango ice cream (Kulfi) and the rice pudding. For an interesting twist, and great flavor combination, I always mix them! The only reason that I'm not giving India House a five star review (as the food definitely deserves it) is due to the service. The wait staff always seems very rude and aloof, and the service is never consistent. Although, in their defense, when we went yesterday we probably had the most attentive staff in the last few years, so maybe they're changing their ways. If I could give this review 5 stars I would, but all in all, it fairly deserves a 4.5.
