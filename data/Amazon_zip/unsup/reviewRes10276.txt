Very reminiscent of my trip to Italy. They do a Plate 1, Plate 2 style dinner. I do think the prices are a little high, but overall loved the atmosphere. Was not in love with the house chianti. Which I believe should be phenomenal at any "Italian" restaurant. It's shameful that it isn't hopefully they'll fix that immediately. The food was nice. I enjoyed my dining experience overall.
