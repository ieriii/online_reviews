maybe i'm missing something , but i've never understood why this place gets so much praise... the beans look like they've been refried numerous times, and the dishes are decent, but nothing special... i know it's a pilsen favorite, but there's definitely better tacos, carne asada and fajitas at nearby restaurants...
