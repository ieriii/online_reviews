Alinea is truly an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience.Service is outstanding. Decor is simple yet intimate. Not a big restaurant which I think is important to not overcrowd so you can enjoy the experience. Went with my boyfriend a month ago. We got the 24-course tasting menu with wine pairing for both of us, which I do NOT recommend. 2 wine pairings are a bit too much because we both got pretty drunk towards the end.. haha. Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people.Hopefully I'll be able to go again soon!
