Considering we went there when it wasn't busy, the service was terrible. I asked for something and the waitress forgot twice. When I first came here couple years ago, the food and service was quite good, but now, it seems to be declining in both. If you are dying to have something korean, I would suggest it to try it out, but for me I will be searching for the ultimate korean restaurant in chicago.
