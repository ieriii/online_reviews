If you can get over the slightly pretentious attitude... *Asked for a booth during reservations, they said they could make guarantees. *When making a reservation, they said "I trust no one in your party is under 10." *The sign on the door "BRRR it's cold. Please shut one door before opening the other" *The sign inside: "Welcome to Geja's Cafe where guests enjoy an environment free of cell phones and electronic devices" ....the food is delicious. Yummy, garlic-y cheese fondue (and they even brought us a second bread/fruit basket), a huge plate of meats, shrimp, and veggies for the oil, and a delicious pot of chocolate. The best part, they light the chocolate fondue on fire and let you roast marshmallows, dip in chocolate, and then dip in graham cracker crumbs for upscale s'mores. Delish. Worth noting: they use steno flames instead of electric like the Melting Pot. All the other reviews are correct though: it's very warm, intimate and dimly lit, and you do want a booth.
