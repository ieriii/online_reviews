The Purple Pig serves amazingly good small plates with a pig-centric theme. It's possibly my favorite place to eat in Chicago. All the dishes are delicious. My favorites were the bone marrow, the neckbone rillette schmear, and the pork shoulder. The wine list is excellent as well, and the beer selection is pretty diverse and tasty too. I haven't really explored the cheeses, but the ones that I have tried are what you expect (it's a cheese plate, what else do you think you're getting?). Anyway, I can't wait to eat here again!
