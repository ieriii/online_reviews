ok, so I don't like to be negative and to tell you the truth, I didn't even want a Yelp account (no offense) but after eating what some may call 'sushi' last night at sushi x, i was compelled to start yelping away. i get it. sushi is trendy. you know 'roll it in this funky mayo' or 'fry it with this 'tropical' fruit tempura'. rub it. pat it down. but don't eat it. i don't want to eat your bizarre sushi experiment in what can only be described as a crazy anime windowless blue hole that blars Liley Allen to feel edgy. oddly, i was fully willing to cast all that aside if the service wasn't like pulling teeth. not every restaurant experience needs to be a life changing experience but i am giving you my money, humor me. also i bartend currently and have been in the service industry for 7 years, so i feel confident that my take on things is not that off base. i digress....ultimately, my party of 8 arrived at sushi x at 9:30 or so and was literally forced out the door at 11:00. again, i get it. its closing time and everybody wants to leave. BUT my party just spent hundreds of dollars on your subpar sushi and now some guy that works there sat on the front counter and flipped through his ipod, playing only portions of his favorite songs until he settled on 'Closing Time' by Semisonic. ok. thats not funny. its not ironic. its out of control. don't go to sushi x unless you want your money to be taken, your stomach to feel gross and some dude playing 'closing time' on full blast as the staff practically physically removes you. go to Tank in Lincoln Square. its amazing.
