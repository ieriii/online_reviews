I have been meaning for months to write a long review, but as time passes my memory only becomes less distinct.  Alinea is a truly unique experience-- by which I mean both that is weird but also that it is very very good. And I say that as somebody who is ideologically dubious of overly processed foods. We had the smallest tasting menu with no alcohol, and still left full, happy, and on the verge of overwhelmed. I can't imagine how much practice it takes to survive the more extensive tours.  I am not sure I would want to go on a regular basis, but it was worth every penny of the (large) check to go once.
