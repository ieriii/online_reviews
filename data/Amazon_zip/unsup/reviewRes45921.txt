It's an ok place. I would go here with some gal friends just to have a nice casual dinner before heading out. The portions are huge, and although several times reservations were made, we would wait at a minimum, 30 minutes before we would get seated. The service is ok - not the worst, nor the greatest, but for a restaurant that seems to be always busy, it is decent. The location of the restaurant, though, is great - the Magnificent Mile is right there, so if you think you ate a lot, just go and walk down Michigan.
