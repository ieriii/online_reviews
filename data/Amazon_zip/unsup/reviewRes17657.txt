I've been twice, once for the lunch buffet and once for a weeknight dinner: lunch buffet - excellent food and good service, but a little pricey for a lunch buffet. weeknight dinner - service was slow, fairly pricey, and food was mixed, though portions are very generous. we got upsold by the waitress on what turned out to be a really expensive and unnecessary side of rice. We started with the Vegetable Pakoras "Mildly spiced vegetable fritters", which was a mistake. It was a mix of onions and and too-think slices of potato that were battered and fried - the onions were just mediocre onion rings and the potatoes were tasteless and heavy. the entrees were much better (saag paneer and a shrimp dish) and the naan that they brought out to start (with some special sauce) was excellent - the best naan i've had. overall, i'd like to try a few other indian places before going back, but i would probably go back eventually.
