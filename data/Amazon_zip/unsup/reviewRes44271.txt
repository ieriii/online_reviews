Great food, cute atmosphere. They have a wide selection of vegetaraian rolls beyond the standard avocado, cucumber, etc etc - the salad roll was pretty amazing. My only complaint is that the seating is smushed together and the service was kind of intense - I got there five minutes before my friend and had at least three different servers ask me if I was ready to order.
