Horrible service! My coworkers and I used to order take outs just for the convenience. The short-haired lady in the front always acts as if customers are all her worst enemies, never a smile, never bother to say a word more. She promised the food will be ready in 5 minutes, but kept me standing there for 15 minutes before she dumped the box to me, and gave me a loathing look. Oh well, I didn't spend the money to be treated this way. Many of my coworkers had similar experience, too. There are many good restaurants nearby. My coworkers and I agreed that there is no point in going to Sun Wah any more.
