There's been some swapping going on at Hopleaf over the last several months. At some point, apparently they stopped using brewery-specific glassware and substituted a few standard shapes/sizes of Hopleaf-stamped glasses. I'm sure that this improved efficiency and increased their brand exposure, but it cost them some personality. On the upside, they upgraded the cramped quarters to...well, slightly less cramped quarters. Let's face it, even with the new dining room and the summertime patio, this place still gets swamped with customers on a Saturday night. Perhaps most rewardingly of all, they seem to have ditched the pretension. Or at least I can say that our most recent server, while dressed for Logan Square, gave Loop-perfect service. Don't judge a book by its cover! I wish that I had caught his name because he deserves a special mention. They seem to have enhanced the depth and variety on their dinner menu, to the point that my red-meat-averse wife finds a few appealing options. But we both agreed that the execution of our meals could have been better. I had the brisket platter and found it downright boring. The onion "rings" starter turned out to be strings, very greasy and salty. That was disappointing, but the brownie dessert was phenomenal (especially when paired at home with my wife's outstanding homemade vanilla frozen custard). Hopleaf 2012: Two steps forward, one step back. Or is it the other way around? It's still a great spot, but no longer mighty, despite the improvements. These days, the beer list is equalled by many others in the city. So you're fighting those crowds for a food and drink experience which is no longer top-drawer.
