I love this place. It's the neighborhood sushi place that's not even in my neighborhood, that I seek out anyway. Why the 4 instead of 5 stars?  Because I am a sushi SNOB, and their fish could be fresher. But then again, Chicago is many things, but it is not the mecca of fresh fish. Their Tuna flight is such a great answer to my oh-so-constant-at-least-weekly sushi craving, it's no wonder I end up going here at least every other week.  Nice sushi, interesting rolls, good atmosphere, and great value - there are a few other places that have this combo, but none do it as well as Wakamono.
