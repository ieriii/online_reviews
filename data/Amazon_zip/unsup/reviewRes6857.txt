We had dinner here a few months ago, and the service was excellent. The food was great as well, the sauce on the lobster ravioli was absolutely amazing. I was pleasantly surprised recently when the chef/owner sent me a thank you letter for our visit along with a coupon inside. This is the first time I've ever had something like this happen and you know I will be back. There is pleanty of other dishes I can't wait to try on the menu.
