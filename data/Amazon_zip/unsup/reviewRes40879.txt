Hi Guys. It's just me. Again. Writing about Bonsoiree. Again. Gushing about their amazingly unique and truly phenomenal seasonal menu. Again. I had the 7 course meal. Again. And was blown away by every single stunning morsel I had and fell deeply in love with Shin, Luke & B.Ross. Again. My BYO syrah and champagne (oh and bootlegged High Life - thanks Luke!) was the perfect accompaniment to my impeccable meal. Again. I had two sublime desserts. That was new. With all these similarities, why bother with an update? Because it's still the best dining in the city IMHO... and I wanted to rub it in that I've been three times now. Heh! Even despite the repetitive nature of my visits, its consistently been a new and surprising experience every single time... And you know what? I already can't wait to do it all over. Again.
