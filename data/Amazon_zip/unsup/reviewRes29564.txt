A vegan friend insisted that vegan cake could be as good as non-vegan, and my research indicated that Chicago Diner was THE place to go for vegan cake, so I decided to try it out with a couple of my fellow omnivores. We ordered a raspberry-filled cupcake, which was one of the day's specials, and a slice of "cookies and craem" cake (that's what they call their non-dairy "cream"). The cookies and "craem" cake was surprisingly based on chocolate chip cookie, instead of the more common Oreo-type cookie that I expected, but that was fine. What wasn't so great was the odd after-taste of both cakes. We were able to place the flavor: raw pancakes. While the cakes were not terrible, had I not known that they were vegan, I would definitely have thought there was something wrong with them. Service was prompt and friendly.
