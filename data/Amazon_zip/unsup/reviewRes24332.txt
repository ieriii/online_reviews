I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out, considering I used to work and live just a couple of blocks away. And what a find it is! A friend of mine has been talking about this place for a while, so when we made plans for dinner, I said that I wanted to go to Icosium. The menu is pretty large, especially considering you can build your own crepe. I went with that option, and chose: spinach, arugula, goat cheese, dried figs, roasted garlic, carmelized onion, and mushrooms. The dried figs had me a little worried, but they were actually pretty kick ass! They added just a little bit of sweet to the savory and creaminess going on with everything else. You also get a cup of soup with any savory crepe that you order, and I opted for the cream of mushroom. I can't complain about some complimentary soup with every order. The crepes are pretty large, big enough to share. So with that, I didn't have much room for a dessert crepe, no matter how good they looked. I think the next time I hang out there with someone else, I'll try to split a crepe so I can fit in one of the sweet ones. Or be smart, and pack half of the savory to go and enjoy later. Oh, and did I mention how fantastic the service and prices are? Top notch on the service, and only $8 for a crepe and soup. What a deal!
