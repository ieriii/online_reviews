My husband and I for a while were coming here pretty much every Friday. My last three trips here in the past two months have been terrible.. utterly awful. I wish I could give ZERO stars.  The staff/kitchen is totally disorganized. The wait time - each occasion was considerably longer then what we were told. When we were seated we waited a very long time 10+ mins for water and then longer to place the order.  I was here 2 weeks ago, on a Saturday... utter mayhem the worst it's ever been. We waited 60mins for a table when we were quoted a wait time of 35mins.... then as we are being seated the host says "you share table, yes?" and right behind was another couple taking their seats at out table. I hate community seating, I was so hungry I just didn't care at that point.  However, we were seated next to the cash register and the ceiling was dripping.... no joke. There was a rag next to the register trying to catch whatever liquid was dripping. It was very unnerving.  Also, there was a at all times through out the dinner at least 3 to 4 ppl. waiting for there carry out orders that were very late. Everyone was annoyed and waiting on there food - really gripping about service and here we are seated next it it all. I think I have made my point, just in case the time I was previously there.... the waitress forgot to put our order in.  I would not suggest eating here any longer unless they get their act together.
