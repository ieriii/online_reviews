I don't know how this place only has 3 1/2 stars. It is hands-down the best breakfast in the city. My husband, daughter and I are regulars and attend every Sunday. Their service is always excellent. There is always a wait (obviously since it's amazing) but they move everyone along. Their coffee is ridiculous it's so good and I have never left without having a fabulous omelet. It's definitely worth the wait.
