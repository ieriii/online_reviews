OH HELL YES. Sushi X is awesome. Why? Let me give it to you quick: 1) Cool warehouse/Zen look. 2) B.Y.O.B. Enough said. 3) Rolls as big as your head! Well, almost. 4) Maki is fresh, delicious, and well made. 5) Menu has simple to inventive rolls for anyone from sushi virgins to foodie daredevils to enjoy. 6) Waitresses know their shit...they don't have to go to the kitchen to get answers. 7) They let you substitute and/or design your own roll if you want. GO THERE. You won't be disappointed.
