So, first off, I made reservations online via Yelp/Open Table. So easy - y'all have to try it. Reservations set, I set out last Thursday to meet a lovely lunch-buddy at 12:15. As I'm someone who likes to read EVERY WORD on a menu, I took a glance online before heading over so I wouldn't slow down the entire ordering process. I knew what I wanted (or so I thought). First impression? Gorgeous. Sleek, wooden tables, intimate lighting - this lunch break truly will be an escape from cubicle drudgery. I was a touch early, so I got to wait in the lounge. I can see myself sitting here, sipping a cocktail after work. Once lunch-buddy arrived, we were quickly seated. Our server was there in a flash to take drink orders and explain the menu. It turns out they have an awesome (and popular) lunch special that involves a choice of miso soup or a salad, three pieces of sushi (spicy tuna or california) and a choice of entrees. So much for my pre-reading the menu! Clearly, I had to partake in this special - it's only $18! Everything came out beautifully (and perfectly timed): the miso soup was divine, the green curry full of shrimp and fresh veggies, and the spicy tuna just the right amount to assure me I'll be back to do an all-sushi meal in the near future. I'd advise making reservations (see note above!) as this Asian Fusion hot spot fills up at lunch time.
