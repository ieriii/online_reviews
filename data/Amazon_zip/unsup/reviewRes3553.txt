I really, really liked the chicken here. Two of us got a whole chicken (half sassy, half BBQ), and both of us liked different flavors better, meaning we're a perfect match for eating here. I loved the BBQ. I didn't think it was too spicy (just right, actually), and the chicken is so moist and delicious, along with the crunchy skin, that the flavor is just a bonus. I bet this chicken is even good plain. We also had the fries, which, gotta be honest, were pretty damn fantastic. I'm not a huge fry person, but man, these were addictive. I think the value is great; we're absolutely getting 4 meals (2 each) out of the dinner, because no one needs 6 pieces of chicken for dinner. The owner told us exactly how we should re-heat the chicken, which is really nice to know--though I think we're going to eat it cold. The staff here is so nice, and so willing to please. They really want you to love their food, and it's damn hard not to. Let's keep this place in business, Chicago.
