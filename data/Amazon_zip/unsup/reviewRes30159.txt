All this place is another "chevys" restaurant like in california. The food is tasty but not worth the prices. keep in mind the menu is different from topolo, so when the reservationis ask you "1st seating" , say no and ask for topolo. also they dont carry a full bar. expect, beer, tequila and margaritas only. we had to go to Sunda for "real" alcoholic beverages!
