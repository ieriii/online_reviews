[updates below] Congratulations, Irazu! You [were] my first bad review!  Look, we got delivery, and not from right nearby. Take this with a grain of salt.  Still: I am currently eating cold food that I waited an hour and a half for, using a crude spoon that I constructed from tin foil, in lieu of getting any utensils with the damn meal.  That, and, one of the large chunks of steak in my taco was sitting on the top, raw side up. It's still sitting off to the side, deep red and urging me on to review. Anyway, I got a steak taco and two Taco Ticos; the steak taco would have been mediocre when warm, the Taco Ticos were still good enough that I ate them out of more than spite. I expect they are legitimately quite tasty in person.  I'm getting the impression that this place may be more of an "eat in" restaurant. If you're curious about the size of the $6.50 guacamole, though, it really is $6.50 worth of guacamole, and pretty tasty. [Edit: Quick reply by the proprietor. I'm guessing that this was an unusual experience, given the enormous number of positive reviews, and he has offered to refund the cost of our group's meal. I am, uniformly, a sucker for free food.]
