Okay, so we've waited about 3 months to get into this place (per our advanced reservation) and after numerous visits to it's XOCO neighbor seeing the two hour line people usually have to wait for, was a bit intimidating. So considering we got in right away on a Saturday night, was perfection right there. The weather was beautiful and we had the option of sitting outside but preferred to sit inside to get the whole frontera experience. It was a little too hott in there for my liking, but also part of the authentic experience. Those fans they have inside need to be cranked up a bunch :) Now onto the service, ours moved really fast, we were out of there within an hour and we got a lot of food, let me tell you. We started with the much talked about guacamole and chips, I thought it was good, very good, but not out of this world amazing, so I probably wouldn't get it again. The chips and the red salsa was to die for, one of the best salsa's I've ever had, so next time, all about the salsa. We got the skirt steak tacos with sauteed onions and guacamole as one entree which was alright, nothing out of the ordinary and we had the Chile Poblano enchiladas which was my favorite entree there, a bit spicy, the mole had a unique flavor and it was a fun dish to try. However, the winner of the night were the fried plantains with sour cream and some kind of cheese, omg, I'm still dreaming about them, they are freaking ahhh-may--zing, Rick Bayless, can you please serve those plaintains at XOCO as I think they would do really well and I go to Xoco a LOT. So overall, good and fast service, yummy food and a great time. However, XOCO is where my heart lies for Rick Bayless. He won me over with the Goat Barbacoa sandwich a long time ago. But I'm definitely happy I tried Frontera..Now off to the store to find that salsa!!! yummay.
