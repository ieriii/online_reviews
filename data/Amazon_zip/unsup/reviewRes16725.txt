Hubs and I went here for the first time this week. After having a few bad experiences on Devon, we've been on the lookout for a good Indian food experience in Chicago. Some friends told us about India House, so we've been meaning to check it out for awhile. Our servers took a lot of care with us and were extremely professional. The menu was encyclopedic, but our server patiently answered our questions and made excellent recommendations on food and drinks. The Lamb Rogan Josh and Lamb Rajala (mint sauce) were both quite good. The nan and dipping sauce served as an appetizer were fantastic. The drink menu was a little funky, but hey, this is an Indian restaurant, right, not a cocktail lounge. Our wine was excellent - a Merlot that was spicy with rounded tannins and a hint of mint. Complemented our dishes perfectly. The last thing I would add is that the portions were quite healthy, so we didn't come close to eating everything. We probably could have shared a single dish, but that wouldn't have been nearly as fun... Also, it's a little pricey, but we really didn't mind considering how we much enjoyed our evening. Highly recommended!
