DATE/SEATING TIME: Went last night, Saturday (3/10/2012) without reservations. The place was packed, but they still got us a seat at a table near the bar after about a 40 minute wait. It was about 7:15pm when we showed up and around 8pm when we were seated. FOOD: The served a bowl of some delicious chips and a bowl of sweet pickles. Both were very good, especially on an empty stomach. I think the chips were BBQ and the sweet pickles reminded me of the ones my grandmother used to make. We ordered the hush puppies for an appetizer. They were good, not great. The chipotle mayo they come with had a little kick that added some flavor, but overall I would not order the hush puppies again. For dinner I ordered the Kobe Beef Brisket and my wife ordered 1/2 pulled chicken and 1/2 pulled pork. All 3 meats were very good. Although I generally do not like vinegar, the pork with the NC BBQ was really good! The brisket and chicken with well with their mild BBQ (big fan of the BBQ sauce!). On the side we each had the huge cake slice serving of Corn Bread. Moist and very good. Highly recommended. We also shared the Mac & Cheese, which is really really tasty. It was the perfect balance of noodle and cheese, so they blended perfectly. With all of the food we ordered, we had what felt like a 10 lbs. to go bag at the end of the meal. I'm pretty sure we have lunch and part of dinner covered for today with these leftovers. PRICE: The price was really reasonable. $80 with tax and tip (and a bottle of BBQ sauce to go). Once of the best values I've had in Chicago.  I highly recommend Chicago Q!
