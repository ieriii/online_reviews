Even if I find the brunch menu somewhat limited (in part because of my gluten allergy), the jalapeno pork chop can't be beat, and they might make the best Bloody Mary since the ones I used to order in Elmhurst at a brunch spot that now, sadly, no longer exists. The chocolate muffins are something to ask after (it's a bit of personal agony that I can no longer enjoy them). Live Cuban-inspired music in the front room, brunch with a bit of spice, what's not to like? Well, perhaps the wait, because as you see from the sheer number of reviews, this place isn't undiscovered territory, but even then, if you aim for arrival before 11 AM on a Sunday, you might find seating quite handily, as the drinking crowd might be staying away because of the blue laws, or because they're still drying out from a late Saturday night. Trying Cafe 28 out for dinner is something I've yet to do, so my kvetching on the short menu might well be Sunday-specific--and even there, as my rating reflects, I love the place.
