I went back to this restaurant with my boyfriend and his sister and the food was AAA-mazing. The service was a tad slow again, but when sitting with friends and enjoying the company, conversation and wine, its worth it. Chef Anthony came and spoke to us a couple of times. I just love that kind of personal touch. Oh and the prices were a bit high, but again worth it. We had the grilled calamari and I had the pumpkin filled pasta (to die for!). I highly recommend this restaurant for Italian food.
