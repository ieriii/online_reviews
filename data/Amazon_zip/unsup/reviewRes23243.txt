In the mood for some lovely Greek food and based on reviews decided to invite the whole family along. Overall nice environment, the menu had quite a few options from sandwiches to entrees to appetizers. We ordered the fried calamari and fava with some pita. Both were delicious! I had ordered the lamb kebabs and parents ordered the gyros- which is staple in greek cuisine, and brother ordered the chicken kebab. The gyros was the best plate of the three, although they should provide more pitas as part of the dish- one is clearly not enough! The only point which I think slightly ruined the experience was the waiter who seemed to be very proud- bordering on arrogant. In an attempt to avoid ruining a bad meal I chose to steer clear. There was a slight problem with the chicken kebabs- one or two pieces were "pink" which is unacceptable for poultry- in most other meats its acceptable. He mentioned that the chicken was cooked at "medium range" ? Anyhow, I might go back in the future, but the overall impression wasn't great.
