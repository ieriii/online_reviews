Pistachio Crusted Chicken 16.75 Sauteed & baked pistachio crusted chicken breast, served over garlic white potato puree and sauteed Swiss chard, topped with a goat cheese porto wine sauce. This reminded me that sometimes 'just having the chicken' is the right move. It's awesome. I want it right now. I'd also take one of those pork chops. Maybe we should go here tonight? Sure, let's go. Really? Great! I knocked one star off because when i went for brunch one day the front room smelled like bathroom cleaning product. It took a little of the ambiance away. But other than that. This place is the tops.
