My wife is from Sichuan and she said the taste is very similar as home. We really loved the food and will return often. Now we need to plan to try all the Lao x x restaurants. We are new to chicago from SoCal, so this was a great find.  Not the best service, but great food and decent price. We had the gongbao ji ding (diced chicken) and the pea pod leafs with garlic. The big one was the Steamed red snapper with tofu and chili sauce. We ate that for lunch and dinner and we will still have some fish left. The pea pods were very good and hard to find at most restaurants.
