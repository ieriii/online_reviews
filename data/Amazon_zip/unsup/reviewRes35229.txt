Excellent food and service in a setting that has a lot of character. The restaurant has that comfortable, lived in, feel to it that many restaurants lack. The wait staff are of the highest caliber that, too, many restaurants tend to lack. I little pricey but not when compared to others in their category. You can't go wrong here if looking for a very good seafood place in Chicago.
