I came here for lunch on a rainy Monday. They had several things on the menu that sounded good, but I stuck with the cajun chicken sandwich with cottage fries. My food was good, but nothing spectacular. The chicken sandwich was pretty boring even with the cajun spices. Maybe a better bread would make the sandwich better. The cottage fries are just potato chips (real fries are $1 more). I wasn't a fan of the chips. They needed some herbs and spices. I only ate a few and didn't bother with the rest. It was too early to drink, but they have "adult" milkshakes with alcohol. Yummmm. I wouldn't come out my way to eat here, but if I'm in the area again I'd give it another try.
