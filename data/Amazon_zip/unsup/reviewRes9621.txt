Another visit and maybe this will be a 5-star restaurant for us. I love black cod, and they did a great job with it: Not overcooked, with potato, cucumber, mint, sambal, and five spices. Delicious. Foie gras appetizers - delightful, although I would have preferred less distractions in the dish.  Terrific setting and great service. Only its location will keep us from being regulars.
