Good: Cheap rates, clean bed, clean bathroom, two good inexpensive restaurants on-site, and good location. Bad: Tiny rooms. Though the essentials were clean, certain things were a little dirty... such as exposed sprinkler system and other nooks and crannies. I don't expect these areas to be cleaned daily, but they should be cleaned at least a few times each year. The carpet was a little raveled in places. The hotel website incorrectly list a "complimentary" internet station. You actually need to swipe a credit card to use... no big deal, but poorly stated on website. Also, the printer at this station did not work for my entire 3-day visit. Again... no big deal, but I felt the staff should have placed an "out of order" sign on the device. (I would've been upset if I paid to print... only to find out I could not.) I compare this hotel to a Motel 6. Though I love nice hotels, my goal was to see the city and sleep cheap. It served the purpose. Again, the location was great... within walking distance to several attractions and only one block from the CTA (Harrison-red line-subway). Would I stay here again? Yes. However, another $20/night may get a nicer place.
