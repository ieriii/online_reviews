Let's not mince words here: Nana is the perfect brunch spot. The space is sunny and warm with exposed brick walls, bead board cabinetry, and butcher block tabletops. I think that the owners reached into my mind, extracted my dream kitchen, and then built it in restaurant form. There are 2 rooms to accommodate a lot of people, but it still gets crowded. The crowds are there because of the stellar food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and devoured every single morsel. It was perfect. Did you hear that? Perfect. I cannot think of a single thing I would change about it. The menu is full of tasty-sounding dishes, and I can't wait to try more things. Our waiter, Marco, was the cherry on top of our fantastic brunch experience. I believe he's part of the ownership of Nana based on his knowledge. He made a delicious special syrup for my friend's meal, talked about when Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives came in to film, and joked with me about my clean plate at the end of my meal. If Nana were located in Lincoln Park, Lakeview, or Wicker Park, it would be absolutely packed, so I'm more than happy to make the quick drive down to Bridgeport to enjoy a perfect meal. I can't wait to go back!
