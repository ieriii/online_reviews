amazing beer selection and good comfort food. it is impossible to go here on the weekends, and increasingly during the week it seems. i have been told that the wait for a table is an hour and a half, i mean really, really? there are only so many beers you can drink before dinner without falling over. i really enjoy the seasonal food selections. the salads are always lovely. the cb&j is the most comforting sandwich i can even imagine, i feel like one of there chefs delved into my psyche and put it on the menu.
