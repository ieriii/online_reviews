The least pleasant aspect of the hotel was trying to relax in the whirlpool tub while there were young children in it. The rules sign says children under 14 are not permitted but both times we tried to visit it there were children. The first time a mom brought 4 young children in who were splashing around and knocking into me and my boyfriend. I mentioned to her that children weren't allowed but she didn't do anything. I told the front desk as we were leaving that day. The next time I noticed it before we got in, so I called from a hotel phone to the front desk to let them know. They said they would take care of it, but I did not see a hotel representative during the next hour or so we were there, and again, children were in the whirlpool. I feel that the staff of the hotel should regularly monitor and enforce this rule, since the parents seem unwilling to follow it on their own. We tend to really enjoy the pool/hottub at hotels we visit, so I'm not sure I'd come here again... The free breakfast was a little similar but reasonably good each day, especially the make-your-own fresh waffles. Wifi worked well, staff was friendly and responsive (except for the whirlpool issue). When it was raining they let us borrow a couple of umbrellas. Only a block from the Grand stop on the red line.
