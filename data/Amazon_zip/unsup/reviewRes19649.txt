I hate waiting in line. At Xoco, we had to wait in line for 25 minutes, but that was okay. I hate sitting in cramped quarters. At Xoco, we were seated in this tiny corner, right next to the kitchen, but that was okay too. From the moment I saw the food, I already knew that I loved this place. For starters, I ordered a churro and it was the best I've had in my life. It was hot, ooey gooey and chewy. The sugar coating melted in my mouth. Just thinking about it now is making me salivate. For my main meal, I got the Gunthrop Chicken. I loved every bite of that sandwich. Every little ingredient was packed with flavor, from the super tender chicken to the caramelized onions. Mmmm M! My coworker ordered the Ahodaga and it looked equally delicious, if not more. (I was jealous of the tomato broth that she used as the dipping sauce.) Even the portions were perfect. I was full, but not in the uncomfortable kind of way. I need to come here again and again to try out more things on the menu. Don't tell your friends. I don't want the line to get longer.
