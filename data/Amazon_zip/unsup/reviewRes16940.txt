I'm not usually one to give five stars. This is a rare occurrence. I had chosen Carnivale for my best friends birthday since he had mentioned wanting to try it. It was delicious. I highly recommend the wood grilled pork chop. Pork is very easy to dry out and that had to have been the most tender, well seasoned, moist pork chop I have ever had. I was very impressed and anyone that knows me would say that is not an easy task to accomplish. My appetizer was delish as well. I can't remember what it was called but it had Amish chicken and iberico cheeses. Yum, yum, yum. I also had two drinks, Victoria's Secret and the summer punch. The VS is very sweet and fruity. The Summer punch is strong and has a kick to it. We also decided to split the brownie sundae. It was heaven! All in all, I highly recommend Carnivale. It has great food and a great atmosphere. The waitress seemed to be MIA for a good chunk of the time but it did not ruin our visit.....5 stars.
