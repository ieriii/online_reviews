Tonight was my third time going and my first review. It's hard to find a great place with good eats for a low cost. This place... hmm. not so much. They really stepped it up with the small plates. I don't remember getting 24 dishes last time. Of course my friends and I only ate about 10 of them. The others had too much mayo or just unappealing to try. We ordered bulgogi, pork ribs and steak, chopjae and seafood egg pancake. The meat wasn't well marinated- plus it must have been sitting out for awhile since it was discolored. The chopjae was bland and dry but the pancake was quite delicious. We all beyond stuffed by the end of the meal but overall if there was another place I knew of, I would head there. THe staff barely knows any English and the grill they use is very archaic. The grill itself was 12 x8 inches but the fire was a bowl about 6 inches in diameter... just dont see the logic in that. I wish there was an 'all you can eat' place- I would tear it up!
