Visited Chicago back in April - the girlfriend and I ate here our first night in town. Having read a lot about Bayless and hearing great things about his food I was very excited to try it for my myself. The wait was an hour or so. The hostess was polite and told us we could wait in the bar. We saddled up and ordered a couple drinks and their ceviche sampler platter. Margaritas were tasty, nothing over the top outrageous. Ceviche platter was insanely good.Got to our table (didn't have to go far as we were sat in the bar) and were promptly greeted by a very informative waiter. Ordered guacamole which was very good. GF got their Camarones Verdes and I opted for the Asada Brava. Who knew Flank steak could taste so good?!? Overall, I was very impressed. The only downer was that Frontera set the bar too high for the rest of the trip; no other meal while we were in Chicago lived up to Senor Bayless' joint.
