This place is whats up!!!! The first time I tried to check this joint out was a couple of weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon @ 4PM. I saw the sign saying they were closed :( Due to them being closed I had an opportunity to try Spacca Napoli (not complaining). I decided to come back this past Saturday afternoon and saw they had just opened @ 5:30PM. Walked in by the lovely bar area and saw they had a nice beer selection. The first thing they asked was do you want to sit inside or outside. I had no idea they had an outside area for eating. Of course we decided to go outside! Pretty nice inside area, but it was a nice day outside. Our waitress was very nice and informative. I started with the often talked about Mojito and it was ok. My girl got some fruity drink that was very delicious. I saw a woman a few tables over enjoying some cuban style frozen drink and I immediately ordered after I saw her siping on it. Don't remember the name but it was semi strong with a mango /peach flavor to it. For dinner, I went with the Cuban Style Chicken which is marinated chicken breast served with a roasted garlic sauce, over congri (beans & rice) & sweet plantains. Simply amazing...the chicken was very tender and the rice was very yummy. Very sweet plantains! My girl got the Pistachio Crusted Chicken and I have to say Damn that was good!!!! This place is a little pricey, but it is well worth it. This is some of the best Cuban food I have ever had. It's right off of the Irving Park Brown Line stop so it is very easy to access.
