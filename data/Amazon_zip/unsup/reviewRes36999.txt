We ate brunch at the bistro one Sunday morning when the crowds at Yolk scared us away. It was an awesome choice. The food was delicious. Great coffee and service. I had the Amish Chicken Hash. At first I was not sure what I was getting. However it was FABULOUS! I highly recommend it. It came with eggs, bacon, fruit and a little salad. It was so yummy!!! My aunt had the Challa French toast which was delicious and my girls had a plain pancake. The main negative is that there is no kids menu. They were very accommodating and made a plain pancake. However, each of my kids wanted a different meat and those came at a price tag of $3.99 each. I was not too happy to comply. Overall, this was a good find and I will definitely be back. There was also some food browsing in the grocery section of the store. I loved that! GET THE AMISH CHICKEN HASH!
