I've been to this place a handful of times, and here's the skinny: Pasta is always on point. Actually have never had a bad entree for the most part. However, it is always packed on weekends and is rock concert, can't-hear-yourself-think loud. I don't know if it's the acoustics in the place, or the fact that they have 999 tables crammed in there, but it's so loud you literally have to shout to the person next to you. It's also super bright in there. So, the ambiance factor is shot. I also always feel like I'm being rushed through my meal, which I don't love. I think upstairs might be a little more chill, but for the most part it's not usually a particularly enjoyable or relaxing experience, which is kind of a shame because the food is actually very good. I'd hit up Angelina or Rosangelis if I wanted to linger over dinner in a nicer atmosphere. However, I will probably continue to go back to this place... I'll just bring a megaphone. PS: if you get the calamari, get it grilled. The fried version always comes out soggy. And if you order pasta, split it w/your buddy across the table - they give you a trough for a serving.
