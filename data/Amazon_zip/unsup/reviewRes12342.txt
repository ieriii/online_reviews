What a gem! Cafe 28 is such a great neighborhood spot. We found ourselves here on a Friday night before going to Martyr's for a show. While there was no wait, we got a drink at the bar (try the frozen mojito ... seriously wonderful). Service was quick and friendly. The menu is quite expansive and diverse. For apps we did papas rellanas (ridiculous!) for entree I had the the pistachio chicken was perfection (and I'm not always a fan of getting "just" chicken) and split the guava cheesecake for dessert. It was a perfect meal and I cannot wait to come back and try more!
