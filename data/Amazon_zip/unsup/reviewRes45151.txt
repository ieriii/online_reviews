My husband and I had dinner on a Saturday night. Every table was full and the place was bustling. It's a small restaurant with tables close together but not so close that you feel like you are sharing a table. Greeting: We were about 30 minutes early for our reservations and there was no where to wait so the hostess walked us down to their other place, Acre (almost next door) where they have a fantastic selection of beer. She came to get us when our table was ready. Food: My husband had the steak and I had the pork with polenta. Both were flavorful and cooked perfectly. We also had an amazing chocolate mousse for dessert. The menu had a great selection and I'd go back to try the risotto and the ravioli.
