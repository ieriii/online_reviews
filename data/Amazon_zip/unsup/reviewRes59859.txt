A thoroughly unpretentious, delicious and enjoyable experience. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by a smiling and personable, professional hostess I felt well taken care of -- but without that stuffy faux-formality that you'll find at those shall-remain-nameless, so-called "legendary" Chicago chophouses within blocks of this place. Great food, great service and reasonable prices. A gem of a find in downtown Chicago.
