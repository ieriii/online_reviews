I will keep this short since there are so many reviews with different experiences, but just want to say that I've stayed at a lot of different hotels in Chicago, and this may be my favorite overall. So let that speak to you however you'd like. Just keep in mind that this property caters to the image conscious, although the roots of the building are not as glamorous (used to be a Radisson, I believe). Pros: * fun location for the summer (walk to Navy Pier and path along lake) * first class fixings - towels, linens, furniture, electronics (although the Bliss bath products are over-rated by some reviewers) * best workout facilities I've seen (with perfect views of the lake) * room service tasty and surprisingly reasonably priced Cons: * public transportation options limited (though I'd imagine that the great majority of their clientele do not take public transportation) * lots of pretentiousness in the lobby and the elevator (since the whiskey bar is on the top floor so you'll be seeing and smelling drunks as you try to get to your "soothing" room) * building shows signs of age when you look closely (you can try not to look, but if the power goes out when you need to check out and you're on the 31st floor and have to walk down the narrow winding stairway and start to get dizzy and thinking "how much did I pay for this?", its not so subtle or funny)
