I love going back for my tofu scramble (vegan as is) at Nana's for brunch! It also comes with a homemade delicious veggie chorizo, black beans, and tortilla (choice of flour or corn) and it's all fantastic! Not to mention the service is absolutely phenomenal. I love this place! If only enough vegans would come here then maybe we can get them to add a vegan dish to the dinner menu - It's not easy finding vegan food in Bridgeport, please stop by Nana's and check out the vegan tofu scramble! They also have vegetarian options and a full bar.  I must also note that this place serves organic and local foods!
