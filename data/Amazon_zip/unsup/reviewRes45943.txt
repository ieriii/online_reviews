I'm not sure how I've never reviewed Grand Lux before! It as been one of my staples for years. I often take out of town guests here because it usually makes a pretty good impression. Some pros: =Huge menu. There is something for everyone...in fact multiple somethings for everyone I'm sure. =Good food =Generous portions; there's a fair chance you'll be taking home leftovers =Good drinks =Generally very good service, though like any place they have their off moments =Nice interior, Italian marble tables =Good views if you get a table by the windows And some cons: =Very touristy =There can be long waits at peak times =Relating to the long waits: they don't take reservations =Huge menu. It can be daunting trying to decide what you want with so many options. All things considered, the prices are reasonable. Not cheap, not overly expensive. Some of my favorite items on the menu are: Sunday Night Pasta (available 7 days a week!), Crispy Caramel Chicken, Spicy Chicken Flatbread sandwich and Shaking Beef. If you're having a hard time deciding, you can't go wrong with these dishes. The fare here is sort of indulgent, comfort food. You can find some healthy stuff on the menu, but you'll need to hunt for it. Here are a few tips: You can request a table by the windows, which can be worthwhile if you're trying to impress a date or out of town guests, but you'll need to wait longer. They serve a good brunch on the weekends.
