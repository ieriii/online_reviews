Sunda is a restaurant that my sister actually turned me onto. She and I went there one night. My sister has a certain type of taste typically (read : bad) and so I was really apprehensive. We went in and there is a really good decor to the place. Very modern yet comfortable. We were greeted by the hostess and taken to our seats promptly. For the record, the hostess was mad hot. Okay, I digress. The food was phenomenal. We had a crab cake appetizer that was not really what I expected but still really good. We split 3 entrees - OMFG. Really, really good. The lobster roll is phenomenal, as is the Golden Child option. The waitress was so helpful to a relative sushi newcomer such as myself. The bill wasn't too bad, either. It was about $120 total for 3 entrees, an appetizer, a bottle of wine, and tip. Check it out, it's a good place.
