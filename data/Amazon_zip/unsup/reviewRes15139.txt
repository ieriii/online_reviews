Delicious drinks and very nice atmosphere. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get into the bar but it was worth it. The ice cubes are awesome but they take up so much room in your glass you're hardly getting any booze! Our waiter was pretty odd but still very nice and attentive. I had the olives, they were good but I don't recommend them if you're trying to have conversation with someone. It's not the most pleasant thing to keep spitting out pits. The decor could use a little face lift.
