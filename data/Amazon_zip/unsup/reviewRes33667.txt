We tried this location for the first time on October 5th. We went to celebrate the giant certification exam I had passed the night before & our 1 year anniversary, so we brought a nice bottle of champagne with us. . The food was good--on par with the other Francesca's Restaurants, but the service was not great. We didn't see our server much, and had to fill our own champagne all night. Really, he didn't pick up the bottle ONCE. The server told us at the END of the night that the corkage fee was $25. I new there would be one, but I assumed it would be $10, $12, maybe even $15 like other places. He had the nerve to tell us we ewre luckyt because it used to be $5 more. I really felt taken four a ride. At least at that price he should have served it to us. Soooo disappointed that this happened at a Francesca's!
