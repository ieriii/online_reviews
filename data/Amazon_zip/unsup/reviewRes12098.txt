My experience at Cafe 28 was a little disappointing after reading all of the great reviews and hearing wonderful things about it. The cocktails were good, and the food was just ok. I ordered the chicken and the beans, rice and plantains. The time that it took for us to get our food after placing the order was +30 minutes, which was too long because we had tickets to a show that we needed to get to. Once we got our food, we scarfed it down, so I didn't really have a chance to savor and enjoy it. I would go back again and try it when I don't have the time constraints.
