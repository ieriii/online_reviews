I came here a while ago and tried to order food. Unfortunately, since I am unable to eat cheese; there were no options for me when I was present. This is because after a particular time only Pizza can be ordered. When asked if I could have something off the menu; it was treated like a major inconvenience that I wasted there time by asking that silly question. It really must be more difficult to make a sandwich or fry something, than to make a whole Pizza. I did look at the non-pizza options on the Menu and they were pathetic. I have not come to Piece since although they are so busy I don't think they will care.
