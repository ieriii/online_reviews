Good food, horrible atmosphere. Don't go on a weekend you'll wish you were dead.. Slam packed with people staring at you from the moment you first sit down thinking "hurry up and leave so I can sit" staff wasn't that helpful just looked anxious and rushed to get to the next person and not very willing to answer many questions :-\ I dunno, the food's pretty good though, have the juevos rancheros but won't go again.
