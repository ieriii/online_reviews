I've had a lot of god-awful thai since moving to Chicago, but Opart was a ray of sunshine in my spice-less, muddy flavored world. The pad thai is awesome, though you may have to say "no, really, HOT." a few times to convince them you're not afraid. The curries are also delicious, as are the rice dishes. But what I really love are the soups. They're served traditional style and are great to share with a group. The BYOB is also awesome. I live only a few blocks from Opart, and its definately rough to not just go "Mmmm, Thai sounds good..." at least twice a week.
