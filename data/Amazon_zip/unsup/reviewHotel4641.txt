Stayed here for a business trip for the first time and was mildly impressed, but not blown away. For a boutique hotel, the Felix meets my expectations of being very simple, clean, and small. I'd go so far to say this place reminds me of "the poor man's W Hotel." The standard rooms were uber-small (sub 200 sq ft) and the nice-looking amenities are of cheap quality. Seriously? It seemed like every time I turned in my smallish room, I would: (a) bump into something and (b) break off a plastic component to something... The sink, the desk light, my bed, etc. The gym and business center were also very small. The vastly superior thing about this place was that the service was great during my two day stay-- including a very friendly doorman. Props to that guy!
