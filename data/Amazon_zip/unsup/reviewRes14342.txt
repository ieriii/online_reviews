I am a longtime customer of Glenn's, but that is now going to change. It used to be a great neighborhood joint and one that we visited many times over the years. However, the menu has changed numerous times (different rules for when certain dishes are available) and the staff has changed to a bunch of arrogant and rude jerks to be frank. Everytime we visit Glenn's, the food is different yet no one will admit this. When you ask if something changed with the recipe they look at you like you have 3 heads and seem completely bothered. Their lobster roll sandwich was awesome--large chunks of lobster, light mayonnaise. Now it looks like tuna salad with the lobster chopped so fine you can't even recognize it and huge chunks of raw onions and tons of mayonnaise. Another example: corned beef hash used to be terrific until they decided to stop cooking the potatoes and include long strips of crunchy red onions. I like onions yet they were so overpowering and uncooked that I couldn't stomach it. Pancakes used to be another great staple. Fluffy and moist. Now they're just thick and dense. . I imagine they still do some things well...potato pancakes, crab cakes and scallops. However, since this place has been on the Food Network they've gone downhill. The place is always overcrowded, the service rude and food inconsistent. I would no longer recommend this place to others as its now a hit or miss experience.
