Sorry Jones, but you are far less sexy than the Indiana variety. First off, experience #1 here involved me asking for coffee with cream, and you bringing me a cafe au lait and charging me extra. And then being rude when I pointed it out. Experience #2 involved your restaurant being almost entirely empty, and still having to wait 15 minutes for you to bring back my credit card when I attempted to pay. Experience #3 takes the cake, with you deciding not to write down our order (which granted, had a few substitutions due to vegetarianism), you bringing me a meal without the substitution (but still charging me for it) and you bringing my friend a completely different meal than she asked for and not bothering to come back to the table after serving us to let us tell you it was wrong. So we ate what we were given, and then when we pointed out, upon receiving the bill, that you'd given us multiple wrong things and charged us for them, you got angry at us. And then told us you were frustrated because you just wanted us to be happy. The food could be better, since this place is more expensive than most of the other brunch places in the hood. And since there are so many amazing ones in the area (Tweet, M. Henry, Taste of Heaven) I think I will go there next time. 3 times was not the charm, and I have gotten all Temple of Doom, with no sexy Harrison Ford. I'm Jonesin for something else.
