Ohhh poooo Sunda! We ventured to Sunda at 6pm on a Wednesday and were asked to find a seat at the sushi bar or in the lounge. We chose the lounge and sat on these swanky banquets that are more appealing to look at than sit on. Our server was very nice but used the word 'like' like about like umm like four or like five times like in a sentence when answering our questions about the menu. Still, I am fine -- booze is hitting me a little now so, like all is good. We started with the oxtail potstickers which were really close to being awesome but they were so, so heavy. I think a wee bit of acidity to cut the fattiness would have taken this dish to new heights. Based on recommendations from fellow Yelpers we tried the Rock Shrimp Tempura next. The glazed walnuts [sadly] were my favorite part of this dish. The tempura batter quickly absorbed the honey aioli making for a rather soggy dish. The meal rounded out with an order of the Tail of Two Tunas and the Firecracker rolls. Both were average to below-average sushi rolls. For the price I was underwhelmed, like a lot.
