I could go on and on explaining how much I love this restaurant. Seriously, its great from all the different small plates to dessert! Do not pass up the ricotta and honey or the torta bacio (yes this is the dessert for you chocolate hazelnut nutella fanatics such as myself!). However, everything you need to know about this place can be summed up in one bite of the Davanti Burger aka the most blissful bite of burger you will ever experience. Go get one now. Or better on Monday when it's $10 for the burger + a tall glass of ice cold Peroni.
