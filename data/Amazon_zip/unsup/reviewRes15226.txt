This is a great addition to the neighborhood! I came here the first weekend it was open. We were quoted a three hour wait, but decided to tough it out with some beers and conversation. The wait ended up only being about 90 minutes, and in the meantime we were able to work through a majority of their self-brewed beers. After being seated, we were starving, so we worked our way through the appetizers and entrees. It would have been easy for a place like this to just ride the we're-a-hip-new-brewery wave and not worry about creating decent food, but as a foodie I have to say the food threatens to outshine the beer (and the beer is pretty damn awesome). So this place is basically what I would conceive for a gourmet brewpub if I had the resources. If you live in the area, you have to come here. If you're outside of Logan Square, it's worth the trip.
