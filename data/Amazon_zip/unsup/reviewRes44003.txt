First off, let me say the food here is excellent and my friends and I love their drinks. This is the only reason I'm giving them two stars over one. That said, their service is terrible. Last night my friends and I ate here and experienced several issues: 1) No one took our drink order until we flagged them down and told them we would like to order drinks. 2) After we received our sushi it was 45 minutes until anyone came to our table again. We seriously thought they had forgotten about us. 3) While we were asked if we'd like another drink while waiting for our sushi, which was nice, the entire 45 min we waited for someone to come back to our table we weren't offered another drink. And the kicker... My friends and I generally tip 20% everywhere we go. We feel that's standard. In this case we tipped 10% (on the entire bill, including tax and alcohol), which we thought was fair given the quality of our service. Our server immediately came to our table to collect our credit card receipts (so they did know we were there!) and cornered us to ask why we only tipped 10% when they are used to receiving 18-20%. Now, I can see if the server was asking to merely understand what our issues were, but it was obvious she was attempting to pressure us into leaving a better tip. It was uncomfortable. Furthermore, when we explained why we left 10% as opposed to 20% she simply disagreed with us. The conversation ended with her saying "Well thank you very much" and walking away while we were still talking. It was surprising, to say the least. I would like to attribute the poor service to an isolated incident, but this was really just the ending of a series of visits to this restaurant where we encountered continually declining service. But, the food is awesome...
