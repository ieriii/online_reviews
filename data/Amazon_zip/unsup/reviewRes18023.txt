UPDATE: Second visit, ordered a Daisy Cutter, sure enough: Got a short pour. Not only an inch of foam at the top of the glass, but some empty space above it. I didn't even hesitate this time, I said: "Can I get some more beer in my glass?" The waitress had clearly noticed the bad pour as well, because she also did not hesitate, responding immediately by saying "Yeah, let me get that topped off for you." OK. And the next beer came back nice and tall. But then they switched shifts and I got another waitress. Guess what? Another short pour! What does this tell you but that shitty pours are endemic to the Bad Apple; they will give you a crap pour unless you complain in order to extend the life of the keg for as long as possible. And make no mistake: An inch of foam at the top of the glass turns your 16 oz pint into a 12 ouncer at most, shorting the customer by 4 ounces (25%!) per beer, providing them with another "full" beer in the keg they should not have for every three served, a "full" beer that you should have sitting right in front of you. Or to put it another way, one free keg for every three they run through. For what it costs to drink at a bar these days, this is nothing less than a criminal activity. I really hope that more people start to notice this. If you do, please say something. If places continue to get away with this then perception is going to shift in their favor -- soon the price of a pint will be seen as acceptable for a 12 oz beer, and it will be that much harder to call them out on it in the long run.
