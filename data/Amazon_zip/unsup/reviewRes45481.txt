All-in-all an A-Ok spot. I was really surprised by the size of the place. What was there before? It's pub atmosphere is cozy and warm; a total change from all of the Asian food spots in the area. Tom F. gives a great description. The menu lists standard English pub grub: burgers, sandwiches, shepherd's pie, bangers. The tastes were equally standard (we ordered a turkey burger and a meatloaf sandwich); good portions. Service was fine. I spied a DJ booth. And, yes, the faucets in the women's bathroom were nifty.
