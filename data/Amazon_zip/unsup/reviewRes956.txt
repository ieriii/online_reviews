This place is a gem. I'll start off by saying that I'm a vegan (health reasons, rather than philosophical) and I have fun food allergies (gluten, dairy, eggs, etc) that generally make eating at a place like Hot Dougs not so fun territory; the experience at Hot Dougs is so amazing, I'm willing to put my health on the back burner and let the alligator sausage, duck fat fries, and fontaine cheese fight it out for the rest of the day in my stomach. I had actually heard about this place place shortly after I moved to Chicago in 2004 and tried to go once in 2006, but they were closed (check the website before you go! They take a lot of vacation time.) I finally made it in 2009 and again in 2011 while visiting. Hot Dougs is not a place to go for a quick bite. This is the best bastardization of gourmet eating and americana fast food I've ever seen. As a result, Hot Dougs should generally be a planned trip, and the closer you come to opening, the better. Expect about a 45min - hour wait. Although there is some limited seating inside (which, miraculously, there always seems to be a seat available when I get there), there is also some outdoor seating around the corner. Word to the wise - don't sit down until you order. You will most likely be called out on it. The staff is friendly, even though pretty constantly busy. And the food. The food is amazing. As it's a pretty big deal for me to eat meat, I always choose from their special menu and explore the land of exotic meats. Fridays and Saturdays offer Duck Fat fries, and they're worth it. This place truly is an experience unto itself and the wait becomes part of it. Bring someone you need to catch up with and chow down after you've explored one another's deepest secrets in line!
