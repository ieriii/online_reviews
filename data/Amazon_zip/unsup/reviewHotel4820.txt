I stayed here for a business trip. It was my first time to Chicago.  My room was clean, personnel very professional and I felt very comfortable on site. It is near (or within walking distance) of quite a bit of things to do, great restaurants etc. My favorite part was the fitness center. Quite spacious for a hotel, well working and high quality machines. Would definitely stay here again.
