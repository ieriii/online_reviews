Was a recommendation from a friend while my BF and I were visiting the Windy City for the weekend. Sunda definitely hit the spot. We got the organic miso soup with crab- super yum. Never had miso soup w/ crab before. It was a first and we really enjoyed it. As for the rolls- we got the baked seafood dynamite and scorpion roll- both were mouth watering, flavorful, and delicious! Our cocktails- toasted ginger snap and the lychee luxury drop were super as well! Definitely coming back to Sunda when visiting Chicago again! I really like the decoration of the place as well- very spacious- and earthy.
