Well made cocktails prob the best made in the city. I have worked in the bad industry for over 5 years. 5 years spent in London running a cocktail bar in Soho funny enough right next door to Milk and Honey London and right around the corner from The Player. Ive been in numerous cocktail competitions and won a few. Any who yes it takes a long time to get in, yes the drinks are $10 and yes there is no standing room. I like the fact that there is no standing room. It is a copy of Milk and Honey with the house rules the 1920's theme well the guys who started Violet worked in NYC Milk and Honey. Maybe Chicago is not ready for this type of bar People in the Midwest I think are still afraid of new cocktails they cant imagine drinks made with things like elderflower or peyschauds bitters. If you want to drink Jack n Coke and Bud go up the street to Tavern or the Blue line lounge if you want quality cocktails then this is the place for you. As for food Ive only tried the Tempura Green Beans which were surprisingly great and I think I had the meatballs Also they give you a little carafe of the extra from the cocktail shaker. Oh and they know how to use a shaker they shake quick and hard no lets grope the shaker and water down the drink here.
