Let me just cut to the chase...the Churros and hot chocolate are over-the-top, roll your eyes to the back of your head AMAZING. You know when you eat something, and it just makes you happy? For the maximum flavor experience, dip the churros in the hot chocolate and THEN eat. I'm STILL thinking about those churros and hot chocolate. I had the original hot chocolate, which is very rich, so I was only able to drink about half of the cup. This dessert and the fact that I saw Rick Bayless in the restaurant the night I went were the highlight of my evening. I also enjoyed the guacamole, which was smooth, creamy and flavorful, as well as a couple of tortas. The tortas (the ahogada and choriqueso) were a little on the salty side for me (particularly the chroriqueso) and while they were good, I probably wouldn't order the ones I had again. I do want to try the soup the next time I go, as there is an interesting selection, the portions are huge and they looked delicious. I'd also love to go back for breakfast for my beloved churros and hot chocolate. This will be my new indulgence.
