I always take my mom and boyfriend here. It doesn't get any better for Chicago brunch. Meli does everything exceedingly well, so it's easy to see why there's usually a long wait. The last time I was there, they sent us a couple storefronts over to 9 Muses to wait. I usually get the Down On The Farm skillet... bacon, sausage, ham, oh my! Topped with a sunny side up egg, it's the perfect hearty breakfast meal for me. I've tried their grilled veggie wrap, chocolate morsel pancakes, and other scramblers as well. All are exceptional. The food at Meli is not particularly imaginative, but the prime ingredients and execution make it a comfortable foodie haven. And I really love those cute little biscuits that they serve with their cappuccinos.
