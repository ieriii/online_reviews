Three and a half. Good: The chips. The sweet plantains--and I don't even like plantains. The yellow rice--and the potatoes in the yellow rice. The guacamole--it wasn't necessarily the best in the world, but it had great flavor. The beans--refried? I don't know, but they were goooood. The shake--my boyfriend had a strawberry-banana shake, and I don't like banana and I thought this was good. The bad: The salsas are really, really spicy. I mean, on-fire spicy. The empanada--it was okay. Just not great. Sam's tacos--very, very chunky chicken. Not to his liking. Cash only--sucks. My potato tacos--they just didn't have quite enough flavor. The cabbage salad--this could have been so good had it not been so heavily cilantro'd. We will probably go back every once in a while, and esp. if we're near, because it's very different from what you're normally eating. But I don't know if we'll ever make a special trip out again.
