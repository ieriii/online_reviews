I love this place. The service here might seem a bit curt or impersonal to some, but I find it pleasing. It's much better than getting a chatty waiter who feigns interest in "how you are doing", the weather or, perhaps, your dazzling political insight. Also, I recommend the following: chef's special dry chili chicken (quintessential "white-person" dish), boiled sole fish fillet in spicy szechuan sauce, crispy shrimp in mayonnaise sauce, double fried eggplant, cold crisp jellyfish, and of course the extra hot ma po tofu.
