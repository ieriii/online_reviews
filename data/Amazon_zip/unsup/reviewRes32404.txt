I came to Demera for dinner one evening with 3 other people after not having Ethiopian food for a few years.  The staff were all very friendly and were prompt to fix us up with some beers and suggestions from the menu. We ordered the veggie platter which of course comes on a gigantic tray on top of injera served alongside a basket with even more injera lol. Every single item on the tray was excellent and we struggled to try and finish the food (we were unsuccessful) which had me full for at least the next day and a half :P I even enjoyed the Ethiopian beer that was recommended by one of the lovely waitresses. Definitely recommended if you're coming with a group. I wouldn't eat Ethiopian food any other way!
