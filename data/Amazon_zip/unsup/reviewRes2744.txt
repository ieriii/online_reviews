Couldn't have been more impressed and suprised! Putting aside the incredible cuisine for a moment (if one can), what was truly amazing was the clear attention to detail and impeccable service from the entire staff. The staff works and communicates like a well-oiled machine; they take customer service to heart and do so in a way that is almost mystifying. We never had to ask for a thing and they anticipated our every need, right down to having our coats ready to slide our arms into at the end of the evening. As far as the cuisine goes, it is hard to know where to begin with my compliments to the chef. The range and mixture of flavors and textures was splendid, portions were perfect and the courses were magnificently arranged! Bravo!
