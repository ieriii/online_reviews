I am a frequent customer to this establishment. Every time I've been here I've had nothing but the finest service with the exception of one occasion.   Their selection surpasses other Brazilian style steakhouses including the salad bar. The servers have always been polite and over helpful. On some occasions they are hard to find, but they make up for it with their knowledge of their wine list and food. I highly recommend this experience.
