We booked our room 3 months in advance by phone, requested a specific suite, was guaranteed and confirmed the room I requested would be available. It was our 30th anniversary and was supposed to be special. Showed up 3 hours prior to check in, our room was given away. I was so disappointed. The staff was cold and indifferent and said there was nothing they could do. We ended up getting a small king room, tucked in a corner and at no discount at that. Very sad moment for us.
