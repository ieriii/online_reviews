Ohhhh, this was pretty fantastic. I didn't realize this going in (yes, the rock I live under provides excellent shade at this time of year) - but it's like Fogo de Chao. No wait, wait, come back. It's not some touristy haven of gluttony where you eat slabs and slabs of meat and cheesy fried things (usually bread) until they have to cart you away. I realize that something like that is fun once in a while, but Zed is more subdued, which makes a huge difference when your gimmick is people coming by to offer you meat. We started with the appetizer buffet which has a ridiculous amount of options, from potato salad to cured meats to sauteed veggies. I got mostly sauteed vegetables (the mushrooms were great!) and the cured meats were fantastic. I also enjoyed a few little bits of the parmesan crumbles, and I'm not much of a cheese person. I also had two glasses of moscato - hooray for sweet sparkling wine. They brought ridiculously buttery but delicious naan to our table. But still, I wanted to save up for the ENTREES. Friendly and polite servers came to offer each of us different types of meat, and they honored my dad's vegetarian requests by bringing him a variety of types of fish. I usually dislike lamb and find it gamey, but it was very well seasoned and delicious. I also enjoyed the buttermilk-cooked sirloin, as well as basically every cut of meat they gave me! The venison was a bit too "earthy," though. I also liked the pork belly, which was not as fatty as I thought it'd be. Basically, with the exception of venison, all of the meat they serve you is AMAZING, and they shave it off in respectably small slices so a food coma is less inevitable! We didn't have desert but I'd like to imagine that they cook cheesecake on a rotisserie and then slice it off for you. The service was well above average. I didn't love the high tables we sat in, especially since I wasn't too comfortable in the seats, but that's barely anything compared to how delicious Zed is. Mmmmmm.
