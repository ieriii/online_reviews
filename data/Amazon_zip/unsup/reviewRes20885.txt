I went for lunch today and I am quite impressed with The Gage. I had the half sandwich half soup with the peppered salmon club and butternut squash soup. I really enjoyed my meal and struggled to finish it because although it was delicious it was also a hearty portion. My dining companion had the sandwich special- a veal sandwich with mixed greens. She assured it me was wonderful. I am looking forward to a second visit in the near future. Our waiter was attentive, my water and wine were never empty and the food was delightful.
