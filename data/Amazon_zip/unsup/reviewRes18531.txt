I went here one night for dinner with two other friends and we had such an amazing time! First off, it's an Italian restaurant that's BYOB - how great is that?! Second, the food is absolutely amazing. One of my friends had the farfalle pasta with vegetables and I never thought veggies could taste so good but they somehow excelled on the plate. I had the cheese-stuffed gnocchi (yes, drool now) and it was amazing. My other friend had the mushroom risotto - she absolutely loved it however I thought it was a bit salty for my taste. If you are more of a salt fan though, I definitely suggest it! The service was fantastic and the atmosphere very cozy - I can't wait to go back!
