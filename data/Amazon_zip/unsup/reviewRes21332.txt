This place is more of a drive-in but you can can eat inside (seats maybe 20 total). Great large dog, but could use more celery salt if you want that authentic Chicago-style. Pickled tomato instead of regular tomato which I wasn't into. Awesome super thick vanilla milkshake!!! Tasty fried onion chips. The one less than stellar part was the fries. They were solid crinkle cut fries, but they tasted like they were cooked that morning and were sitting under a lamp for a few hours, still above average though. I left wanting another dog for sure and wouldn't mind coming back on a future trip to Chicago.
