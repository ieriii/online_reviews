The lunch buffet is wonderful! We've only been for that, but it's good enough to keep coming back. They keep the buffet selection broad, with dishes to appeal to vegetarians and diners of all tastes. My fiance was happy to see lamb vindaloo on the menu, and I was thrilled to see the paneer makhani, which is some of the best I've had anywhere. The chicken tikka masala is great too. They also have some delicious desserts. The only thing I was ever disappointed with was the iced tea - it is not brewed - but that's such a minor thing. Great place for Indian
