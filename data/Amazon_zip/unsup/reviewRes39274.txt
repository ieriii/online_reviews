I'm very tempted to give four stars based solely on the fact that they give a crapload of side dishes - more than I have ever seen in my life and I love it. I love all the Korean side dishes. We ordered Short Ribs and Pork Belly and I was a bit disappointed with the meat. It wasn't as tasty as other Korean BBQ I've had. The Kimchee soup was decent. The service is good, they kept refilling our water, side dishes, lettuce, and etc.
