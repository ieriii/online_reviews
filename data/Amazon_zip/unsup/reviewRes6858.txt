You know, I wasn't expecting this place to be nearly as good as it was. It is a SOLID four star place. The outdoor patio is really nice, the food is excellent. The hush puppies were great, but too many for two people to share. The corn bread was a little less buttery/moist then I like, but still very good. The BBQ was a little less "fall apart" than it could have been, but the spicy sauce was AWESOME. The mac n cheese was really really good too... Great service too. I would totally go here again
