For all the middle eastern /persian food lovers. I will keep it very short. This place is far far better than Reza. Any time of the day. I wish i had known this place earlier. Amazing food, very authentic and very original. Food was hot and so was the lentil soup. The lamb pulao i had was amazing and wish i had more room in my belly to try more. The only thing i didn't like was the approach to the place. Neighborhood didnt seem as enterprising as you might want and the entrance was a little confusing. But, once you settle in you will love every bite.
