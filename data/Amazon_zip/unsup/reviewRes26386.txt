OK Jose. Now that you are an Iron Chef, the least you could do is invest a little more money into Mercat to hire some more servers!!! My family and friends went there for Easter Brunch yesterday. First of all the menu, which they just changed, and you could only order from that Easter menu, was confusing! It took at least two times for our server, Charles, to explain it to us. He was so stressed and frustrated with us, that I actually gave him The Hand as if to say "take a breath". There was no bread too! We didn't get any until my friend managed to get a hold of a manager to bring us some. No spoons to stir our coffee as well. As I have read elsewhere, it looked like only two servers on the floor, that the bussers and managers ended up serving our dishes. Also, they really pushed the alcohol, so if you are not a big drinker or can't have alcohol for some reason, it can feel a little pressure. Now come'on. This is ridiculous. This is a really nice place and could really kick ass if they could up their service. But first of all you actually need more servers. Is this a restaurant or a sweat shop you are running Jose?
