I've been to the Bad Apple twice, and I don't really get why everyone loves it. Yes, they have a monstrous hymn book of a beer list. But their food menu is much smaller. As I look through their burger list, I often think, "This burger sounds good... wait... no... there are at least 4 ingredients I want no part of." On my most recent visit, I got Smokey and the Brisket: relatively bland brisket on quickly deteriorating Texas toast. The interior of the sandwich was nuclear hot, but the bread was falling apart by the minute, leaving me the choice to forge ahead with shoveling magma in my mouth or letting the sandwich cool and break into tiny, sloppy pieces. My first visit, I had the Big Texan: pulled pork, fried onion rings, BBQ sauce on Texas toast. Same problem. Bland taste and Texas toast isn't up to the challenge of the sandwich. I do like the decor. It's dark and fairly spacious. But if your food is no good, I have a hard time justifying a visit. Sorry, Bad Apple fans.
