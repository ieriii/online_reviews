OOOOHHH MYYYYY GODDDDDDDDD! I've lived down the street from this place for over a year and only just tried the food last week. After tasting their wings at a superbowl party this past sunday I HAD to try a buddha bowl (which was highly recommended). I walked in a snow storm tonight (ok, ok, I know it wasn't THAT bad but normally i just hiberate so this was big!) to get myself one. I got back to my place and dug in and tasted HEAVEN. It was so good! I'm an instant fan. If your looking to switch up your normal asian food routine and add some fantastic flavors GO HERE! Chicken wings: A++ Buddha Bowl: AAAAAAAAAAAAAA++++++
