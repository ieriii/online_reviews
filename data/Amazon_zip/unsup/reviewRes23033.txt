Oh Lao Sze Chuan, how my mouth waters as I say this!!!! Ok, if you are seeking a great restaurant in China Town, this is it! It has so many choices for us Westerners - while allowing us to try some authentic dishes. Again, I took my family here for dinner on Friday night and they loved it (no egg rolls) but still loved it! We ordered their Famous Duck (moo shu style) and takes 45 minutes to cook, but when the waitress comes over and does her famous presentation - you will wow your guests! We also ordered their chicken fried rice, chicken w/veggies and shrimp with lobster sauce (this was mouth watering delicious). Parking is a bit difficult, services well, not many speak english here but they will try to make good recommendations. I love it, love it, love it!
