I've been here 3-4 times already. The food is awesome and the service is great! We always go between 5-6 and we only waited for 10 mins or we got seated right away. The servers there are very nice and the food comes out quick. The prices there are reasonable. The wine is great too! We always get the bone marrow because its simply delicious! We have ordered the fried pig ear, pork fried almonds, fired brussel sprouts,porchetta sandwich, meatball sliders, pork sweetbreads, sirloin tip, and bone in beef tenderloin. The only thing I didn't like was the porchetta sandwich because i've had better. I recommend get 3 dishes for 2 people maybe 4 but it will fill you up trust me! Also for dessert you must get the SICILLIAN IRIS! Its so yummy!
