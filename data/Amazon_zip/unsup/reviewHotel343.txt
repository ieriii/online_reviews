This was the worst hotel i have ever stayed it. PERIOD. Coming from Minneapolis to Chicago, my flight was delayed, so I called ahead to make sure they wouldn't give away my room. They said no problem. So I arrive at the hotel around 11:30pm and check it. I reserved a 2 bed room. I get a room with one bed. I call down to the front desk. They have no more 2 bed rooms. Can we have a cot/rollaway? They don't do roll aways. Can you just sleep on the couch. NO, I CANNOT JUST SLEEP ON THE COUCH. I'm paying you $150. Finnally, they decide they can get me a second 1 bed room for my companion... ok fine. Second room is the size of a closet and smells like cigarettes (despite the fact the entire hotel is "non smoking" ). Not only that, but the window is painted shut, so I cannot get any real fresh air. I turn on the air conditioner full blast and it lasts about 3 minutes and then just turns off. I try to turn on a lamp at this point but nothing happens. The alarm clock is also dead. THE AC TRIPPED THE CIRCUIT BREAKER. WTF. Not only that, but the vent in the bathroom looked like someone punched a whole in the wall and then tried to put a grate over it. The next day around 9am I try to go complain to the manager. "He isn't in today." Huh? Not in today? What do you mean. He's the fricken manager. Needless to say I checked out early. Horrible experience. Maybe the worst ever.
