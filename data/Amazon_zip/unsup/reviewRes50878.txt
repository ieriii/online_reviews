this restaurant was incredible for brunch. i had the benedict alexander, with ratatouille and corn cakes. it was amazing. the beignet as an appetizer was so surprising and delicious. the service was okay (it took us 20 minutes to get our check after we had asked for it before), but i was there for the food! will DEFINITELY go back. can't wait to try the mimosa and tea, which looked super fancy!
