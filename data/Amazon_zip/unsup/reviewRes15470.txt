What a lovely place for a cocktail! It is dark, mysterious, and cozy. The decor is fantastic and plush, with high chairs and floor to ceiling velvet drapes. You know you're in for a treat when you walk in. The service was kind, friendly and helpful. Our server was easily able to answer my questions about some of the cocktail ingrediants. He was also quick to suggest some favorites, and make helpful comments on our drink contenders. The cocktail list was impressive and made deciding a challenge. Both of us loved our choices, and raved about the ice - of all things. The ice for the old-fashioned came out in a single large ball, which made the drink look very classy. We had a couple appetizers, and each was delicious! Our favorite was the beet crostini. However, I would highly recommend the gnocchi too. I also liked how the fries came with three different dipping sauces. I'm all about more choices for dipping. All around, a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back.
