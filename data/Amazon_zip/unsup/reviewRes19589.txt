Geat Sushi Great Style..Great waiter.. It's hard to find a combo like this I can't wait to go back.I think this will be my new fave place to go for my cravings ....If you like a drink with your Sushi then you will love this BYOB spot ...hey more fish for your dollar. they have a web site and you can droll before you go.. The waiter that we had was great and this is a large place for a sushi joint....try there special's if you like to try something new...
