Was here for Saturday night rehearsal dinner. The occasion of course was spectacular, but i'm rating the actual venue. What a wonderful place! The private room held about 95 of us. The food was served family style per table. We had appetizers, entrees and desserts. The salmon was so perfect! The ambiance was great, the service got in the way a little bit, but they were just trying to do their job. Plenty of staff to accommodate and plenty of food and drinks! Great time, great place!
