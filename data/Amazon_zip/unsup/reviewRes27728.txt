Here's the run down: 1. Cerviche 5 stars: If you have a hard time figuring out which one to get try the trio sampler, although my favorite was the albacore. Not as much of a fan of the red tuna (tasted like guacamole) or squid cerviche (too spicy) 2. Casa asada 5 stars: tender and flavorful. nothing else needs to be said about this dish. you need to try it. 3. Mole 5 stars: perfect mole. I love mole...so some bias here. 4. Guacomole 4 stars: had better although some claim it's the best here.
