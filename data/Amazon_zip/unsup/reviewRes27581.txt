Went here recently with friends and we figured out the key to getting a delicious pizza at pequods. If you're a meat lover, go nuts as their toppings are as good as anywhere. If you're a vegan just keep it basic. It seems like when you order more than 2 non meat toppings on a pizza it gets way too soggy because of all the water. We had a sausage, spinach, and garlic pan pizza here and it was excellent. The service is always good even when there busy. And it's clean, spacious, and has big screen tv's so you don't have to miss the game. Overall after being an afterthought when it comes to pizza options, Pequod's is officially in my regular pizza rotation again after a brief hiatus. Good to have you back guys!
