Beware Lincoln Square fans of Mexican cuisine. At best, Garcia's has an inconsistent hit or miss menu and at worse their head chef might be the Taco Bell dog. Don't let the pseudo upscale aesthetic fool you, this place likes to cut corners in the kitchen. I ordered an appetizer of guacamole and chips, but what was brought to my table could best be described as a mint toothpaste and sour cream spread: a sickly green color with a pasty, unnaturally smooth texture and bland taste. I questioned if avocados even factored into its creation. For an entree, I split an order of mixed (steak/chicken/shrimp) fajitas with my companion, a decision more important than I realized. The portions were huuuuge. Even with two of us, we couldn't hope to finish the plate. This may be somewhat of a plus, however quantity does not trump quality. The steak and chicken were fairly tough, though the shrimp was admittedly pretty tasty. Maybe a place like this could pass in a lacking suburb, but with so many other options at your fingertips in Chicago, I would highly recommend a pass on Seor Garcia.
