I tried it twice to be sure, the place has great burgers! If your considering them don't think twice other wise you'll miss some great food. Mac and cheese is great too but I prefer the hand cut fries. Onion rings aren't great unless you like the Frenches style, hard to pick up and dip in the ranch dressing. Stick to the burgers, fries, and Mac and cheese and you will never be disappointed! Get there early though seating is limited and fills up fast!
