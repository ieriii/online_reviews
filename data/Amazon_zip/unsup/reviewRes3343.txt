I've never actually set foot inside this place, but I've tried the Crisp BBQ chicken and let's just say... shut the front door. My boyfriend told me about this place, but we couldn't find the time to make it there for lunch, so he ended up picking up a half chicken for us to share and met me at my office. We sat outside in the courtyard since it was a nice summer day, however, it was incredibly windy. About halfway through the DELICIOUS chicken, a strong gust of wind completely picked up my plate (with the bbq chicken still on it) and blew the remnants everywhere. I ended up with bbq sauce on my dress, and had to face the humiliation of fetching strewn-about napkins all over the place... but even after all of this, I must say it was well worth it. Enjoy the chicken, but just watch out for the wind!
