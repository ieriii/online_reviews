I've been here a few times and I've enjoyed it. The service can be spotty and it's best to go with a Korean speaker, otherwise the service will be worse. Korean restaurants can be like this though so it's not surprising. My latest visit though was exceptionally okay, though. Yes, it was average on a spectacular level. The service was all right nothing special you have to flag someone down and basically demand things not ask. We ordered the joo moo luk which is rib eye and right away I could tell it was frozen, some of the cuts were still pretty solid. It cooked up all right, but still a little disappointing. I always appreciated that the place was open late and it was an interesting place to take my Valentine's date after a late show. I will always keep a special place in my heart for this place for a late night Korean food fix but not as good as it used to be.
