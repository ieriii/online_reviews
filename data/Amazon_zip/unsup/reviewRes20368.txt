A civilized pub experience for the suit and tie crowd. Solid beer selection and an interesting menu wins points. Other than drinks, we only tried the roasted beet starter, which was quite simply, lame. Still, I'd look forward to returning to try their other offerings, or at least for drinks as I did like the atmosphere very much.
