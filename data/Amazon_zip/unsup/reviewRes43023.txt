Pizzeria Maravilhosa! This is great pizza period. The Brazilian intrigue adds some interesting pizza variations that are worth trying. We had a pizza with Catupiry which is a delicious soft Brazilian cheese and another pizza with Heart of Palm. The Heart of Palm was excellent with the bacon and other ingredients.  I have read about the ingenuity of Sao Paulo pizzamakers in using ingredients and I am glad we now have this inspiration here in Chicago.  Of course, you can order the classic pizzas as well. I want to try the Brazilian Chicken some time soon.
