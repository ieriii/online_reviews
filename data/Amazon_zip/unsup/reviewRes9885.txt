You'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't love this place. It's really good. REALLY good. I love coming here to sit and have some local craft beer. They have great beer brewed on premise. And their pizza is outstanding. So of course, it's one of my favorite places in Bucktown/Wicker Park. The atmosphere is conducive to sitting at the bar and sampling some of the luscious beers which they rotate. I've never had a bad beer here yet. Crowds can be a problem though - evenings and weekends are especially tough to even get near the place. Too many people realize the same thing I do - this is a fun place. So, go at off peak time. Go for lunch or late afternoon. Cut out early from work, head to Piece. It's so worth it. Get some pizza. Drink some beer. You'll feel WAY better.
