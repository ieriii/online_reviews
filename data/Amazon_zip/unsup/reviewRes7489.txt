I agree with all of the happy sentiments about the food. It is wonderful. BUT...dear owners, you have a service problem. I have been a loyal and generous customer for 6 years. (My last meal, for 4 people, was over $400 because we ordered some fabulous wine.) The last few times I have been I have had to wait at least 20 minutes to be seated, even though I made a reservation many days in advance. For my last meal (10/08) I was embarrased that I had insisted to my very Italian father what a great place this was and he had to strongarm the server to get us a table. STOP OVERBOOKING or YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS!!!!
