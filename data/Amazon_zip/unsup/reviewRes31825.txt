Chicago Diner is vegetarian heaven. Meat free since '83 baby and it has a great outdoor space to lounge and eat in during the summer months. The service is always great and the seitan delicious! The sandwiches are all very unique, though my fav right now is the seitan gyros. Get it with a side salad or sweet potato fries. Both are satisfying. Note: It's best to take public transportation or your bike to this place as it is scant on parking places, though you can park after 6 in a small lot next to the building.
