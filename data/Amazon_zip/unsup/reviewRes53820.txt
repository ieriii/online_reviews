Listen, Doug seems like a really nice guy, BUT, well, in a word (or two) the food is greasy, greasy gross. And expensive. And the atmosphere, well, if you like lots of fat people stuffing french fries in their mouths while unsuccessfully attempting to stifle belches -- it's great! I'm sorry but this place is way over-rated. Not so HOT after all. One star.
