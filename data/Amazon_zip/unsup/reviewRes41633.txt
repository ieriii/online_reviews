I really enjoyed this place. 7 courses great portion size. Highlights are lobster octopus salad, fatty yellowtail sashimi. Everything else was above average. Wagyu beef was very lean, not my favorite nor was the beef tongue but ut was good to try. I really appreciated the portion size. They were more than single bites across the board. I've been to schwa and which it's a ten course meal. Portion sizes there were delicate for all ten. Dessert of cookies which unique were just mediocre.
