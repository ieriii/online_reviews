Yeah ok, it's a local chain. I like it. The ambiance is nothing special, but the food is quite nice. Every dish I have had here has been pretty good, though I don't have a specific recommendation. If I'm in the area and want Italian, I'll probably end up here. Long waits sometimes, but that's because it's good.
