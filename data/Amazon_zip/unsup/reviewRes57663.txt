We gave Nuevo Leon another chance after we were unimpressed the first time around. What a mistake. First of all, the floor of the restaurant was caked with dirt and grease. And the food was not good at all. I ordered the shrimp fajitas which were mostly peppers and onions and very little shrimp. The flavor was blah. I've had way better Mexican food at several other restaurants, such as El Milagro. If your looking to eat fresh, authentic Mexican food, don't go to Nuevo Leon.
