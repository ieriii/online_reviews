Came here on a Saturday night at around 5:30, which was perfect. We were lead to our table right after we got in. A few minutes later, more people arrived and before you knew it, every table in the room that we were seated in was taken! Anyways, I ordered the Ropa Vieja, which was shredded beef that came with rice and black beans while my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Islana. Both were very tasty. I also ordered a side of plantains, only to find out that the Ropa Vieja came with a few of them! But whatever, I cannot get enough of plantains, they are quite delicious! The drinks looked like pretty popular items, as they were on every table...but I can't speak of them since I don't drink! Cafe 28 is a cool place, I might return again!
