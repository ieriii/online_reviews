Go here for the duck!! Nothing else matters. It's really crowded and loud, and you'll almost certainly have to wait if you go on the weekend. Even after we were seated, we had to wait about 20 minutes for our food. The servers, while very efficient, are not particularly friendly. It can be hard to get their attention, and you will likely have to wait a few minutes to get your bill at the end. But none of that matters, because this is the very best duck I have ever had! Order the Beijing Duck Feast. It's not on the menu, but if you just ask for the duck dinner they'll know what you mean. This incredible meal comes with three courses. 1. Peking duck, freshly cut. It's served with steamed mantou buns that are RIDICULOUS good. So much better than the lame tortilla-things that most restaurants serve with Peking duck. This part is by far the best of the meal. Perfect crispy skin, savory duck, amazing plum sauce, perfection! 2. Duck soup, made from the bones of your duck. Be careful not to swallow the bones! But it is oh so good! Some of the best broth I have ever had. 3. Duck fried rice. This is the weak link of the trio, but it's still very tasty. More than enough to feed three people, and it only costs $37. I dare you to try and find a better deal in all of Chicago!! Sun Wah is the kind of restaurant that you are guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face, because the meal is fantastic!
