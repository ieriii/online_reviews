great atmosphere. great service. free valet!!!went on a saturday night around 7 PM. there were A LOT of people waiting.... the food was delicious, but not as out-of-this-world as i had anticipated. we didn't have the greatest seat in the house, but it wasn't terrible... just a bit crowded. i LOVE greek food, and will definitely be back, just probably not on a saturday night.
