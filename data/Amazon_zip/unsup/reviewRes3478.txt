I've had all kinds of Corean Wings from all over the globe, from BonChon in NYC to Donky Fried Chicken back in the day in Seoul, so I know my wings. And this place definitely delivers the goods. Over the holiday weekend, I ordered up the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ wings and tenders, along with a bowl of bi bim bop, which made for quite a delicious picnic at Montrose Harbor and plenty of leftovers. The owner, Jon Pazona, was friendly and knowledgeable about his menu, and even threw in two free orders of kimchi because it was my first time ordering there. A subtle ploy to get me to come back? Perhaps, but it worked. I'll definitely be making more trips as the summer heats up.
