Nana is a sweet little light bite, spot 'o life in Bridgeport. Organic, locally focused, this little place has got a mission, and it's doing it, and doing it well. Corner outpost on Halsted Street. Bright and sunny, clean crisp lines. Hardwood floors, white sturdy furniture, and hefty tabletops, ain't no wobblin' up in here, folks. Vibrant local art splashed across exposed brick walls. Little alcoves. An espresso/juicer bar. Quaint little touches dot the interior: doorknobs, fixtures, the little things. It's a happy place. AND, that was before I had coffee. Oh, the coffee: perfectly lovely lattes served in steaming hot mugs. Regular (bottomless) coffees were rich, and served with REAL cream. (No fake sugars, hello...organic, but there were some Stevia packets, good 'nuff). Ah, and what's this? Espresso froth art in the form of cute little leaves? Awwwwww, Nana...me likey. Food: My omelette was fresh and flavorful, perfectly portioned. The side of fruit was a bit skimpy, but still fresh. We ended up staying and working for several hours (our waitress was AWESOME, too) and so I also had the Southwest Chicken Salad, which was divine. Actually, better. Best salad I've had in quite awhile, perfectly dressed, perfectly hardy...and quite tasty. Local lettuce wins! I'm sure its batshit nuts on the weekends (with good reason), but its most def worth a stop in, or a voyage to Bridgeport. Charm, style and organically wisftul = great spot. notes: *no "traditional" sodas, but try your hand with some of their homemade ones. *only open til 3pm, so get there before closin'! *easy street parking.
