Very crowded, seems like everyone knew about this place but me, lively pizza joint. We managed to snag a seat on a busy Thursday night and had a large-and-in-charge thin crust with veggies and half meat (for the carnivore in this two-some). Part of me thought the crust needed a little umph with some salt but everything else was delicious! Super nice servers. Great drink selection and music choices. What a fun place for a large group too! Will be checking this pizza place out more than once!
