What about some Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes or Pig's Tails Braised in Balsamic.. Or maybe more in the mood for Pork Saltimbocca with Rainbow Swiss Chard? Seriously, by the time you've finished yourself off with Roasted Bone Marrow and Herbs you might as well die. Unbelievable! Make sure to fit in a Sicilian Iris {Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche}. This is some serious eating matter for a very reasonable price.
