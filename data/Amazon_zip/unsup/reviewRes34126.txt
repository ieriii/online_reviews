One of the best breakfasts / brunches in town for sure. We have been coming here for years now and found it consistently one of the finest eateries in the city. They are just good for everything breakfast or brunch. If you really want to treat yourself, have a large strawberry-orange juice and just enjoy it. It makes the day start wonderfully. We have found the service and especially the food quality here to be highest. They offer very healthy portions and you won't leave hungry, so be careful to ask the server about the size you are ordering so you don't overdo it. This is one of my favorite places for meeting business associates who come in from out of town and want to have a private meeting over breakfast. Not only can we talk, but the food blows everyone away. I find my associates wanting to meet here when they come in from out of town and they don't even have anything to talk about - they just enjoy the p[lace that much. On weekend days after 9:30AM, you will find that you will definitely have to wait to be served since there are so many younger people in the neighborhood who like to brunch. However, they vote with their feet and the traffic here is huge, deservedly so. I just wish they had a place in the West Loop, but I don't mind traveling over to the South Loop for the occasional brunch to eat here. This is truly a wonderful food place and good for everyone. When it is cold outside in the winter, they have a larger area now in which to wait in the warmth which I find makes a difference on those cold Chicago Winter mornings.
