I finally went to Nana and much to my dismay, it was just okay.  Our waitress was too talkative and the kitchen didn't make my breakfast correctly. The servings were small for the price.  However, the ingredients were fresh as promised and the place is nice and clean. I live in the neighborhood and won't be going back too soon.
