This is one of the most frequented restaurants I go to in Chicago. Mainly in the beginning because it was walking distance to my apartment, but more so now that I've moved a bit further away because it's the one place that I'm guaranteed to have a good time and a great meal. The ambiance of this place is amazing. Beautifully decorated and lit. The servers, while a bit preoccupied and slow when it's busy, are always humorous and gracious. And I can honestly say that them being slow and preoccupied has never stuck our or been an issue because of how all the other aspects of this place are a 10. Dishes I highly recommend: chicken pot pie, shepherds pie, roast chicken, burgers, and their spinach artichoke omelette. However, I've never had a bad meal there.
