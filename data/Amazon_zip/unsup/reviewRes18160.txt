Wow! I really don't know why I will ever go to another Italian restaurant! This place is so cute and comfortable. It smells amazing once you open the door. The staff is so friendly and great at suggestions. We enjoyed some of the best calamari, eggplant and brushetta... and that was just the beginning. It was the best gnocchi I've ever had - absolutely amazing. Its BYOB and our bill was only $30 each in the end and we all left beyond stuffed. I cannot wait to go back! ***** I just went again on Friday and have to add that the salmon is ahhhhhmazing and I do not like salmon. I couldn't get enough of this delicious fish. And again, the gnocchi was shockingly delicious yet again. I would recommend doing what we continue to do and order a few appetizers and main dishes to share with one another! Fantastic restaurant!
