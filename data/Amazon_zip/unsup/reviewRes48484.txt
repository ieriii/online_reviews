I had such high expectations for the brunch, and was very under-whelmed. I did not think it was possible to over cook eggs the way they did. The red wine poached eggs were soooo over-cooked it was funny..and the over-easy eggs on the duck confit hash would not even run they were cooked so long. I understand they r busy, and have national recognition, but come on guys..Eggs are b'fast 101!!
