Made it to Sprout opening week and I'm so glad I did. Typically a bad time to check out a new restaurant. I was expecting there to be some misses here and there... and to my surprise there was not a single mistep. Well done Dale and Sara!! Some of the delectables my guests and I enjoyed included such apps as the scallop, rabbit pierogi and, melt in your mouth, foie gras. Our entrees blew us out of the water. We enjoyed the succulant short rib, perfectly prepared sturgeon and duck that got me amped up for the holidays with its seasonal spices. Desserts were refreshing and light and I was thankful for my night was not over and I hate that overly stuffed feeling... Service was right on!! Knowledgeable, experienced, informative, attentive and engaging. As a service professional I appreciate this almost equal to what is coming out of the kitchen. Thanks Jerimiah! I felt the specialty cocktails were innovative but a touch heavy on the agave nectar making them a little too sweet for me... All in all a fabulous dining experience!! Check it out!!
