We stumbled into Demera after our favorite, Queen of Sheba (with it's terribly erratic hours) was randomly closed (on a Friday night, no less!) Alas, I left my BYO booze in the back seat as we trekked through the snow to non-byo friendly Demera. Demera, from the moment we walked it, was obviously an upgrade, with more upscale decor and the appropriate track lighting. I'll ditto what people were saying on the wait- it was probably about 30 minutes before we were attended to and even longer before we got our food. Food-wise, we had a lentil samosa-like appetizer that was great. Entree-wise, the food was about twice as expensive as Sheba, although delicious. My only gripe was that the food lacked some of that spicy "kick" that I've had at other ethiopian joints. In sum, the food was solid and satified my craving for ethiopian, but slow service and above average prices might make you want to think about some of the other joints further north on Broadway.
