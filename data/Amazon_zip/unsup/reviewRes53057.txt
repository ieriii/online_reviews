Great setting, fast employees, Open kitchen, fantastic patio. The food was perfect and had a great variety for all different options - I do not eat meat and I was surprised at the vegetarian options!! Still had many meaty feeling options without the meat - nice. The vegetable empanadas were to die for. I had the garlic drizzled plantains, shrimp, veggie, and spinach - the veggie ones were the best, I got some to go :) I took a million pictures, I will post! Great atmosphere :) We had a rather large party, they forgot some of the order but it happens! Also, it is a great place for small parties, it has a really great atmosphere in terms of seating, the back garden patio is a really nice place to sit and have some drinks. BYOB, we had several bottles of bacardi and they provide the mixer. The white rice is very yummy and butteryish? It is an inexpensive option - must try !
