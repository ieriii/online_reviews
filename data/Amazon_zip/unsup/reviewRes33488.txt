I've always had a nice time at the numerous Francesca's locations, but we had a really great experience at the original location on Clark and just had to share. Our server was friendly and knew not only the menu but the history of the restaurant well, so we had a great time chatting with her. The food was great as usual, and I love that their menu changes often, so you can try something new each time should you want to. Also appreciate that they're open to customization of their dishes upon request. Their appetizers are some of my favorite - we had their fabulous sauteed calamari and brushcetta, then decided on a number of great pasta and seafood dishes and shared around. Great for a romantic dinner or a big group - looking forward to dining in their outdoor space this summer!
