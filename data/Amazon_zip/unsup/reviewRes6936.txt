I honestly loved everything about Sapori Trattoria! From the moment we walked in, the servers were SO friendly. I had bought a LivingSocial deal yesterday, and then called the restaurant to use it that same day, and they were very accommodating. When the actual voucher wasn't emailed to me in time, I just brought in my confirmation email, and they were so nice about it! The avocado appetizer was amazing. I'm still thinking about it. I had the lobster ravioli and it was divine. I will definitely be back! Cute little Italian place with free parking Sunday-Thursday... what more could you want?
