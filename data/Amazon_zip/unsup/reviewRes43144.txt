I think Art of Pizza has the best deep dish around. I love the buttery crust and herby sauce. They also have good sub sandwiches. However, they get knocked down a star because the pizza sausage is really disappointing, its like the kind that comes on a Domino's pizza, and the pepperoni is sliced too thin. The kind of money this place rakes in, you'd think they'd spring for the good stuff. Also, their thin crust is joke. I think cardboard would taste better. But, I'm not mad at 'em.
