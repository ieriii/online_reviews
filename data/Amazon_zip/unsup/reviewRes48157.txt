Went here for brunch as part of Grubwithus and I have to say it was downright delish. I love bacon and the bacon they served was the best I've ever had. I was sad that I only got one piece. The honey butter on the waffle was so mouthwateringly (not a word, I know) amazing that I would buy a vat of it and put it on everything I eat. The pork belly was super tender, the pumpkin cream donut was heavenly, the red wine poached egg hit the spot, and oh yeah, the omelette was fab. Maybe one day I'll get to try dinner, but for now I can say brunch was the bee's knees. The one star off was because it was super loud in there. I felt like I had to almost shout to be heard.
