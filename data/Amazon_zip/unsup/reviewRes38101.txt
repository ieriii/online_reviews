Hopleaf is easily my favorite bar in Chicago. Best belgian beer selection in the City besides Map Room, and the wood work in the front bar area is beautiful. Beer prices are reasonable for the quality and the bartenders know what they are talking about if they have time to talk.  I kind of miss the way it was before they expanded and started serving food. It was still always busy even as just a neighborhood bar, but it just felt easier to relax and get a drink pre-expansion. Everything changes, though. And to be fair, the food is fantastic and often worth the wait. Go there during the week if you don't like to wait. Or better yet, go there and just plan on relaxing and having a few fantastic beers while you wait an hour or so for your table. According to the reviews below the bar was featured on Check Please and the crowds are even larger know, which I find hard to believe because it was NEVER easy to get a table at this place thursday through saturday nights.
