Longman & Eagle is one of the best gastropub-restaurant experiences I've had in Chicago since I moved here four months ago. Pros: -The atmosphere is warm, romantic and comfortable. It's hip but not unwelcoming. -The staff is wonderful. Really. Everybody that's ever waited on my table has been friendly and knowledgable. -The bone marrow, the skirt steak and and the foie gras over toasted funnel cake are my favorites. I also love the cocktail menu. Although, I don't recommend the Harvest Sidecar--it had a strange aftertaste. I couldn't finish it. -The dessert is worth making room for. What I ordered was unusual, but an interesting experience overall. I recommend ordering something light instead of the heavy, chocolate desserts. I made that mistake the first time I went, and I thought I was going to pass out from all of the richness. Cons: -Arrive before 7PM because the wait can be brutal. Especially on the weekends. Arrive at 5:30! -The tables/seating arrangements are a little too close together. Prepare to overhear conversations. A-
