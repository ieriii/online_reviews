I planned the first bar of a party here. When I first called about the party, I spoke directly with the owner and he was more than happy to help me throw the party I wanted for my friend. I came in once before the event to chat with him and the manager about the day, and they were both very friendly and welcoming and I knew that this bar was the perfect place.The day of the event, our server was great and around often, and the owner came over a few times to make sure we were having a good time. We had left a little earlier than planned, but only because my friend wanted to get up and dance (and as fun as this bar was otherwise, it wasn't the place for a dance floor).In planning the event for my friend, I called/emailed a bunch of different bars to see what their deals were, see what type of arrangement they could set up for us, etc etc. Lockdown was by far the best one I have ever worked with. They were so nice and the actual party was a really fun time too. They really catered to our party the ENTIRE time we were there, and we all arrived at the next bar still talking about how much fun we had there : )
