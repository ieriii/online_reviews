We ventured to q because of a Facebook mama's recommendation, and went on Valentines Day with an 11-month old. I was very, very hesitant to do so. But the evening was wonderful (when I say evening I'm somewhat exaggerating because we had a 4:45pm reservation!). The staff made us feel very welcome and at ease when we walked through the door, while I was totally expecting a "why did they bring a baby, ugh, annoying". They took our coats, seated us quickly, and brought out a high chair and children's menu without asking. I like the decor and the vibe - especially the large wall art of the truck driving down the road. The complimentary appetizers of chips/pickles also made a great start to the night. Our waiter was very friendly, made many good recommendations throughout the night, and had an easy way about him. Our food came quite quickly (they brought our daughter's out in about 3 minutes much to my delight, even before our food which was smart on their part) and we enjoyed our meal and cocktails very much. I would definitely like to come sans kids, and while there weren't any other kids here (I wouldn't expect it on v-day) I wouldn't hesitate to bring our daughter back. The prices were good for what we were served, and we even brought home some leftovers which I just polished off and tasted amazing the 2nd time around! We shared a rack of ribs, mashed potatoes, pulled pork/chicken dish, and a wonderful salad with smoked tomatoes (awesome). I only wish we would have made room for dessert. {As a disclaimer, I think its important to dine out with kids so they get accustomed to how they should behave at a young age, and we are always prepared to make a quick exit if things take a turn for the worse.}
