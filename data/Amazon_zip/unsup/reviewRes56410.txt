So my friends and I have been talking about me getting on Yelp for sometime now. I LOVE going out to eat and have tried many places especially in chicago, but i have delayed it until i went to Simply it! Even after going to knwon place here like Spiaggia, Geja, or Frontera I think Simply It was one of the best dining experience i have had. We called in an made reservation on a saturday night, although we were all a bit late the owner was wonderful about it. This place is BYOB and which i think is one of the best things about places, it makes the dining experience much more affordable and you can really indulge on the food. The appetizer were a great start i would reccomen tha avocoda wontons absolutuly delicious. The entries that are avalibe were so hard to chose from there were too many that sounded so great and its rare to come to a place where you want 10 things at the same time. I would reccomend the pinapple calamari or the beef cocununt which come out inside a pineapple and coconut. At the end ot the night they finish off with watermelon nd cherries. The prefect light dessert. We went seven of us brought 3 bottles of win 12 pack order appetizer and meals are for 90$ it doenst get much better than that. And the location is great you can walk out after dinner and hit many of the local bars.
