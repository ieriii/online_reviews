Nana's was good before they opened up for dinners. The $9 burgers earlier this year are now a whopping $14 for the SAME thing. It's good food, but these prices are almost criminal, especially for Bridgeport. This place used to be pretty packed for lunch, now it's sparse for lunch and dinners. Is it too much to ask for a reasonably priced and healthy place in Bridgeport?
