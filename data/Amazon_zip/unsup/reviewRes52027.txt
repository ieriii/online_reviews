A friend told us to try here when we went to Chicago for Labor Day 2011. We were kind of freaked out by the length of the line outside but after waiting a few minutes we were taken in as we were a group of 4 and pretty much all other groups were bigger. Went upstairs to order and were told there would be a long wait, about an hour. Kids loved the writing all over the walls and chairs and added their own mark. Pizza we got was amazing. Never had anything like it before. My OH says it is the best pizza he has ever had. While we were waiting for our pizza my OH had to go and move our car before the parking ran out. He had time to move it to a new spot and run back and still get to the table to have some pizza. We've tried the frozen pizza you can get from the grocery store and it is good but it's not the same.
