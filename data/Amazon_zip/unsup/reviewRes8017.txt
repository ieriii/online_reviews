Service: A+ Food: A+++ Value: A+ I've been here a few times now and have never been disappointed. I once came in at noon for lunch. They were suppose to stop serving lunch at 2PM, but stayed open just for me because I have a tendency to eat for 2-3 hours when I go to these types of restaurants. Thank you! Also, go during lunch. Cheaper and typically not as busy.
