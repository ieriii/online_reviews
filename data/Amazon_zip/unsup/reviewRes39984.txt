i'm mixed. I went with my Korean friends, (i'm not Korean), and didn't have anything yay or nay though all I had was the spicy beef soup. I returned today with my 3 year old son because I was in the area, and it wasn't what i expected. I think I may have to be Korean because I felt dismissed as opposed to the Korean speaking customers. Service was super slow despite the fact that there were not many customers. I had to get their attention to order. After what seemed like an eternity, my soup and Korean pancakes arrived. Then again, I had to get their attention to let them know I needed to take the leftovers home. Only to find my server returning to tend to another Korean table and chit chat than with my boxes. YOu would think that would be an indicator that I was ready to leave, but yet again I needed to let them know I needed my check. At this point, my son was restless and was starting to kick under the tables which my server snapped at him and told him not to do that. Then did she hurriedly tend to me and pretty much threw the check at me. I packaged up my leftovers and left without as much as "Have a nice day!" from them, despite the fact that I heard them tell all the other patrons before me. So note, if you have a young child, DO NOT take them there. Service is way too slow to accommodate. And to be honest, their bulgoki didn't taste any better than what you can buy packaged at the Korean markets. And their soup fell behind Joong Boo Market's little hole in the wall..
