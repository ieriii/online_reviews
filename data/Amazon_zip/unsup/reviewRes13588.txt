Unfortunately recent, unnecessary staff related events are making me downgrade my review. As is often the case, I was quite happy and put out a "4-star but please..." review, and hoped my few qualms would be addressed. They weren't, and my recent issues, revolved around staffing, add up to a much less enjoyable experience.  While some of the staff are excellent, a couple of them have made me want to make my own sandwich and enjoy some delicious bottled beer at home, for a fraction of the cost. Take the guy at the host stand. I came into a mostly empty restaurant, planning to meet a friend. I asked if he had seated a single woman and he responded along the lines of "(sigh) we only seat full parties (sigh)" with the expressed tone of "I really need to get back to my important text messaging." That's all the said; if that's the policy -- fine. It's tone and delivery, and lack of follow up. How about "check at the bar or at the waiting corral -- we only seat full parties [even when the restaurant is half empty]. If you don't see her grab a seat and I'll let you know when she arrives. What's her name?" The server was exceedingly awful this time too (hence I feel the need to update). She took our initial order, dropped off the food and drinks, and *never* came back. I would have loved another beer. The food was fine, but you really need to check in, because that's you job. What really lit my fuse was that we literally sat there with no food and no drinks for FIFTEEN minutes without her showing up, when all we wanted to do was LEAVE. She visited the tables on either side of us on several occasions, always with her back to us, never making eye contact, never checking in. Excellent beer and solid food are important, but if the staff is this incompetent, it's going to take me a long time to forget enough to come back. It's not rocket science - it's being friendly and mildly aware of the world around you.
