This is THE place in Chicago for premium imported beer. I found my new favorite beer, Delirium Tremens, at the Hopleaf. The beer selection is vast to say the least and the food is fresh and delicious. The pulled pork sandwich is probably the best I've ever had and coming from an Iowa girl, that is saying something! Order the frites as a side and you won't be disappointed. This is one of the few restaurants that I let the servers talk me into dessert... the apple fritters are heavenly. Come for the beer and stay for the food!
