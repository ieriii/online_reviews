I went to artopolis with my girl friend for some coffee and desserts. First of all, our server was too busy doing whatever he was doing. We had to order from a different server because he was missing for 10-15minutes. But the desserts and the coffe was excellent. Desserts were sweet enough to satisfy our late night sugar cravings, but not too sweet. Although we didn't like our server, we love this place. Great atmosphere and food.
