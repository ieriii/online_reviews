Finally dined here on Friday night after being canceled on twice beforehand. I was expecting an amazing experience with amazing food and to be honest, I didn't think it was all that great. Spend your money where the service matches the prices. Out of all the courses we tried, I would say 3 were pretty darn good. Everything else was just ok, I was not completely wowed. I think there is too much hype about Schwa, where people think it is super cool to go somewhere trendy, with no dresscode, blaring rap music and a teeny bathroom thru the kitchen. It's not that I don't understand it, I just don't appreciate like most of the reviewers.
