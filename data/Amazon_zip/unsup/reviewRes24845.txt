So tonight a friend and I went to Irazu. The weather was looking ominous so there wasn't much of a wait (which she had talked about). First impression, LOUD, the restaurant is buzzing with salsa music and scores of conversations. I ordered Bistec, which is steak served with stewed tomatoes . onions . green peppers, rice, black beans and finally boiled tostones. Very generous serving and was delicious I washed it down with a horchata, which was a little on the sweet side. Our waiter was attentive but also very busy, still, he did a very adequate job. Definitely worth a visit, or two.
