Checked them out a couple of weeks ago.Food was good and the beer selection was also above average.The decor was really nice as well.The downside:Long wait for tables and open seating in the bar area, so everyone is circling the table like vultures.The bar tables are so close together thet you feel like a jerk squeezing between the table when you get up to use the bathroom.Would go back though!!
