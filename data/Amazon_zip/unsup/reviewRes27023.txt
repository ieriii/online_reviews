CEVICHE!!!!!! There, let this review require no verbal foreplay. (Wordplay?) Get it. The ceviche trio, that is. Fresh, succulent ... my mouth is watering just thinking about this stuff. I also had the tortilla soup, my friend had the pork entree (the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were sweet potatoes somehow INFUSED WITH BACON). We also had the champagne margaritas, which is exactly as dangerous as it sounds. Imagine the bubbles of champagne mixed in deadly combination with the punch of tequila. OK I must stop writing now, I am drooling too much to look normal at work.
