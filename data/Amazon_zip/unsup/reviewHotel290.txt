For the price, this place gets five stars! I was blown away by the quality of this hotel and would easily stay here again. PROS -The size of the room was enormous. Giant queen bed, great desk (fantastic, because I had a ton of work to do), enormous closet, bathroom, fully stocked kitchenette with stove, sink, dishes, pans, even a colander, fridge and freezer. Where else can you find that? -The bathtub had a whirlpool!!!! There was also a hairdryer and working heater in the bathroom. I experienced no problems with having tons of hot water for baths and showers. -Two free continental breakfasts. They weren't amazing, but they weren't Costco danishes either. Ham, two eggs, toast, hash browns and coffee. -FREE WIRELESS! And the wireless customer service was great. -Fantastic service all around. They helped me when I lost my key card, remembered me when I came back in and opened the security door for me without my having to swipe my card, gave me a wine bottle opener, let me chill in the lobby, use the internet and do work for two hours after my checkout and were just very helpful and polite. -Quiet room. I had to record several interviews out of my room and each time the audio came out great. CONS -The shampoo and conditioner wasn't great (but then again, is it ever?) A light burned out and so the room wasn't well lit (but I didn't call down to notify them, which is just my laziness.) I also can't judge how good the gym or sundeck were because I was too busy the whole time.
