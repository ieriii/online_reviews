So sad, Sunda. Went in yesterday with a girlfriend for some cocktails and rolls. The place was dead. We found a spot at the bar where we were more or less ignored by the snarky bartender for most of the time there. The saving grace was the poor guy getting trained by this woman. He was actually attentive to our needs: wanting to order food & drinks at a restaurant. Cocktails were good, I'll give 'em that much. But things turned for the worst when my friend found a hair in her Dragon Roll. To add insult to injury, the manager comes over with a piece garnish and proceeds to argue that the hair "could not have been a hair because the sushi chef is bald. Are you sure it wasn't this piece of garnish?" Lady, I know what hair looks like! At least they comped the meal, but my tummy was a bit upset afterwards. I guess hair doesn't digest well.
