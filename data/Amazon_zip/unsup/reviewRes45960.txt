Om nom nom nom I liked almost everything I ate here! The chicken flautas were oh so yummy. The caesar salad was good, the dressing was just spicy and tangy enough. The berry fizz is a great option for a non-alcoholic fun drink. The BBQ salmon was a bit weird for me, I'm not really a fan of BBQ sauce on fish, but the fish was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were so good it was hard to stop eating them once I hit full capacity. We did not spring for one of the fresh oven baked goodies, instead option for the creme brle duo. Oh Wow! The vanilla creme brle was light fluffy and perfect, while the chocolate creme brle was dark, intense, and very very rich!
