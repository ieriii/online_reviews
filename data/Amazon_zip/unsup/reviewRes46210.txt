Cheesecake factory on genetically modified steroids. It overlooks the street and if you have a corner seat you can look down on Michigan avenue.  The layout is wonderful for those that like bright lights and tons of white and gold decor. If I was under 21 and wanted to impress my girlfriend by taking her downtown, I'd probably bring her here for dinner. That's as long as I worked all year and had enough money to cover the bill. It's freakin' expensive, more than Cheesecake factory. Two 20 oz Stella's, an Amstel lite bottle and a diet coke, $26.20. That was our bill for waiting at the bar, fifteen minutes later our seats were ready, surprising for a bustling Saturday evening. (I used the under 21 analogy, because there were a few suburban kids that brought their dates there and were excited at how much their ladies' loved the place.) The menu is insane, too many options yelling at you. Just like Cheesecake factory, the meals were huge. It was a mistake to have dinner here before heading out on the town. After wards I was too full to move, literally. I got three blocks and just sat the rest of the time at Pippin's. I had the Carolina sweet BBQ rib sandwich. It was awesome. I was really hungry at the time, so, you know.  One strange thing, the floors were very slippery, maybe just waxed? How strange that they'd be that slippery, a law suit waiting to happen.  Slippery like someone had spilled corn oil all over the place, our shoes were greasy even after leaving the restaurant.
