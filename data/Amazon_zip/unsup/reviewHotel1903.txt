What's up with the average 3 stars? Guess they weren't in Suite 1209 -1210 After a hell day of travel, miss connection due to Delta errors, cold front and rain... I was soooo elated to check in!! The lobby was extremely inviting with tall white tufted serpentine couches, chess tables, coffee table books, and bar. We just didn't have time for it. Our main purpose was to see as many shows at Lollapalooza as possible.  Whatcha get: King size bed Two bathrooms, two plasma screens, comfy couch, streamline sound system that we turned up late night with out a peep from our neighboring guest's complaint. Bliss products Lots of closets Over-sized lamps and a view that was on the sad side (but who cares we were out enjoying the streets of Chi Town) Concierge was friendly and didn't mind answering questions like: where to buy an cheap umbrella (which we brought at Walgreens -Totes brand did the job fine), how to get to the metro, is it worth taking the architectural tour etc  Maid service fine. All-in-all great clean, peaceful stay and won't hesitate to visit again.
