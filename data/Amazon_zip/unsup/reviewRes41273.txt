Had a fabulous time at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. The Fresh Berry Martini is to die for. The crabtini lived up to all expectations. For sides, the sweet potato casserole & creamed spinach did the trick. The filets were cooked near perfectly for the bf and me. Our waitress was the epitome of great service. Obviously expect to drop a pretty penny while here, but a great place to special events and occasions!
