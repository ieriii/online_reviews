Get there early, because this place fills up fast. It has a beautiful, dark, intimate atmosphere that we loved. When we were seated my wife said "I don't like gin. Make me like gin." and our server relished this challenge. And when we left, my wife liked gin. A minor miracle. We will probably visit the Violet Hour on every trip we take to Chicago for the foreseeable future.
