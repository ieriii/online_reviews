I went here with a friend who was a bit hesitant going to a fusion restaurant, since we both have access to a plethora of quality sushi and Thai joints. The restaurant is nicely laid out with some intriguing art, a perfect place to take a date. On the same note, the place leans toward the pricey end, so don't expect cheap eats here. We shared a Monte Carlo dish, which was pretty fantastic looking, and about equal tasting. My friend ordered additional regular maki rolls which met with approval, and I ordered the spicy seawood udon dish, which really hit the spot. I'm not giving it a perfect five only because the sum of its two cuisines is not greater than them separated. The prices also pushes it closer to a 4, but it's certainly not the deciding factor.
