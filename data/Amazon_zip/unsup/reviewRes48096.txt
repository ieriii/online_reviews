Went here with friends for our pre-meal appetizers and drinks. Beer selections was great and quite crafty.  Decor and seating was comfortable and very casual yet modern feeling. Love the super large pig photos! Server was into his job and took the time to explain everything we asked about.  We had the Chartruise (spelled wrong) plate that included samples of a pork pie, salami, veal rillette, an epic sausage, head cheese, pickles, mustards etc.  It was really great......even the head cheese! So meaty good. Oysters were tasty along with sauted fresh spring Ramps. Both were light and refreshing reminding me spring is here. Ham sampler.......well ham all three types was great. Sliced thin and melt in your mouth goodness. It was easy to taste the differences in all three. Disappointed in the small portion but quality of the ham wasnt' lacking. Prices and food quality are high but beers are surprisingly affordable and reasonably priced. Portions are small but very rich. The best way to describe the food is peasant food turned elegant and attrative to the masses. Completed with great cooking techniques For me it was a way to explore what Bourdain calls the "Nasty Bits" that are often tasty and overlooked but Americans who are spoiled by our unending selections to prime cuts of meat.  It was enlightening for my palate to eat here.  I only wish I'd of tried more.
