Took my girlfriend for her birthday because she heard good things about the place and was excited about her first fondue experience. It seemed a little bit overrated for the price and not to mention I had made reservations a month in advance requesting a booth and one was not available for us. Everything was standard fondue fare. My girlfriend particularly enjoyed the meat but not being a veggie person found the choice of vegetables lacking.Dessert was fantastic as well as our waitress was very nice and attentive. Still a great place for somebody who never been to a fondue place with a pretty nice atmosphere. It is a nice place for a first date but be warned you will smell of oil by the end of the night.
