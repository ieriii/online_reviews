Not bad... I grew up eating NY style pizza and I feel that the Chicago deep dish pizza is a different category on it's own. For me, it was more like I was eating a pie stuffed with cheese and toppings. But it is good. The deep dish pizza with sausage, green pepper, onions is a good selection. The ingredients come together nicely. Not too much meat and the pepper/onions bring out the flavor of the sauce. The best deep dish pizza joint in Chicago? I don't think so. But The Art of Pizza is definitely worth a try.
