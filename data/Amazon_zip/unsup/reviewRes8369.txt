Do you know what makes a really good pizza? Crust. Spacca Napoli has really good pizza because their crust might just be the best in Chicago. Light, supple, chewy and airy with a smoky flavor from their brick ovens. The toppings are, of course, good. The ambience was okay. But the crust? The crust was amazing.
