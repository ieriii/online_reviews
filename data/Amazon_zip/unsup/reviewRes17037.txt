I stopped in for dinner with three friends last night to use my Groupon, and am bumping India House up a few notches. We had no issues getting in around 7pm on a Wednesday. The service was good, we had about three different people taking care of us. Our main server was weirded out that we all ordered some variation of makhani, but that's more our problem than his. The makhani was great, as usual. We ran into the issues with having to order rice separately again, but it was less upsetting since we knew it going in this time. The naan was good, and cut into easily sharable pieces. We were also given (gratis?) naan triangles and some makhani dipping sauce upon being seated, which was great since we were all starving. The veggie pakoras were good, too, but I can't tell if it's just because I dipped mine in the makhani sauce. That sauce is the cure for all that ails you, or at least the cure to bland Indian food. I also liked that the pakoras came with four side sauces. One of the them was super vinegary, like eating a pickle. Not bad, just odd. I loved my mango lassi, but thought it should have been double the size for $4 and change. It was only about 12 oz. Another odd thing is that one of my companions ordered her makhani hot, and while there was a discernible difference in the taste of her sauce, there wasn't a lot of heat to it. Maybe you have to really specify that you want it non-Midwest spicy to get the good stuff. We burned through the Groupon pretty fast, even with it being worth $50 instead of $40 (since we used it during the week). It ended up being enough to cover half the bill, which left us paying $25 per couple on top of the discount. So not a cheap meal by any means, but in line with what I have come to expect for Indian food downtown.
