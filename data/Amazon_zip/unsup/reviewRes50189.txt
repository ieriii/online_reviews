Yummiest lunch at Big Jones today! Chicken salad to die for. . .extremely time consuming to make I'm sure as well as delicious. Generous portion of succulent raspberries as well as other fruit, corn muffins, etc. Heavenly ginger iced tea. And Aaron, the waiter was helpful as well as friendly. So nice! Thank you!
