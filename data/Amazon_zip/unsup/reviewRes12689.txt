I believe there is no point in making a big review for this one, you wanna know why? BEST BRAZILIAN STEAK HOUSE IN CHICAGO. If you are looking for various cuts of meat, cheese filled bread rolls, amazing mashed potatoes, and good service then go here. The salad bar is also excellent, with various types of cheeses and greens. A cool + is the wine rack that stands 2 stories high with a woman dangling from a circus cable doing flips while grabbing your choice of wine.
