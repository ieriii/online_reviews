All around a great place for dining with family/friends in town. The menu is large, and the drinks are exceptional. I had a great french martini. Items that are good: surf n surf (that is correct), filet mignon, whitefish, and lobster. There is live jazz in a different room and another attached bar. You feel like you are in a cruise ship when you are inside!
