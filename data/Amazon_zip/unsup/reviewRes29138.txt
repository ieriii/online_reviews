a few weeks ago, my bf and i stopped outside the pasta bowl to check out the menu. "best italian in chicago!" a guy says to us on his way in. bahhhhh. "best italian in chicago?!" are you kidding??? we both laughed. yeah right. doubtful, we thought. well, pasta bowl... here i am, a believer. it's almost hard to accept, but this little, hole-in-the-wall, casual restaurant is really that good. if it's not the best italian in chicago, it's pretty damn close. we've been a few times now, and every experience has been great. there's always a daily special, which always sounds tasty and sometimes sells out. the menu has a lot to offer - and the prices are CHEAP, especially for what you get (hefty portions at high quality.) i love the farfalle pollo, but i really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. service is always on par too. now, some of you might not believe this, but quality and taste-wise, i think the pasta bowl is on the same level as.... mia francesca's. yes. i said it. and you might not believe me. but there are really only two differences between the two of them. 1. the prices. 2. the atmosphere. at mia's you're in a fine dining atmosphere. at the bowl, you're in a neighbor's welcoming kitchen. i love sitting at the bar, watching the pasta master at work. how he's able to cook 15 separate pasta dishes at once, i'll never know. yes, that's right. each dish is made to order. it's not out of some tub of pasta and thrown on a plate. home cooked and carefully plated, just for you. impressive if you ask me. "best italian in chicago." whatever kool-aid the pasta bowl is serving, i'm drinkin' it.
