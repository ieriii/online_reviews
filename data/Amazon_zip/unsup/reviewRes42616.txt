The ability to order deep dish slices of Pizza is fantastic. The pizza was delectable, however, I wish I would have ordered an entire pie because my slice was not so fresh. Aside from that, Art of Pizza got it right! I had a slice of cheese deep dish pizza. The sauce was layered on top of the cheese juuuuuust right! It wasn't too saucy, or too cheesy. That slice consisted of the perfect ingredient proportions. When I got to the crust, I knew this pizza was extraordinary. Be sure to get it hot 'N fresh! You haven't seen the last of me, Art of Pizza! I'll be back.
