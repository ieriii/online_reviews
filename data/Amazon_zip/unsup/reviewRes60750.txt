The owner of this place is pretty awesome and will sit down and talk with you. They have excellent food and their wait staff is on the ball. Some of the girls who work behind the bar are a bit snotty. Would give this place 5 stars on the food alone but due to the amount of meatheads and such that hang out at this place, its not somewhere I ever want to sit and eat at. Nine times out of ten I get my great food to go and always tip the waitresses that get it ready for me.
