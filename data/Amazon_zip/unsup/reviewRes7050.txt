So my friends wanted to come here but I gave up meat for lent. So I checked out the menu and found a few things I could eat. First, they start you off with bbq chips and pickles, nice touch. For my meal I had the hominy, corn, and black bean salad and the jalapeno corn bread. It was DELICOUS! For some reason I expected the salad to be warm, but it comes out cold, nbd. And it was a large enough portion that I could bring it home for the next night. The salad and corn bread warmed up, equally delicious. And my friends both got the ribs and loved it. I will definitely be back...maybe tonight. And maybe I'll save room for dessert this time....
