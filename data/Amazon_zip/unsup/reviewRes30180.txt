A true neighborhood gem. Old space, but not obsolete or outdated. Maybe the only place in the Gold Coast that feels like you're in the Gold Coast. Excellent food. Not boring food like some neighboord dives. That is, 3rd Coast gives you the impression that they are trying to serve you good food, not hold on to old recipes that have lost their magic. Great beer and wine list as well.
