I have been a loyal fan of Coast for years because the sushi is so delicious but the last two times I have gone there the service especially at the front desk has been awful. They told me i was number 1 on the reservations list and then called me 3 hours after my desired time - three hours! Then they told us we did not need reservations for a 6 pm dining time. We get there at 6 pm and they said its a 90 minute wait. Its as if they want to fail. The sushi is not worth the wait and the person who seats you should realize they are working in a restaurant and they are not the Queen of England. Run, don't walk away from this too trendy for its own good.
