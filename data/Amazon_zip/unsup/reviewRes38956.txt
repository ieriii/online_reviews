I was here for Brunch the other day. The service was great (Brendan was perfect), the meal was overall pretty awesome (minus the cheese grits, skip them). The Longman Manhattan was wonderful (even at brunch). Generally, I was a happy clam. Biggest gripe was that the host at the front screwed up, and sat us inside after about a 30 min wait (which was supposed to be 10 min) for an outside table, saying it would be another hour to sit outside. The lack of communication at the front desk amongst the hosts, as well as the communication to us from the frontdesk really rubbed me the wrong way. However, the rest of the experience was superb, and I look forward to going back for dinner sometime.
