Wow, what a great meal! Four of us ordered 8 items and it was more than enough food for all of us. We ordered: Pork fried almonds: A little soggy, but salty and very yummy. One of the night's favorites. Braised baby artichokes: Good for a veggie option. Pig's ear with crispy kale and egg: THIS? is good. scary good. French fries of the sea: Also scary good. Pork neck bone smear: We were going to go with the bone marrow, but our waiter suggested this instead. I was skeptical, but don't let the sound of this scare you. It is delicious. Eggplant with goat cheese: I want to fill my bathtub with this and eat my way out of it. My very favorite dish of the meal. Pig's tails: My least favorite. Still good, but it doesn't compare to any other item. Milk braised pork shoulder: Other Yelpers are not liars. This is a very, very good dish. Get it. If you can sit outside, do it. The wine selection is great. The staff are better than great.
