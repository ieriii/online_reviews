deep dish pizza in chicago is like that obligatory hello you have to say to the frienemy -- you know, the one from your sorority in college who held you when you cried but also returned your borrowed clothes with ambiguous stains all over it? whenever i'm in chicago, the visit just doesn't feel complete without deep dish, regardless of whether i enjoy it. well, i think i'm over niceties. don't think deep dish pizza and i were meant to be together. i wont complain too much if i have to stop in and say hello occasionally, but this is not my ideal pizza place. the crust is thick and almost crumbly, reminding me of...cornbread? sometimes my mouth isn't very smart and misplaced textures are discombobulating. however, the tomato sauce is delicious, and at one point, i was eating just the sauce with a spoon. the layer of cheese is neverending. thank god for my slight intolerance to dairy. came at 11 am and were served with a minimal wait. we were ravenous, ordered a bucket of beer, the appetizer sampler, and a medium pizza. we left at 1 am with bulging stomachs and 2/3rds of a pizza. gino's, it was good knowing you. i'll come back when i finally get the nerve to send my frienemy my dry cleaning bill.
