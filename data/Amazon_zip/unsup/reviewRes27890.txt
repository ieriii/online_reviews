I am a firm believer that dinning at a restaurant is more than about just the food. It is an experience and for that I am giving Pequod's a bad review. The food itself was good although certainly not the best pizza in Chicago. The reason I probably will never go back was the service. I arrived at this establishment on Saturday night and as expected there was a line. I asked for the wait time and was told 45 minutes. That's a long time but this restaurant's notoriety preceded it and I was willing to wait and wait I did. After an hour I asked approximately how much longer the wait would be and I was told 15-20 minutes. Feeling very discontent but understanding that the majority of the laborious task of waiting was already completed I opted to stay. Wait...Wait...Wait...I ended up waiting for almost two hours. Was the host appoligetic? No. Was the owner? No. Did the waitress blame us when our pizza which we had preordered was late? YES! It's unfortunate that I had such a bad experience as I had heard a lot about this restaurant and it was a letdown to be so disappointed. There's better pizza and service out there. Don't settle for Pequod's.
