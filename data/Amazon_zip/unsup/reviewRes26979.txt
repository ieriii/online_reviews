This restaurant has the best Mexican food I've had since visiting that country recently. Very fresh salsas, soft huevos, and chilequiles like comfort food.  Huge portions at low prices. The place was clean and intimate, busy but not crowded, with many families looking around like they might know you. But my five stars go to the staff. Our server was so kind and sweet. My date and I stayed for three hours and were never once hustled with the bill. Maybe that is the norm or maybe she saw that we were enjoying ourselves and so left us alone. In either case, it was so nice to spend time amidst good food and music in a welcoming environment. See you again soon.
