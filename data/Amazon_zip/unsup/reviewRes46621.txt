Had dinner for the second time at RJ Grunts. It is located by the Lincoln Park Zoo. They have a bar area, great, upbeat music playing and cool pictures all over their walls. At first I thought they were pics of famous movie stars, but they are of servers who've worked there in the past. My favorite things were the mac and cheese, nachos and famous milkshakes. Yum! Next time, I will try their salad bar.
