The Gage is awesome! Nice, clean and trendy! Love it, love it, love it! Went there for lunch the other day and in spite of having a small menu for lunch they accommodated a couple of option for vegetarians. I had a mushroom sandwich that was to die for! the service was good and the owner came by to see how we were doing. The guy is nice but don't expect him to pickup the bill for you! :-) Looking forward to go back for dinner and drinks!
