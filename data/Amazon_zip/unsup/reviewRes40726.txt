We've been wanting to try Bonsoiree forever, and got finally made a res just in time for Chef Shin Thompson's last underground meal. It was good, but not great. ONE: Lobster & Octopus Salad with Fresh Uni, Trout Roe, Kabayaki, and Frise -- A nice start TWO: Scallop & Crab Motoyaki -- it is no surprise this is their signature dish. It was delicious. THREE: Duck Duck Goose -- Wished there was more duck confit, and less duck breast. The foie was nicely seared and the fig jam paired perfectly. FOUR: Crispy Suzuki in Plum Negi-Yaki Sauce with Lotus Chips -- This is not my favorite type of fish to eat, but they did it really well. FIVE: Strube Ranch Mishima Wagyu Beef, Wagyu Crepinette, Sweet Potatoes Dauphinoise, and Japanese BBQ Hot Mustard -- My cut of wagyu still had the silver skin and it was upsetting and nearly ruined the dish for me. SIX: Caramelized Banana Rum Bread Pudding, Banana Ice Cream, Grilled Banana Mousse, and White Chocolate Lavender Crme -- This dessert was solid. Looking forward to see how Beverly & Johnny make this place their own.
