went to shaws for sunday brunch, got there around 11am and the main room was full so we were seated in the oyster bar, it did kinda suck to have to walk back and fourth but whatever, will get there earlier next time. the food was great, what i loved, the king crab and melon cups, the waffles, the bacon (um the bacon was so good) sausage, the fried shrimp were really good, potatoes good, crab cakes were okay but i prefer the lump meat style. the raw shrimp were good too and the candy room, all the wine candy was stuck together and the lemonheads were a weird color besides that the truffles were excellent they had my favorite and saved me a trip to godiva this week for chocolate covered oreos, yummy cotton candy and this chocolate cake, cant wait for the next time
