Went for NY's eve, and was pleasantly surprised. I had asked a friend about it before I went, and her suggestion was "wear stretch pants". Agreed. It's a meat-lover's paradise. The contemporary design was a warm and inviting maroon color, and while it was quite spacious, I would maybe consider spacing the tables a little further apart (it made navigating to the salad bar a little tricky at times). The servers were very attentive and friendly. The first stop was the salad bar which had a huge array of food (salad/tasty chicken salad/cold cuts and cheese/ceviche/oysters/artichoke hearts/heart of palm/grilled zucchini and squash/sundried tomato/ahi tuna) with a couple warm dishes (mushroom risotto which was really delicious/cheese tortellini). Afterwards, we started on the meat... tried the chicken/pork with bacon/filet mignon/sausage/lamb/rump roast/pineapple, and while the cuts of meat were quite flavorful, I felt like I needed maybe some palate cleansing foods in between because everything started tasting very similar after a while. I do have to mention these most delicious cheese biscuits? Well, they were more like popovers in consistency..light but very moist in the middle. I looked up a recipe today and I believe that these are called Po de Queijo. Most of the recipes have tapioca flour, so it was recommended for people that have gluten sensitivity (I'm not sure what the recipe is at the restaurant so I'd ask if you need to know). So delicious..also, they gave us some mashed potatoes, and plantains. By the end of the meal, I didn't have any room for dessert, although the creme brule looked delicious. A definite must-try for anyone who is a meat-lover and has a healthy appetite. bon appetit!
