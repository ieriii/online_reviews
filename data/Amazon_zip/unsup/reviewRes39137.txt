Food: 4 Stars Service: 1 Star (since I can't do negatives) Been here many times and never had a problem. Why one star then? Because the service was almost comical in how bad it was. After waiting 15 minutes we were served the small dishes and finally had to ask the bus boy for water since we never got any. Then we didn't get the beer we ordered until halfway through the meal. They didn't turn on the fan until we complained. Our waitress showed up maybe four times. To take our order, to bring beer and then food and then for the check. The list goes on. And when she brought the check she hovered until we told her we needed a minute. I ended up slipping the bus boy a five and gave the waitress $9 on a $105 total because he gave us better service than she did and works a lot harder (you try carrying that thing of burning coals all night). But wait, it gets better. She had the nerve to come to our table right after I signed to try to shoo us out quickly and if that wasn't bad enough she looked at the signed receipt and pointed to the tip because she thought it was too little. "Only $9 dolla?" she said. You have to be f-ing kidding me. I told her the service sucked and that's why it was so low. She's lucky I didn't grab it from her hand, cross it off, and give her nothing. I understand its a Saturday night and you are busy and trying to turn over a table, but that level of service and the balls of the waitress to say that at the end is absolutely inexcusable. San soo gab san will be lucky if I ever come back and if I do it sure as hell won't be on a weekend. In fact, I advise nobody to go there on the weekend unless you like being treated like shit.
