Girls night out ....a revolution in the making ;).  OK so the wait was crazy but after all, it was a Friday night....guess I'm still getting used to Chi town hustle and bustle. I can handle that.....now the antarctica winters are a whole other story! To soften the blow of what felt like an eternity, I ordered the Bottom Up Belgian Wit ale & requested an orange slice. Cold and crisp it was exactly what the doctor ordered ;) to make the wait more palatable. Finally, we were seated...the server was nice, however visibly rushed....I suppose it is a Friday night, but as a leader in the customer service industry, I expect the best! The server was accommodating though....I ordered the Flemish Beef Stew, however subbed the garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes / french bean with carrots for the roasted squash / sweet potato/apple/ braised rainbow chard/apple brandy jus which normally comes with the locally raised pork chop.....quite yummy.... Je retournerai!!
