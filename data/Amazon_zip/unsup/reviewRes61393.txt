This has got to be one of the WORST places I have eaten in Chicago.. So much so that I had to create an account to tell about it.We were told that the food was good but the service was lacking... Little did we know.We were sat outside which was nice. About 20 min later we finally got a waitress to take our order. About 45min later we got our food. My Cuban sandwich was small and had large pieces of wax paper in the melted cheese. The banana chips that came with the meal. Well there were only 4 yes 4 of them on the plate. About 15 min later our server came out with our drinks and asked how our food was. I informed her that we hadnt recieved our apps yet OR our DRINKS. She blamed another server for taking them and said she would go get ours. She brought our drinks and then after we were all done with our meal then our apps came out. IT was NOT worth the wait or our time. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. I am usually very forgiving about alot because I have worked in restaurants for the last 20+ years but this was unforgivable. There were only 6 tables of people there.
