PROS: Great design, friendly staff.CONS: Horrible food, staff too amateur. Seriously, maybe the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. We tried almost everything and there was not even one thing that we could find tasty. At one point I thought we were on a candid camera and they were bringing us horrible food intentionally. Sad thing is, it's all real and it costs A LOT.
