I am a total hypocrite. There are restaurants that I refuse to eat in because I think that they are dirty, unsanitary or complete abominations..worse than any dives imaginable. When it comes to Chinese food however, I turn a blind eye and have my chopsticks ready. To many, Sun Wah is definitely not a place that you would go to for ambiance, decor, etc. If you're a neat freak, this is not the place for you. If you want damn good food, go here!! When I lived and worked near here, Sun Wah was my place to go for BBQ pork, duck, and roasted pork. They even sell fried chicken and pork skin! I loved this place with a passion. I had never eaten in the restaurant itself, I just shopped the meat counter. Since I no longer work in the vicinity, it is very difficult for me to find the urge to drive the 45min plus. I had the good fortune tonight of eating dinner here. YUM YUM, I had a party in my tummy! My sister treated us to Peking Duck, roast chicken, squid, ong choy, garlic ribs, etc. Seriously some of the tastiest and yummiest dishes ever!  I highly recommend ordering the Peking Duck. At $30 a duck, you receive it carved table side. You place the slices inside steamed bao, add a bit of plum sauce, daikon, carrots and it is honest to goodness melt in your mouth good! They then take the duck carcass and prepare a a duck broth with scallions and cilantro..it has just the right amount of flavor and makes your tummy feel great! The rest of the duck meat can be prepared into duck fat noodles or fried rice..both of which are equally tasty! The home made sorbet was also really yummy! On a side note, if you are unfamiliar with the area, I urge caution. It is not the safest area to be around once the sun goes down. I strongly recommend that if you must go in the evening, to park as close to the main streets as possible and to be sure that you are in a lighted area. I did not feel comfortable walking alone with my little one at 7pm.
