I live down the street from Longman and Eagle and I have taken my family there for brunch, I've recommended it to coworkers and I go there for drinks with friends on a regular basis. I was really excited when they finally opened. Three friends and I were celebrating my 31st birthday last night and we went there for last call. My friend bought 4 expensive beers and 2 minutes later the bartender started yelling at us at the top of his lungs to slam our beers and leave. He was literally YELLING at us to stop. This is unacceptable. What made matters worse, though, was that there were other patrons sitting at the bar and there were a couple of tables behind us, too, and the bartender did not say anything to them so they stayed. The guy was being such a jerk that we had no choice but to leave. I might expect this at a tacky college sports bar but not from a gastro pub with a Michelin Star. On the way out I noticed the clock at the host stand said it was only 1:55. It wasn't even 2:00 yet! I have worked at several restaurants (including high end restaurants) and know better than to treat people so poorly. I do not recommend this place to anyone and I will never go back. Longman & Eagle should be embarrassed about allowing such a contemptible person to serve the public.  Thank god there are other bars and restaurants in Logan Square.....this place is overrated.
