Absolutely delicious! I was not a big fan of the duck fat fries as most people are, but this means I can avoid the famously long weekend lines and get my fix of amazing encased meats on a weekday instead. The place is small but cozy, Doug is an amazingly kind person, and the food is beyond great. Even if you end up waiting in that line, it's well worth it-- just remember to bring cash.
