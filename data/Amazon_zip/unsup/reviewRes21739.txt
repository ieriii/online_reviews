It is a definitely a novelty now (the nostalgic factor as one of the reviews said), or it maybe a valid part of the hotdog culture history in Chicago, since drive-in and car hops are hard to find now these days. But I can't say its hotdog is really any special or even tastier than, like say a beef frank from the food counter at Costco. However, service is quick and friendly, that's a big plus!
