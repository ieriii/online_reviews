Here's the thing. I don't think that $11 for a well-crafted drink is insane. I mean, I'm not going to go every weekend, and I do consider $11 on the upper side of what you would pay for a drink. However, in this day and age of the $14 martini, I don't consider The Violet Hour that bad for what you get. First off, I kind of like the whole 'no signage' phenomenon. I appreciate not being bombarded by advertisements from the time I reach the door until I get to the loo, and then until I leave. It gets old. I understand the appeal of Schlitz signs, but it does get old. I enjoyed a rather quiet (it was probably a Tuesday or Thursday) couple of drinks with my fiance. I liked the high-backed chairs, so we were able to scoot them closer together and have it feel like a private room. I loved the drinks. They were mixed to perfection - I didn't feel like I was drinking a ton, until I stood up (after two drinks). They were both gorgeous tasting, and the boyfriend loved his as well. The only drawback was our waitress, who apparently graduated from The Bitch School with high honors. She was nice enough at times, but I could tell that she wanted to be anywhere but there. I kept waiting for the eye roll to make an appearance. When you're serving unusual concoctions, darling, you must realize that some people like opinions and recommendations. That should be part of your job description, a mini-sommelier for froo-froo (yet manly) drinks. I should also state that I swear that I saw several gentlemen with bottles of Red Stripe. Perhaps there was something available under the table or they brought it in from across the street. In all, I would say that this is a great date spot or somewhere to take a few friends. I wouldn't go all the time, but as a celebratory drink night out, it's fantastic.
