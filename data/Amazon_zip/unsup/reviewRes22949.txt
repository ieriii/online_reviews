after living in the Chicagland area for over 30 years I finally took the voyage to Superdawg and it was well worth it!! As usual I ordered too much food, but had a hard time not eating it all, tamales were solid and a nice unique touch to the menu, the supercheesie (i.e. cheeseburger) was very good as well, even though I forgot to order it without relish, which ended up being a good thing (I'm typically not a fan of sweet pickles, but it was great) The superdawgs were out of this world, I've been a loyal Portillos fan since I was a kid, but these are soooo much better! The superdawg is bigger than a jumbo from Portillos, and very filling. The toppings are top notch and they do not skimp on them, plenty of mustard and onions, just the way I like it, all topped off with a great dill pickle spear (not some flimsy cardboard tasting thing you get at other places) I know a lot of posters have complained about the price, but when you think about it, Superdawg is a good value since everything is served with the fastastic fresh cut superfries (generous portion to boot). If you take the price of a jumbo dog at Portillos and add a reg fries you are about the same price (same goes for the burgers)  As an operator of 13 full service restaurants it is a genius idea for them to do this (due to fries being the second most profitable items on any menu - behind soda) Cant wait for the other location to open in Wheeling so I can drink the Superdawg Kool-Aid even more!
