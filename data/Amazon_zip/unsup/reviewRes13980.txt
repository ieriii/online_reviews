Arrived here at 4:45pm on a Sunday afternoon with a party of three. 3-4 tables were open. We were asked if we had a reservation, which we did not. "The earliest availability we have is 7:30pm." Huh? I know the place is small, but this level of pretension is best reserved for River North at places that won't last a year. Don't bother with this place.
