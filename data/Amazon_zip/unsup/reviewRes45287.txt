This is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at in the city! If your looking for a romantic cozy atmosphere this is one of the best places to go. If your on a date you can ask them to sit you in the "Library" and if you get bored on the date you can just start reading off the strange books they have placed up there, and stay warm by the fire. The service depends on if they are busy or not. I have been there and had great service and poor service.
