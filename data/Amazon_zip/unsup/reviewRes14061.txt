I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. The staff was incredibly friendly, the place has a lot of character, the service is quick, the food has distinctive flavor and you won't walk away feeling as if you need to go back home and take a nap.  I chose an omelette sandwich with ham, swiss, onions, and fried sweet plaintains on a baguette roll. I added a cafe cortadito and a pastry on the side, which came out to about $10 total. It was a great deal. They have a wide range of lunch sandwiches that I'll come back for sometime soon. The inside is decorated with old newspapers as wallpaper, as well as several photos and postcards of Cuba. They also provide a few decks of cards as a distraction for the 5 or so minutes till your food comes out. It's a comfortable and unique place.
