I'm craving Demera's veggie combo as I write this... I can't wait to return :) Went here for Restaurant week's brunch. Between our table of eight, we sampled tea, four different appetizers, three combos (meat, veggie, and meat/veggie), and three desserts. All but one of our party of eight left stuffed and happy. The eight just didn't like the thought of eating with her hands from a shared tray (they will give you a fork if you ask!) Everything was delicious, we had a wide variety, and it was very healthy. The food was made with little oil but was still very flavorful. To top it all off, our meal was so cheap! With a 20% tip added on automatically, each of our bills were $16.  I also have to say that it is very hygienic. The bathrooms are completely touch-free, including the door handle to exit.  If the point of Restaurant week is to impress prospective customers so they will return, they have definitely picked up new customers from our visit. Good work Demera!
