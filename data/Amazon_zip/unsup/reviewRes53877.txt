Been there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch.  As many have said before, the food is indeed great. However, the drink prices are excessive -- even for the location. We had a great glass of pinot for $24.00. I liked it so much I looked it up after our visit and found it was selling for $21.00 per bottle. I felt totally ripped off. I understand restraunts make their money off of alcohol, but two beers and two glasses of wine with our meal came to $70.00.
