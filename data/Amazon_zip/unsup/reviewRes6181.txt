4.5 stars. This place has some really stellar dishes, but also a dish or two that was not the greatest. However, let me just suggest some of my favorite dishes of the evening, and plates that you should definitely get. Mascarpone polenta + ragu of the day (pork cheeks when I went) was absolutely phenomenal. You have to get this dish - the pork ragu was braised perfectly, as it was flavorful and rich, but balanced out very nicely with the light polenta. My favorite dish of the night. The linguini with sea urchin and crab is also a great play. Not the largest portions, but enough to split between 2-3 people. The linguini was al dente, and the dish was a bit creamy but not overwhelmingly so. I thought the pizza della fattoria (egg, pork belly) was not that great, and I did not care much for the seared octopus dish either (the octopus was great, but the warm potato salad with the horseradish aioli just didn't taste right with it).  The great thing about this place is all of these dishes, plus dessert and a side of mushrooms cost about $70 w/ tip.
