I LOVE this place! I have never had a bad experience with either dining in or ordering delivery. The BYO is great and they are very accomodating with wine glasses. Service has always been prompt and accurate and the servers always know the answers to my qeuestions. The crab Rangoon and cucumber salad are things I order every time and they are always wonderful. My fiance claims the sushi is fresh and well prepared, but since I'm not a sushi lover, I can't say for sure, but I trust her! The multiple items from the Thai menu I have tried have been great - green curry, basil fried rice, cashew chicken are all delicious an well seasoned. The prices couldn't be better either - it's very affordable and a great value!
