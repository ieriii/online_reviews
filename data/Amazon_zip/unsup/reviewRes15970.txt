This was my sis inlaws choice to celebrate her bday. A large celebratory space. Food was excellent and well executed. Considering the size of this place I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. We share guacamole, ceviche tasting, bife angosto, churrasco, and the mama mendez arroz con mariscos. All of the beef was cooked to requested temps and the rice / seafood dish was amazing.
