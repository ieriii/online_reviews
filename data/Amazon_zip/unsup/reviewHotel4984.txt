This is a very nice hotel with a very friendly and courteous staff. We stayed in a king suite. The bdrm was very large, the living rm was even larger and both rooms overlooked the shoreline, a park, and major attractions. We liked everything about the hotel except the very small bthrm, which was quite difficult to maneuver in and out. The pool and gym were nice, housekeeping was okay but it wasn't until 5pm when they got to our room on the 9th fl. You can catch the bus on both sides of the street in front of the hotel, and catch the subway around the corner - two blocks. The Essex Inn is away from the crowds of North Michigan Ave, yet convenient to major attractions along the Mag Mile. We will most certainly return here. Oh, there was something going on EVERY night at the park. A couple of bands performed two nights, there was Salsa instruction another night. Quite lively and entertaining.Overall, the hotel was nice but a bit pricey for the outdated decor. We ate at the Inn's restaurant our first visit because we had to wait until after 4pm checkin for a 5pm room availability. We arrived at 3pm! So we lounged in the restaurant, which was satisfactory. Other nights we ate outside the hotel.
