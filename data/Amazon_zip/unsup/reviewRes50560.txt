What an awesome place to have brunch! A friend and I darkened this doorstep on a Saturday early afternoon and it's only hours later and I'm dreaming of when I can go back and what I can get.  We started out with perfectly brewed Intelligentsia coffee in enormous mugs served with cream and...wait...a bottle of simple syrup to sweeten. Loved that touch. Following shortly behind were beignets which we perfectly light, fluffy and sweet. And free. Oh yeah. After considering most of the specialties, I chose the Eggs New Orleans and it was possible the best breakfast choice I've made all year. Perfectly poached, perfectly beautiful eggs sitting on top of savory crab cakes sitting on top of the most wonder popovers, all generously drizzled with a tangy hollandaise. Clearly, I was looking for low fat options (um...no). This was a great meal. My friend ordered a similar breakfast but it came with a piece of sirloin (cooked perfectly medium, I might add) resting on top of grits cakes. I left loving mine but ultimately wishing I had hers but not wanting to give up mine. The service was fantastic (thank you Nathan with your very cute Southern accent...from Virginia)--very attentive. My only beef and it's a very small one--the food was only lukewarm when it arrived at the table. I wish it had been a little warmer but that really doesn't detract from my experience in the least. It was wonderful. And any excuse I have to go back I will take with no hesitation. I can't wait!
