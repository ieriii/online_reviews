Great spot to bring a date for dinner & drinks. Dimly lit on the inside, nice decor, good atmosphere & ambiance.  I started off with the steak tartare as an appetizer which was phenominal & a few glasses of wine. I've had steak tartare at a lot of places & this was the best I've had. For an entree I got the pork belly - which i enjoyed & my girlfriend got the mushroom/truffle pasta which was very good - both dishes being very rich. Overall I was pleased with the food & very pleased with the presentation of each dish. The service was above average, the waitress was knowledgeable about the menu & made a solid effort to ask if we needed more drinks or anything else. Overall good spot & reasonably priced. Worth going back.
