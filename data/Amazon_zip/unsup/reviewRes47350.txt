Best Burger for your Buck ! This place is easy, fun, and provides great value. Me and my buddies went to grab some food and drinks before a Blackhawks game. Beers were reasonably priced, service was great, and how about those Burgers ! Each one was cooked to perfection (as ordered) on a pretzel roll - my favorite. And you get a heaping order of old-fashioned potato-cut fries. All for $8 bucks ! My burger was so juicy (although it got a little crumbly by the end) I was in heaven. I can even bring my wife for the Hummus appetizer plate which was loaded with fresh fare. I can't wait to head back when it gets warmer and they open the window-filled garage doors that look to provide exposure to the fresh outdoors. Very cool concept. I love the exposed brick and the rock theme of this place. Oh wait, I forgot to mention the banana fried wonton desert topped with ice cream. Oh my god. I don't even eat desert, but this was delicious. Great value. Great burger. I will definitely come back.
