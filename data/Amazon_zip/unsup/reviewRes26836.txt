I tried Nuevo Leon for the first time over the weekend. The chilaquiles were spectacular - 5-star worthy - and our waitress did a great job. Unfortunately, the actual experience of eating at Nuevo Leon was rather unpleasant - 1-star worthy. We were seated in a micro-booth right next to the door, which was constantly flapping open and generating a serious draft. This restaurant does not have a waiting area, so people in line hovered over our table for the duration of our meal (our poor waitress really had to struggle to approach our table). Maybe take-out is the solution for this place...
