If you have a craving for pho, you should give this place a try. You have the options to have tripe, flank, tendon, meatballs, or steak in a bowl of noodles garnished with onions and cilantro. I recommend you use the hoisen sauce mixed with some sriracha for a kick. The broth is what makes this place stand out from other pho places I had tried. Its something about it that brings together the noodles, meats, and spices. Everything compliments each other well. If you are not a big fan of pho, they still have congee, banh mi, rice dishes, or dried vermicelli. I also recommend their egg rolls for an appetizer and thai ice tea for a drink.  I had to deduct a star because of their cleanliness and service. Their tables are sometimes still sticky or have leftover food from the previous customers. I also don't like how they would just sit other parties at the same table without asking if it would be ok to share. Besides that their services are great. They are always attentive and quick with the orders and food.
