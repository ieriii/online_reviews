Typically I'm not into big plates and small servings. I'm from a Polish family on the North side of Chicago and need to eat a meal for dinner. Graham Elliot totally changed my opinion on this style of eating. I went with a group of co-workers last night with reservations for 7:15PM. We were promptly seated in a comfortable corner. First, I have to say I love the atmosphere, decor, and music. It's a cool mix of jazz, lounge, and rock music. Who would have thought that would go well together? For starters, our waitress brought of some crazy good truffle popcorn with black pepper. WOW. All four of us were starving and dismantled the popcorn within minutes. For a drink, and I had a killer dry vodka martini. I was a little confused by the menu at first, but our waitress quickly explained and walked us through the process. How thoughtful! I went with the deconstructed caeser salad. Insane. I loved it! It had some weird "twinkie" bread with cheese in it. Appetizers and salads are easy to order, but I was getting a little nervous about the main course. Everything was meat. I had to ask about a vegetarian dish and I'm so glad I did. The waitress recommended an orange tofu dish that isn't on the menu. Seriously, probably one of the best tofu plates I've ever had. I'm a foodie, by means of trying new restaurants of all different types, but I'm not a food snob. On a usual evening, I probably wouldn't check out restaurants like this, but if you have a few hungry co-workers after work, I recommend checking out Graham Elliot.
