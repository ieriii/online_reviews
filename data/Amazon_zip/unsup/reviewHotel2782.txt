Near Perfection. I have stayed at the James twice. When i first walked into the lobby i knew i would be taken care of. Every detail, from the location of the front desk, the lighting changes as one moves through the lobby, and the subdued modern decor show so clearly that someone thought very hard about how to make ME and my friends comfortable. Everyone is polite, but none suck up. We are all equals, from the people who clean to the front desk and the managers, all of us part of an experience, that has been an integral goal of human society for ten thousand years--how to welcome a guest. Well, this hotel has it figured out, at least for me. Everything is clean. the decor is subtle, almost minimalist, but complete. There is no hard sell of candy, no 7 dollar charge for a sip from a bottle of water left on the bedside table. Internet is free, easy to log on and available throughout the hotel. Lighting in the room is perfect for a computer, not a newspaper. The hotel is a remarkable achievement. If you can stay here do!
