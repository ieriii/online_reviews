Everything was really good. Had their featured Sushi and rolls. Portion size was spot on and the knife skills were Dooley noted. Asparagus side was a hidden gem. Service was professional with being snobby. Food was fast, awesome 'cause I was a starvin'. Place was packed but the noise level was minimal, thumbs up. byob and they deliver!
