This place is solid, even for someone like myself who does not eat red meat. There is plenty to eat, let me tell you. They let you start at the hot/cold bar: a buffet of steamed and pickled veggies, fresh soup, an array of salads, and my fav roasted garlic. The meat selection is great if you're a carnivore. I stuck with the chicken breast and parmesan, both of which were very good. The best part is the unlimited supply of garlic mashed potatoes and fried bananas. The ambiance was wonderful. I really enjoyed the acrobatics in the center wine display. My only complaint is that the bathrooms are on the second floor, so if there's a private party up there, its a little challenging to make your way through.
