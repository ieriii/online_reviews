simply it, being simply only the best place I wanna get vietnamese food from!we came in as a huge group last week, unfortunately our group was running 25 minutes late and they had to serve some other customers. The owner however made it up to us while we waited and chatted with lots of small appetizers that I couldn't get enough of!When we were seated, service was prompt, our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Simply It's beef, it was simply... YUMMY.Nice socializing time, BYOB is a huge plus for this restaurant, many others at my table seemed to enjoy their meal as well. We were checked up on often enough to make sure all was well. 5 stars! one of Lincoln Park's best gem of a restaurant.
