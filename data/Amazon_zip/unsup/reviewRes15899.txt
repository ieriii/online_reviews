A friend of mine from the neighborhood told me I had to try Calo....so we met there on a Tuesday night for dinner. We were seated outside and given our menus. My friend immediately told me how great the ribs were...explaining that they are only $9.99 Mon-Thurs instead of full price. I was convinced (although there were many other appealing items on the menu) and ordered the ribs which came with a small salad and a side of garlic mashed. Let me tell you these ribs were GREAT! They were meaty and the sauce was so tangy and delicious. Also, the garlic mashed were phenomenal...chunky and flavorful. I was hooked. I've taken two of my friends there now and instructed them to order the ribs. I'm sure there are other wonderful items on the menu, but I just cannot pass up those ribs!
