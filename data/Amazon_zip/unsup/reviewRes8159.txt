I live in Tennessee and whenever I travel anywhere I check if there is a local VPN approved authentic Neopolitan Pizzeria. So I had a a 3hour layover at O'Hare and got on a taxi for a memorable and fantastic lunch. The host was very respectful and a gentleman all around. Additionally, the mozzarella de bufala is a cut above what I've had in the states. Definitely worth the taxi fair.
