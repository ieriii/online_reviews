Oh, Hot Dougs.... I've only been there twice, but I'm in love. Yes, there's a long wait. Get over it. It's well worth the wait, and honestly I don't think anyone in line cares. Yes, it is crazy packed just about every time you go there. At most small places like this, I would expect a situation like that to make the staff rude and rushed. But not here. Doug is patient and friendly. He takes his time with your order and is happy to explain anything on the menu to you. It's nice to see a smiling face after waiting in line for an hour. Also - I am so glad that they offer a vegetarian Hot Dog. I have no idea what it's made of, but it. is. DELICIOUS. Also, the selection of toppings and specials is fantastic. A+ for food. A+ for customer service. Go wait in the line. You won't regret it.
