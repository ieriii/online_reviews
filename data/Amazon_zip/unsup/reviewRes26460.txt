I have gone to Mercat for lunch, and for a bite at the bar--and enjoyed it tremendously. Certainly a 5 star experience. I wanted to warn people, though, not to go to Mercat for dinner in the evening--even a weekday evening--if you want to enjoy the company of your friends and peacefully enjoy the food. I don't understand why some of the money spent on decor was not spent on any simple expedients to muffle noise. They exist. I felt like I was eating in a huge aircraft hanger filled with screaming nursery school children. Added to this noise was pounding music with a relentless dance beat. The place is a dining room--not a 1980s disco for heaven's sake! My party of five was also seated around a huge table--so that any conversation was impossible. Our poor waitress and waiter--who were more than excellent--had to yell to be heard. I hate to think what their throats must feel like at the end of their shift. The food was good-if uneven. Sometimes it was fabulous. Unfortunately it came out of the kitchen with very strange pacing--so that dishes that were ordered together (for a reason) came out at very different times and the intense flavors of the small plates often warred with each other. The service was wonderfully gracious--we were given generous samples of a number of wines before we chose our bottle--and the waitress noticed and accomodated my nephew's teenage metabolism. It is a shame that this graciousness was nearly negated by the assaultive atmosphere--and that interesting, and expensive, food could not be appreciated fully.
