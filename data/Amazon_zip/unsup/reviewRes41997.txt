Awesome! We go for the pho, which, you know, is why you go to a pho house, but just about everything else is good, too. The broth of the pho has some great flavoring and it just smells like heaven before you even put the basil or anything else in it. I personally think the meat at times is a bit fatty and it shows on the top of the broth after a little bit, which kinda makes me gag. But it is sooooo flavorful I do say! The spring rolls are nice and fat and minty and the peanut sauce that comes with it is one of the best we've had in town. Coffee's great with the condensed milk, chicken lemongrass was great, maybe a little much on the fish sauce, and the three bean 'sweetie' was wacky and really good! Not a huge fan of bubble teas generally, but the avocado was pretty darn tasty and i just worked around the bubbles. Yeah for the busy tasty Tank!
