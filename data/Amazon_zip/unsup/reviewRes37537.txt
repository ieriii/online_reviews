I love beer. I really do. Good beer. Delicious beer. I also adventure and trying new things and pleasant dining companions. My evening at Hopleaf included all of this and more. It was crowded, being Saturday, but we managed to find a nice corner to hang out in while waiting for a table. The wait was about 45 min. but we had beer and were, therefore, happy. My dining companion and I shared the mussels for two. They were outstanding. In fact, I kinda regret eating as much as I did on the appetizer as it meant I had less room for my entree. My friends all know I am a kid at heart. But leave it to the Hopleaf to class up a childhood classic with the CB & J. Cashew butter and fig preserves on toasted bread with some sort of lovely cheese in the middle too. Wow, it was so good. I am still mooning over that sandwich. I am also trying to think of where I can buy some cashew butter. I have absolutely no idea what my dining companion had. I was too enamored with my sandwich. God it was good. Especially with a really nice beer to wash it down.
