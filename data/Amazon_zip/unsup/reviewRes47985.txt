Publi-can you do better than that? LOVED the ambiance of this place, being that I was visiting I really loved the unique and rustic-ness of the place which was seemingly representative of the cool, clean Chicago downtown area. If you don't mind feeling like a barn animal being trapped in a high class barn, ask if you could sit in a booth, they literally have a wooden gate at the end of the booth that encloses you in. Kinda fun, kinda wierd. As for the food, I wasn't too wowed. The one dish that was really good was the maple glazed pork shoulder with pickled cauliflower and braised greens. I also got a salad with lox that was disturbingly similar to a salad I could make with Safeway mixed greens and Newmans Own salad dressing. Minus the $15 that I paid at Publican. My friends had better experiences with dinner, so I'll definitely give it another shot next time I'm in town.
