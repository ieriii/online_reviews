This review is for Zed451's brunch, my favorite in the City! At $29 (previously $24), my initial reaction was that it wouldn't be worth it. Rest assured - you'll get your money's worth and more! There's something for everyone here, and you'll eat enough for your next two meals. And, at $3 and $5, the Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are a bargain.  The Harvest Table offers an assortment of fresh, unique salads as well as cheeses and charcuterie. Be selective here or you won't have room for the other courses! The waiters then bring out unlimited amounts of several dishes, my favorites being the cinnamon buns and bacon. A couple are egg-based, and the fried chicken and waffle seems to be a staple. If you're not full yet, you then have the option to try the traditional Brazilian meats (similar to dinner, I imagine). I've never had any room remaining to visit the dessert table after all of these courses, but there is a decent-sized spread. My only complaints are that they can't substitute or omit ingredients in the standard dishes as they're pre-made, and sometimes the same dishes are offered repeatedly, while others never come around. In fact, we've wrapped up our meal only to realize that we weren't offered some of the dishes. So be sure to ask your waiter if you've seen everything.  Don't plan on eating any meals the rest of the day!
