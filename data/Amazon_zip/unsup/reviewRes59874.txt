Hands down best restaurant in town. Perfect follow-up to a Broadway show. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Not quite jeans and t-shirt, but otherwise quite relaxed. We are not traditionally beef eaters in our family. We had the Filet Mignon Medallions w/Shrimp. If we could eat at Kinzie everyday, we would be converts. The meet was so tender and delicious. The shrimp was fresh and succulent, and the red bell pepper risotto was excellent. We had cream puffs and butter rum cheesecake for dessert. We do not recommend the cream puffs (aka profiteroles), as they were made w/ice cream instead of sweet cream. However, the butter rum cheesecake was heavenly. Overall, the specialty martinis are fantastic, waitstaff is truly remarkable and attentive, and the food was so good that we could easily spend every weekend at Kinzie. The prices are also very reasonable for food of this caliber. If you are looking for a wonderful evening, in a relaxed yet cozy and romantic setting, and you want to experience fine dining at it's best----try Kinzie Chophouse.
