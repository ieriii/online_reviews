Tonight I had one of the best restaurant experiences I've had in a long time--great food, great drinks, wonderful ambience, great company, and the most adorable waiter who was just great . They start out with warm sweet corn bread muffins that has just a bit a spiciness tot them.We liked them so much that they gave us more so we could bring some home. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. Before I had dinner I had sweet tea vodka over the rocks...what a delicious drink. Then I had fried green tomatos coverered with shrimp and a small amount of remoulade sauce and wonderful gumbo. One of my friends wanted the meat cooked more well done than the chef likes to make things and the waiter had to take it back three times. They felt bad about this and we were served complimentary appetizers of homemade andoulloise (I have no idea how to spell that word) sausage. One of my friends ordered red velvet cake for dessert. It was made to order!!!!! I have never seen cake made to order and it came with a combo of ice cream and cream cheese and some crumbles of some kind of a toffee. I took a bite of it and it was wonderful. I can't wait to go back!
