Unfortunately, I only get to enjoy Hopleaf every once in a while. The location is a bit out of the way for me and the food is kind of pricey. However, the Belgian tap selection is second to none and the expensive food is always interesting and delicious -- mussels, cheeses, sausages, frites. Many of the negative reviews on this page need to be addressed. If you admittedly are not a fan of Belgian beer or food, don't complain when it turns out that it isn't your thing. Second, if your review is completely based on the fact that Hopleaf is now too popular, giving it a low score just comes across as bitter. I understand that a crowded restaurant isn't always fun (most of the time it isn't), but Hopleaf is completely honest about this. They start serving food at 5:00pm, and they don't take reservations. Show up when it opens if you don't want to wait in the bar for a table.
