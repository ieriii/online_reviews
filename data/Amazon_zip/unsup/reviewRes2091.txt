I cannot say enough good things about Hot Doug's. I started going here before I ever even moved to Chicago. Every time I visited my sister, I insisted that we eat at Hot Doug's. The food is really good (especially the duck fat fries on Fri and Sat) and really inexpensive. And Hot Doug himself is great. He is so friendly (the guy in line after me was short like 50 cents, and Doug didn't even care. I know that's not a big deal, but it was still nice to see.)
