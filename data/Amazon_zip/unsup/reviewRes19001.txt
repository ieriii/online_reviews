The burger craze that Kuma's started has spread to every corner of the city. Every place now has fancy burgers and the Bad Apple has joined the mass movement into the 10 oz burger on a burger mania. They make some amazing burgers, and the French fries this place serves are infused with something. The Truffle were the best. Yes, the fries are off the charts here. Yum! I had the Frenchie burger and was happy as can be. The beer list is deep, and the service on a very busy weekend night was focused and friendly. I think this place used to be "Feed the Beast" and the only complaint I have is that they removed the long comfy bench along the wall and replaced it with high bar tables, but other than that the move from Beast to Bad Apple seems to have been a good one. Yummy.
