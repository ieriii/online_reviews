How does this place manage to be so authentic and so touristy at the same time? Great spot for music, but for the atmosphere as well. Jazz is not the most varied type of music, yet each and every experience I had there was very different. I usually take people who visit me from out of town there at least once, everybody kept it as a fond memory of their trip. Even if you don't take the historic and mythical aspect of the place into account, it is still a must-see in Chicago!
