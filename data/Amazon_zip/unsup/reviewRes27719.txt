Great for breakfast lunch dinner every day. Stick to your bones, authentic, CHEAP! Very chaotic at times (slippery floors!), the non-smoking area can be a bit smelly(sometimes like a bathroom deoderant), but the amazing food outweighs everything. You can even get homemade flour tortillas to go. WE MISS THIS PLACE!!!!
