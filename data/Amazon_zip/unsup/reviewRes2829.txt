I went about a year ago with my family and we all tried on of the gourmet dinners that about eight courses. The staircase caviar was amazing partly just because of the presentation. Every course was more amazing then the next and the five hours we spent there felt like nothing. The food blew me away. The most amazing course to me had to have been the cheese course. They came out with a cheese cart with what must have been 30 cheeses and then I got to choose which cheeses I wanted. After the dessert course be prepared for the mini desserts to come your way. If you are going to go there for dinner I would suggest doing the special menus. Since it's not a place you will go to a lot it pays to do the entire dinner. Beware you will constantly be asked to add thing to your set menu to add to the price. Tru also has several half bottles of wine which is a great way to do it because then you can have a half of white to share and then have some red with the meat courses. The wine can add to the experience but it also adds to the price. I think this is a great experience for everyone to have. It's not a place that you would go to a normal Friday night but for a special occasion I can't imagine eating at a nicer restaurant.
