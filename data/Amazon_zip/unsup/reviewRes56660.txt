My kids always like the ravioli and truffle toast. My youngest daughter loves the ricota and the pasta and sauce is almost as good as the sauce I used to eat at a restaurant in Los Gatos, California 10-12 years ago that is still the best I have ever had.Everytime i have the swordfish it has been delicious. My wife smiles and thinks of ways to get me to make time to dine at Davanti's whenever we are in the Chicago area. Considering the quality, the prices are very reasonable... it can get a little loud, so we tend to eat there early.  Try the Uovo in Raviolo 'an Domenico. You will want more than one!Colin
