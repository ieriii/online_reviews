A few of us went here for hot pot one night. Unfortunately none of us had had much experience with it so it actually ended up being a little frustrating trying to order how we (thought) we wanted it. The waiter kept suggesting that we get the deluxe hot pot which would have been about $22 per person with tax and tip which I would not have minded but some people didn't really want to spend that much. So we went with two pots one spicy and one not spicy. The waiter insisted that only one pot would be okay and that we could have a spicy and non-spicy side since the pot has a divider but a few thought that would not be enough...Anyway in the end that's what we should have done. I was extremely hungry and it took forever for them to get our pots out and going. We should have ordered appetizers but I didn't know that it would take that long....I wasn't extremely happy nor satisfied with the experience, partly our fault and partly theirs. I think next time I go we will just order dishes and go family style....
