There are so many reviews L&E I was on the fence about submitting one. However, it is so amazing I have to voice my most recent experience! Appetizers and Small Plates: My friend and I ordered the Bone Marrow, Meatballs, and Olives to start with a bottle of Rose'. The Bone Marrow is different than other restaraunts because they provide you with salt and a jelly on the top which makes it a different and yummy experience. The meatballs have an bold but not overpowering herbacious taste with a delicous marinara sauce and sits on top of an amazing bed of polenta. I could honestly eat entire bowel of this and be happy. The olives are a nice compliment to the heavier appetizers and have several different sizes and flavors and are marinated perfectly. They are not overpowering with flavor and are done just right. Big Plates: We split this amazing porchetta dish that just melted in your mouth. The flavor of the meat was buttery and salty and the risotto underneath was perfectly cooked with just the right sized vegetables and creaminess. Mmmmmm We also split the clam in white wine dish (sorry don't have the exact name and the menu online is not up to date). The white wine broth was extremely flavorful. The wine and the herbs everything mixed nicely. What stood out to me the most with this dish though was how perfectly the clams were cooked. They were silky and moist and flavorful. The service: Waitress was perfect hipster friendly and knew exactly when to come, food timing was solid, bus boys knew exactly when to take our plates away, and the recommendations were right on. The price: For the quality of food you get, the flavor, the service, very affordable and worth every penny Overall: A place so good you yearn to go back over and over again. It's not a fancy meal place where you enjoy it but never return. It's one of those places you can schedule dinner with your friends, have a week night excursion just cuz, a anniversary dinner, or a first date. Perfect for all!
