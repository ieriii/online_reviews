TERRIBLE SERVICE but good food! Everytime I go there I wait for at least 5-10 min to get a falafel. A few days ago the cashier was sitting on his laptop not acknowledging that there is line of people waiting to be rung up. Next day middle aged old blonde lady was talking on the phone for 5 minutes before I got rung up!
