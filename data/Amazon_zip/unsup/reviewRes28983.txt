One word: Frustrating! If I were to rate this place just on the food, I would happily give it 5 stars. Yes, it was pretty darn good. The fried tofu's sauce had a nice kick to it, the som tum salad was very good, very flavorful, and spicy, and the panang curry with tofu was sooo good. The curry was creamy, rich, peanuty, sweet, and savory. Yum. The decor was pleasant. There was artwork on the walls and woodwork all around -- the woodwork was not just your average panelling, but had lots of impressive carving in it. The ambiance was nice. All good stuff, right? So what went wrong? The service. I can't really say that the staff was outright rude or anything, but they certainly didn't seem to care all that much. My lovely panang curry came with a big, nasty, black hair in it (clearly not belonging to my husband or myself) and they barely even acknowledged it. If I were running a place, I'd freaking comp something on the bill, not to mention even really saying sorry to the customer and seeing what I could do to make it up to them. Yuck.  They never came back to our table to see how we were doing, and as soon as it came close to 10 PM (their closing time that night), the cleaning fluid odors were overpowering the place and the lighting that had created the ambiance was switched fully to ON. Oh, and they didn't ask if we wanted dessert, which I kind of did, and did the same thing to a table near us, where I heard them hand the waitress back the check (she was trying to get them out of there -- this was at 9:15-ish) and ask for dessert. I opted to ignore dessert and get out before becoming overwhelmed by the cleaner smell.  So that's it: I was so bummed by the service that I have to give this place a 3 star review. It made me not want to go back there, which really sucks because it was uncommonly good food. Grrr.
