Carnivale is one of our favorite restaurants in the city. We go there frequently and try to make it a point to take out-of-towners. It's the best mojito I've ever had, the service is OUTSTANDING and the prices are super reasonable for such great food. The place is gigantic (converted from a warehouse or something), but the size doesn't feel silly or comical. I highly recommend the fish dishes. There's usually one of the specials list. The ropa vieja appetizer is also a must as is the Churrasco (entree).
