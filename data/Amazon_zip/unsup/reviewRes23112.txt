This place is my first Greektown experience as a recent transplant to Chi. First of all, when yelpers say the portions are enormous LISTEN. I read all the reviews first, then chose here over Parthenon and Venus (to come later) and had no idea I was going to get so much food. The two of us went with Family dinner 1, as to try as many things as possible. We also ordered the grilled octopus platter. Right, so what did we get? Hmmm, there was taramosalata (wish I could taste the roe a little more, but very good), gyro meat (oh so damn good), the Grilled tentacles (mmmm), and a really nice saganaki (flambe'd cheese... opa!) Then came a salad, which was the only real let down, as the greens were iceberg (some baby greens maybe, please?) and totally over dressed. Like drenched. Not great. Dinner was roasted lamb, mousaki (kinda like a Greek Shepards pie for those who've never had it), dolmades (stuffed grape leaf), lamb meatballs, rice, and potatoes. Did I mention it was a ton of food??? It was all really really good. Not light, but really quite tasty. Then there's desert! Which is a custard, a baklava and a cup of coffee. Damn I needed that cuppa. So here's the kicker. That meal was $20 bucks per person. Seriously? Yea some elements could be done more delicately, after all it was a pretty filling meal... but at that price, why even bother complaining? We had a full dinner of leftovers for the next day! This is a good place to make a night out of dining. I will definitely be bringing my appetite back here. It will be interesting to see how the other restaurants in the area compare.
