One of Chicago's finest restaurants minus the attitude. Pleasant, efficient staff. Everything was good. Ths is a place you can take a friend or relative visiting from out of town with pride and you know won't be disappointed. I've had some experiences where I took my mom or friend visiting to a 'hot spot' or 'heavily hyped' (Gibson's anyone?) only to be let down or embarrassed. My mom loved Mia Francesca then she loved the picture I showed her afterwards of John Mayer and Jennifer Aniston on a gossip blog coyly \ leaving of Mia Francesca .
