For almost one year my husband and I walked by the place before stepping inside. It didn't look too enticing from the outside with the busstop right outside the door. Then we walked in and have been back about 6 times since. With all the other choices in Andersonville, that is sayng something. We've taken others there, they all agree it's pretty good stuff. Our favorite soup is the complimentary vegetable puree, which one can heat up depending on how much additional mystery paste is added. Then there are the entrees. We usually eat mid afternoon, so we usually order the savory crepes. My all time favorite is the house Icosium crepe, but the Chicago crepe is a solid runner up. Their apricot iced tea is really good, but sometimes a little weaker than others. The cucumber water is a refreshing touch and their hot drinks are usually served in these great oversized glass mugs which I just love. Decor is interesting and we usually can find a seat, all except for one Saturday around 2 pm. Prices are really reasonable, too, but the food is what we come back for. The owner is sometimes there and goes from table to table chatting, like he really wants to know his guests. You'll become a regular once you try it.
