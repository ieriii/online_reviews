Had to find a decent place for breakfast with my little brothers who live near UIC, so I decided on Meli Cafe since I'd had a great solo dining experience here once before. Very cute little cafe right smack in Greektown with ample street parking (don't forget to pay the damn box!). Time to grade our breakfast.... -service...A-attentive, sincerely friendly, not too intrusive -food...A-organic eggs, honey whipped butter!!!, berry marmalade (they also sell jars of this sugary goodness for $6), skillets & crepes galore on the menu!! -decor-A-clean, homey, comfortable Tip: TIme to go back to basics...SHARE!!  Portions are big here, so be ready to doggy bag it!
