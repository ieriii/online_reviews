By far the most amazing mexican restaurant in Chicago! Here are five reasons you need to experience this place for yourself: 1. Alejandro is a fantastic server, who remembers you each time you visit, and seems genuinely happy to see you. His sidekicks are on top of their game as well! 2. Their selection of margarita flavors is great, and they are all delicious! My favorite is the strawberry mango. There are actually chunks of mango in it! 3. The chimichangas and guacamole are unbelievable! 4. It's affordable! 5. When it's warm outside, the back patio is nice. It's not much to look at, and the walkway leading you there is between two brick buildings that may be about a foot apart, but once there, it's worth it! I can never get enough of Mayan Palace!
