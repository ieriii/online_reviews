Good Mexican food! In a sea of fantastic Mexican restaurants (oh Pilsen, my delightful oasis for good, cheap tortas, enchiladas, horchatas, tostadas, tamales), Nuevo Leon stands out for its memorable decor & waitress "uniforms." So colorful! In any case, food is good. Love the free chips, the various dipping options, and the meat on top of flour tortilla thing-a-ma-bop.  BYOB is also nice. Great for groups, good for small tables as well.
