I came here earlier this week and will definitely return. This place is delicious! My boyfriend and I ordered the vegetarian messob w/ 6 portions & we were stuffed. Eat very slowly...I think the injera blows up in your stomach. Regardless, our meal & the service here was great and I can't wait to go back with a larger group so we can sample more of the menu.
