Yes, Yes, YES! I currently live in NYC and everytime I come back home, I gotta get my fix and gorge on Chicago gems that I just can't get anywhere else. We just avoided the long line at around 11 AM on a Thursday. The Chicago-style hot dog is, of course, a classic. The Veal and Parmesan was aight but the Spicy Cajun was surprisingly addictive! Pure culinary genius, I tell you!! The fries were also yummy. And to boot, the guy behind the counter instantly gets you in a good mood. I guess you would be as hype as him too if you had access to Hot Doug's all day.
