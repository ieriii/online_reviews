Have you seen that Food Network show with Paula Deen's sons?? They travel around the country and visit places that have delicious food. Yeah, I know, sounds like many of the shows on that network. But their catch is that they visit places where you, the home viewer, can order from and they'll ship and send the food right to your door. Well, if I ever move away from the city and am craving deep dish, then I can only hope and pray that Pequod's is in the business of domestic shipping. Pequod's is hands down my all time favorite deep dish pizza. As you'll read, everyone gushes over their toppings, but I have to say that the crust is what keeps me coming back. I wouldn't even do it justice to try and explain their crust so just try it yourself! Those Deen brothers visited Lou Malnati's when they were in Chicago, but I call on them to return and experience Pequod's!
