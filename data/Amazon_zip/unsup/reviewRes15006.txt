After my husband and I got a rude greeting at Gondola, we decided to try Sabatino's. Wow, am I glad that we did! This place is old school Italian in every way. The complimentary valet parking, the coat check, the waiters and waitresses in the old school black and white uniforms and the owners who speak Italian and look like they could have come out of Goodfellows or the Godfather. The room is dated, but in a good way. It reminds me of my great aunts living rooms. They also have private booths, which I am definitely reserving for my next visit (and there will be many, many more). As for the food, all I can say is WOW! It started off on the right foot with the pizza bread. Damn is it good, I just wish they gave you more. They also give you warm bread which is clearly made there. I had to stop myself from eating it all. All of the dinner dishes come with soup AND salad,..that's right you get both. My husband and I both had the Minestrone which was really tasty and had a lot of veggies in it. The salads were a good size and they had a large dressing selection. For our entrees, I had the Fettuccine Alfredo which was yummy and satisfying. My husband had some farfalle dish with peas, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. It was one of the best pasta dishes we both have ever had. We both have tons of left overs. For desert we asked if the Canolli's were made in house and they were, so that was it for us! We did see the banana fosters being made and they looked and smelled great. The only negative of this place is that there are no refills on soft drinks, and they are pricey for what you get. I can't wait to go back here. This place was amazing.
