Coming from the northwest, I have been slightly disappointed with the seafood in Chicago. A friend of mine turned me on to Glens. We happened to be there for all you can eat king crab legs. They do all you can eat one day a week. The food was fantastic as well as the service. I ate crab until my stomach hurt and I hope to do it again. I took my mother there when she visited Chicago and she said the crab was some of the best she has ever eaten. I had trout on my second return and it was so good!!
