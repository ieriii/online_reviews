I went with four people, we all got different things and I got to try a bite of it all. The chicken we all agreed was great. The Wagyu and Halibut we all found to be good, not great. The lamb was just ok. We tried three desserts and two appetizers as well and they were all amazing.The service was great, very friendly. The atmosphere was great. The presentation of the food was great. But the food was just good, not great. At this price, I expect the food to be great. I would give it 4 stars, but the thing that really bugged me was that I left the place still very much hungry. The portions were tiny.
