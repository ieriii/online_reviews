Pork Rinds. Hot damn they're good. They're served in a brown paper cone, and dusted off with some cheese and pepper. Think of it as a mix between pork rinds and flaming hot cheetos on steroids (minus the flaming hot cheetos).  Pork Belly. Greatest ever. Ordering this is a must. If you don't, consider yourself a failure.  Also, the first (and only) time I've ever eaten sweetbreads was at Publican, and they were quite tasty. Food/Ambiance/Service - 5 stars all around.
