I will go straight into the food as the ambiance is not why you would go to San Soo Gab San. There is nothing special about the structure or interior itself but it provides a solid foundation for some good eating. This is the place to go within the city limits for Korean BBQ.  The kalbee is definitely worth your while. It is well marinated and tender. Nothing beats having it cooked right in front of you and eating it when it is nice and hot. The food has got to taste better when you are slowly watching it cook right in front of you with the smells coming off the grill the entire time, right? I don't think I have had anything else and I have been here on multiple occasions. The ban chan (the small side dishes) are abundant as well although you may have to flag down the waitress to keep them replenished. I would have liked to give 4.5 stars because of how often I visited here while I lived in Chicago, but no half stars are allowed on yelp. It is also more expensive than other korean restaurants in general nor do I have the balls to give it a full 5 stars.
