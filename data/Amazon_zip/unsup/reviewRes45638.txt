On a Sunday not long ago, my boyfriend and I thought we'd like to enjoy a bit of brunch at Wilde. So we took a stroll over from my apartment, and were seated quickly by a friendly host. The experience seemed promising. The restaurant wasn't full, it wasn't even that busy. The day was pretty, the menu looked like it was full of varied delicious choices with the potential to start the day off great! Our smiles soon turned to looks of concern when we realized that five minutes had passed and no one had greeted us. We were not seated at a corner table in the back where no one could see us, on the contrary, several people nearly bumped into the empty seat to my left. Perhaps it was because we still had our noses stuck in the menu..... we folded them back up and set them on the table, hoping that someone would approach.... nothing. Another few minutes go by, and a hand full of servers, runners, bussers, and bartenders have passed without so much as an acknowledgment. My coffee headache beginning to intensify, I turn to my bf and say... if one more person walks by and ignores us, we're just going to leave.... three more people on the staff walk by.... nothing. We get up and leave. We walk across the street and eat at Stella's where we're greeted with big wide grins....  I have no idea what happened there, but I sure wish I had more to go on than "nothing."
