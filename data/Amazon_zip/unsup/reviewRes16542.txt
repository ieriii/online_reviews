Awesome food! Something for everyone... Order extra naan! The garlic is so yummy and you can eat it with the sauces from the main dishes. I always order the mixed grill which comes sizzling to your table and has grilled shrimp, pork, and chicken marinated in Indian spices. The menu is very extensive and has something that will appeal to anyone. Beer selection is really good and the lighting is ideal for a date or cozy dinner atmosphere. Service is good and up to par but not extraordinary by any means. I don't usually have room for desert so I can't comment on that but definitely recommend for a unique dinner experience.
