Grabbed dinner there on Friday night and was a little nervous because of all the mixed reviews. I must say that my wife and I were very impressed. The food was great, and our waitress did an amazing job. Asparagus appetizer was phenomenal. If Asparagus, Quiche and a Souffle made a love child it would be this. Just phenomenal. I had the lamb which was pit roasted and it was very well spiced and well cooked.  I'm sure we'll go back soon.
