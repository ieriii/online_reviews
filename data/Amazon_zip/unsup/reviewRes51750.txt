oh man I am sooooooo missing Garcia's right now since it is under some remodeling. I love there tacos,steak, tortas, rice, taco salad. and chicken soup. There chicken soup is great when you have the chills or a little sick. Prices are a little high but its worth the extra few cents etc... I hope they re-open soon and that the restaurant comes back better than ever........there STEAK TACOS is just DELICOUS!!!
