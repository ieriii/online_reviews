I thought RJ Grunts was a fine meal. It wasn't anything to sing about in the streets, but it was fine.  The atmosphere is what you go to RJ Grunts for. The original Lettuce Entertain You locale, it has a certain pizazz that you can't put your finger on. Part high class establishment, part dive bar you went to in college. I couldn't pinpoint what I liked about RJ Grunts. I ordered one of their burgers b/c that's what everyone raves about. I wasn't all that impressed. I've had better burgers. But it wasn't so bad that I would've sent it back. The GF loved her meal. She ordered whatever the special of the day was. This particular day it happened to be a chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes and a veggie. She loved it. I remember eating some of hers and thinking that it reminded me of Grandma's house. As brought to my attention (I had forgotten), we did enjoy the cookie skillet dessert. This was a little piece of heaven. Definitely grab one of these on your visit!
