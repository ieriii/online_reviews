The food here is out of this world!! Even if you don't like Indian food, you will love this. I'm not a fan of spicy food and this place provides the perfect balance between spice and taste. I recently went with a friend who happens to be an Indian chef and owns his own catering company and even he could not stop raving about the dinner. The best dish, in my opinion, is the chicken tikka masala. If you've eaten it anywhere else, you will forget all about that when you eat it here!!
