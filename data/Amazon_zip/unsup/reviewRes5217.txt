You almost have to know PP is there to go there, with its Harry Potter station 9 3/4 -esque entrance right off of Michigan. We walked back and forth past it a few times, baffled, before we looked up and saw the sign above proclaiming, "You are idiots," aka "The Purple Pig." The actual restaurant is recessed quite a way in from the street, and upon entering, took a seat at the bar with a puzzlingly mute bartender. He nodded, shrugged, thumbed-up, but never once spoke a single word. Not that he needed to exactly, the food really spoke for itself. We started off with the salt roasted beets - I am a beet fanatic and absolutely fell in love with this dish, while my bf could cared less for the taste, which he just described as "purple." Crunchy, nutty, creamy, and slightly acidic all at the same time, to me it was heavenly with every bite. The proscuitto bread balls were interesting, more kale (I think) than proscuitto or bread, but good none the less. To top it off, I loooooove me a good marrow, and PP's "spread" did not disappoint with its garlic and buttered toast points, sea salt, and parsley. However, the best dish of the lot was definitely the milk-braised pork shoulder. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and I would have licked the plate to get every last touch of the mashed potatoes off if our mute batertender wouldn't have silently judged. We would have given PP 5-stars if it wasn't for the fact that we were STILL hungry after dropping over $60 on the 4 dishes and two glasses of wine, and the fact that getting to this place means that you will inevitably have to battle through the swarms of tourists on Michigan Ave. Location and value aside, however, there's no denial PP knows how to cook up some good eats!
