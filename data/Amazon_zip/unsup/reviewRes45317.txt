Get this--my sister and her family AND my in-laws were in town (that makes 10 of us) on a Saturday night and we needed to find a kid friendly place to eat dinner in the city at 7pm. Wilde took us in no problem. I know what you're thinking--the place must suck if it's that open at that time. But you are WRONG, my friend. Wilde is great! It has this cozy Irish pub feel to it--dark woods, fireplaces, low lights--with a well rounded menu filled with good things to put in your tummy.  My favorites include mac n' cheese, fried fish sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich (yum!), this apple dessert crumble thing, any of their chicken sandwiches, their monster salads...the list goes on and on. Not to mention they have a pretty good beer list as well.  So why not 5 stars? There was one thing I didn't like at Wilde--and that is their shepherd's pie. It just didn't do the job and was pretty bland. A disappointment in one of my favorite go-to places.
