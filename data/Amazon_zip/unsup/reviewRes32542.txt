Went to Demera last Saturday after it was featured on Groupon. We had a great time - just asked our server to pick out three or four entrees and she brought some really tasty stuff. As is the tradition, everything came on that sponge bread - probably my favorite way to eat food. I'd like to put on a shirt made of that stuff every morning and just eat it off during the course of the day. Also, there was a musician playing some lovely Ethiopian music. The Green Mill is right across the street, so Demera is great if you're looking to make a night of it with some music afterward.
