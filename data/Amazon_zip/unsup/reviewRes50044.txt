I am writing this review after my second visit to Las Tablas. I am not a big steak person, but the skirt steak here is TASTY, perfectly seasoned. Both times, my husband and I have ordered the same thing--an empanada sampler and the Combinaciones entree with skirt steak and grilled calamari. While the empanadas and calamari are good, the most delicious part of the meal is hands down the skirt steak. I highly recommend this place!
