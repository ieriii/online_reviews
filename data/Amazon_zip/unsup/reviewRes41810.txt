came here for a couple more times in the last couple months...has the food always been that salty? I don't remember the dishes were that salty last year when i came for the first time... the bone marrow dish were still really good, but i found most of their other dishes are either smothered in lard (they called it pork fat), or, salt. At one time we had to send the fries back....apparently they fried the fries in bacon fat (any diff b/w pork fat and bacon fat?! aren't they the same? I realized the secret ingredient when we asked to send the fries back), They probably taste good to some people, but i just found the "scent"/"taste", whatever you called that unique favour" is, a bit overwhelming. I believe Au Cheval does the similar tricks with their fries and I didn't find the taste as overwhelming as that batch from Gilt that night. hopefully they just had a couple bad months recently...the drinks are still really good though...
