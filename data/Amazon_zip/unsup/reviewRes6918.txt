Fantastic pasta, great service, and a really cute cozy location. The perfect place for a quiet date night or for catching up with the girls. The prices are a little higher, but for homemade pasta and huge portions it is worth it. They also have really fun weeknight specials that I highly recommend you take advantage of like wine discounts or one night where they feature a second Italian-style small plate menu. So fun!
