I wasn't impressed the first time I had it... it was a few years ago and I'd never gone back. I'm a Lou Malnati's girl.  But my patients LOVE this place and talked it up this week, so I decided to try it again. The hubs and I called it in and ordered their deep dish/ pan (same thing) and ordered sausage, mushrooms, onions and jalapenos.  It was ready on time and we drove home with the intoxicating smell radiating from the back seat. I was excited. It looked amazing and we hung out watching the Bulls game, sitting in our family room and devoured a couple slices. You had to use a fork and knife... it was quite a meal. The melted cheesy charred crust, the humongoid sausages, the generous pizza sauce. It was delicious. We finally found another deep dish pizza that we enjoy. The ingredients were fresh and abundant.  Damn Pequods you've redeemed yourself!!!
