Came here for a late night din din with some friends on a Friday night. The bar service was busy, yet friendly, which right away I was impressed by. When you walk in there is a hostess stand and a huge crescent shaped bar. Beyond the bar is a dinning area and then another dining area to the right. I liked that this place was spacious, yet intimate. Our hostess originally told us we were going to have a 30 min wait, so we got cozy at the bar. Then 15 min later she had a table ready for us. So that was cool. I ordered their snazzy foccia bread - yum! I highly recommend trying this. They are known for their burgers and three of us in the group got burgers and there were no complaints. The service was good, although we had three people waiting on us - interesting. However all three were very nice and got our orders all correct. I recommend coming to this place for a late night meal. BTW, there is a classic sit down Ms Pac Man machine with Galaga on it in the back. Retro fun!
