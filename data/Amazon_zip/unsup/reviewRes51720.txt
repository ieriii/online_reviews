Garicia's (on Lawrence) is never crowded, and the food always comes quickly. The margeritas are strong, and decently priced, and the fish tacos (new) are quite good. THE REASON to go to Garcia's (it ain't the decor!) is to get a container of their salsa to go. Nine times out of ten it kicks butt, and is a good value.
