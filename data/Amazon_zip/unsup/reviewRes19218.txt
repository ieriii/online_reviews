Used to go here after work occasionally when I lived in Chicago.  It is one of the best spots for happy hour in the loop (perhaps the BEST spot in the East Loop).  It has the best burger in Chicago, too (The Gage burger, not the $10 option they also serve).  Would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago looking for "New American" cuisine without having to totally break their bank. GET THE BURGER.
