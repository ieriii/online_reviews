I have started coming here more often. They have a pretty good brunch menu, and their chorizo benedict is amazing. The blend of the chorizo and hash browns is a perfect mix, unlike some places that try to make meat/potato mixtures 80% potato. They have an American Irish skillet which is like a meat lover's skillet, and it is HUGE. I consider it at least two meals for me. I don't think they've changed their drink menu in a while, but I've grown fond of the Commodore Perry IPA. When going out drinking, I always enjoy a beer menu that's a bit more extensive than this one, but in terms of proximity, Wilde probably has the best beer menu within a few blocks from me, so it's good for convenience.
