I came here on a Friday around 5:00 p.m. with some friends and were seated right away. I had the Cross of Gold (several of them) and they were light and tasty, but just alright. The food, however, was impressive. My group started off with the bruschetta and tried all four pieces for $8. The duck confit was the best, though I picked off the mushrooms. We split the rappini pizza which was the perfect blend of fontina cheese, garlic and basil and great to get with a vegetarian friend in tow.  After a few hours the place filled up pretty quickly, though that didn't deter from their outstanding service. Our server was attentive, friendly and was helpful in answering questions about the menu. I'd return to try some different brews and pizza, but would get there early again to beat the crowd.
