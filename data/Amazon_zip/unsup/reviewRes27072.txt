Although, it's obvious below a lot of people are digging my favorite Chi-town pizzeria. I've, also, noticed a lot of reviews of people who aren't feeling it. To help, here's some ordering advice when hitting up Pequod's: If you like Sausage Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan Pizza If you like Veggie Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan Pizza If you like Thin Crust Pizza ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan Pizza If you like Pepperoni Pizza with Mushrooms or Green Peppers or something else ---- Order the Pepperoni Pan Pizza The thing that makes their pizza so good is that caramelized outer crust and the crisp 'roni's on top. It's niche pizza and when you order other toppings I've found that it just doesn't work right and the excess moisture in those other toppings doesn't lead to that crusty deliciousness. If you don't like Pepperoni Pan Pizza, you're better off going somewhere else. If you like Pepperoni Pan Pizza, this is the best.
