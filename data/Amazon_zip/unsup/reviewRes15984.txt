There isn't a better place in the city to just go and relax in the comfort of the food and atmosphere. My fiance and I love going in on a saturday for a late lunch. Sit at the bar, hang with Don, one of the friendlier bartenders around and eat some comfort food. All the food is good(not great) but always consistent, great for a quiet saturday of football.
