This place was amazing - delicious and just wonderful! I had some time between a meeting and a work event and my friend recommended that we come here for some drinks and a bite to eat. This was amazing from start to finish. They have this extensive and amazing wine list. We started off with a quartino of this Italian red wine - I couldn't pronounce the name then and I doubt that I can even spell it now. Our first dish was the roasted bone marrow smear with herbs which was savory and delicious on the toasted bread. We also had the Chicken Thigh Kebabs with Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki which was juicy and deliciously flavored, as well. Since I was a time crunch, we only ordered one more dish - the Fried Manchego with Membrillo Vinaigrette which was delicious, as well. Everything was perfectly done and nothing was overboard. Overall, delicious food and perfect for sharing. I definitely look forward to coming back again!
