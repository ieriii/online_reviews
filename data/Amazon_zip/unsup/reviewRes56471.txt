My hubby decided to surprise me for our anniversary by taking to frontera grill. I used to watch his cooking show and thought he cooked great Mexican food. I decided to order a fish plate and it was terrible. It was so bland, I could've had a better meal at Mcdonalds at one third the price. My hubby was not impressed either after recieving the wrong order and also not great flavor in his dish. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone because of terrible service, terrible food and experience.Very disappointed, save your money and have your Mexican food made by a real Mexican! I give one star for having a nice place.
