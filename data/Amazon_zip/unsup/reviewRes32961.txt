I really like Ethiopian food, and I've only had it at one other restaurant, so I may be a bit biased. But I really like this place. The portions are big... If there are 3 of us, we'll order a combo for 2, and there will be plenty of food and even leftovers that we take home. Ethiopian food is definitely an acquired taste so if you've never had it before, go with an open mind. The waitstaff has always been friendly every time I've gone, and service takes an appropriate amount of time. Also, they have outside seating in nice weather, which is always a good thing!
