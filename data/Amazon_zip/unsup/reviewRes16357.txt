This is one of the best Indian restaurants that I have ever been to! Love the long list of dishes that we can choose from (the word Tandoori appears in more than just 'tandoori chicken'!). We had Lamb Madras (Boneless pieces of lamb cooked with South Indian spices flavored with coconut) and loved it! You can taste the shredded coconut in the gravy, which is new to me. We also ate Chicken Tikka, very juicy and tasty. It's a little pricey compare to other Indian restaurants that I've been too, but the portion is huge, so we were definitely happy (their 1 portion rice is definitely for 3 people! :p). Excellent service, great food!
