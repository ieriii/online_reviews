After reading previous reviews I had to see this place. After coming into Chicago for a night I went to take a tour of the rooms. It was absolutely horrible. My friend and I left to have a few drinks only then could I bring myself to say we should stay there. $55 was reasonable which left me a few hundred more to spend out for the night. When I came in a 3:30 AM I decided to take a look at the other floors and the roof. It was worth the experience the views are amazing and if you are a fan of history this place has it. In 1936 Serial Killer Robert Nixon killed one of his victims on the fifth floor of this hotel. The over night clerk says he isn't sure which room it happened in but room 515 is creepy. Since I know the murder took place on the fifth floor that could be the spot. I did drop my toothbrush on the floor so it was lost forever and yes it smells and yes the walls are cracked and crumbling but to be in the heart of the city for that cheap of a price was well worth it. We were on 16th floor and the other people there were Belgians who stay there every year when they come to town. I really enjoyed the experience but was very happy to take a hot Shower somewhere else the next day...
