Fantastic time. 6 of us wandered in looking for a bite before the Cranberries show. It was pretty crowded but they somehow got us seated in under 5 minutes. We were all pretty new to Ethiopian so we let the server order for us and it was a feast.Plus, it turns out that if you show them your ticket to a nearby show, they knock 5 bucks off your bill.Will definitely be back.
