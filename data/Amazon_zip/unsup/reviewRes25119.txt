A group of nine of us went on Saturday Jan 16. Many of us have done tapas elsewhere (BaBaReeba, Barcelona, some of us old school in actual Spain, etc.), but we had a couple newbies. PROS: Our server, Deirdre, was very polite and attentive and made knowledgeable suggestions. (Although we did not necessarily go with said suggestions. It did at least show she knew what she was about there!) We got two comped items: some delicious tomato flatbread and these flash-fried chili thingies. Food very tasty. Things I tasted at various points: patatas bravas (delicioso), the mushroom paella (rich, somewhat salty to me, but good), chorizo (good), salchichon de vic (good), datiles con almendras (excellent), diver scallops (excellent). I was somewhat surprised the place didn't have the standard bread and olive oil offered. It would have been nice to have something to go with the extra salchichon, for instance. Decor is swank. Things to consider (not necessarily CONS): Mercat, IMO, is one of those "for show" restaurants. It's got the swanky decor, the swanky downtown location, you should dress appropriately. The food is staged and dressed up as well. Compared to some of the other tapas places I've been to, they were more expensive for less on the plate (and we had a lot of people to go around, so we were ordering multiples). I guess I've got it in my mind that tapas should be more fun and relaxed and casual. It's not that this place wasn't fun (it was), but the overwhelming impression I have is it's a place for people who are more interested in the looks and social cache of going to such a place. And of course you are going to pay for that because hey, the place has got to pay that expensive downtown rent! I'm just not into that. If I'm going out to eat, I'm more concerned with service and food quality. Overall, I am glad I went for the experience, but I probably won't be back. I'd rather return to my other tapas options in Chicago and Evanston.
