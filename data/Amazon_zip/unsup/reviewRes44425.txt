They're lucky the sushi was pretty darn good. Until my food came, I was leaning towards a three, based on liking the trendy atmosphere and prompt service, but feeling shocked and disappointed at the $5 per bottle corkage fee - the first I've encountered at Asian BYOBs in the city. But...the sushi was fresh, the flavors clean, and overall very very good. I had the Snow White roll, and it was excellent. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the rolls!
