Third time eating at Big Jone's was yesterday. First time, I had a slightly pulpy Mimosa and spectacular catfish tacos during lunchtime. Second time, took my dad and son during dinner. Waiter was fantastic (looked like Dave Chappelle) and I ordered the gumbo ya-ya. Whew!!! Awesome. They also had Two Brothers beers which was cool too. Not that these people know me on a first time basis, but I guess I joined the mailing list. My birthday was this past week and I get a lovely invitation to go to Big Jone's for a free wine/beer/cocktail and a free dessert. Awesomeness, again!!! I had a nice Greek wine and the crab cakes were delicious. I tried the pan-eed catfish with curry sauce yesterday and I ate every single bite. It was so GOOD!!! I think the food takes a while, but I'm used to it by now. It's just a horrible process wanting to eat but waiting so long. I believe the food is worth the wait. BTW, this is the ONLY place where my 7 year old son loves the chicken fingers.
