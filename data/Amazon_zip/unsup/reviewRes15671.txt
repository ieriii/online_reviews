The service here was excellent, except for one lie by omission. I ordered Pollo Francese, which was terrific - succulent chicken, lightly battered, served over spinach with a terrific wine and lemon sauce. And a side of pasta. It had three (yes, 3) chicken breasts. "All the chicken dishes are that way" the server tells me after I exclaim at the size. It probably could have fed all three of us along with salads and some of their yummy bread. Having said that, it was a great dish. The Minestrone was simple, flavorful and hearty - just the way I like it (this one had pasta in it). Others ordered Farfalle Con Verdura (simple, good, huge) and a chicken canneloni (very nice, with a creamy sauce). The salads were also huge. Big, comfortable food - nothing earthshaking, but I would go back. And the service was great the night we were there - giving us suggestions and being attentive.
