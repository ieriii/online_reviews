Chicago has lots of great restaurants and eateries. This one is not to be missed for all the right reasons: Great food, friendly service, neighborhood flava, and right price. While not cheap, the food is Authentic with a cap-A. Owner is very present and all family friendly. Nice garden for the summer. Seasonal menues make it a place to return to every 2-3 months, cuz you'll never get to eat all you want on the menu in one meal... Lots of imagination and style without being fussy. Marinated grilled lambs heart were mind blowing... I know not for the faint of heart (sorry) but a simple, rich, and tasty adventure. Perfect for Valentines Day. Tho I think I was the only person who tried it that night.Basic but excellent wine list by glass 250 or Bottle. When it comes to real regional Italian, this and Ricardo's Trattoria in LP are the ones.
