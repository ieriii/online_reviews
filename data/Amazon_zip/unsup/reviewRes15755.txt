I have been torn over this review for a long time. The atmosphere makes it for me. yes it's huge, and it's not very intimate. But the fun, sexy art all over the walls is super entertaining. I love the bold colors and all the crazy decor everywhere you look. Kind of like a sexy Bucca di Beppo, if such a thing existed. Actually, I remember walking in for the first time, and my best friend said "this is like YOU! In restaurant form!" I think the restaurant would have to be smaller to be ME, but still, the point is, I like the decor. :) I also love the latin theme and want to come back for dancing. It could be awesome. But what really gets me about Carnivale is the food. It's good, but it is not fantastic and it will cost you an arm and a leg. I was not wowed by the ceviche or the ropa viejo. Or the drinks. I don't think I was wowed by anything. :( I'd recommend it for sitting in the front bar part, and dancing. Because it looks like fun.
