Wow. I didn't know what to expect in terms of elevated bbq, but I was shocked to say the least when I walked in the front door of the beautiful Chicago Q space. Gone is the dark decor of former sushi haunt, Tsunami. In its place is white wainscoting, warm country club-esque clean lines and modern art work that made me feel as if I was sitting on someone's porch down south. The staff is equally as friendly. I hadn't realized that this was a bit of a dressy restaurant and came to dinner from some last minute grocery shopping. The hostess kindly checked my bags in coat check and I chatted up the genial bartender while I waited for my friend. Our waitress couldn't have been nicer either and happily explained the concept of the Q and her favorite items on the menu. I left completely stuffed and carrying a box of leftovers. The Pimm's Cup is refreshing and a delightful spin on a classic. Great companion to the half bbq chicken, cornbread, macaroni and cheese and bacon fritters that I feasted on. Oh, AND they give you little butter pickles and homemade potato chips when you sit down. This place is great! Leave room for dessert too (if you can) I had the chocolate Kentucky pie which was decadent. I was expecting to go in liking Chicago Q but not loving it. I came out a devoted fan. The service, the atmosphere and the food are all top notch. Welcome to the Chicago bbq scene!
