Love it, LOVE it, LOVE IT!! Maybe I'm easy to please...but great breakfast food, fresh ingredients, good service, 5 stars for me. I love any place where you can get breakfast all day, and Meli is no exception. The orange-lemonade is fresh and tart. The omelette's and Benedict's are made to perfection. All of the fresh extras, like the homemade jams and honey butter, make everything here that much more special. I recommend Meli for breakfast or lunch. Enjoy!
