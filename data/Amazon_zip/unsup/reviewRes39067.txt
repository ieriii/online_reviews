I took my guy here for brunch based on stellar reviews. Yelpers, you done me wrong. The good and the bad/shitty: Shitty: 1) As we sat down we were told the crab cakes, biscuits and gravy and two other items were now out of stock. Sweet! 2) My guy ordered the croque madam and as he ordered we were told that their fryer was out so no beef fat fries. WTF? 3) When he then ordered an Arnold Palmer we found out they were out of Iced Tea. WTF?! 4) There was a hair in both his home fries/hashbrowns AND my cauliflower thing. I didn't tell the waiter because then it just looks like you are fishing for a free meal and I was a server for years and hated that. 5) As we were finishing up, the waiter said verbatim "Our chef would like to offer you a maple fig donut, fresh". Sweet. Based on that statement it sounded like the chef was trying to make-up for his total lack of ingredients with his free donut peace offering. When we get the bill, there was the $3.50 for the donut. Again, WTF?! Good 1) My "daisy" something or other drink and my cauliflower/lentil thing were amazing. No joke, my meal was awesome... Curried and perfectly cooked cauliflower, great lentils, raita, perfectly ripe mango pieces. I found the hair when I was almost done, so I got to enjoy the food not knowing someone had apparently shaved their beard into my meal. There were just too many bads... Out of food, out of tea, hair in TWO ITEMS, awkward offering of a seemingly gratis donut. Good luck Longman. You suck and when a new hipster place comes about in 16 months, everyone will forget that you exist. I want my $45 back.
