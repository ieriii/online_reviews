When my friend told me she had a *gourmet* hot dog place for me to try I kinda thought it was a big joke and was wondering where the punch line was... This was until I had the greatness that is a hot dougs hot dog! I sampled the prime rib with duck fat fries. Let me just tell you that this place was an experience everyone should try. It can be a little intimidating if you aren't "in the know" (the no sitting before you are served rule, long line and limited hours are a bit of a detractor) but believe me, it is well worth the trouble.
