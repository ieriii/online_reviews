One word Chicago: Overrrrated. I know this isn't the best Chicago has to offer (even though it claims to be and has been voted such by several news groups). Please tell me its not Chicago's finest. I went to Lou Malnati's, but didn't feel like waiting 2 hours. That must be Chi town's best. So this is all I tried, and I was sorely disappointed. To add insult, it took them over an hour to get us our stuffed pie. Crust was dry and tasteless, sauce was mediocre, and overall the pizza was bland. I ended up boxing it up and giving it away on the street.  Sorry Chicago, but Zachary's in Oakland, CA does Chicago style better than Chicago.
