The food was some of the best food I have eaten in my life but not answering the phone for reservations, and not returning phone calls is a bit nose-up. Beyond that, the restaurant was a one of a kind experience, having the chef be personally involved in presenting us our food. The portions were small but if I remember correctly there were eight delicious courses. I recommend trying it but getting past the reservation system is the most challenging part.
