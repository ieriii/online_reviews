This place is really, really good. We live right across the street so yay! They have some cool eclectic items on the menu, and the atmosphere is quaint and even can make for a good date night with the candles on the tables. The prices are cheap, but the food is not lacking in quality. We never leave disappointed. Service is good too, the old man who runs the place is the nicest guy ever. He even gave me chopsticks once when we ordered sushi and forgot them. All of the servers seem happy to work for him.  They also have boba tea/smoothies here, which we are a big fan of.
