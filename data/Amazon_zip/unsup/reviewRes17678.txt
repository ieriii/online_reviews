Dark quiet spot with good mixed drinks. The bar tenders wear old school gitup. Trendy and refinded without trying to be. Solid spot. Only let in enough people that there are seats so no people crowding around which is nice but there is usually a line. It was packed by 6pm on a wednesday when it was like the first nice day of summer.
