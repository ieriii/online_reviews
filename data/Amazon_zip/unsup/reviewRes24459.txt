We lived near the restaurant for eight years until 2006. Everytime we come back to Bucktown, we have to stop by for a mango shake and the costa rican sandwich. If you ever make it to Costa Rica, it is the same food at Irazu. Unfortunately for Costa Rica, it is the same food/menu across the country until you get to the Caribbean coast where Jamaican influence the food with more spice.
