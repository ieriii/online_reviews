We headed into this restaurant on the 4th, and it was relatively empty. I have gotten use to San Francisco service, which is better than any city I have ever been, but I will say this restaurant had excellent service. The wine list was reasonably priced and the meal was great. I had the flounder special. My one complaint is the fish was a little underdone. I would have liked it to be cooked a little bit more. The flavors were spot on though. My husband had the shrimp grits were great. All and all this place was great.
