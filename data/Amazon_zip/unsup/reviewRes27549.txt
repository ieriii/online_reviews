Pretty disappointed with our experience. The service was poor and the kitchen was unbelievably slow (we waited an hour between our apps and our entree). The food however was fantastic, but you expect the total package at this price point (especially on a Thursday at 7...). I wouldn't recommend it considering the cost.
