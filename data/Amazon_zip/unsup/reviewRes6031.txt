WOW. I had been hearing about Davanti for a little bit now, and I rarely get over to Little Italy anymore since college days are long gone. If you're looking for inexpensive Italian food that will blow your mind then get your little butts over here now! Seriously...do it now! In fact, I will go so far as to say I haven't had such great Italian cuisine in a great while. These guys are taking fresh and fulfilling to the next level. The space itself is very warm and inviting. The hardwood floors have a very rustic feel to them and the lighting fixtures are something I'd like to have for myself. In exterior does not reflect the lovely atmosphere on the inside. They've always told me you can't judge a book by its cover. It's cozy and perfect for any type of gathering. Date worthy? I would certainly say so! I dined on a Sunday night and it was pretty low-key. On Sundays, they have what is called "Sinful Sundays" where they offer no corkage fee when you bring your own wine. This is very good to know. On Wednesdays I noticed they also have $5 House Martinis. This is also a bonus! Service was friendly and just plain awesome. Let's talk about the food, because that is what's so amazing about this establishment in the first place! We started with the Calamari which in my opinion is pretty standard everywhere. I must say, I've never had a better order of Calamari in my life. They must sprinkle love potion all over their food because I've got stars in my eyes. My dining buddy for the evening tried Riccio di Mare e Granchio (linguine + sea urchin + crab). This is something I would have never ordered on my own, but it came highly recommended. BONUS! Since I was in the mood for fish, I ordered Spada Davanti, which was purely delightful and hit the spot. (grilled swordfish + brussel sprouts + pancetta + Calabrian chili) For desert, we had to try the torta bacio (chocolatehazelnut mousse + crunchy bottom + cocoa nibs) mmmmmmm. I can still taste it now!
