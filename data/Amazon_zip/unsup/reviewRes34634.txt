I have been here enough times to say that it is one of the most consistent breakfast places. You will not have good/bad batches, but the same thing every time. Service is quick and only tapers off on the most busy weekend rushes. Omelets are excellent, skillets, pancakes, etc are all very good. I recommend getting your diced potatoes well done, that's the way they should be.
