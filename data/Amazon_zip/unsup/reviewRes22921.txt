Probably the most popular and well known restaurant in Chicago Chinatown.  I have Asian friends living in cities all over the US and it seems like they have all heard of this place or been here.  You may have a wait a bit to get your table, but the wait is usually under 15 minutes and if you want Sichuan cuisine, this is the place to go! Dishes to order: Sichuan cuisine is known for spiciness so you have been warned.  My favorite dishes here are the water boiled beef and the mapo tofu. The water boiled beef comes in a fiery red chili sauce and contains chinese cabbage.  A great sauce to eat with some rice.  The mapo tofu here comes red and fiery as well. The other dish my dining companions always get is the chili chicken. Lightly battered and flash fried chicken that is stir fried with fiery whole dried chilis.  Not my thing, but if you like chicken and spicy, try it out. The other thing to try Lao Sze Chuan out for is their hot pot.  For under $20 per head you can get all you can eat hot pot.  Veggies, meat, and seafood.  This may get a bit messy, but it is definitely worth trying out hot pot here if you haven't before. Other places you can go if spicy isn't your thing: I think Lao Sze Chuan is a little dirtier than the other Lao restaurants.  Still cleaner than a normal Chinatown restaurant.  If you don't like spicy, try out one of Tony Gourmet Group's other restaurants, Lao Shanghai or Lao Beijing.
