I've never actually been here, but they catered the Exhale Spa event this evening and everything they brought in was so good! The pumpkin cupcakes won the contest, but the red velvet cupcakes and fruit tarts were very close behind. I never even heard of this bakery, but I guess I've been missing out based on my experience tonight and all the great reviews.
