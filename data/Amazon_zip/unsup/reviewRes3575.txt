I hate that I'm not going to do this place justice with a thorough review, but suffice it to say that you must go there and get a buddha bowl. I think i ordered a veggie one with tofu?? I don't recall because it was a few months ago and I forgot to review it. I had never had Korean food before and my friend and I walked in real quick and it just BLEW MY MIND!!
