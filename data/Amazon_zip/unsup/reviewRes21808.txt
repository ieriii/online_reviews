We went for lunch on a Sunday. Sadly, there were no brunch items on the menu like huevos rancheros. The chips were only ok, but the salsa was nice and spicy, uncommon these days. I had the carne asada which was a bit tough and chewy. We had an urge for tres leches (the "three milks" dessert), but we went away with none. I like Mayan Palace but probably won't be back until they learn to marinade their carne asada and add tres leches to the menu.
