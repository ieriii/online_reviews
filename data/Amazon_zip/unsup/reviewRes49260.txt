This was the second, and final stop on my mini crawl. I LOVE the vibe of this place, very cozy, dark-ish...I really liked it in here. I, again, asked what flavors of cupcakes they had and the man behind the counter was so descriptive about all the flavors it was hard not to want to try them all! =] I ended up going with the chocolate with a salted caramel filling, vanilla/vanilla and the red velvet. I also saw some savory croissants and just had to try the turkey/swiss. So...the good...the croissant was AMAZING! It was crunchy where it needed to be, soft, flaky and tender in the center and the contrast of the slight sweetness of the pastry and the sharpness of the swiss was perfection! The cupcakes...I LOVED that salted caramel filling in the chocolate cupcakes, it was dense, almost buttery with a great flavor. Now the cakes themselves, all of them for that matter, were just okay. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the cake or the frosting. They were a bit dry...let's just say I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, the cakes displayed in the window were truly pieces of art, and I would consider doing a cake tasting to see if the larger sized cakes have a better flavor than the cupcakes because the designs were THAT good! So we will see in the future about that...but I would definitely stop in again for one of those savory croissants! Mmmmm...
