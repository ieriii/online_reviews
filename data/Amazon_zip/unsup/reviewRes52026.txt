Not my thing- nope, I will pass. Corn crust. Enough to make my stomach clench. I had the personal pan pizza. Pepperoni and cheese. It was heavy on the sauce, and VERY heavy crust. Yuck! One of my friends had a thin crust. He was not too thrilled. I think the best part of our meal was my salad. I get it some like the place. Some actually call this Chicago pizza. It is not. I do not. I will not be back.
