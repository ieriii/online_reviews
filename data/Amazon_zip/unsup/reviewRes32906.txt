I've never tried Ethiopian food but I went today with a couple friends to try their lunch special for $7.95. Large portions for cheap. We all chose four different meats/veggies and shared them with each other. We used our hands to pull apart a thin, spongy bread and grabbed meats/veggies to eat. Definitely an interesting experience because I'm not used to eating with my hands. The meats were mostly spicy and very hot. I liked the meats better than the veggies. Only thing was that the bread made me very full within minutes (so I asked for a fork and started eating just the meat and veggies). I'm not sure I'd try it again only because I don't think my stomach can handle the amount of spice I ate today (and usually I can handle a lot of spice). But it was definitely worth a try, the money, and the experience!
