i heard that the greek islands was one of the better greek restaurants to go to so I wanted to do something different for my moms bday. With the family thing, we usually keep it pretty familiar, but we tried the greek thing this time. The calamari was okay nothing special, the appetizer potatoes with garlic were way too salty and garlicky, and the saganaki was too salty. So the appetizers aren't very good. Then, I ordered a beer which was spilled on me...fell to the ground and cracked and splashed all over my moms jacket and hair! haahha. the waiter was apologetic, but i was surprised that the manager who we saw scolding at the waiter didn't approach us at all.  I ordered an eggplant which was pretty good, they ordered chicken and also the lamb, those were pretty good as well. This was great b/c the way things were going I didn't have a good feeling about this outing. So, the entrees saved the day. The waiter then brought out a piece of cake for mom which was pretty good and then he said the cake would be discounted and it was free. Well, of course it was! They brought it out without us asking for one! duh! i mean it was a nice gesture but I mean what were you going to do? charge us? So that kinda bothered me ONLY because I expected some sort of discount for spilling beer all over us right? I don't know, I guess its just a business thing not to give away free food, BUT really do people have to get loud and yell in order to get justice! So, yes the entrees were good which is the main thing, but I guess i will say that their service was below average. Overall, I think the food was good, but I just don't feel that Greek food is my thing. if I have the urge for greek food sometime soon I might re-visit, but I actually feel that I'd like to give another place a try. Also they have free Valet that is pretty nice.
