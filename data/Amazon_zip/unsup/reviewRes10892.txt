After living in CT a few years ago, I was looking for a place to get some great pizza and house-brewed beer. Now that I live over in Wicker Park, I think I have found the place. As I stated above, the pizza is great. It is New Haven style at its finest. They even have a garlic mashed potato option that I first grew to love on the east coast. The home brewed beer is very good with a wide variety of options across the brewing spectrum. With all of the pizza and beer goodness, the atmosphere was a bit lacking (hence the lost star). The music is always way too loud. It is really hot (hello swamp ass). If you are even thinking about going on a weekend you need to get there way too early for my liking. I mean the food and beer are good, but waiting an hour to even get a table is just too much (it is still pizza).
