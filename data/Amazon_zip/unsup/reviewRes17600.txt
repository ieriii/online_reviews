This place is charming and good for date night. You will be either seated at the table or bar. It won't get crowded inside because they only let you in when there are open seats. On the other hand, the wait might be long for people who are waiting in line. From my experience, the wait was not bad for two people, but for a group, you can expect to wait longer. Drinks were good. We sat at the bar so we got to see the bartender showing off his technique too. My drink was served with the gigantic ice cube and it looks really cool. Music was not too loud so it is still possible to have conversation.
