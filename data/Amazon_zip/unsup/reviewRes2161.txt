This place really did exceed my expectations. The line was a bit long, but was well worth the wait. The menu makes it almost impossible to decide what you want because it all sounds delicious. I had an anduille chicago-style, buffalo sausage with aged cheddar and some ridiculous mustard i cant remember, but the best was the rabbit sausage with white wine dijon and fresh feta chesse (think soft, not crumbly). Duck fat fries were also unreal. I felt like an absolute glutton, but it was an experience I will not soon forget.
