This is not just the best hot dog I have ever had, it is quite possibly the best meal of my life. I was totally blown away by the quality of this dog, And the duck fat fries were incredible. around and really experience my trip. I waited in line for almost 2.5 hours on saturday and I would do it again, In fact i would wait in line all day to have this again. The line was very long but I am glad it was because they do not rush people in and out. They take the time to get you a place to sit down and enjoy your food without feeling rushed out the door. To me this was the biggest plus because for all of the wait I was given a chance to look around and really experience my trip. If you are planning on going to Hot Dougs, which you would be insane not too, go when they open at 10:30, even though I did not mind waiting inline i will plan my next trip better to get there a bit earlier. And on a final note. I thought it was a typo when I seen that "The Dog" with everything was only $1.75!
