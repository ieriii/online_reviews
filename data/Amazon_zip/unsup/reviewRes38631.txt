This place is fine, GREAT beer selection, nice ambiance. Problem is, it's way too crowded. All the time. The only way to do it is to eat in the back, and then leave and go to one of the other neighborhood bars. It's too bad, because it should be a place where you can just relax with your friends and take advantage of the amazing beers they have in the appropriately selected glass. I really dislike going here because you can't move at all. Much prefer Glasgott's
