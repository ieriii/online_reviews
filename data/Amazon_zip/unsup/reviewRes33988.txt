Ugh, Sultan's Market has just gotten bad. This place used to be fantastic but the last several times we've eaten here it's just gone from good, to okay, to never again. Seriously, it's been more than a bad night... it's been a repeat, repeat offender. Sorry Sultan's, it might be a trek but I'll head up Kedzie for my middle-eastern fix cause you cannot deliver anymore.
