The duck is awesome. My husband and I have been looking for crispy duck as we had in London for a couple years and finally found something that is the closest and maybe we can say EVEN better! In London they fry the duck, here at Sun Wah - it is roasted so you get more flavor. It was delicious. We went with a group of 10 people, 6 of them really wanted duck, the other 4 wanted to taste it. We ordered 2 ducks, thinking it may be too much but it was JUST RIGHT. Everyone ate the duck and loved it.  We also got a few other dishes, but if we were to go back I would def. stick with the duck. It comes with duck fried rice/duck chow mein noodles and duck soup - I didn't try the soup, but I heard there were a lot of bones in it - the duck fried rice & the chow mein however was delicious. I would definitely go back and recommend it for any duck lover and even those who aren't - you can be converted!! YUM! we had multiple rounds of drinks, 2 duck specials and maybe 6 other entrees, and it was only $28/pp. can't beat that!
