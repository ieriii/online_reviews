THE BEST Mexican restaurant in Chicago. Why pay $40 for a Rick Bayless dinner when you can spend $10-15 at Garcia's and get an equally good (if not better) dinner?? I've been going here since 1987 and I think I've put all of their kids through college with the amount of money I've spent on burritos all this time. Try the chicken enchiladas in mole'...out of this world. Hot salsa and hot chips to snack on, coupled with perfectly cold and sweet horchata round out your meal.  My only complaint is that the restaurant is no longer the hole-in-the-wall go-to Mexican restaurant that few people know about. The days of "Hi Ryan, the usual?" are gone. It's now waiting for 45 minutes for a table, which is a testament to the quality of the food. They've sold out to the man and this has become a chic, trendy joint, but I can't blame them. The food is that good...why not make a bunch of money??
