I went all boring here. When someone else is paying, that's the best time to try new foods. I'm not paying? Yes, I'll try the Kadhai Ka Palak. Gajar Ka Halwa? Sure, I'll try it.  I typically like the adventure and experience of trying new foods, but I just wanted some rice, naan and tikki massala. So we did get that with the palak paneer. Admittedly, pretty boring stuff, but still tasty nonetheless. Typical Indian fare, nothing too spectacular, but of good quality.  Typically for me, the biryani is the deciding factor on whether or not an indian restaurant has its act together. Since I didn't try it, my 3 stars will suffice for now. It's probably one of the few places downtown to get good Indian.  Oh, and the bathrooms have foam soap. I like foam soap.
