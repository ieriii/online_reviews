About as good as food can get... But you'll pay for it, lol. Seriously, this place is supremely expensive, to the point where I never would have chosen to go if I wasn't dragged.. boy was I wrong... Obviously not the place to go for your everyday dinner, but it's an amazing experience. the front door is frankly a little intimidating, you kinda feel like you're walking into a psych experiment or something (the walls collapse around you as you walk toward the end of the hall).. But everything is amazing there.. even foods I thought sounded pretty gross tasted phenomenal. I highly recommend doing the wine pairing as well.. It costs more.. but how often are you going to drop this much money on a meal anyway.
