I know, I know. As Review #584, I have "nothing useful to add." Too bad. This is my happy place. Therefore I shall review it. The space is just gorgeous. It actually wasn't at all how I pictured it, finally making it here LONG after the hype had come and gone. It was even prettier.  To truly enjoy it, come at "off" times- such as right at opening on a Friday for "happy hour" (not the obnoxious kind of course) like we did. It is quiet, it is dark, and you'll probably be seated in the room with the fireplace. You can even bring a "large" group at these times, since the cozy back coner tables near the fireplace can easily seat 7 or 8. The crowd and noise pick up later in the evening (although we managed to blow through at least 5 hours here barely noticing the time passing, when normally the noise would have distracted me. Maybe we fell down the rabbit hole). The Violet Hour serves up the most interesting drink menu I have ever seen. I made a point to order at least 2 with egg whites in the ingredient list (The Riviera being a hit among the group, frothy and happy looking, served with some leftovers on the side). I tried a Tequila Old Fashioned as well (not to my liking, but certainly not VH's fault- I should have known it wouldn't be up my alley and was just trying to branch out). Everyone else seemed to adore their drinks.  We did order some food as well- the Tots were a great compliment to drinking in general, the Hummus was actually a pretty generous serving compared to what I had expected, and the Doughnuts rounded things out nicely. We had at least 4 drinks each, plus the food, and I can't remember exactly how much it cost us, but it was not nearly as much as I thought it would be, and was definitely worth it for a luxe night out - I am so glad I finally made it. It completely lived up to how much I had hyped it up in my head. The Violet Hour is the happiest hour...
