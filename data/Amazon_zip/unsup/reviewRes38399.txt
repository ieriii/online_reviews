They seem to be everywhere, but don't mistake this chain for Pizza Hut or Domino's . . . this is one fine pizza. There's a big difference between a deep-dish and stuffed pie; the latter has two crusts, top and bottom, so if you're not counting carbs - as if anyone coming here is! - order one with fresh spinach, which should help ease your conscience . . . as long as you overlook all the wonderful cheese that comes with it. Although they ship nationwide, the cost is prohibitive, and I can't imagine the pie would taste nearly as good as it does hot out of the oven here.
