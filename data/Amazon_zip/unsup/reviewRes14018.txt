I love IPAs and Revolutions offerings, the Whip and Iron Fist, were both great. Aside from their own brews, they had other great options from Goose Island, Three Floyds, Two Brothers, Dogfishhead and more. The food is great too. I definitely recommend the herb and mustard chicken sandwich. The waitstaff is friendly and quick. Definitely will be back again.
