After a LONG day of doing the tourist bit downtown with Millenium Park and what not, my friend suggested Gino's East. I've heard great things and came here with high expectations. The line was out the door to the side of the building but really only lasted for 25 minutes so that was great. The restaurant is large and has a fun, casual atmosphere. We split the sampler apetizer consisting of cheese sticks, fried calamari and spinach sticks. I liked the spinach sticks the most, think of cheese sticks with spinach inside. Delicious. We ordered one large stuffed pizza for the four of us. Sadly we could not finish. 1/2 of the pizza was cheese (for the girls) and 1/2 Supreme for Aaron and myself. I liked the pizza but it wasn't spectacular like I had hoped. Oh well, the restaurant is fun and I enjoyed my time here.
