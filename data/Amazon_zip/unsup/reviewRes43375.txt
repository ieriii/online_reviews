This has to be my new favorite place! I can't say anything about their other food, since I haven't tried it yet, but the sandwich I got was delicious!! Grilled portabella, goat cheese, roasted bell peppers and spinach. It's a very decent portion and they have several sides to choose from. Got my hubs a roasted beef sandwich and he was very happy with it. They also have beer, wine, mimosas and they are very decently priced. maybe sandwiches are a bit expensive, but I don't mind paying for delicious, quality ingredients, so I was happy with my 9$ plate that also included a homemade(I assume) pickle that was very good :)
