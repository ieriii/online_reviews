Come here on a dinner date with friends and I expected better....We ate outside in the evening and a little more lights would have made the place better; I felt like I was eating in darkness, not even knowing what I was picking up off my plate, and had friends dropping food in their laps! I had a chicken dish and it was tender but flavorless...Did not really wow me
