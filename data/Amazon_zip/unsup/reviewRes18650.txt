I'm still not convinced burgers deserve all the attention they've gotten lately. Is any gourmet burger that much better than your typical back-yard product? Bad Apple makes a good plate. Better than some of the other burger-centric joints. The 'Slow Burn' had a nice balance of flavor and heat. 'Dracula's Revenge' was covered in subtle garlic. But nothing really elevated them above a typical good burger. The best upsell was spending the extra to get flavored fries. Both the curry and chipotle were much improved by the spices. The beer selection was really impressive, and the staff was to-die-for indie-heartbreakers. Both should be way bigger draws than the burgers.
