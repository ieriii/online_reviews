My server was AWESOME! Shawn is professional and knowledgeable but that is not the reason I chose to comment. Frankly, I expect that from a server when dining at a nice restaurant. Shawn, however went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. My wife and I were very impressed by the way he recommended items based on flavor profile and not on price. I rarely rely on a wine recommendation from my wait person, but Shawn made me comfortable and the wine was great. In future visits Shawn has Carte Blanche! Thanks Shawn.
