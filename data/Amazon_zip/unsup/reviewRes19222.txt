Thanks Yelp...you helped me find a good dinner spot in "The Loop." Based on many of the reviews, I wish I'd be able to check this place out for brunch/lunch...sounds awesome, and very affordable. I'm a gastro-pub whore. I mean that in a good way, but it means I put out (my money) any time I'm near one. There are a bunch of things on the menu I'd like to try, but I've had a rough few weekends wallet-wise, so I eased up tonight and only tried a few things; that being said... I went for the Vindaloo mussels followed by chicken livers. Weird, right? I agree. The mussels...to quote a teenage girl, omfg, they're good. Get them. Immediately. Best mussels, flavor-wise, I've had...ever. To be fair though, you could have dunked chunks of cardboard in that sauce and I would have eaten it like a fat kid on a cupcake. Regarding the chicken livers; turns out I just don't really care for 'em all that much. Flavor-wise & execution they were good, just too "liver-y" for my liking..but that's not their fault. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars...service at the bar wasn't amazing, and sliiightly pricy. Not bad service, but, I've become pickier about the service in my old age, and I'd like to see prices ~15% less expensive then they are. Would I go back? Hell's yeah.
