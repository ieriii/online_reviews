I actually like this place, but after last Sunday, I can't stand up for them anymore. I had a friend in from out of town who specifically wanted to come here. He had heard about it and we decided to to brunch here. Sadly, the whole thing was a disaster. Waiting, waiting, waiting....Seriously, there are more empty tables than full tables in the dining room (and the back room was empty) and yet we can't get a table. It's a 45 minute wait. Why are we standing up? Eventually we get seated.... After about an hour. At one of the tables that was open for an hour. Why couldn't we have sat there the whole time? The food comes. The server sits my plate next to my girlfriend and then sits my friends plate next to an empty seat. No seriously.....Nobody sitting there. Who was that food going to? Meanwhile. My girlfriend's food doesn't come out for another five minutes. Other people talk about the attitude and pretentiousness. I actually like this place and try to stick up for it. I don't know if I can anymore. I don't think it's a pretentious thing. I just think that they got their Michelin star and don't care anymore.
