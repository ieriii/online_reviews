3.5 STARS What's all the hype about? Seriously, has anyone ever eaten at Cuban restaurants in Florida? I've dined at several Cuban joints in Tampa and Miami, and there's no comparison. Now, let's be fair---this is the best I've had here in Chicago. It is good---GREAT service, and the owners are extremely friendly. I will return when in need of my Cuban fix.
