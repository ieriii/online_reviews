The pizza rates a solid 5. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. However, the service is majorly lacking. We arrived around 1pm on a Tuesday and there was a 45 minute wait. They asked us to wait up against the wall. Um, no, we will just go get a drink at the bar and order a pizza to go...or so we thought. I guess they don't like getting business in the bar because we were told that you have to "go over there" to order pizza. If they would let people order pizza at the bar, we probably would have stayed for a couple of drinks. So we go back to the hostess stand to ask where "over there" was. The hostess didn't say a word, but rather pointed at a cafeteria looking section of the restaurant. For the first time since we had been here we saw an employee actually crack a smile. She took our order but told us it would be 45 minutes or we could get a pre-made personal pizza right away. We chose the personal pizza. Like I said, best pizza I have ever had! The crust was buttery and flakey and I love how they put the sauce on top of the pizza. The decor inside was pretty cool. You can write on the walls and tables and pretty much anything else you can find. But, like I said the staff was less than pleasant and looked like they didn't want to be there. You can really tell when a person is not treated well by their employers and this place is a sad example of that. These employees hate their jobs and that really sucks because everything else about Gino's is perfection.
