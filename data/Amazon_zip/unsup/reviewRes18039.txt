Get me on the goddamn gourmet burger train already. Every time I come home for a visit, it seems I usually stop in at one of these burger joints (Kuma's, Lockdown so far). My friend who lives in the hood suggested this for a nice dinner on my last visit. They were able to seat all 12 of us with no problem in the side room, even after we were only able to secure a reservation for 8, so thank you for the accomodations Bad Apple! They didn't cop an attitude about it either and they were pretty slammed.  They have an extensive beer selection that makes this Colorado girl very happy. I settled for the Great Lakes Christmas Ale upon the server and friends' recommendations. For my burger, I decided ont he left coast reuben. The cole slaw/thousand island dressing combo just worked very well on that burger, not to mention it came served on a pretzel bun. I highly recommend paying the extra charge for the garlic fries also, but you'll have lingering garlic breath the rest of the night. Overall I think this place is definitely tops in the gourmet burger category. Nothing still beats Kuma's Judas Priest burger but for a much less chaotic burger experience definitely check this place out.
