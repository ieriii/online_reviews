I was in town last weekend and needed to find a place to eat in their area. After seeing positive review after positive review, I decided to force my friend to go here. She trusts me and I trust Yelp so...it works. I think the look and feel of the place is great. It's small. Limited inside seating. The outdoor patio area had more seating and given the weather and the awkwardness that is sitting/eating/having to constantly look left or right to talk to your company it was a must do. I've only had Cuban a couple times in the Detroit area so by no means do I consider myself an aficionado. I will say, however, that I've heard hundreds of people talk about how the Cuban sandwich is a Godsend and yet I have not had one good experience ordering it. I ordered one at 90 Miles hoping for redemption and much to my surprise...it delivered. Great sandwich. The side (fried plantains) were nice because they are an interesting upgrade to fries (or any variation of fries) but the 3-5 small pieces seemed inadequate in comparison to the sandwich price. I also thought the sandwich creation process seemed pretty slow as a hole but everyone was nice so it wasn't a major dilemma.
