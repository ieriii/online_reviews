Look I can't add more to what other reviewers have already offered up. This is a unique experience - while this does not go to the extent of Moto in terms of over-the-top scientific creativity, I give Alinea the edge on simple foodie excellence. Given Chef Grant Achatz's health troubles, I'm not sure where Alinea will go in the future. Book now. This is a culinary experience that is unmatched. And go for the 24-course Tour menu.
