Solid steakhouse. Had the delmonico and my friend had the bone-in delmonico. Did the mac n cheese and calamari as well. Everything was great and the and the crushed velvet martini was yummy. We ate at the lounge bc we wanted watch march madness and bartenders were great. Def be going back. Solid steaks and solid service with a nice touch on cocktails.
