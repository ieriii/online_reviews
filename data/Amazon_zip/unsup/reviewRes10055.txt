You know how you take the hottest stripper into the private room and then she turns out to be lame and have all sorts of rules and smells like cigarettes? That's what it was like at Piccolo Sogno, a let down, minus the smell. I wish I could have eaten the reviews instead of the actual food because the reviews were so much better. To be fair...everything was fine. The food was ok and the service was actually great but for the price, you can do much better. That's the last time I pick the hot one. From now on, it's all about personality.
