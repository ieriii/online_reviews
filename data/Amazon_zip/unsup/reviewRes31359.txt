Just ate at Sunda last night for the first time and overall I would say my experience was pretty good. I made a reservation about a week before and wasn't told it was for a communal table, which would not have been good since it was a business dinner. The manager was great though and helped to accommodate our party and the rest of the night was awesome. I will say the crowd was pretty trendy for a Wednesday night, but that is usually par for the course with new restaurants in Chicago.
