I am a fan. I couldn't talk my guests into sitting at the oyster bar (YUM!) so we sat in the main dining area instead. It's certainly a service-oriented establishment (we even saw a waiter classicly run out of the restaurant to grab a guy leaving who left his credit card sur la table) and they did not dissapoint in this area for our table either. I dined on the griddled shrimp and lump crab cakes which could be described as none other than savory. I believe our total tab came to about $250 for 4 people (ordered a crisp bottle of white + soups) so it's definately not an everyday adventure - but well worth it...especially since I did not end up with the bill :)
