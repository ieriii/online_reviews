With conventions in town, and my company asking me to stay longer, the Holiday Inn @ The Mart was booked. So I had to switch hotels today. This Holiday Inn is located about 2 miles from The Merchandise Mart, very close to the Sear's Tower. It's pretty tiny and out of the way. Not conveniently located to anything walking distance. The service is decent. The view from the hotel is atrocious... It's actually costing me $220 a night to stay here... I'm glad it's only for 3 more days. One good thing... they also have free wireless here and since they have less rooms, the wireless is less used and it's much faster than the other hotel. UPDATE: I just woke up from my first night's stay...and I have to give 1 more star! These beds are SOOOOOOO comfortable. Much more comfortable than the other Holiday Inn. The pillows are VERY soft... I love this bed!!!!
