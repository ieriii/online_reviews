What a pleasant surprise! We decided on this restaurant purely because it's close to the blues clubs we had in mind for later that evening. Despite being almost 20 minutes late for our 8:30p reservation, they seated us immediately without a fuss. Our table of 4 was seated outside along Schubert Ave, which had very little people and car traffic....a definite plus. The entire wait staff was excellent! Our waiter, while a little slow, was very friendly and right on the money with all of his suggestions. The bread was hot, fresh and there was plenty of it. Since none of us like seafood, our table started with the Bruschetta. I honestly wasn't expecting much....after all, it's just bruschetta. But wow, was I wrong. It was unbelievably fresh and quite flavorful. For dinner 2 of us had Cappellacci di Zucca (pumpkin ravioli) - - WOW! The perfect combination of sweet and savory, Vitello Ossobuco alla pugliese (veal shank over meat lasagna) - - AMAZING! Extremely tender, and Spaghetti Barese (spaghetti with veal meatballs and Italian sausage, made spicy) - - PHENOMENAL!! Great heat and full of flavor. The portions were large, but that didn't stop us. We all came close to cleaning our plates, which unfortunately did not leave room for dessert. That's ok, we'll be back. To sum up Sapori Trattoria - Great service and simply delicious food!
