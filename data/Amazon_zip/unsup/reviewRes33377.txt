After reading the glowing reviews and getting somewhat of a thumbs up from my Chicago indoctrinated roommate, I decided to venture out in search of some solid falafel at Sultan's Market. Spending some quality time on a couple CTA buses (I'm taking the train next time, even if it is out of the way), I arrived annoyed and starving to the corner of Damen and North and immediately my falafel-sense started ticking. (eerie ghost voice) "Go to your right, young man. It is there that you will find zee great falafel sandwich." (other non-ghostish voice) "Go left and cash that check in your wallet, ya dumbass, this place is cash only!" So I went left, to the bank, and then right, to the promised land of yummy falafel. It's nice and quiet on a Wednesday afternoon, so I sauntered right up to the counter, ordered my falafel, and then surveyed the menu provided that it would be good enough to make a return trip. Baba ganooj! Yes! And lots of other veggie items, not just for the sake of having them, but actual well-thought out dishes that would satisfy anyone, herbivore or otherwise. Though I was somewhat disappointed to see a few young Wicker Park types behind the counter (I was hoping for an old Middle Eastern guy, what can I say), the dudes whipped up my falafel with speed and precision. Spicy, of course. The food verdict? This is some damn good falafel. It's not The Best I've Ever Had....but the best I've had in a long time. The veggies were crisp and fresh, the pita warm (but not falling-apart hot), and the hummus perfectly spiced. Although, considering I ordered "Spicy", I was expecting a little more heat. It was perfect for me, but I could see it not being enough for others. Clocking in at around four bucks, it's going to be hard to beat. Kudos for the recycling. Did I just find my favorite falafel spot on the first try? Armed with garlic and hummus breath, I decided to go breathe on the guys at the bike shop down the street.
