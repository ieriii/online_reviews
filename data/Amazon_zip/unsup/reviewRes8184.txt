The food was good, but the best thing about this restaurant was the incredible service. My water glass was unable to run out - they kept refilling it! And there were always men walking around with the steak. I did not care for the sides, and I think they should offer something other than bananas and potatoes. The salad bar was pretty good, and their creme brulee was fanastic.
