Perfect lunch spot for me this Sunday. I wanted to walk around a bit since it was actually warm (as it should be in early April!!) so I headed over to Broadway for Crisp. I had read many of the reviews but completely blanked on what I should get. I just went w/ the wings since that's what they're known for with the BBQ sauce. Delish! Finger lickin good for sure.  It lived up to the hype and I was full and satisfied w/ a few wings left over for dinner tonight.
