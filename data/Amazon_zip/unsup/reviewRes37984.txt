OMG! Hopleaf has so many reviews! Will mine just get lost in the review melee? Well, I feel lucky today, so here goes! I must begin my review my stating that I am not a huge fan of beer. I like a good cold one on occasion, but if I am trying to get my party on, there are other libations that do a better job of ringing my proverbial bell. That said, I am a fan of Hopleaf. As beers go, I'd say that Belgian ones are the smoothest and tastiest. It's great that the staff of Hopleaf is compassionate towards a beer novice. All in all, the recommendations I've received have been eye-opening. What I most admire about Hopleaf is the food. Sure, it's a bar, but they have some really great eats! First off, the Belgian mussels are divine! The mussels are always fresh. The broth is heavenly -- warm and smooth with seasonings that compliment the mussels perfectly! I could seriously eat them daily. I LOVE mussels (as well as muscles, but that's a whole different story...). The duck breast Ruben is another good choice. It sounds rather odd, but boy! is it tasty! Perhaps it's a bit greasy, but it IS a grilled sandwich after all. The CB&J is another sinfully delicious choice. Cashew butter and fig jam on grilled sourdough bread. It satisfies the sweet/savory craving perfectly. My only wish I could get it toasted rather than grilled. Well, maybe I can -- I've never asked. Hopleaf is a crowded place, but they do a fine job handling the masses. You might have to wait for a table, but that's ok. You can stand around in the bar and try some beer recommendations!
