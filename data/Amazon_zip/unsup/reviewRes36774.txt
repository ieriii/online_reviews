YUMMY. I wasn't feeling so hot after (way) too many libations last night. I don't go to breakfast that often but given my given physical state, something calorie-laden was in order. Don't let the wait deter you. There waiting room was packed, and we were told 30 minutes. 15 minutes later (yay!) the buzzer went off and we were seated. I opted for one of their fresh juices. I got the carrot apple celery concoction. It was pretty tasty. Different, but still good. My boyfriend ordered the mango orange kiwi juice. It was really sweet but also very good. For the main event I ordered the special; an artichoke omlette. It was realllllly hard to decide since the menu is huge. I knew i wanted an omlette and the artichoke option filled all of my requirements: bacon, cheese(I think it was goat cheese), and veggies(HUGE chunks of artichokes, tomatoes, onions). They are very generous with all of the ingredients. The dish was served with these wonderful red potatoes and grapes. I was in breakfast heaven. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs, toast, potatoes, and turkey sausage. He said it was tasty, and I thought the turkey sausage was a nice option for those watching their waistlines (obviously not me this time). They also bring you homemade strawberry jelly and whipped honey butter to spread on your toast which added a nice touch. It seems a little steep price wise, but i was only able to eat about half of it and was still stuffed! I ate the rest for dinner and it was just as good. The service was decent. The food came out quickly and our water glasses were refilled often, so no major complaints there. This is definitely my favorite spot for breakfast in Chicago.
