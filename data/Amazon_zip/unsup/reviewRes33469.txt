After living in Albany Park (for all of you guys clamoring over falafel, head up to the Kedzie stop on the brown line! ), this didn't quite meet my standards for Middle Eastern food. However, it was good, and ridic cheap, if not a little bit rushed. They also need to make more menus available for people waiting in line. Loved the decor, I got take-out, but I would definitely come here for lunch sometime.
