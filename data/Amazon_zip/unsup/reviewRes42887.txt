We really enjoyed this place. Cool vibe, a little crazy on a Fri night, but manageable. We were lucky enough to score two stools at the corner of the bar. Bartenders were awesome - personable, even while working their tails off. - Burrata and tomatoes were spectacular - Mushroom & truffle pasta was good (I wasn't a big fan of the noodles) - Mussels were very good (and the portion was huge) - Pork meatballs were rich, but really good....could really only eat 2 As others said, the music was very cool - though it could be a little louder. We'll be back.
