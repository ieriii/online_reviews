Let me start by saying that the food and cocktails at Zed are pretty darn good. The harvest table is always stocked with yummies and the meat is obviously fab. It doesn't get a lot of press for whatever reason but we ventured there for brunch recently. Food also good. BUT our waiter was super obnoxious -- "did you guys go out last night? you get super hammered? where'd you go?" verbatim. ok buzz off and let us eat. also they accidentally charged my friend's card twice and mine not at all and when she called to complain they asked for my contact info so they could charge me. uhhh -- no? thats YOUR bad. sorry zed. step up your service.
