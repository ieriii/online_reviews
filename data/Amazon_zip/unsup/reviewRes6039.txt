Upon recently moving to the River North area, my boyfriend and I have been making date nights out of the hundreds of restaurants within walking distance from our apartment. "Wildfire" caught our eye as there were many people waiting for the valet and the menu seemed right up our alley- as we are total carnivores. We were seated right away and caught a glimpse of the "decade" decor and fire behind us. Water was served without ice and only filled half the glass....I should have walked out after this, as our experience got much worse. Ten minutes later our waitress arrived and practically forced our order out of us. Guess she was too busy at 9pm on a Sunday night. We decided on a wine flight, french onion soup, chopped salad, lamb for me and porterhouse for him. She returned another ten minutes later to inform me that the lamb special was out. I requested that the manager allow me to have the other lamb dish she recommended for the special price- but he declined. I ordered the prime rib instead. At this point I was slightly disturbed and the fruit flies flying around our bread were not helping the mood. The salad was tasty, the soup was overly salty...and the wine was decent. When the steaks arrived.....i gagged at the color- it looked rare to me and the two bites I had instantly made my tummy hurt. He hardly touched the porterhouse as well, because the consistency was stringy and mushy....I'm still unsure why that was. After complaining to the manager for the second time- our practically untouched steaks were taken off our bill and the waitress finally got the hint that the overall experience we had was far under par. Regardless of their last second attempt to satisfy a customer, I will not be returning to any of the Wildfire's. So $50 bucks later- sans steak- we walked home with two tummy aches. Take my advice and try Sullivan's a few blocks south- for a few bucks more a pop, its well worth it.
