Amazing food! Order the Arracherra skirt steak. Simply outstanding. The dcor is beautiful. Vibrant, lively, spacious. It definitely has the "buzz." Service has always been impeccable, yet friendly and never snobbish. The only reason they get 4 stars and not 5 is because of their wait time. I always make a reservation for this place, yet, I've never been seated on time. Or even close to it. Not a deal-breaker, but it's definitely something they should work on.
