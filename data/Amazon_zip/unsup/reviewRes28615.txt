I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is 10 times better than Gino's, 5 times better that Giordano's and just a tid bit better than Lou Malnati's. If you want good deep dish come here, it is awesome and the crust is just a little burnt to perfectness. I will be coming here from now on for my pizza needs, which mean a lot. It also has a better atmosphere than the other pizza joints (Lou's in Lincoln Park feels like a basement), which makes it only even better. GREAT PIZZA!
