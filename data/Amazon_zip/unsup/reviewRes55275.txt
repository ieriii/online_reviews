I really enjoyed this place. It was really delicious. The meat just KEPT coming and coming at the flip of a card..beef lamp,chicken pork It was seasoned just right. I cannot say enough . IT was superb. The only reason I did not give this restaurant a 5 star is due to the high noise level and the fact that it was quite crowded. Anyway I will be back!! Great place to bring family and guests!! You will not be disappointed..
