I would never stay at this hotel again. I booked a king suite for my sister's bachelorette weekend so we'd have space to get ready and open some gifts before heading out for the night. When we checked in (at 5:15 p.m.) we were informed that the previous night's guests had checked out late so the room was not clean. They kindly provided us with drink vouchers and we settled in to the martini bar to wait for what we assumed would be a reasonable amount of time. AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER I revisited the desk and asked what was going on. I was informed that the previous night's guests actually hadn't checked out until 45 MINUTES AFTER we had arrived at 6 p.m. (check in is listed at 3 p.m.). This was directly in conflict with the previous statement that "housecleaning is in the room cleaning it right now." Despite checking in at 5 p.m. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE ROOM UNTIL 7:30 p.m. (four and a half hours after we were supposed to be able to check in). Hotel staff could only say "sorry, we really have no control over when guests leave." What?! While we were waiting, three other guests came to the desk with assorted other complaints. The hotel room phones did not work so we had to use cell phones to call the front desk. Staff noted that they did not work but did not come to fix them until we were checking out the next day. In addition, we had to ask three times for extra beverage glasses (which took a half an hour to show up), and had to request linens for the fold out bed as well. Speaking with upper management the day after was less than delightful. They did agree to deduct a small portion of the room price, but only after repeated complaints and difficulty. The hotel is lovely with lots of character. Too bad the same cannot be said for the management. . . For my money I'd rather stay someplace that can be counted on to provide a positive experience.
