Came to Chicago to stuff my face and see the sights and ended up in flavor town. I'd heard about this spot and had to give it try since they specifically bake it with cheese on top to give it a nice crunch! I made the long trek from Millennium Park ( yes, i was being touristy...sue me :P ) to a neighborhood that put the urban in suburban and plopped my hungry hungry hippo a$$ down in this bad boy. My friend and I were immediately greeted by a cute waitress and offer drinks (+1) We ordered up some some local brews and and a shared a medium Pepperoni, Sausage, & Mushroom pie. Th wait was about 20 minutes, in the meantime we watched as local after local came through, and perused their decor. Cools dive bar-ish like feel without the same crowd..and smell ^.^ The pizza was came out piping hot and overloaded with toppings! The real coup de grace was the delectable crispity crunchy blackened lasagna-like (in a good way!!) cheesy crust! I wolfed down 3 slices and called it quits...I would have loved to sit around for another beer or two and finish off the rest, but all good things must come to an end. Plus I had reservations for L20, but that's a different story and review all together.
