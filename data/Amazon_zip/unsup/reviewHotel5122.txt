The Intercontinental Chicago has topped our expectations. Not only were we greeted with the nicest staff, but one in particular, named Emily at the front desk, really enabled my boyfriend and I to have a wonderful stay. Another staff member who made the experience so delightful was Patrick, one of the guest service men. Not only did we use a groupon to get a basic room, but it being my birthday engaged them to upgrade us to the Historic Tower (which is recommended far more than the North Tower, which is the basic tower), but they also gave us the bigger corner room which allowed us more room and a comfortable space during our stay. When we arrived, they provided us with cheesecake wishing me a happy birthday, and were on call to our every need. They took care of specific requests in a timely manner and truly made our experience excepetional. One thing I feel could have been better explained is that the gym is an additional charge. This wasn't explained to us in the beginning which takes a star away because of the misinformation that we weren't provided. The gym could also use enhancements. For the kind of hotel it is, I would expect a nicer gym area. However, the food was fantastic in the dining room, and the ambience and hotel itself is clean and nicely set. We truly enjoyed our stay and would absolutely go back anytime for a stay. I would recommend it!
