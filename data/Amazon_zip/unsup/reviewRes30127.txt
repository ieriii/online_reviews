I'm only an assistant vegetarian, but I heartily enjoyed almost everything that they put in front of me. Guacamole and salsa: Yum and yum Garden salad: Surprisingly for a basic salad, very yum Creamy ginger dressing: Yum Sweet-potato fries: Yum Enchilada entree: Big Yums. It's Mexican, so you can just mix it all together and enjoy a mishmash of beans, rice, cheese, red sauce, tortillas, avocado slices, and whatever the hell is supposed to be inside the enchilada. PDG. Yep, I'd definitely go back, despite the botched vegan "milkshake" which was supposed to be s'mores-flavored but evinced no flavor of marshmallow or graham crackers. As a chocolate shake with chocolate fudge and chocolate chips, it was actually pretty good for being vegan, but sadly it lacked the desired s'mores characteristics.  Appetizer success, dinner success, dessert fail. Sing it, Meatloaf. Er...is it a faux pas to bring up meatloaf here?
