If you want Chicago style deep dish pizza, then you have to go to Giordano's. The best location for visitors is of course the one off of Rush St., inside the Miracle Mile area. However, you will most likely have to wait 30-45 min if you are going on the weekend because they are always very busy then. Its probably worth it though. I prefer their pizza over other places that serve deep dish for some reason.
