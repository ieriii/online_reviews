I just went for the first time to see my buddy play the free 2am show on a frigid Wednesday night. I was expecting the band to outnumber the crowd but the place had a couple dozen people milling around. Take that going to work in the morning! The interior itself is quite unique; carved wood, giant mediocre paintings, an old 45 jukebox...everything classy and original. And they have Guiness on tap. I'm planning to make several more trips out that way in the near future.
