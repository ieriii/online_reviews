I'd come back here just to see the sexy Cuban business owner (pictured in business images). I think they have the best Ropa Vieja in the city. The owner told me himself that since the average John Smith (I dislike the term Gringo) doesn't care much for the authentic chewy Ropa Vieja, they add mango preserves to the meat to make it more tender. Just that effort adds a star. What seor dueo needs to do is get better employees and a larger space. The girl who took orders couldn't understand the request of No Onions/Cebollas. She asked me twice if I wanted them, checked twice with my friend AND actually put them in another customer's meal. She must have an onion obsession (maybe it's necessary for the Cuban authenticity, but they already prepare tender Ropa Vieja so who cares if there's no onions too). I thought 90 Millas would have a larger seating area as in a restaurant, instead of being a 10 seat, primarily take-out joint. I guess the Cuban wall decor makes up for it. Oh well, it was worth the trip.
