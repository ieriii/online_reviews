I am not a Korean BBQ expert. I have been to only three Korean BBQ places in my life. But I will stay satisfied knowing that I have tried San Soo Gab San. San Soo Gab San is a blissfully smoky and dark experience. It is a place where you can stumble in at 3AM and order flavorful galbi and enjoy unlimited banchan all while feeling like you are in a sauna of ash and meat. Their kimchi is sour and tangy, their chap chae is light and savory, and their marinated galbi is sweet and tender. Plus, the miso soup that comes with each BBQ order has a great spicy tofu taste that cleanses the palate and doesn't obscure the main dishes. It is not the cheapest korean bbq in town, but it is a fun place with good service. It's great for groups and people who like playing with meat and fire.
