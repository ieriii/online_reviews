I love this place...great value...I've been coming here for years and 3 years ago this place would have receive 5 stars but after they expanded the food flavor went down....not sure what's different...maybe the chefs or recipes...the rice is always hard these days :( soooooo please please please go back to your old ways of cooking because they were amazing...
