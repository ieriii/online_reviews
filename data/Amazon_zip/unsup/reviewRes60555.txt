I went here with a friend who was craving her favorite Grand Lux salad. I ordered the same thing and while the salad was okay, you can get much better for far less elsewhere. But so-so food aside, my lowly one-star rating is for the atmosphere... It sucks. It's loud and tacky and reminds me of a mall restaurant. The patrons are loud and tacky, too. Save your money, your heart and your sanity and go somewhere else.
