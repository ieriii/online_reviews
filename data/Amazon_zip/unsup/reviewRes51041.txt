The menu is very interesting but the food was just ok. I found my salad to be pretty bitter and my friend didn't even finish her duck gumbo; the po boy was a big hit. Service was also hit & miss - the waitress was nice, but spilled my beer. Another waiter accidentally dropped one of our appetizers, but apologized. The bus boy twice tried to take away plates we were still working on. Just underwhelming.
