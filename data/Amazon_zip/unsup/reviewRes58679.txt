Waitress who took our order apparently went off shift as we never saw here again. Food came out in stages, not all at once. Forgot to bring rice we ordered. We requested chicken dish prepared mild. It came out late. Too spicy to eat. When I asked how it was prepared I was told it was prepared extra hot. Then told No, that is how we prepare it mild. After some checking in the kitchen, there was an apology and an offer of a beer on the house. The couple at the next table also complained about something screwed up in their order. The other dishes were nothing special. Maybe it was an off night, but it looks to me like this place is resting on its laurels. Won't be back.
