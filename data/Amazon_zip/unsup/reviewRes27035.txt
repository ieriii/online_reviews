Rick Bayless has to be one of the godfathers of Mexican food in America! Which seems odd for a guy from Oklahoma, but hey, whatever works. Frontera is the casual side of his restaurant in Chicago (next door to the high end Topolobampo). We had had a truly phenomenal meal at his LA outpost, Red O, so we figured we would give the Chicago branch a try, and it did not disappoint! We started our evening with the Topolo margarita for me and champagne margarita for the Mrs. Both were nicely prepared and definitely different from your generic lime-infused margarita you find in most Mexican joints. For dinner, we had a range of the appetizers and street food, including: The Hurrache, which may have been the highlight of the whole meal, a thick and crunchy hand made masa cake grilled to get smoky bits on it, then covered with shredded carne asada, grilled vegetables, greens and cheese - imagine a tostada on steroids and you have a very faint idea of how good this dish was! Goat Barbacoa Queso Fundido (don't go yech!) - one of the most unusual and tasty queso renditions we have had, with the usual chorizo replaced by a savory goat and tomato stew with onions and peppers, MMMM! Ceviche Trio - three very unique interpretations of this classic, including a tuna, mango and avacado mix that reminded us of Hawaiian poke, a shellfish and cucumber version, and an albacore and tomato version - all tasty and refreshing! There were probably 20 other dishes on the menu we could have eaten, and given how well the food we did eat was executed, I'm sure the others would have been equally excellent. Guess we'll have to come back on our next visit to the Windy City. Atmosphere is nothing special here - certainly a far cry from the hip buzz of Red O. Topolobambo may be different (we didn't go in), but I'd recommend this spot for the food more than the atmosphere.
