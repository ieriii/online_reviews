I've been to Glenn's for both brunch and dinner and I can honestly say that both are amazing, but if I had to choose then stick to dinner. Glenn's has such fresh seafood and they know how to make it very well. The first time I went it was for dinner and we had to wait 45 minutes but it was worth it! Definitely my favorite fish restaurant for the money in Chicago.
