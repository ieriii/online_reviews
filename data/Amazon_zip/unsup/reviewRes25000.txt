Artopolis is such as gem in Greektown - especialy for their desserts! A friend and I stopped here after getting gyros for dinner down the street because I wanted a spinach and feta artopita for breakfast the next morning (more on that later). We were immediately attracted to the dessert counter and couldn't resist. The desserts were heavenly. I had the Royal (white chocolate mousse with raspberry glaze) and my friend had the mango mousse and both were outstanding and reasonably priced. I was disappointed with the service. The place was not that busy and it took forever for anyone to pay attention to us even though we were one of the few people there. And the slowness continued through the entire time we were there. Now, I also ordered the spinach and feta artopita to go. I had eaten one before but it was a long time ago and I was expecting it to be an appetizer type deal (especially because I had ordered it as spanakopita so I didn't realize it was the artopita on the menu). However, I was presented with the pita and a side of pasta salad. The pasta salad was so-so but the spinach and feta was fantastic even the next day. However, in my mind $8 for that is a little steep for what you get. All in all Artopolis is a good place for lunch or a dessert.
