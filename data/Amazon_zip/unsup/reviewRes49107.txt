Liked the brunch a lot, dinner was so so, mainly pork dishes. You really have to be connoisseur of pork which I find hard to be. Beer selection is great. Will try the mussels next time. Still I don't get what the hype is all about, I guess it's hard to get a table anywhere in the West Loop on weekends. Luckily I live in the area so can come any night.
