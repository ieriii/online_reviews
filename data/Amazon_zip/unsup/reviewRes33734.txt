What is there not to like about this place? Since moving home from the city, I miss this place so much and have constant cravings. Want a super yummy falafel, come here!! Totally veggie friendly for all you vegans and non-animal eating people. I love my falafels super spicy and this place makes them exactly to youre liking. The salad in the sandys is so yummy and the falafels are easy to eat on the go. The best part is, they're so cheap!! You really can't go wrong. Definitely try some of the canned juices they have, they're delish.  The place has cute decor but is pretty small on the interior... so either except to wait for a table or get it to go. Eating at home is always more relaxing :) Hands down, Sultan's has the best falafels in the city. I havent had one thing I haven't enjoyed. I highly recommend this place. Oh! Most importantly, bring cash!! They do not accept credit/debit. Enjoy!!
