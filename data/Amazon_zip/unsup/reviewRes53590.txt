There's nothing I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. Quite possibly the only place in the city I'll wait in line! We tend to over indulge (if you're going to wait an hour, you have to order more than one dog....). And while we're enjoying the cholesterol fest, thrown in an order or two of duck fat fries.....why not! I've worked my way through the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. This is the ultimate hot dog: worth every single calorie, and every single minute in line!
