Ate here while staying at the Blackstone. Verrrry yummy! Boyfriend and I both had absolutely delicious flatbreads - braised beef was amazing! - and tried both the red and white sangria which we liked both. White sangria was my favorite though. Enjoyed the patatas bravas as an appetizer and they were very good. Portions are rather small and very pricey, but worth it. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and was attentive even though the night was busy. Would definitely go back for a nice dinner in Chicago.
