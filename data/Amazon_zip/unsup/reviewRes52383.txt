Very noisy atmosphere made it difficult to hold a conversation with my guest. Was seated at a dilapidated booth intentionally decorated with white graffiti on a black background. Our cheese and sausage pizza seemed flavorless and prepared with little or no salt. The service was OK but there wouldn't be any reason to want to go back there.
