Delicious Italian Food! Went here with my New York in-laws and we all enjoyed tremendously. Had an 8:30p reservation and although it was packed, we were seated immediately upstairs. Only issue was very tight table-space. We literally had to shift our table everytime someone around us got up, but strangely, we didn't mind. Great service, great food, great wine.  For a more limited menu, try their little sister restaurant 'Francesca's Forno' in Bucktown/Wicker Park.
