Brunch is without question my favorite meal. I have been to a number of brunch places in Chicago, and none of them come close to the Bongo Room. Full disclosure, I have a gigantic sweet tooth, to which the BR definitely caters. Although their savory items are phenomenal as well, their take on french toast, pancakes, flap jacks, etc, etc is incredibly unique and exquisitely delicious. Even though their brunches increase my likelihood of developing diabetes, it is well worth it!
