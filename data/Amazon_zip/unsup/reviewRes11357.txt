This place is amazing...had heard great things for a long time and we decided to give it a go...we ordered a large pizza (way to big for 3 ppl..but I'm looking forward to the cold leftovers) with green pep, mushrooms and onions and it was delicious...I am a deep dish guy but this is the best "non-Chicago" style I have had in a long time. Oh and we go a house salad on which was great as well... Truly a great spot.
