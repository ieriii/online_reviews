First experience here 2/12/12 was a terrific one! My wife and I had about 9 different dishes, as well as a wonderful dessert. The food was fantastic, plated perfectly...but here was the real impressive aspect: Every single person who came to our table (staff) was incredibly knowledgeable about every dish. It's hard to find that kind of training and commitment these days. Our server (Sally) was a jewel! We will absolutely be back, and we recommend this place to everyone! Hats of to the Chef and his line for a job well done! Thank you!
