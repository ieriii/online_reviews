I will be up front about not reviewing the food there because the sliders were pretty good. The lack of stars is a reflection of the customer service. Let me go on. We heard about a restaurant shuttle that takes you from your place of residence to the resto, so after night of pre-drinking at the bday boy's place, we place a call for a pick up. Perfect...so we think. When confirming the shuttle later on, we find out the shuttle is no longer available and the manager promises our party a round of drinks on the house. No big deal. After finally getting to Zed451 via cab, we are confronted with a non existent line but a 40+ min wait to access the roof top deck. The manager comes up to us to give us pretty un heartfelt apology about the shuttle and then dismisses the promise for a round of drinks. No shuttle, no drinks, but a 40+ min for the rooftop access. No dice whatsoever.
