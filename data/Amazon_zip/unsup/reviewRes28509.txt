I like to think that I'm a fair and unbiased judge of restaurants. If a place looks like a dive, but has great food, I won't disparage it. Despite the unassuming facade, I checked this place out after reading all the positive reviews; however, I could find no redeeming qualities in this place. The restaurant is attached to a bar - fine. But it is dark, dingy, and only has high stools or cramped booths for seating: strike one. The music is tuned to the "Worst of the '60's", which may just be a matter of taste, but it didn't improve my experience. The waitress came over soon enough, but left before we were done ordering, and we couldn't flag her again. She then proceeded to flirt with the busboy on the other side of the restaurant. Naturally, our order wasn't quite right: strike two. The food itself was chewy pasta, drowned in canned sauce and an inch of cheese. No flavor except fat in the Fettucini Alfredo - I've had better Stouffers dinners - and the marinara was a runny mess of tomato water. Plus, $1.50 for the 1/4 cup side of sauce to cover the rest of the pasta? Strike three, I'm outta there. It cost $20 without tip for two tiny bowls of nasty pasta. If you're looking for comfort food, or cheap food, or good service, I suggest you look elsewhere.
