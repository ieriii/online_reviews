The BBQ Chicken pizza was pretty pretty bomb(Check my photo). The garlic knots are super banger, but just needed a dipping sauce I feel. This is one of the first pizza's I've had in a while that I couldn't make it past the 2nd slice. The gouda on the pizza was so tasty. It was very hearty and filling. I would suggest going to eat in, it's a very small place with a couple of tables, it great for ordering out. Solid spot, I'll try them again later in the summer.
