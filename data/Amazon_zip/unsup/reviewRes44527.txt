For croissants and breakfast pastries I give this place a 4 For cupcakes/macarons/other sweets I give this place a 3.5 On Saturday, my husband went and get massages at the Pain Stop, then we walked over to Mana for lunch and then we figured we should try out Alliance bakery. So we came in here after we were already stuffed from our lunch at Mana, but everything looked so delicious we had to get a box and try everything. We got one of each flavor of the macarons. We got an almond croissant, a red pepper/goat cheese croissant, a chocolate croissant, a chocolate beignet, this danish/croissant looking thing with apricot and orange, and a red velvet cupcake. Amazingly, we ate everything by the end of the day too. For us, we thought that the croissants were the stand out. They do an amazing job with breakfast pastries. We weren't blown away by the cupcake. You can get better cupcakes at Molly's/Swirlz. The macarons were tasty and there were a lot of flavor options, but they had been in the case for a bit, and some of them were kind of hard. We will definitely be back for croissants though. Yum!
