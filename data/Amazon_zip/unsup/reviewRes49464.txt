My wife and I have been a few times, and it seems like the first few times were better. We had lunch at Bin 36 yesterday, a Saturday, and there were only 3 other tables eating. The first warning sign should have been the large, empty room. While what we did get was good, the problem is that there are practically no entree-type items on the menu for lunch on the weekends. Instead, you have to choose among a burger, the smoked salmon, or a selection of appetizers. We opted for the appetizers, and for lunch for two including one wine flight it cost around $65 before tip. If we had realized there were so few entree selections and it would cost that much before going in, we probably wouldn't have. With that said, the first few times we went there were good enough for us to keep going, so Bin 36 gets 3 stars instead of 2.
