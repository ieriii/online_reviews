Wow. What a disappointment. I went with two friends due to Calo's $10 rib dinner special. And while I can't say my $10 were wasted, I did have a full dinner after all, that dinner was pretty much awful. You know it's bad when the best thing out of a 3 course meal is what amounts to a chain restaurant garden side salad. Next came the ribs, stacked double high, cooked long enough to ensure they stuck firmly to the bone instead of falling off with ease. I quickly found myself using every utensil at my disposal to try and separate meat from bone, reverting back to caveman status in an effort to simply eat my food. The side dish of garlic mashed potatoes were essentially a gooey, tasteless blob, that served little purpose save to reinforce the idea that the entire venture had been a mistake. Adding onto the low quality of the food was the service. I'm usually fairly tolerant of low/poor quality service, but between getting our drink orders wrong, constantly fumbling over everything, and an over all  ignorance of the restaurant she was serving at and proper waiting methods, I feel like this slight rant is justified. Sorry Calo, you won't be seeing me again, but then again, judging by the way you treated me, I don't think you had any interest in my return anyway.
