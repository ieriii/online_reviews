I really liked xoco, but I didn't think it was out of this world. The wait was not terribly long-- I went in with my sister and friend at lunch time and only stood in line for about 20 minutes. The hostess was very helpful and pointed out that there are two lines--one for take out orders and one for dine-in. The wait gave us enough time to decide what we wanted. The jamaica-lemongrass drink was AMAZING. I got the chicken tinga torta: gunthorp chicken, black beans, chipotle-roasted tomato sauce, pickled onions, avocado, queso anejo, arugula. It was good, but I felt like maybe the chicken could have been a bit more flavorful. The bread, although it was not a traditional torta bread, was crispy and yummy. I loved that they used arugula instead of lettuce because it gave the sandwich a yummy peppery taste. We also got guacamole and chips, the guac wasn't the best I've had in my life but it was by no means bad. The restaurant is very beautifully decorated and I love being able to see that giant oven and everyone working-- we saw Rick Bayless himself going through the kitchen doing quality control which was great to see that he actually cares about what his customers are eating. The seating was not bad either, yes the tables are close to each other but it is a small restaurant so they do the best they can, it feels very cozy to me. We had a kind of "bar" seat behind the door which sounded bad but it honestly was kind of nice because it was away from all the other customers. OOhhh and we had the churros which were good but they had a sort of potato-ish taste, i felt like the dough should have been a bit sweeter. Their hot chocolate is amazing though, but it has a very distinct taste unlike that of regular American hot chocolate. I would definitely go back to xoco, especially if it were just for the hot chocolate. Next time I want to try their caldos =]
