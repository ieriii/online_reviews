I rarely give 1 star - maybe I am a little bitter because I was expecting so much from everyone's review of this place. Ok maybe it should be more like a 2 if they actually cooked our pizza thoroughly. We ordered a large deep dish with sausage, bell peppers and mushrooms. it came out with the famous caramelized crust, the bread dough was rawish in the center, and bellpeppers and mushroom topping was not cooked and the pizza sauce was cold! We took most of it home, my poor husband got diarrhea later that night, so we just ended up tossing this out entirely.
