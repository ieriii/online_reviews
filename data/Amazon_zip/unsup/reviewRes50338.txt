I've been here a few times, mostly for lunch. This place has some redeeming qualities to compensate for the crowd it brings into the neighborhood. The food is pretty decent. The atmosphere is one of an upscale sports bar, making it a place to be watching sports and a place to be seen in an untucked dress shirts, weathered jeans, and whatever else your former frat boys think is stylish and grown-up. The menu is worth checking out in the warmer months, as you don't have to enter the building when outdoor seating is available. Otherwise, wait until then.
