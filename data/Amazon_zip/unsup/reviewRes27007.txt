I came skeptical, as I'm a believer in cheap, authentic Mexican fare... I left having eaten the BEST tacos of my life! I didn't know anything about Rick Bayless before coming here, but I can assure you that he is an EXPERT at melding flavors. Every dish we tried was complicated and layered in taste, and every bite was extremely well-balanced in its flavors. THE TOPOLA MARGARITA: smooth. Strong. But pricey. THE CEVICHE TRIO SAMPLER: had to try them all! Seafood with a tangy twist and chips on the side--layered-flavors amazingness. Our fave was the Yucateco (calamari), followed by the Coctel de Atun Tropical (sashimi-grade tuna and guacamole), followed by the Fronterizo (albacore). THE SOPES RANCHEROS: corn shells with pork, numerous fixings, and ranchero sauce. Melded together awesomely. One of my faves, at a good price. THE PATO EN MOLE DE PINON: duck with mole sauce. The mole here tastes very earthy and complex. Not exactly my taste but it was interesting. The duck was a bit dry. We drenched it in the mole sauce. Our least favorite dish. THE TACOS AL CARBON: the carne asadas was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the flour tortillas were AMAZEBALLS. I'm salivating just remembering it right now. So, so good. I was sad I only got to eat two. Favorite! THE DUO DE FLANES: one coconut flan and one classic vanilla flan for dessert (like we needed to eat more by that time). Pretty good. Beautiful presentation. THE FROTHY MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE: So we're total gluttons. However, we only ordered one and they gave us two for the price of one... thanks! Yummy, though you probably won't need it unless you're as indulgent as we. Obviously, it's pricier than your local taqueria, but you get your money's worth for the best combination of flavors ever (and a hip, swanky yet casual atmosphere). Will probably never bump it up the extra fancy notch to Topolobampo, because Frontera does it for me.
