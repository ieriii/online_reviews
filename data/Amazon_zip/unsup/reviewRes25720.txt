Tucked away, between the bars on Lincoln Ave. in Lincoln Park, there is a taste from the past. Growing up on the North side of Chicago, I've been to just about every Vietnamese restaurant Uptown had to offer but the one place I've always missed was Pho Pasteur, which closed about 2 decades ago. Fast forward, 2 decades later, Tuan Nguyen, former co-owner of Pho Pasteur (time to eat) and Pasteur (now reopened) had set out on his own and Simply It has me reminiscing. You're greeted warmly into an intimate dinning room. The decor reminds me of the places I've visited in Vietnam. Tables are clean, always set with a tea candle, a vase of fresh flowers (no one does that for under $25 an entree anymore) and the floor is never sticky. Service is quick and attentive. Uncle Tuan, owner and Head Chef, will always check on you personally to make sure things are perfect. He's a really sweet man and if he has the time, he will sit and tell you a story. Sometimes, he'll even throw in free smoothies or desert. On to the food. Vietnamese food is pure and fresh and Simply It's menu is extensive so, I'll list just my favorites. Appetizers, I would recommend the Seafood Eggrolls or the Shrimp Papaya Salad. I've eaten them since I was 5, believe me, they're good. Entrees, I love the Pineapple Calamari, Simply It's Beef and the Catfish in a Clay Pot. All three are savory and true to Vietnamese marinates.  Don't miss out on the Ginger tea! So, it's possible that my review is bias but I don't care what you think, I'm just happy to have found a piece of my past. Hopefully, you'll be lucky enough to experience what Simply It has to offer.
