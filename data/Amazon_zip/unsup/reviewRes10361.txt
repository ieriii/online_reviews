Piccolo Sogno was just okay. I've had better Italian food for cheaper (thinking Anteprima here). Perhaps it's because this place has been so hyped up by both reviewers and by friends, but I was seriously underwhelmed. The wine list IS excellent. The patio IS lovely (and while this was no fault of the restaurant, perhaps I would have appreciated my meal more if it wasn't 90 degrees and humid at 7:30 at night). Our server WAS friendly and knowledgeable, although I think he took a powder for literally 30 minutes between dinner and dessert. So that was kind of weird. The food was good. Just that, good. For the amount of money we spent, I wanted the food to be GREAT.
