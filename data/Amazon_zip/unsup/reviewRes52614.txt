Much much better than FoGo! I just love the month of May! Birthday after birthday after birthday and then my birthday....yayyyyyy!!!! Well anyway, we went to Brazzaz to celebrate my sisters birthday and we had a BALL!!!!! I've been here a couple times but just not within the last year. I am happy to report that this spot is still just as good as when i visited in the past. Our reservation was for 8pm on a week night and everything was perfect. We were seated right away, the waiter was very attentive and the food was OMG so FANTABULOUS! Of course we tried everything except the chicken legs. I just didn't think they were anything special and didn't want to waste any space in my stomach on something i could definitely fix at home :) The steaks, sausages, bacon wrapped chicken, parmesan pork and leg of lamb were so juicy, tender and well seasoned we were in heaven. Two things i absolutely love about Brazzaz is that they include shrimp and grilled pineapple as part of the offerings. Which to me gives them extra points in my book compared to Fogo. Also the atmosphere of Brazzaz is more youthful and vibrant. Such a great experience, on to the next birthday celebration!
