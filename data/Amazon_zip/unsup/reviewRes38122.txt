Hopleaf and Guthrie's are at the top of my favorite bars in Chicago, though I've never eaten at the Hopleaf before. So many types of beer - many of which you have difficulty finding elsewhere. Lots of people there, but I have never really had any problem finding a table. Upstairs is cash-only...my only real complaint about the place. Still need to try their food...
