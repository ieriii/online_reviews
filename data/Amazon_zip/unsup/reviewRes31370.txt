I always wanted to really like the Chicago Diner because I lived around the corner from it during the height of my (now-lapsed) vegetarianism. It's good and tasty and all that and you'll have at least one more meal out of your leftovers, but I've never had anything mind-blowing there. I had raw falafel once that was close, but it was a special and not on the daily menu. On the other end of the scale, I had really soggy sweet potato fries ... which is a huge shame because I love sweet potato fries. I'll definitely be back, but I'm not hurrying to get there.
