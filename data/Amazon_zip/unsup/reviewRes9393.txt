Romantic decor, tasty, flavor-filled food and great drinks make this one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. If you're looking for a quick bite or drink, the upstairs lounge is a great little place to relax as well. Dishes to order: Banh Cuon: Chicken/mushroom ravioli with a tasty garlic sauce Ga Xao Xa Ot: Chicken in a basil chili sauce. (Spicy, but good) Bun Thit Nuong: BBQ pork sliced thin over vermicelli noodles
