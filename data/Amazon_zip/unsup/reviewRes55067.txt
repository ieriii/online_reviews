I have been here two times now, and I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The food, the drinks, the atmosphere, and service have been stellar. My only complaint is that I wish the tartare and bone marrow weren't so good so I could try something else on the menu.I definitely would suggest this to any friend looking to lounge or go on a date. Client meetings might be a bit awkward, though, due to the more intimate atmosphere.
