I am not ashamed in the least to say how much I hate Chicago-style pizza. In fact, it's a personal mission of mine to avoid it at all costs. So when I'm offered a trip to devour some thin & crispy pizza in Chicago, I take it. Piece, you lived up to the hype I've been hearing for so long. Sure, it's loud, you may have to sit around and wait for a while (both to get a table and to be waited on), & it ain't cheap, but the broccoli-covered white pizza I had made up for any disappointment. I was the only one at my table to go with the white pizza, and every other person kept oohing & ahhing over it, wishing they had done the same. T-minus 4 minutes to the leftovers for lunch! Yum.
