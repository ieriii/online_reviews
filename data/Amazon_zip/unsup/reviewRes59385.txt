the produce at this location was all wilted. quality of the deli stuff was aweful . i bought some expensive almondine trout and lavender turkey slices. and both were terrible. i know i am not going to step into f& o ever. the quality has gone to thy kingdom come.one has to get value for the money one spends and that is not available at f& o. i guess the rent kills it. used to be a gr8 pace to shop.
