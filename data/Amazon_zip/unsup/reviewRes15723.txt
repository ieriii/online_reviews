I certainly would not call this place snobby or say that there is a formal dress code, but I felt slightly underdressed in jeans and a t-shirt. Jeans and a nice sweater would probably pass though. And that's only if you care about that stuff. People were there in shorts and things like that, but the atmosphere of the place is a little nicer to me. Let's get to the important stuff. The food. Everyone at my table shared a Mozzarella Fritti. It's not enough to share though, we were expecting more (this is for the fried fresh mozzarella), it's only a small block. But delicious. Just order 2 or 3 if you want to share. We all (except my grandfather who wanted ribs) had the Stuffed Pizza. I think this is one of my new favorite places. The pepperoni to sausage ratio was a little off, but not enough to make it an issue. The crust was crisp and delicious and the sauce was a really nice consistency (I don't like the chunky sauce). All in all, it was great. My grandad's ribs were purported to be great. Falling off the bone if I recall. They must've been good because he pulled his bottom fake teeth out right at the table to clean them off with a cloth napkin. You gotta love old people and their lack of caring about the rest of the world.
