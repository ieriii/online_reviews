I don't need to say much about Art of Pizza. Hands down the best deep dish in the world. The recipe has unfortunately changed for the worse in the last few years (the crust has taken a direct hit) but even though it's not as good as it was, it is still better than anything else. If you don't like deep dish, go to one of the other thousands of pizza places, it's all the same. But if you are a connoisseur, this is a must-go place, don't miss out on the most delicious event of your entire life!
