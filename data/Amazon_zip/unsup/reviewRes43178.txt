I kind of wore myself out on Chicago stuffed pizza, so it had been awhile since I'd been in the mood for a deep dish. I had heard good things about Art of Pizza and I wanted to give it a go. I wasn't disappointed. My very meaty pizza arrived hot and fresh and delicious. I had a little trouble with the crust, but the stuffed parts inside totally made up for it. Yum!
