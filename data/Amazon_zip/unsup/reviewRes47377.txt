If Yelp would let me rate something in the psychotically anal style of Pitchfork, I'd probably go with a 3.8 or 3.9. And I think my review is good for the period of time that Lockdown is open until about 9 or 10 pm. Can't confirm that, just a hunch that I have. So let's start with style. Lockdown is basically trying to rip off 50/50 and Kuma's and kind of fails at both, which results in a sort of simple, bro-metal flavor. Imagine if Zakk Wylde owned a chain of bars. Equal parts Ed Hardy, ESPN and post-Seasons In The Abyss Slayer. So if you can't get past that vibe, you most likely won't even walk through the front door. If you *can* get past that vibe, you might be pleasantly surprised at the beer, food and service. Typical selection of garbage beer with some decent local-ish flavors like Goose Island, Half Acre and Bell's (Kalamazoo is close). I was skeptical of the burgers, but they're actually a pretty decent imitation of Kuma's. Not quite as good, but at least on par with Bad Apple or Hamburger Mary's. Probably better. And my request for medium was actually honored - came out with juicy, pink flavor in the middle. It's getting increasingly difficult to find places that actually know what medium means in Chicago anymore. And they actually butter-toasted the bun, something Kuma's doesn't seem to do anymore. The mac and cheese was also decent, though maybe not worth the $2 extra for a side. No issues with the service either - fast and friendly. So if you can get over your perceptions, it's actually an alright place, at least around 6 or 7 at night.
