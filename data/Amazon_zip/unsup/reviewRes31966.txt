Five stars for the flavors, the value, honey wine, no silverware, and being late for a reservation and still having a table waiting for us. I have been here a couple of times now and I enjoy every aspect of the dining experience. I am no expert on African cuisine (having only eaten it twice... at Demera) but I do consider myself an adventurous eater and Demera is a treat. The food is flavorful and spiced in a way similar to Indian dishes, the injera is very unique, and it is fun to eat with your hands. The staff was kind and helpful in choosing our 6 options for the meat/vegetable messob combo. The spicy dishes I would consider to be upper-medium amount of spicy, which was just right for me but too much for my friend. The dishes we tried (from best to worst): + Spicy beef + Spicy lentils + Chick pea cakes + Medium chicken with drumstick and hard boiled egg + Carrots and potatoes - Lamb (small, tough, fatty pieces) Total came to $45 including one glass of honey wine, with leftovers to take home. I hope to come back and try out some other options!
