Great atmosphere--like you're straight out of the film "Indochine."  The food is delicious as well, and even the desserts are delectable. There has clearly been a lot of attention payed to blending the flavors of French and Vietnamese cuisine in a harmonious manner. A great choice for a romantic dinner because of the decor & ambience alone, but when you add the food to the eqation, it becomes a truly memorable experience.
