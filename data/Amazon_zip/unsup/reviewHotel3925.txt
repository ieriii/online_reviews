I loved the historic feel and ambiance of this hotel. Crickety old elevators and solid wood furniture in the room. You don't see that much anymore, good solid wood craftsmanship. I got the hotel for a really good price. The room was clean and stayed cool even with a real real old air conditioner. I think my only complaint is that the hot water took about ten minutes to get hot enough for a shower. I don't know so many people are knocking this hotel. I loved the location and all the staff were very friendly and my room was clean. Yeah its a little outdated but I think that is the charm of the hotel. I would definitely stay here again. I loved it.
