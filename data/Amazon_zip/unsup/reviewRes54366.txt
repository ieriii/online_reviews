Hands down my favorite Chicago pizza.I've tried all the tourist traps, and in my opinion, Pequod's is where it's at. Killer deep dish crust, amazingly fresh toppings, and a perfect sauce with just the right amount of kick. (I recommend requesting some fresh basil if you want a little something extra)As far as service, let me put it this way: I was recently in the area working on a record, and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We'd get done in the studio super late and then head over for pizza and drinks. We stayed well past close several nights a week, and without fail, they were always awesome to us and extremely welcoming. Thanks guys! You've got a fan for life!
