Wow - I hardly give out 1-star ratings, but I'll gladly frame this up and hand deliver this to the owner. This is where you would go to eat garbage-grade fish in a dark loungy setting. About the only thing good about this place is the fact that I was dining with my beloved wife. For starter, the place is so dark that you can't even see what you are putting in your mouth. But that's not a capital offense. The food is the real culinary crime being committed against humanity here. The server has the audacity to tell us the fish is imported from Japan when we asked about where they buy their fish. If you have any standards in sushi at all, you wouldn't put the frozen, low-grade fish in your mouth.  I should point out that this is not an authentic Japanese place. One of the simplest tests you can use is to taste a Japanese restaurant's tempura. If the breading is not the light, authentic Japanese tempura breading, like this place, this should be a good sign that this place has no idea what real Japanese cooking is like. This places uses "fried jalapeno" type of breading...too thick and over-powering on the taste buds. I checked out their website and saw that they received the Best of Chicago from Chicago Magazine and the Zagat award for excellence in 2004. That may be the case, but those days are long gone. The website also claims that they use the freshest ingredients and top quality fish from around the world - I find this claim hard to believe. You don't have to take my word for this. Try this place out yourself and be prepared to be disappointed...that is unless you like eating in a lounge / club atmosphere, then I guess you could accept the low quality of the food.
