I have really been looking forward to dining at a Rick Bayless restaurant since I moved to Chicago... and let me say up front that I am glad that I did! The restaurant is an area of Chicago where there are a ton of hit or miss restaurants that you pay top dollar for, the prices at XOCO were quite moderate...I thought we got a bang for our buck. Anyhow, the boy and I visited this afternoon around three. There was really no wait to get in granted it seemed pretty busy. You basically go up to the counter put your order in and they bring it to your table....deli style. I loved it. I started off with a Half Acre Lager and the boy had a Matilda. We enjoyed the XOCO salad which was phenominal...avocados, lime, braised pork, lettuce, and some sort of caramelized red onion deliciousness. We then moved onward, I had a sandwich with milanese chicken and beans and cheese inside...really good....I think I was oinking the first few minutes of eating it, and my partner in crime had a chorizo sandwich. I am not a huge fan of chorizo...to rich for me- but he said he would go back for it. I will definitely go back here!
