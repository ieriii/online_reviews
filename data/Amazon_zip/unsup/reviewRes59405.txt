If you like THICK pizza, and not just breading, but CHEESE! This is your place.Their pizza is like a lasagna without the noodles.Two slices are very filling.The atmosphere is friendly, with a variety of Chicago types, business people and tourists... but the pizza is outstanding.This is not New York style thin and wide, but Chicago style, think and deep!By far my favorite.
