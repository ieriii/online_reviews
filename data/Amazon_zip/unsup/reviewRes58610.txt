Coast sushi has some of the best sushi in the Chicago area. Its fresh and reasonably priced. I also love the fact that its BYOB. The only reason my review didn't get 5 stars is because the last time I was there our waiter was a jack ass. I went with 5 people and we asked to split the check with 4 credit cards. Our 5th person only had cash so she asked him for change for a $20. He replied with, I'm sorry but I don't have change for you....what restaurant doesn't have change for a 20? It was ridiculous and he argued with us for about 5 minutes until we got fed up and had to go to a manager for change. It was weird a ridiculous.
