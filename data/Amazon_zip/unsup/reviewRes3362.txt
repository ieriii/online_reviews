I'm about 95% sure that they use MSG. But its sooooo good, you won't even care. The buddha bowl is fantastic. Any of the fried chicken will punch your tastebuds in the face. In fact, it's some of the better fried chicken i've ever had. The sandwiches are not impressive. The "not so common" crisp is very reminiscent of the "oh so common" chicken filet at McDonald's....even down to the kraft cheese they put on it......it could be improved so easily, if they'd just just get a better bun and some real cheese.... The sides are also only ok. You won't really remember them. Some of the sauces are amazing. Go with the buddha bowl and some wings and you will come back again and again. And BYOB.
