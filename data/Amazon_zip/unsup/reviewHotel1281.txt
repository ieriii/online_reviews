My mother and sister in law attended afternoon tea here last weekend. We had done it before 2 years prior and found it to be one of the better teas offered in the city. Unfortunately, they've changes some things around and we experienced terrible service. Last time when there was an afternoon tea we were in the section underneath/surround by all the windows with city views. This time, we were told our reservation for tea was in their itty bitty, open and uncharismatic restaurant. Points lost for change of scene and seeing the city. Then, there was no harpist or carolers or anything that represented this quaint holiday tradition. Instead it just sounded like we were in a field house.  All that aside, the service was terrible. Especially considering it's the Ritz...I would think they'd have people kissing your ass left and right. We were 10 mins early for our 4pm reservation, and yet weren't sat until 4:20. This is only after we witnessed the entire 'lobby' (by the fountain) clear out and everyone else sat that had come after us....I actually went up to the host and pointed this out to which he brought us to a table that wasn't set.  The wait staff was horrific throughout the entire experience. We spoke to about 4 different servers, each bringing something different. Our original server that took our order, never came back to get our wine order. We had to flag him down. No one ever came by to check in on us, or worse, refill our wine glasses. We grabbed a bus boy to do so. Then when the check came, it sat for 20 minutes and when still no one had come by to pick it up, we had to flag down yet another waiter to run the card. Never again Ritz.
