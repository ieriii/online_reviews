The food here was very good, you have to get the pork rinds if you decide to go, They were melt in your mouth fantastic. Other items that were delicious were the muscles, radishes,and the daily pickles. Our server was nice, very attentive and seemed to know a lot about the menu, he was helpful. I also enjoyed the space it's huge, with large pictures on the wall of fat pigs and so many hanging lights I lost count.  The reason I gave this restaurant a three star is because of the horrible busers. They were in our face every moment to clear just one glass, or one fork. me and my party did not enjoy our meal because of them, they were always in our face interrupting our conversation it was horrible. It was like they were trying to hurry us out but there were no parties waiting to be seated. One of the women that I was eating with was still eating a piece of bread and one of the busers took the plate from right underneath her. I work in the industry and I understand being efficient but this was just rude. I would not go back just in fear that I would get as angry as I was that night. My meal was ruined. Good luck!
