What a gem! My boyfriend and I went to Sapori Trattoria for the first time last week and we fell in love all over again.... (by fell in love.. I'm referring to our love of delicious Italian food!) My boyfriend is Italian, has lived in Florence for two years, and has eaten more pasta in his lifetime than one should ever consume... so when he says an Italian restaurant is good... I generally believe he knows what he's talking about. And let me tell you, Sapori Trattoria was wonderful! It was everything an Italian restaurant should be. It was quaint and romantic with dim lighting, perfect spot for a date. For starters, we had wine and an appetizer, the grilled calamari. Our wine was great and the appetizer was good. However, grilled calamari wherever I've ordered it tends to be slightly bland for my personal liking so I would opt to try something else. Our entrees were exquisite! I had the lobster stuffed ravioli in a light pink sauce, similar to a vodka pasta sauce. It literally melted in my mouth! :) I would def. recommend it! However, in comparison to the other dishes, the portion size was notably smaller... I don't know why. Oh well! My boyfriend ordered the butternut squash ravioli and it was orgasmic... I say that because when I had a bite, I let out this dramatic embarrassing moan. It was def. a "when harry met sally" moment! So GOOD! Tasted like a dessert almost! Would def. recommend if you would like to indulge your sweet tooth! :) For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding. Not much of a dessert person, but my boyfriend loved it! The only bad part was that our bill came out to be 85 dollars which was quite more than we had originally intended to spend. If you live in the city and are looking for a new place to try for a special occasion or what not, I would def. recommend Sapori Trattoria. It is a real treat. One of my new favorite places in the city! Can't wait to go back!
