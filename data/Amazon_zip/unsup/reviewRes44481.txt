Very good sushi. Try to go there on a non weekend night, especially in the summer because it gets very busy and is very small on the inside. I went one time in the summer and the host told me the wait would be over an hour and that I should go to pingpong across the street. Kinda through me off for a bit, but overall the sushi is worth coming here for.
