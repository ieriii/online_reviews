We went, in part, because of the review of my trusted cher amiga, Lindley E. - and I have to disagree with her on one matter: ANY of the appetizers that involve Bufala Mozzerella (especially when joined/combined with the Insalata Mista) can be scrumptious...! However - the pizza is grand - and plan on ordering (at least) two for a party of two... You really can't miss with any of the selections - but our personal favorites are Funghi e Salsiccia (mushrooms and sausage) and Proscuitto e Rucola (arugula) - both are totally delish! Desserts? They sound good - but who has room? BTW - parking has never been a problem.
