The pizza at Piece is my second favorite in Chicago. I am not a big fan of deep dish and I often feel the thin crust at deep dish places is just ok. The crust at Piece is thin and crispy- not buttery. They do not overdo it on the cheese, the sauce is the right consistency and the veggies are fresh. Yum!
