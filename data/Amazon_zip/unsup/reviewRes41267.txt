This place is awesome! We did the 4 course and it was amazing. My wife has a gluten allergy and they prepared her meal without gluten and it was still amazing!!  This place has 2 minor problems: 1). The meal will take at least 2 hours. 2). It's very expensive The food, the service, everything was awesome! I've been there twice both with groupons. Even though it's byob, I doubt I would go back without a coupon because of the price and time. If you are okay with a 2 hour dinner and $70 for each meal then this place is awesome! Because the food is amazing, its so good that I cannot even describe how good it is!
