I come to Fifty/50 on a somewhat regular basis and always have a great time. The drinks are always cold and served quickly and taste great. The food is superb! The burgers are great, fries always cooked to perfection and the waffle fries are sooooo good! Service here is prompt and perfect. I have never had to wait more than a few minutes for a drink no matter what I order. Trust me when my sister and I enjoy a few mimosas here on Sundays and the service is always great. The bar staff is very professional as well for a bar. I have been coming here since they opened and I have to say the service has never been bad!!!! I am always impressed by Fifty/50 :) Will definitely be back :)
