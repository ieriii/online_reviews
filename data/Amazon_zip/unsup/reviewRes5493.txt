Cheese, swine, and wine doesnt even begin to cover this place. It was wonderful. Complain all you want about it being packed, its packed for a reason. Delightful wine selection but the food is FABULOUS. We had the muscles, bone marrow, fried manchego cheese, and chicken skewers. Everything was divine. The servings are actually quite large. (I figured it would be tapas style were you get a little food for a lot of money and still go home hungry). I will be back, probably tomorrow actually. I doubt theres a bad thing on the menu. PS James is amazing.
