Once more a great dining experience in the neighborhood. What an incredibly warm and inviting atmosphere. Must say the food is more complicated than I normally seek but well worth listening to the server's explanation of the ingredients and preparation. What do I mean by complicated-how about red wattle pork belly with beluga lentils or espelette pepper. I think you get the idea. What we learned is that the ingredients are fresh, tasty and unusual.  We ended up ordering the balsamic roasted garlic and olive oil and toast, greens with a delicious mozzarella and cream combo. Yum! Main dishes included the pot roast swordfish and the chicken. Great value for the price combined with knowledgeable and extremely friendly staff. You will be amazed at what you can get. I will return especially when the sidewalk tables are set when the nice weather returns. Highly recommend you try Gilt. You will be glad you did. Oh by the way, I have not been back to my former suburban favorite, Hole in The Wall, since November. I miss the wait staff but have so many new city favorites.
