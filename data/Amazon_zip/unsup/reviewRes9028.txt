I used to work at a Persian Restaurant in Indianapolis so when I came upon this place I was very skeptical and biased. But boy did I misjudge this place. The kebab's were just soooOooo succulent. The hummus was wonderful and the noon (bread was just light and airy). Creativity - n/a Traditional Presentation - 2 (Basically how your mom would serve you dinner if you were Persian) Service - 4(Very attentive) Atmosphere - 3 Flavor - 4(Excellent, I had some green rice and my girl had a shrimp and fish combo that were just wonderful) Execution - 5 (Texture of the rice was unbelievable and the succulent meat, drool.)
