You know how there are places that, when you hear you're going there, you want to clap and jump up & down like a little kid? (Do kids do that?) Anyway, this is Piece for me. It's out of my way and not remotely convenient to my neighborhood, but when friends say we're headed there, I get stupidly excited and may be known to yell out, "OH YAY, PIECE!" I stumbled upon the most delicious custom pizza combination--white sauce, spinach, sausage. That's it. Dare I say that I may like this pizza better than Lou Malnati's, which for me is like peeing on an altar. I am not sure--they're totally different. I will have to have much more of both to decide. Always a fan of dark beers and dunkels, I also really enjoyed the Dark-N-Curvy Dunkelweizen. Smooth and delicious with no weird aftertaste. I love the unique beer selection and all the custom pizza toppings. So if you get a bad pizza here, YOU CHOSE WRONG. That, or your taste buds are broken. You should get that checked out. There can be a hell of a wait here on Saturday nights--just assume 45 minutes and come prepared to grab a beer at the bar. I groaned inwardly when I saw that it was live band karaoke night (two things I hate, in combination!) but we got lucky with a good band and some very good vocalists (which overshadowed the ones who sucked), so it was all-in-all a great time.
