I'm pretty sure that when Homer sang "You can't win friends with salad. . ." that it was based on a dining experience here. This is the place that all my veggie friends from out of town want to visit because it's so infamous. It makes me want to die. The food is terribly bland, and I'm not sure their cooks are aware of salt or pepper. I had a potato/leek soup there that visibly had dill in it, but it could've been shredded green construction paper for all I could tell. Sandwiches of soggy consistency still lack sauce surprisingly. The food is also expensive for what you get. A sandwich with a side of steamed kale can set you back $12.00 and the fact that it tastes like every wrong stereotype of meat substitutes and cardboard is wrong - just plain wrong. Maybe my standards for vegan/vegetarian fare was set too high by places that use salt and creative menu choices. Maybe it's the fact that the menu resembles the Morning Star line of products in the freezer a little too closely to justify paying premium for it. Maybe my expectations for seitan to be used beyond the recipe on the side of the package from Whole Foods is expecting too much. (By the way, many of the seitan dishes are NOT healthier just because they're vegan. Whenever was heavily processed wheat healthy? Just another myth being perpetuated.). What is nice about this place though are the soyshakes. Peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough shakes of any kind can win my heart, but that doesn't mean I'm staying for a burger. The desserts are great, but they're mostly outsourced from various vegan bakeries so that might explain the presence of sugar and spices. Kind of interesting that people give them credit for it.
