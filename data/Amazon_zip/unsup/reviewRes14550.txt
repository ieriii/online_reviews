I recently excercised my right of freedom of speech, and wrote a review about my experience at this restaurant. A few days post my review I come to find an email in my personal inbox from the owner himself. Apparently he was not satisfied with my review, and felt it necessary to send me a very rude message. i stand by my review, and if the owner is not happy, i suggest YOU remove your business from Yelp. I expect to not see another message from you in my inbox.
