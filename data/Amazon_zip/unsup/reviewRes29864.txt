This place is excellent. Rick Bayliss knows how to please. The food is unbelievable, the drinks are spectacular, and the ambience is great. Service was pretty good, it is always very, very busy so a little inattentiveness can be understood. I love everything about this restaurant...except, that it is so good that it gets so crowded there is often a significant wait for a table and they have a very weird reservation policy. So go at an off time, or plan on waiting a few minutes, either way you'll have one of the best meals of your life!
