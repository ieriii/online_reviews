I have never worked this hard to get a reservation. Looking for a reservation for the first week of August, I started stalking the web site as soon as July rolled around. A seemingly endless series of cryptic promises and updates eventually culminated with the roll out of the new "a la Next" ticketing system. Fortunately a coworker caught the release as it was happening, and half an hour later I was sitting on tickets for a four top. But I was looking for a reservation for 3. Turns out thats not something that Alinea's new ticketing system can accommodate. Problem? Not at all. Turns out this is a heck of a popular place, so without much fuss, we were able to find a fourth to join us on our culinary adventure. Concerns about the awkwardness of spending 4 hours with a stranger were entirely unfounded. Its amazing how shared admiration for breathtaking food can bring people together.. At a price tag of $280 (sans drinks), this place had a lot to live up to. I am very happy to report that I think it was worth every penny. While there are plenty of fine dining establishments providing you with fine culinary fare, Alinea is providing you with a complete experience. Dinner and a show. I was surprised by the extent to which the restaurant made use of molecular gastronomy, but the bells and whistles added rather than detracted every time. Innovative techniques and ingredients came together in surprising and wonderful ways. I wont provide any details of how; I wouldn't want to ruin the surprise. Just go, and be prepared to have your mind blown.
