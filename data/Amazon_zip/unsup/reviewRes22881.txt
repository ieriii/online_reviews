I am not a hot dog fan, but I have to say the superdawg is a super treat. It may very well represent the pinnacle of what can happen on a hot dog bun. Poppy seed buns, flourescent relish, sweet and spicy peppers, quality franks. . .get the 'furter outta here. . .Nathans (Coney Island) or Pinks (Los Angeles) can't hold a candle to this place.
