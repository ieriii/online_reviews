The food here is AWESOME! I've been here very early and when they have become slammed and every time my Husband and I, along with our guests have been very satisfied and happy with out dishes. I love the juice bar, I always get a glass of something while I'm there and I'm always pleasantly surprised. They are great with folks who have food allergies, the place is a little small but they get people in and out. So go early cause there is usually a line coming out the door on the weekend.
