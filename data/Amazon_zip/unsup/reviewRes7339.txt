Wow, what a great find. We came here on a recommendation from a friend last week, and actually walked right by the unassuming storefront. Great food and service, overall, a superb experience. We had the lobster ravioli and lasagna - I was a little hesitant about lobster stuffed into a pasta shell, but the combination was delicious. The sauce is creamy but not overpowering. And the lasagna was a yummy, traditional style in a generous serving. All served with a big hunk of crusty bread. The waiter goofed, and instead of bringing two glasses of wine, brought an entire bottle. We didn't correct him (who turns down a bottle of wine), but when he came back he noticed his error. He apologized and filled up our glasses and did not charge for a bottle (although he took the rest of it. doh!)  The place has a nice, mellow vibe; and the tables are pretty close together so it's very intimate. I can't wait to come back!
