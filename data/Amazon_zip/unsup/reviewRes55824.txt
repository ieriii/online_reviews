Well, dine-in might be good, I've tried that.. but I'm pretty disappointed in the latest delivery-to-your-door treat I splurged on. Full slab of ribs.. arrived not-too hot, medium-warm in fact. Kind of on the dry side. Side of spaghetti with meat sauce was hotter, but could have used, oh, 300% more meat sauce. Salad was unimpressive. Bread was good. Delivery person was (as they all seem to be) unapologetic for the not-hot food. I think it should be same temp delivered to your door as delivered to your table; microwave reheating does NOT enhance any dish.  When you can get it, though, the cream of mushroom soup  is....wunnerful!
