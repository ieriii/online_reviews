The food is pretty good, but I have come back time and time again for THE SERVICE. There is a gentleman who greets us every time, and brings us water and arranges chairs for us to sit while we wait for a table (very popular place). He and the staff are so attentive to our every need. All other restaurant owners, managers, and waiters could really take a cue from Simply It.
