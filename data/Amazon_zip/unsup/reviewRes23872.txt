Fresh ingredients, friendly service, reasonable prices. Five stars! I did the "make your own crepe" option. The server helped me decide what would go best together with the Icosium dressing. I chose artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato tapanade, and roasted peppers with brie. DELICIOUS. I moaned throughout the entire meal. The crepes also come with soup. I chose the vegetarian soup. It was pureed. I don't like pureed soup because it reminds me of eating baby food. But goo-goo-ga-ga, I loved it.  Some reviews say they've raised their prices. I still think $9.99 is a fair price for a bowl of soup and a huge crepe filled with love.
