This place was unbelievably good. Randomly came across it and it looked busy so I went in. I got sat next to a very nice woman at the bar who was alone and since everything was small plates we decoded to share. OK enough back story. Beet salad awesome. Fried manchengo one of the best things I've ever eaten fried and I'm a sucker for fried pickles (not they have them but I thought you should know). Moved onto bone marrow, great. Ended with pork shoulder which was not the show standout but was the perfect final course. I need to randomly meet someone next time I come here because so much other good food came out I didn't get to try. Oh and good luck to the lady I met her baby is due in January.
