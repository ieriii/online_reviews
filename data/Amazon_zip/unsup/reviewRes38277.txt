MR says... what's that song by U2? .... "i still haven't found what i'm looking for" MRS says... It's a shame that we were not impressed by this place. We picked this place because we read it from a book that was sitting on a coffee table inside our hotel room. it was mentioned as one of the best place for Chicago deep dish pizza... says who? We got a mozzarella platter which was ok even though there were a lot of mushroom buttons and a squash type (likely zucchini) breaded thing than the actual mozzarella sticks. "veggie platter" was probably more appropriate name for this To get the most of everything we split our large size pizza into two flavor: half side tropic delight aka Hawaiian then the other half special combo... neither flavor was incredible... just ok Our quest continues in finding the best, the world famous, the most voted, the one and only Chicago deep dish pizza. Each time we take a trip to the city of Chicago, we explore restaurants that serve the so called "famous" Chicago deep dish pizza yet we end up disappointed and that's what happened with GIORDANO's
