Growing up in South America and having to eat at churrascarias all my life, Brazzaz definitely doesn't compare. However, in the Chicago area I would have to say, Brazzaz is my favorite churascaria in town. I've been to Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, but sometimes they seriously oversalt the meat. Like I tell all my friends, if you ever go to the churascaria make sure to order a some guarana soda! it's my favorite drink in the whole wide world.. you won't regret it! Also, compared to the other churascarias in town, brazzaz actually rotates their meet unlike other restaurants where the meat servers come around only once in a blue moon!!! oh and Garlic Picana all the way.. it's delicious!
