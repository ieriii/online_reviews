Excellent breakfast place. Be prepared for a 30 minute wait or longer on Saturday/Sunday, but the large portions of good quality food will help fill you up. Coffee is available for sale at the front desk so you can enjoy some joe while waiting for your table.  Nice interior, good service, food was ready quite quickly given the full house they were serving.
