I went here with fellow yelper, Nikki C, after he gave me a wonderful hour long massage. He suggested the place and I'm so glad he did. The hummus appetizer was very yummy and I could've eaten a giant plate of that for dinner. I ordered a combo plate of chicken and ground beef skewers with a mixture of plain rice and dill rice. The food was amazing and so filling. I had leftovers for another meal.  If I'm ever in Albany Park around lunch or dinner time I'll definitely be back to try more dishes.
