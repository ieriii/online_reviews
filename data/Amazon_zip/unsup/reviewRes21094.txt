I love Xoco. A couple of things 1. Price. Yes, the sandwiches and caldos are a bit pricey, but do you realize that you are supporting so many agricultural communities across Illinois and helping to pay living wages to Chicagoans? A couple of dollars more is worth it. Not only are you helping people in our community, you are also helping provide a better quality of life for the animals, land and resources used in order to produce your beautiful Torta or piping hot Churro. Sweet, yes? 2. Taste. Oh my god, so so good. Unfortunately I don't eat meat but I'm still so satisfied. I always get the black bean caldo which is so unbelievably flavorful. It's full of delicious black beans, mushrooms (which I only eat in this caldo) and these mind blowing potato-masa dumplings which really just taste like the best tamales you've ever had. My boyfriend loves his meat but loves this caldo too. It's finished with a little bit of raw garlic and ripe avocados. Mmm. 3. Salt. The second to last time I was there my caldo was so salty it was inedible. I had to ask them to maybe add more broth? Even water? They quickly fixed my caldo and I was back to enjoying my food. They have all the broths and sauces in pots and when you order a caldo they just add them to a bowl depending on what you order. I asked them last time if they could please make my caldo a little less salty and it came out perfect! Just ask them ahead if you're worried about the salt level. Okay, I think that's all I can write. Basically just go and make sure you get churros with a chocolate shot.
