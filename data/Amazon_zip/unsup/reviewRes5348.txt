Love the purple pig! Just brought foodie friends here over the holiday weekend. Could have been a nightmare with all the holiday madness. Instead we were greeted with the smiles and laughter of Darma our fantastic server. Darma not only takes good care to get you what you have ordered, she guides you through a unique menu making recommendations that hit the mark every time. With her no-nonsense blend of humor and experience combined with a great food and wine menu you are in for a treat beginning to end!
