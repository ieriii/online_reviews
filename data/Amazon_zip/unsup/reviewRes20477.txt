Probably the best fish and chips I've had to date. Started off with an heirloom tomato tart that was one tomato core away from perfection, easily over looked by a pie-crust enthusiast like myself. My grandmother has made pies for a living for a good portion of her life and still cannot do a pie crust this good - nice work. Also noteworthy was the scotch egg - the first I've had that actually desirable to eat, let alone delicious. Dessert was an apple fritter with cider reduction and ale ice cream; a perfect way to spend a fall evening on Michigan Avenue.
