I've eaten here more than once, for business lunches and for dinner. The food is very good, but more than that the atmosphere is wonderful. We felt like we were in the dining room of an elegant pre-war colonial Vietnamese hotel. Which is the point, right? Don't plan on a rushed meal here -- they have a bar so a two-martini lunch would be just fine. Service is excellent and deliberately slow-paced.
