This place is in a great location and is beautiful, but that's about it. It is way too crowded, long lines at the check in and check out, people EVERYWHERE and really long walks to the rooms. Riding the elevators in the morning took longer than my commute to work. It is just a big hotel with way too many people staying there.  Oh, and my key quit working, which create about 20 minutes of logistics in the morning and made me late for the meeting I traveled to Chicago for in the first place. Palmer House, while beautiful, has bit off more than they can chew with this monstrosity of a hotel. Not a good place to stay if you are on business travel.
