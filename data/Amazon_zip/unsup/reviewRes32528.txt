I've wanting to eat at Sunda for quite awhile but was not able to get a reservation. So, when I finally got a reservation this past weekend I was very excited and the food did not disappoint. Although all of the dishes were good,except for "sticky rice", I especially enjoyed corn fritter which had the most flavorful taste and my wife loved bread pudding which she says is combination of creme brulle and thai custard ...."to die for". I was told that the service was very good but our server, Stephanie, was awesome and she even took the sticky rice off the bill because I did not like it. Overall, I will definitely revisit Sunda again to try other delicacy on the menu.
