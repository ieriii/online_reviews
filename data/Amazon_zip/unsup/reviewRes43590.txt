This place is the sister establishment of one of my fave coffee spots, Cippolina Cafe, which automatically earns it extra points in my book. A beautiful, sunny space that feels calm even when it's busy (and on weekends, it. is. busy.) The coffee is delicious (no surprise there, hi Cippolina!) and the food is simple but tasty and satisfying. I've been here for both brunch and lunch and I have to admit *sacrilege alert* that I kind of prefer the lunch. There's just something about those sandwiches that is so so lovely- and great for vegetarians too! I always appreciate a place that recognizes a sandwich doesn't have to contain cold cuts. I've checked it out for brunch, too, and enjoyed the cosy atmosphere even more. BB had the orange french toast (with a side of sausage, of course!) and was a fan- I had a taste and it wasn't too sweet even for this anti-sweet bruncher. I was a bit of a harder sell- I don't like to get brunch items that I can easily make myself, but I'm also not fiending for sugar at 10 am (remind me again why brunch is my favourite meal?) So the brekkie burrito never tends to draw me in. I got the egg and cheese sandwich and while it was satisfying, it was nothing special. I prefer to wait for lunch on this one..mmmmmm...
