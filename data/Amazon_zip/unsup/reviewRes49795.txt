I came here on a Tuesday night with a kiwi friend who had never tried Latin American food beyond the offerings of Taco Bell. First question - Where are the chips and guac? Answer: Down the street at the Mexican restaurant! I thought I knew what to expect, as I had tried my fair share of pollo al ajillo while traveling. This isn't your snack shack kind of food, though. Sure, there's a pollo al ajillo (its one of the specials) but you've never really tried Pollo al Ajillo (chicken with a light garlic wine marinade) until you've had it at Las Tablas. In fact, I'm going to make a lofty claim and that I never knew the delicious details of chicken until I tasted the perfectly prepared, tender, and delicate chicken at Las Tablas. The only downfall is that the chicken didn't heat up for lunch very well the next day. In retrospect, however, I think my initial standards were too high for that small leftover piece to fulfill its grandiose memory of the night before. As for the ambiance, I could not have asked for a better spot to a bring a friend for feasting on a Tuesday (PS- BYOB on weekdays!). I imagine that Las Tablas would be fabulous for groups. It's definitely not a "date" place in the standard of Geja's Cafe, but it the restaurant is still quiet enough that two people can have easily have a conversation.
