I recently went here with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday, and we were both really pleased with our experience.  The atmosphere is warm and woodsy and romantic. Lovely large and low lighting fixtures, big booths around the perimeter and a lower seating area where diners can view the cooking line and big brick back wall behind the cooks. It's bustling, but not overwhelmingly so.  Menu is a bit pricey, but the food was delicious. My salmon was a large fillet served on a cedar plank, perfectly cooked with a large side of delectable red-skin mashed potatoes. My man's steak/shrimp combo was really good too. We also ate about 4 of their little loaves of bread - no joke. They kept it coming the entire time and we had really great service too. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed for dessert, but wow, they had a lot of tasty looking options. Will definitely be back for another special occasion!
