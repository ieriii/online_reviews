I took my beau here on his birthday, not really knowing what to expect--just knowing of Graham from his appearances on Top Chef.  When we first arrived there was some filming going, not sure for what. We saw Graham come out and glad-hand the guys being filmed. It was nice to see he was actually there in the kitchen.  About half way through our dinner, the filming ended and the entire ambiance of the place changed--for the better. Low lights made it feel much more intimate, which was a bonus considering there isn't much space between you and the tables next to you. We both did the tasting menu, which we were pleased with. Got to try a little of everything that way, and everything tasted pretty amazing. (If you like sea scallops, Graham's are a must.) The beer menu was impressive, though a bit overpriced. Paying for the experience I guess. Overall, the place is fun and upscale without being snooty. You don't have to be a foodie to enjoy Graham Elliot, although at those prices it helps to know a little something.
