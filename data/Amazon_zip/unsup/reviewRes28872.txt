I love this place! It's fast and delicious pasta; plus it's really cheap. It's a hole-in-the-wall fun type of place. They have board games in The Other Side which is conncected if you go with a large group of people. You can eat in either section depending on if you want a loud bar, or a slightly more quiet restaurant. I just wish they delivered to my neighborhood and that parking was a little easier (parking in Lincoln Park is a feat no matter where you go though).
