"Did you enjoy eating at Publican with so and so" my friend asked me... "Eh, it was ok" I responded.. "Why is it that you never seem to like any restaurant that isn't, Asian " she asked me. "That's not true' I said. "Well, I can't think of the last time you told me with excitement about any other place" "I really liked Minetta Tavern, that place is very good" I said.. Yes, perhaps I am picky.. perhaps, not easily impressed.. Though, I did like the concept of Publican, the use of local ingrediants, the small plates, the forward thinking combinations and ideas.. It fell short to impress and to meet my expectations. A plate of acorn squash wth burrata cheese with done fairly well. Candied walnuts were nice but, then it was drizzled with this overly sweet balsamic reduction.. Way too sweet and kind of ruined the whole dish... A carrot dish with little pieces of swordfish was kind of off.. the swordfish tasted way too fishy and I feel the attempted to mask this fishy taste with way too much vinegar.. A shrimp dish hit the mark.. Though for 24 bucks, it was nice that it did. Things were good, I am not denying this, they just felt a little lazy and too informal.. More like home cooking.. I wanted to like it, I kind of do like it, but, I do not love it.. I would go back and be happy to if I lived in Chicago.. But, it wasnt spectacular.
