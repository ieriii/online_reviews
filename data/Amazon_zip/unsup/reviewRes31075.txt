I enjoyed Sunda this week on a slow monday :) We picked Monday, just because things are more chill at restaurants. My pals and I ( 7 of us ) got to catch up and beat the weekend crowd. We had drinks before at Le Bar @Sofitel Hotel down the street. Now Sunda: We ordered ~ "DEVILS BASKET" - soft shell crab nested on spicy chile peppers (oh boy these were spicy!) "PANCIT CANTON" - pork, shrimp, carrots, egg noodles, tapanaki chicken and chinese broccoli (DOUBLE YUM) "ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA" -glazed popcorn shrimp, (JUST OKAY) "ROASTED DUCK HASH" -roasted duck appetizer, (JUST OKAY) "LO MEIN" - beef, bok choy, carrot, mushrooms,scallions ( DOUBLE YUM) "CHICKEN BREAST TOBANAKI" - baby bok choy, spicy soy glaze, carrots. (JUST OKAY) The best dishes for me were the Devils Basket and Lo Mein. I need to go back and try their sushi and other entrees. Def next time I'll have the LEMON GRASS BEEF LOLLIPOPS!! I would say 5 stars for the Atmosphere, 5 stars for the service, and 3.5-4.5 stars for the food that we tried. The food here has a twist to match the restaurant atmosphere, but def a place for appetizers and drinks for me for now : ) Def come back again to try more. : )
