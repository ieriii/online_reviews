I ventured to the Grunts after reading the reviews on Yelp and I must say that it did live up to its rep. This place is a lot smaller than I originally expected, that is where it loses its one star. It feels a bit cramped especially when it is packed, like on a Monday afternoon, which is quite surprising. The chili which was claimed voted best in 1979 was mediocre. The patty melt was a very good sandwich, something about grilled onions just seems natural, very underused in modern day society. The service was truly outstanding, fast and incredibly nice. Everyone raves about the salad bar but I wasn't too impressed with the size of it. The music was also rather loud for a family eatery.
