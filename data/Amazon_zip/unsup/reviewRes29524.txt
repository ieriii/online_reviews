Having had noodles for lunch, I went fairly simple when i had dinner here. I had some fried rice, an my brother had the pad woonsen. We both agreed the dish was too eggy. The flavor was too rich and hard I could not finish, despite the average size portion. I should try more menu items in the future, but in this city, you could eat thai food each day from a new restaurant, so who knows....
