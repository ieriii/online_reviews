Main course was ok with the carbonara and the chicken royale. Generous portions as usual so kudos to that. Service was great too; waiter kept checking in on us but not too annoying. And he even apologized when our dessert took slightly longer than expected with a valid reason: kitchen is preparing for a party so taking longer than usual. Well, it's ok. we were warm and comfortable and still really full from the main course. And he refilled our glasses promptly. The dessert. You MUST get the molten chocolate cake! It's one of the best i've tried so far! In fact, I've never been able to have a proper molten chocolate cake. This one, once cut open, the chocolate oozes out like lava and the chocolate lava is not too sweet but just right. The outer crust is also baked perfectly. We also ordered an apple pie. The crust of the apple pie was amazing. but I think due to a side-by-side comparison with the molten choc cake, this apple pie couldn't quite catch up. everyone was just delving into the choc cake while leaving the apple pie almost untouched (except the crust, it was ripped off). nice food, good service, fantastic dessert.
