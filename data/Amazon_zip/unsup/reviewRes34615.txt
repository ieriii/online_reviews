I love breakfast and this was definitely a good spot. Tried the strawberry-orange juice, it was awesome, then had a 3-egg omelet filled with veggies that was real good. We also shared a side of banana nut pancakes that were awesome. Overall a great place, highly recommend it. The service was really fast, the food was great and the prices were reasonable.
