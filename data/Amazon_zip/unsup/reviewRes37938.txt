Terrible experience. It was crowded but we didn't mind waiting. When we asked for a timing update after 30 minutes I got a sneer response. After 45 minutes I was told 7 more minutes. After 10 more minutes I was told the oven was broken and everything on hold. Stuff happens, a service attitude would have been greatly appreciated.
