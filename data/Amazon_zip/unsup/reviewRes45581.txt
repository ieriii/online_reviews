WOW!!! Their gluten free menu is almost the same size as their regular menu, and I couldn't be more excited :)!! I delved into the gluten free mac and cheese, with pieces of tomatoes, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, and a GF bread crumb crust on top. SOOOO delicious. I can't wait to go back and try the other gluten free delicacies. Don't get me wrong they have wonderful food that isn't gluten free, but due to my allergy I hit the jack pot here.
