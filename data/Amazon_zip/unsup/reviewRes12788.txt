I love TDB's feijoada. And I think it's cool that a Brazilian place offers tabbouleh (it's because the owners of the restaurant chain are Lebanese). I always fill up on the salad bar because they have amazing choices. And I love the bananas that they serve on the table, they are SO good. The potatoes are pretty damn awesome too. Oh yeah, and the meat. My favorite cut is the picanye (probably not spelling it right). Strawberry pineapple caipirinhas are the way to go! Did I mention the wine artist flying around in the cellar? That's a really cool feature.
