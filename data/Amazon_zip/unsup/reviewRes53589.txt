Korean fried chicken is muy delicioso!!! The sauces were tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. Just the way I like it. I do feel they're a little over priced for the actual portion size, but they definitely know their chicken. The staff is fun and quirky which fits the neighborhood. And I love that they have coat racks to accommodate their patrons during the fall, winter and spring months since their seating has a tendency to be a bit awkward (it's arranged as if you're joining a bunch of strangers at a hibachi grill). I hear the salad's are awesome and they're next on my list to try.
