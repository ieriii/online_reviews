Excellent food, excellent service! I really enjoyed my time at Sapori. I dined here with a group of 10 and everything was impeccable. The manager on duty was super nice and took care of us. We were seated at a semi-private, cozy area upstairs.  I loved the ambience of the place-it was crowded, but still intimate enough to enjoy if you're on a date. Sapori is one of the best Italian restaurants I've had the pleasure of dining. The rigatoni was sooo good and cheesy and their bruschetta was unique as it had avocado on it! I highly recommend this place. Make a reservation at all times. I can't wait to go back. Ps: The bathroom is very clean.
