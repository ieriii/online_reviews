My favorite neighborhood sushi!! Great atmosphere, good staff, quick service, fresh ingredients, BYOB although connected to a unique little Asian-inspired bar you can wait in or drink at after, love it!! I'm always pleased at Wakamono, I've been there countless times, the only downfall is how packed it gets on weekends, so try for a week night.. and It's totally worth the extra dollar or two per roll. Alaskan roll is amazing!! Totally recommend!!
