I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The owner is the nicest man and the food is out of this world. I love well made food with fresh ingredients and my favorite Vietnamese food has been Le Colonial. This place achieves that level of quality. Everything is wonderful in the restaurant, and many are great for carry out/delivery. The Lemongrass beef app and the lemongrass pork chops entree will change your life. The viet crepe app is packed with flavor(this is best in the restaurant). I also love the shrimp satay (it's not like the satay you see in Thai place, but very yummy.) If you have many mouths to feed I would also add the green beans entree. You can substitute brown rice for white rice in any dish. I would eat here twice a week if I could.
