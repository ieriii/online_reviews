I liked this place the moment I called. Spoke with Jeff who helped me out getting a reservation at the VERY last minute. Cute little place, great atmosphere, the only problem was the table we were seated at was right next to the bar and when it gets busy thats where people wait for a table. My friend got a great portioned meal and i got the pumpkin stuffed pasta which was amazing! appetizer of avocado on bread was amazing. and they give you bread at the table with olive oil and a cup of parm. cheese. the dishes were about $20 a plate. would go again!
