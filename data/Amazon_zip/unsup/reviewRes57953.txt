Made the trip out to Little Bucharest Bistro the other night to check out the restaurant. The facade, outdoor seating and fountain are quaint and were done very well. The interior as well is clean and quaint. Two menus were offered: one offering classic Romanian fare, the second being Chef Andre's menu. Having eaten at his last venture, it's amusing to see that this menu is more or less identical to his last, save some small changes. We ordered off of both menus. Iceberg wedge, gravlox and onion tart off Chef Andre's menu, sausage and cabbage rolls off of the classic menu. No complaints about the salad except that they used a wedge of romaine instead of iceberg. The gravlox was also well executed; my only suggestion would be to serve rye toast points to accompany the salmon and decrease the portion size. The onion tart, unfortuantely, was not exceptionally palatable. The pastry was soggy, the onions were not cooked down enough and the accompanying thyme salad was missing. The classic Romanian entrees were exceptional. Terrific sausages and cabbage rolls. The accompanying sides listed on the menu, however, were different from what we received. All this being said, I was astonished that Chef Andre was not in the kitchen and apparently taking a Friday evening off. It's possible that he had an emergency or very pressing plans, but if not, he should be there to insure that the menus are being executed properly.
