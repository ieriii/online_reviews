It's always lively in this Greektown fixture--and for good reason--free valet, quick seating, great service and delicious food. You can get in, eat, and get outta there even with a group of 4 or 6 in about 1 hour. It is a fun place to take out of towners, go before a trip to the United Center or after an event at Old St. Patrick's church. We like everything---but our favorite is to build a combo plate of a few favorites like Moussaka and Gyros! The saganaki is dramatic but I don't particularly like it--is worth it for dinner guests though.
