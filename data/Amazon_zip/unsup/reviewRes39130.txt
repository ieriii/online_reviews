I've been coming here for years. I usually come with a group of 6+. Once I brought my brother and didn't realize that the smoke from the grill would upset his mild asthma like it did. Oops! Anyway, this place is awesome. You grill your own pre-seasoned meat, you receive 100 different sides, and you have the option of making lettuce wraps. I love that! I've never been disappointed with my food or experience at San Soo Gab San. Its not fancy, but you can come here and get a lot of food and MANY drinks for a decent price. Its a favorite of mine for celebrations.
