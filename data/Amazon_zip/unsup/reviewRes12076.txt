Disappoining. I have been to Cafe 28 for the brunch, and it was good, had good music, too. All the meat dishes were way overcooked. I was researching Cuban restaurants with an outdoor patio. it was a gorgeous day and I was determined to sit outside. I made a reservation for 6 people that morning and requested the outdoor patio. When we arrived, no reservation was on the books. In addition, the patio was not available because there was construction being done. the "outdoor patio" consisted of a bunch of Costco lawn chairs with no other decor. It did not look very appealing. I should have gone elsewhere
