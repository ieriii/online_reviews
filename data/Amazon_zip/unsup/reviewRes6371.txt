I can never get enough of good food a Wildfire, dined last night and tried the steak salad. It was delicous and well worth $14 bucks. The restaurant is a part of Lettuce Entertain You Group, so I take advantage of that. I love the goat cheese, french onion soup, caesar salad, everything. Reservations is always a good idea, even if the party is only for two. Enjoy.
