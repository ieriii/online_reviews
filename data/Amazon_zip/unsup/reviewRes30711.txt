You'd have to be a father fucking idiot to not love this place. the food is AMAZING. I've never eaten anything there that i haven't fully enjoyed. some of the highlights include the vegan biscuits, the gyros, and of course the raw cheesecake. I would eat there every meal if i weren't to socially awkward to do that. The back patio can't be beat in the summer and there's nothing better than an adjacent parking lot to make driving there stress-less. The only problems i encounter are that i can never decide what i want to eat. Being vegan for the past year and having other various eating restrictions for the past several years before, i'm used to having 1-3 options on any given menu. The decision is usually salad, french fries or pasta. But here, i can eat almost anything and it is overwhelming every time. also, the hot cider is perfect. oh, wait, once i had this stir-fry over noodle thing... it was awful. don;t get that.
