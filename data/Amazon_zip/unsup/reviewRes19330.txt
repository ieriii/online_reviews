I'm going to hell for writing this*, but... screw breakfast burritos. Give me an egg and chorizo torta, instead! Though the various breakfast items that I saw looked desirable, the only one that really called out to me was the breakfast torta with fluffy eggs and spicy chorizo served on light, crisp grilled bread with a side of delightful salsa verde. For under $10, this is at -least- as much start-your-day satisfaction as you'd get from any number of breakfast burritos in San Francisco. Believe me, I'd know: http://bit.ly/FiDiSoMaBB --------- * Okay, so we all knew I was going to hell, anyway. But at least I'm taking the scenic route!
