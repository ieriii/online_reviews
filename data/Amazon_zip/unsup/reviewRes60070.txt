My cousin and I went here on Tuesday for fried chicken night. There are a lot of great places to eat in Chicago, but this was the best all around restaurant experience I've had in a long time. The service was outstanding, it made the night to be treated so well. Our waitress was extremely polite but not overbearing. When I had a question about the wine she enthusiastically got an answer for me, which made me feel great about the second glass. The busser was also wonderfully attentive yet non-instrusive. They just made us feel good and quietly helped us enjoy the meal and the night out.They give you these delicious corn muffins with honey butter instead of bread. Our grandmother will send back anything that doesn't come out hot enough to scald your tongue, and the food came so out piping hot and fresh that even Grandy would've been pleased. My cousin got the fried chicken, i had the crawfish appetizer and tomato soup with bacon. Everything was tasty town.And to top it off, the atmosphere is great. It's simple and well lit but there are touches of elegance like the high backed chairs with nice soft removable cusions (you can actually wash those, so everything was really clean) that set the place apart. Big Jones is a find, get at it.
