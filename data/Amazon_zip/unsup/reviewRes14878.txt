Before going to Sabatino's I read most of the yelp reviews. The terms "old school", "dated", and "kitschy" seemed to stick out. More importantly though, nearly everyone seemed to love the food & raved about both the quantity & quality. I work nearby & had received a gift certificate from a few co-workers.  My wife & I arrived at 6:30 to find a packed restaurant. (If you're going on a Saturday, make a reservation.) Old school, dated & kitschy perfectly described what we saw. A little old lady politely took our coats, we were seated in the corner of a more than crowded dinning room & we waited with much anticipation for the menu. While the decor & crowd weren't quite our norm, we were really looking forward to some good "standard" Italian-American grub.  The service was slow, but tolerable. The portions were huge & included soup, salad, bread & pizza bread. We ordered gnocchi with meat sauce & the grouper - one of the evening's specials. The meat sauce was barely better than the Chef Boy-ar-dee that I choked down as a kid. The grouper wasn't bad, but there was little special about it. The fish itself was well cooked, but was too heavily flavored with garlic. The roasted pine nuts scattered over the fish were a nice addition.  The wait staff did a good job. They were a bit slow but generally kept beverages filled & kept a steady flow of plates on the table. We noticed that when the waitress asked questions like, "are you enjoying your meal," she never stayed around to hear the answer. We looked up to answer and she was already snaking her way across the crowded room. In the end, I left disappointed. I wanted to enjoy the meal. I wanted to leave thinking "that was a quirkly place but the food was great." But, I just didn't. Honestly, it was a half step above Olive Garden & only gets points from me for character. If you're looking for a good value, this might be the place. If you're looking for good food, I say keep looking.
