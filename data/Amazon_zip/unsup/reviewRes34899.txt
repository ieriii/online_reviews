I can't believe people say this is "the best falafel in the city." Are you kidding me right now? The falafel I had today was bland and dry. I had to pour various sauces all over my sandwich just to make it edible. The "tabuli salad" had literally no taste. NO TASTE. The two stars say it all. "I've experienced better." And MUCH better at that. Yes, it's cheap. That's a plus. But you certainly get what you pay for. Food aside, the service is super shitty. I don't know if the guys are stoned out of their minds or just really really bored, but they're certainly not interested in working. I went in here after watching Check Please thinking I was going to get something at least close to "the best falafel in the city," but I ended up with what seemed to be the worst. Because of the mass amounts of good reviews, I'm going to assume this was just an off day and try it again sometime. Maybe I'll go with a different sandwich and the lentil soup everyone raves about? Hopefully, I'll have a better experience, but until then I'm sticking to, well, any OTHER place that serves falafel. Oh, and being a cash only restaurant is just irritating. You can tell by the faces of the people in line at the ATM (being charged a fee) AFTER they've already ordered their food. If you're going to be cash only, at least try to advertise it a bit better.
