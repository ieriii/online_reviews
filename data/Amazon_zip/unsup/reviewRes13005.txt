Tried it on a Friday night wasn't very crowed seating was pretty quick. The waitress was pleasant and very knowledgeable about restaurant, The salad bar was excellent w/plenty of options. Meats especially the beef, were tasty, chicken and pork kind of dry. My group liked our meat cook med/well, which the waiter and gauchos made sure that's what we got. Setting, atmosphere and Overall experience was good.
