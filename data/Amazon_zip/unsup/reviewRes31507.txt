I would give them 500 stars if I could! I have loved the Chicago Diner since 2000. On a Sunday, July 3rd trip back to Chicago, we found parking in the parking lot and got a booth without having to wait, and received the most thorough and friendliest service from our incredibly enthusiastic waiter, who really knew his soy cheese and the details of everything on the menu. I was in heaven with the vegan huevos ala mexicana and my fiance really enjoyed down home egg-biscuit sammy. It was a perfect dining experience. I cannot think of one thing they could have done to have made it better!
