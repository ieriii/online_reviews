After two weeks of calls (the answering machine is routinely full) my girlfriend was able to get us a reservation for the night of my birthday. She spent the day selecting and then decanting three wines. Our reservation was for 5:30 p.m on a Friday.  At 4:40 or so the phone rings and it is Schwa. Like so many other people who have posted here, we were simply told that the Chef would not open that evening.  We are in shock.  They promise to call on Saturday to find another time for us to come in. They do not call. Never did. While others seem content with this behavior (Chef apparently does this on a regular basis) I think it is terrible. No one would put up with a band that cancelled concerts at the last minute -- and without explanation. Perhaps Chef is an artist -- but he seems to overlook one of the most important rules in life -- you need to show up.
