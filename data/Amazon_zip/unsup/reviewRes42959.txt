Nice lounge restaurant.. Our waiter was good and talkative. The host not so bright, we had to tell him that OUR table was ready. I had the rib eye which was for a limited time only ala carte. Rib eye was amazing! Also sampled pastas, chicken, and fries, all were cooked perfect and flavor was very good. All around great experience would definitively go back again.
