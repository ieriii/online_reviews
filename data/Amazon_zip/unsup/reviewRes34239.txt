This is one of my favorite restaurants in the world for two reasons: quality and consistency. I've eaten here at least a dozen times and had take out a half dozen more, and I've never had a bad meal despite trying virtually everything on the menu -- and that is really saying something.  I've eaten at almost every 4-star/5-star italian restaurant in Chicago and this one (the original - haven't been to the other locations) is my favorite. One caveat. The downstairs of the restaurant is admittedly VERY loud. Just ask for a table upstairs if you want to avoid the din.
