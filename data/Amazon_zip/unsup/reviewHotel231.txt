My wife and I live in Chicago and we were looking for a 'get-away' in the city for a night for her birthday. After playing roulette with Hotwire and receiving Hotel Indigo as the inexpensive boutique hotel in the Gold Coast area, I have to be honest and say that I was little disappointed based on the photos. It seemed like it was a little out-dated/tacky for our taste, but we made it do. When we arrived at the hotel, everyone was extremely friendly and they even went above and beyond by adding a little romantic touch to our room when we arrived late at night.  If you're looking for a good/clean inexpensive place to stay and you can look past some of the 'disney-esque' decor, then I would definitely recommend this place for you...Just don't use the parking garage next door- it's valet only, overpriced and they only have two men working on weekend so we waited over half an hour for our car.
