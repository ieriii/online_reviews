Went for a Friday afternoon lunch with a friend...made reservations for 11:30 and walked in with a feeling of dread. There was NO ONE THERE...except the wait staff and a way too eager host. Thirty minutes later, it was packed...and for good reason. Gorgeous room (have always loved subway tile), lots of wood and a great back bar. Service was outstanding, food good not great. We were in a back room which helped with the noise but I could tell it was different in the bar as we walked through to leave (much later). The two tops by the bar were VERY close together and I think my experience might have been different if I was packed in there. Great addition to the Loop area...not much to rival its charming atmosphere and attentive service. Absolutely going back...think it would be a great winter spot on a cold, blustery day.
