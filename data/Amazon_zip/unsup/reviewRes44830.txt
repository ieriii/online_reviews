Tucked away in the Aon building area, I visit this, my "home base" Giordano's, once a week (or order in) for stuffed pizza (half mushroom, half sausage) and a Chopped Salad. Yum. Go easy on the dressing that comes with the chopped salad: it's FIERCELY vinegar-y. This place can get reaallly crowded...probably tourists staying at nearby hotels. Only reason for no 5 stars? We've experienced some snarkiness on the part of the staff here...
