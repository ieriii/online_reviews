I loved this place!! It is better hotel in chicago. It is modren theme and furniture looks good and their staff is very friendly. My wife and and I stayed here for 3 days .The room we stayed was clean and comfortable . We amazed by the good custmer services by all male and female staff. The shopping area just steps away after you exit. The rooms were not cheap but given the proximity and convenience, it was fairly worth it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
