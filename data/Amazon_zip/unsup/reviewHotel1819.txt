This place is very nice! I loved my stay here and will use it again if I ever find a need. Finding the building is not difficult and there is plenty of parking around if you need it. Or if you're taking the L, there are many stops in the area to catch it. Checking in was easy and the staff was very nice and courteous. As I took the elevator up to the room, the walls had a almost trippy 3D effect that was cool.  The room was very trendy and very clean. The room was fairly small but adequate for only needing to sleep and leave belongings there. For those who travel for business, this room would work well since there is a desk with any and every kind of connection you would need to work or charge an kind of tech piece. The linens in the room were white and the decor was well done. My absolute favorite part of staying here was the bed and pillows. So soft! You kind of just sink in to a cloud. Very comfortable and relaxing. I want those pillows! The next morning I went down to the lobby to ask the concierge about a breakfast spot I had heard about, and she was very helpful and gave a great recommendation.  Overall I really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to any of my friends.
