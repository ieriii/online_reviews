One of my favorite sushi places in the city, despite the fact that they only serve maki. But, the fish is very, very fresh and while there's a limited selection that means pretty much anything you get will be of very high quality. I've never been disappointed. The prices are almost shockingly low considering the quality, and since it's BYOB you save on drinks as well. The atmosphere is nice...not too hip but pretty much perfect for what it is.
