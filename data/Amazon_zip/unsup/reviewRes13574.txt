Dearest Glenn's Diner! Your presence in my life has been a joy since you opened. First, I was overjoyed to have a place I could walk to that would serve a delicious brunch and coffee. Next, I was thoroughly seduced by your chowder, which contains not only plump clams but healthy amounts of bacon! Finally, you made me yours forever with the Monday night fish specials. The Diablo Char! My life was incomplete before you! Now, I am of two minds in regard to your negative reviewers. In my first mind, I question their sanity. Are they actively looking to be displeased? Did they catch the kitchen or serving staff on a bad day? In my estimation, I have now been to Glenn's at least 50 times, and while perfection is not in the cards over that many visits, I have never been thoroughly disappointed in the service or the food. So in my second mind, I believe there is method in the haters, for as knowledge of Glenn's excellence spreads, the wait for tables grows. This is a SMALL PLACE with closely spaced tables. Perhaps the haters are trying to thin the crowd, in which case, BRAVO and keep on keepin' on! I, too, want Glenn's to be successful enough to stay for 50 years, but chill enough that I can get a table. To sum up: Great food, fun atmosphere, MINE YOU CAN'T HAVE GO AWAY.
