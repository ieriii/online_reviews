Oh, how horrible. Went last night at 9ish pm and was starving. Just a side note, I usually and have in the past always gone to De Pasada a couple storefronts down. Amazing food and owner is very nice. From what I know, La Pasadita and De Pasada are all somehow in the same family. Anyway, going to La Pasadita, against my better judgement, was disappointing. I realize they they were highly rated by NYTimes in November 2007, but I can't see how it was so. I even felt that I was cheating on De Pasada and it made me tepid with anticipation. Well, only when I got my food at La Pasadita, did my feelings turn into queasy stomach from the food. I ordered 3 veggie tacos and quac on the side. Well, first thing, the chips and pico was good, however, the green sauce was beyond horrible and the brown sauce was marginally better. The tacos lacked any flavor, and just tasted like mush that would be the result of being in the stomach broken down. No amount of horrible green sauce would have helped. I got home after and was incredibly thirsty... why? It wasn't because I had a glass of water there or the milk drink... no, it was because there was SO much salt in all the food. Felt as if I licked a Salt Block. Don't go here. Do yourself a favor and go to De Pasada on Ashland. You won't regret it.
