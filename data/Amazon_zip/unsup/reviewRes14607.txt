5 stars for food (same menu for 40 years), service (organization & timeliness), and nostalgia (same decor for 40 years).  Eating here is an event and when the Italian food is this tasty, it's worth the time and money (which is such a bargain) For a party of 4 on a Saturday night expect to be eating continually for over 2.5 hours. Place gets packed by 5:30pm so reservations are a must.  The steak is Prime, therefore it's the same cut, and just as flavorful as the best steakhouses in Chicago, except half the price.
