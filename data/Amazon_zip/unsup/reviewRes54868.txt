Incredible selection of some of the best beer around, great food, buzzing crowd and surly waitstaff--what more could you want in a neighborhood bar? A FEW TIPS OTHERS HAVE MISSED:-The 2nd floor dining room is a bit more secluded and suitable for conversation if you can get it.-If you're into beer, be sure to ask for the FULL menu, not the mini-menu that you get at the table. Well over one hundred beers...Belgians of course just waiting to be tried-Mussels are their specialty--get them in the Belgian beer sauce, and ask for extra bread-The lamb stew puts any other lamb stew in this city to shameRECOMMENDED BEERS (SOME OF MY FAVORITES)Draft_________________Leffe Blonde (as appetizer)Gouden Carolus (w/ entree)Our Beersel (for dessert)Bottles________________Atomium Premier Gran CruGulden Drak (warning: this is 10.5%! alcohol!)Orval Trappist AleWitkapLindemans Framboise (best dessert beer ever)I live in the neighborhood and love to take friends here.Enjoy...
