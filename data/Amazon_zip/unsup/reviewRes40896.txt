If you don't mind your pho with new neighbors, listening to 90s hip hop/techno mixes while you digest, and once in a while having to flag down some human interaction -- you will love this place! Banh xeo (the shrimp and pork belly crepe) is an obsession of mine. It is the delicious way I tell myself I'm sticking to my diet, even though I know there are carbs in the fried pancake. Oh well. I still think Tank does it best, and I've tried many of the others in the neighborhood. I still come back for Tank. When I have the room (or company) to branch out past my usual, I have found that everything else on the menu is excellent too. I would recommend the broken rice with pork chop, french cubed beef, spring rolls, sugar cane meatballs, and catfish in claypot . All scrumptious. As for atmosphere, all I have to say is: It's about the food people! Get it good and hot, eat it now, and get out of my seat! In the past few years, Tank has become a victim of the "Check, please!" syndrome, pulling in pinot grigios from downtown, but the food quality/authenticity has not suffered like other places have.
