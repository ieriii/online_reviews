Well I will tell you right off the bat I don't crave deep dish pizza... that being said we ordered the regular crust daily special. And... I didn't find it so special. It was typical with peperoni and peppers but not quite worth the cost. Plus the atmosphere... is non existent. No personality in the pizza and no ambiance.
