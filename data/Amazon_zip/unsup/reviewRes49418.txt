Fun, trendy, and tasty. The inside is hip and modern, with a small but varied menu, and a decent wine list.  My favorite? The cheese menu is fantastic - I'd go back just for that. Many to choose from; all of them good. You can create your own cheese flight, which is very fun.  The wait staff isn't snobby, but they are attentive and know their stuff. I'd definately go back. Drawbacks: very cold by the window and not my favorite location (right near Harry Carey's).  Oh, and during the week at least, it is not at all overrun by tourists. I've found it to be a great place for a lengthy dinner and lots of conversation.
