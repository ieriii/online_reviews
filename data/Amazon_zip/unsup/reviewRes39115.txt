This is probably the worst service I had for Korean BBQ.  I have been here in small groups and in larger groups. Lunch time, dInner time, and late night. Every single time, I had the same horrible service. The only reason why I keep coming back is because of friends' birthday dinners or late night cravings (since its open 24 hours). The waitresses all seem to hate their job, our glases of water were always empty, and it takes ages for them to give us menus, take orders, and bring our food.  Its not like they have to physically cook the meat.  The pre-seasoned meats were only mediocre, but the complimentary sides such as kimchi, potato salad, spicy radish, lettuce, etc. were a little bit tastier. Some of the side dishes have an acquire taste, but other dishes may suit you better. Just really depends on your taste buds' preference. If their service was going to be this bad, they should at least compensate it with better tasting food. You'll be more happy going somewhere else.
