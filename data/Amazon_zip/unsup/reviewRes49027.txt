This review is for how exceptionally well they handled a vegetarian when it was a pre fixe menu on one of the busiest nights of the year! I went to the Publican for New Year's Eve dinner with some friends. It was a pre fixe menu, which can be a scarey thought for a vegetarian! However, we told them when we made the reservation that there was a vegetarian in the group, and they were so accomodating! It was truly excellent. They made a vegetarian option for each course, and they were all delicious! The server was pleasant, welcoming, and acted like it was no problem at all to make everything completely vegetarian. She even asked whether a little anchovies in the pasta sauce were a problem, which they were, so they made me a separate (delicious!) creme fraiche sauce, completely vegetarian. All of the vegetarian dishes reflected the regular meaty dishes, which my friends said were excellent. The last course was a pork loin with white beans and kale, and the vegetarian option was a white bean and kale stew served over a slightly grilled piece of garlic french bread, The bread had a crisper exterior, but was soaked in the stew, pointing out a similar texture to that of the meat. Obviously, eating a stew with French bread is not eating a big chunk of pork, nor should it be. But the chef thought about particular characteristics of each dish, and made something tasty and totally within my dietary restrictions. The service was perfect, the food was delicious, they were awesome at handling fancy food for a vegetarian! If you are a vegetarian, or have any kind of dietary restriction, just let them know and they will handle it beautifully! It's so great to eat out at a nice restaurant and not be relegated to eating a salad or plain, steamed vegetables while everyone else gets great, well-thought out meals.
