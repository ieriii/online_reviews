I went with a friend of mine earlier this week and there was a big party just sitting down so the waitress kindly took our orders first so we could get our food in a timely manner. It was really considerate and ended up working out great. I had the Marrakesh Crepe with Salmon and really enjoyed it. The Algerian Coffee they served was really great also though I'd definitely suggest using cream even if you take your normal coffee black. This was a really interesting and tasty take on crepes.
