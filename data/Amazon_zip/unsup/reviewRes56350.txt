I simply love this place. Their owner is really friendly. Every time I walk in, he has a big smile on his face. I love their rousted duck sandwich. I am a Chinese. I am from China. I usually do not eat sandwiches in a Asian restaurant. However, I just love their sandwiches. I probably will try other flavors next time. If you live close by, this is a place you cannot miss. Their combination is great.
