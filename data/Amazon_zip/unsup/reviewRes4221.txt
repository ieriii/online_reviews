The service here is not the greatest but this bar has, in my opinion, the best Jazz in Chicago, and for it's upkeep in history, the bartender would have to be cussing me out in order to make me remove a star. (Which, he came close to for the poor crazy man next to me.)  Al Capone was a co-owner of this bar and the glamour, flapper atmosphere here is of no comparison to any bar that I have ever been to. Bathrooms here are not consistent with the glamourous preserved (and somewhat restored) interior, but the live music here is what makes this place so wonderful.  Service in here....wish it was better still.
