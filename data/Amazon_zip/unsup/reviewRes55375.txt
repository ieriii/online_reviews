So I came here thinking this place would be amazing.............and it was so so. I ordered the kabobs............and I was kinda disappointed it didn't actually come on kabobs. I mean it was pretty good (I think they have better Persian food in Andersonville, but maybe that's just me) The waitress was nice and knowledgeable but besides that, it wasn't an amazing dining experience. Food was decent but that's about it. The worst part was about 5 minutes after getting dessert, we got our bill and were more or less asked to leave once we finished dessert since they needed the table. I wasn't even halfway done with my coffee before we were ushered out of the store. So yeah, not the best place to eat in Albany Park, if you're in the mood for Middle Eastern fare, there are tons of other choices in Albany Park.
