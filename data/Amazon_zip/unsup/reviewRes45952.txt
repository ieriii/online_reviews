A reliable place on Michigan Ave. after a full day of shopping or watching a movie. The decor is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory (gee...it's owned by the same company). Colorful swirls and whimsical designs are littered across the walls. Try to get the rotunda room. It's a circular room, a bit smaller than the main room, so you have a bit more quiet space for you and your guests. Also, if you have a seat near the window, you have a great view of the Mag Mile. The menu is similar to the Cheesecake Factory as well. I enjoy the grilled pork chop. It's not too sweet, but very savory. The pork chop is tender and the mashed sweet potato is perfect with it! The food is satisfactory. But the real gems lie in the dessert menu. The New Orleans Beignets (though not as good as those in New Orleans) are delicious. I like to dip them in the raspberry and chocolate sauce. The food portions are generous, so the price tag is pretty decent. It's a good place to relax and dine.
