somewhere behind this tiny storefront on broadway, there must be an enormous coop of 4 feet tall chickens. it must be some korean grandmother's job to feed the chickens corn and protein powder -- every hour on the hour. honestly, i can think of no other feasible explanation as to how the chicken wings get so large.  the wings are easily twice as big as average -- plus, they aren't breaded so the size isn't deceiving! the seoul sassy sauce is really key though. i paced the consumption of my chicken as to absorb every last bit of the sauce in, on, and around the general vicinity of the tray.  great neighborhood place, will definitely try to be back.
