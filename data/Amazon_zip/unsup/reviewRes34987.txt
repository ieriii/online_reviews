Wow, this place gets really packed!! Even on a Thursday night. Is it all tourists? Anyways, I came here for oysters, some delicious seafood and a few strong drinks and they delivered! The oysters were fresh and salty, my haddock was moist and cooked perfectly and my vodka sodas were strong and to the point! I'm really looking forward to coming here and trying the brunch!
