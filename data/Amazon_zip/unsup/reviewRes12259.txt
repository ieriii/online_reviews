The pizza here is outrageously good, as are the beers. I could rave and rave about their pizza here. The small is enough for two people, really, but I ordered one just for myself, knowing I'd have half to take home. I literally could not stop eating the pizza because it was so good. The atmosphere was not really my type... Very smooshed together and cramped. Aside from the seating arrangements not being ideal, I'll definitely be back soon for some more delicious pizza!
