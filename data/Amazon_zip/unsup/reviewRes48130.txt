Love this place. You name it, order it here. The service was superb (although we had a reservation for 8pm and weren't seated until 30 mins later...).. the waitress does a great job of explaining the menu and their pacing style. Pork Belly entree - fabulous, the grits didn't over power and added just a the nice light touch needed for this dish. Desserts - you can't go wrong, innovative and fun to eat Drinks - bourbon beer? yes please, nice selection of both beer/wine. would love to see more specialty drinks on the menu next time though!
