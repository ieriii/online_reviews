I like the falafel i had here and the vegan cookie i had was really good.The sandwich was alright. But if u like the falafel here u shoud try the falafel at Cous Cous on taylor st, its better. At least to my opinion. I had the sanwiches at CousCous before i went here so although Sultans sandwiches were good, but COusCOus was better, and cheaper.
