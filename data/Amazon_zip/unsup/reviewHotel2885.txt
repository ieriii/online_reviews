I would not recommend STAYING at the Sheraton. First, it's not that close to Michigan Avenue and points of interest. I would say it's kind of confusing to find since there is an upper and lower street level. I waited 15 minutes to get service to check in. The lobby is nice but once we got to our room... it was definetely not FOUR STARS. I would say it was more like a lower 3 star hotel hotel. The bed was lumpy before anybody slept in it. The room was tiny... the bathroom was tiny. I pressed the wake up call button to arrange for one.. NOBODY picked up. I'm sorry.. this is not the characteristics of four star treatment. Besides the nice lobby.. I wouldn't want to come here again.
