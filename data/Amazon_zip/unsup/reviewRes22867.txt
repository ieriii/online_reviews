There are a lot of great reviews on this place so I was anxious to try it based on my fellow Yelpers. We opted for take out on a Sunday night. I was told 30 - 40 minutes. I arrived in 44 minutes and was told it would be another 15. I ordered off of their website menu and figured my food to be $30. pre tax. The cashier who did not speak English very well rang up $39.25 with tax. That was a good $5. more than I expected. When paying for my food a patron came up (very upset) asking where his table's food was. He proclaimed that they ordered their food 1-1/2 hours ago. I got my food and left fast as it looked like he was about to make a scene. The food was good but not as good as I hoped based on the reviews I was reading. I considered it overpriced as well.
