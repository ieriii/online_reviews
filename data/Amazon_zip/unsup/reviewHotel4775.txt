I primarily book a room at the Palmer for their exquisite lobby. It is simply a beautiful place to enjoy a few cocktails, particularly during the holiday season. I could care less however, for the standard guest rooms. They are unbelievably small, and often a room will be booked facing the building next door. The water pressure belonging to the sink and shower head are unusually low (which truly is not a bad thing environmentally as less water is exerted, however, I shared a room with someone that was really irritated by this.)
