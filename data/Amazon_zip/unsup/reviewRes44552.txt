I don't know what I would do without Alliance's savory croissants for breakfast. I can't decide if I prefer the turkey and swiss or the ham and cheddar, but both boast perfectly flaky croissants topped with perfectly browned cheese. Delish!  The pastries are moist and tasty, and dangerous! I lay awake at night thinking of the mini carrot cake--so good.  The bakery itself can be crowded (and staff overwhelmed) at peak hours, but most of the time they wait is short and service pleasant. The bakery annex next door is a great place to settle into a couch and read or work, and the sidewalk seating is perfect for people watching in good weather.
