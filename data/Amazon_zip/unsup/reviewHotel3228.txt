Our second stay at the Hard Rock. We enjoy the historic building and perfect location on Michigan Ave at the River. Close to the action. The hotel design is understated and not Theme Park-Like (as their restaurants). Rooms, clean, contemporary and well appointed. Kind of strange to have Yoko Ono and John Lennon staring at you from over the loo. Staff is polite, effiecient. I enjoyed a drink at the bar before going out. Again, the environment is nice. Check out each floor. The have one Rocker's memorabilia displayed simply at each elevator lobby. Both times we enjoyed our views from the room. Tips: A perfect spot to The first time we stayed, we were able to find a "package deal" this time we were able to get a discount online, check Yelp, Hotwire or http://Hotels.com. AAA or AARP (if your over 50). The web site states you get free wi-fi if you book direct on the Hard Rock Hotel web site (normally $14/day). We did not book directly online because we were ale to get a better deal by searching. Try to get on a higher floor For the views - the city noises are audible (well at least the emergency vehicle sirens are). After settling in, we decided to park our car at the Millennium or Grant Street Garages for $29/day VS Hard Rock's $46/day. Pay attention to your phone messages, you may get an announcement of live music at the bar.
