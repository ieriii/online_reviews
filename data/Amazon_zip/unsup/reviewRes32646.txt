Dined at Demera for the first time last night (5/17) after passing by it on Broadway many times. There were a few tables seated at 9p on a Tuesday, but that might be due to their Groupon expiring next week. My roommate and I were starving and it took a little bit of time to get a waitress, but nothing ridiculous or rude. Ordered some Ethiopian beers which were pretty good and decided on the Demera platter b/c we wanted beef, lamb, and vegetables. The dishes came on one big platter and there was a naan-like bread served with it. Awesomely, there was no silverware to be found. You tear off some bread, wrap it around one of the meats, and just shove it in your face. It's caveman cool. I can't say I knew which dishes were which, but all were delicious. My favorite was the cubes of lamb that were served crispy with some peppers and onions. We barely knocked out the entire platter (we're both 200+ lb. guys) and didn't have room for dessert. Price is very fair for all of the food, since we could've added a third on our platter without leaving hungry. The service was great after the slow start and she gave us a free beer to make sure we liked it (we did). I'd go back anytime.
