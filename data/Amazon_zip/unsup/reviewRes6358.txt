Wildfire: I've eaten here several times and have been very underwhelmed. The last time we walked out before being served. The noise factor and open lay out of the restaurant makes for a very uncomfortable dining atmosphere. The food is average to OK. I get a very strong corporate-organization vibe. There are better places to eat in Chicago, places where the owners are in the restaurant and the servers are not trained through "corporate team-building" excercises.
