I ordered a cheddar burger and clam cowder from Shaw's as i have before. I thought the burger was unusally tough but discovered they had melted the cheese on the burger without removing its wrapping/backing first. I hope the 40% of this burger/wrapping i injested passing through me without making me ill. The delivery service informed Shaw's manager, who offered to redo the order for free and not charge me for this crap, but even though i asked the delivery service to have Shaw's to call me, no one has nor to my knowledge did they apologize. Check your food throughly if you order from here
