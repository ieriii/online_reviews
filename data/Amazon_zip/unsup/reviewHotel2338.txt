The Marriott is OK but pales in comparison to the numerous hotels in the area that are frankly better. The lobby fills up with people, probably because the rooms are so average in size and quality. The revolving door along Michigan Avenue is automatic, but turns slowly so there is always the desire to push it along (not a good idea). The location of the hotel along Michigan Avenue is good, and the Kinko's on the second floor is not as busy as other locations in the city.
