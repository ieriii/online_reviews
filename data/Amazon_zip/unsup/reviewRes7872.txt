What should have been a leisurely Thursday afternoon lunch quickly turned to an unmitigated disaster. While the appetizers were fine, the pizza came out right after and was WAY too soggy. When telling the waiter our complaint he spoke over me and was extremely rude. Instead of hearing our complaint he said "Let me educate you." and then went on to tell me that it was my fault I did not like the pizza and was unwilling to attempt to fix my issues. Bad food and even poorer service makes this pick a mistake for any occasion.
