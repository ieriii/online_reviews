Spacca Napoli crafts the best pizza in the City of Chicago, hands down. My wife and I went there and enjoyed both a margherita and a marinara (no cheese) pizza. We each had a glass of the house red and finished with a complimentary glass of dessert wine - don't you love it when you get something on the house unexpectedly? These pizzas were heaven. Now, I love pizza, and have tried a lot of other famous Chicago establishments including Great Lake. This is undeniably the best. Not to mention the awesome original art produced by one of the owners that graces the walls!
