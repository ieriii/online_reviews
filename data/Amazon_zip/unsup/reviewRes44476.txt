I really like sushi and on top of really liking sushi I like trying new places. The best part about this place is that it has good sushi, good ambiance and BYOB, although there is a $5 dollar corkage fee. I have little to complain about this place, each time I have been there has been a wait and they dont take reservations but has a little hang out room. If you want to try a new sushi place without having a big group- highly recommend.
