Cappuccino and pellegrino. Friday afternoon in the sun. Alliance is that classic portrait of the pastry shop of yesteryear. It's the neighborhood bakery. Friendly faces serve you treats and intelligensia coffee. And designer cakes too in a showcase window. A certain sense of nostalgia. Find yourself patio side, sitting back sipping and nibbling; observing the walks of life go by- scurrying about, to and fro, there they go a' commuting. People watchers' paradise and fine treats too. Stop by.
