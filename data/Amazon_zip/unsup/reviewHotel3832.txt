So I had high hopes for this hotel, and am only giving it three stars because I paid full price for a tiny room, and they couldn't switch it because the hotel was full. I didn't bother to ask for another room the other three nights I was staying there because I didn't want to pack up my things just to unpack them again. The most irritating things was having to use my room key to GO UP and DOWN the elevator. YUP, in case of emergency, don't use the elevator, because it won't go anywhere without a room key. This was always the talk on the elevator with someone, and an annoyance during my stay there. The location is good, very close to two Starbucks and one block away from Whole Foods. The staff is great, always good-looking, friendly and helpful. I didn't experience much noise, but that was probably because my room was on the end of the hall. Overall I couldn't sink into feeling comfortable here. Maybe it was something about the overly-mod decor, the layout of the lobby, or the concrete ceilings. I did enjoy using the ipod doc/player a lot. I would recommend it to people who are night owls, want to party,, meet other singles, and who don't mind keying up and down the elevator.
