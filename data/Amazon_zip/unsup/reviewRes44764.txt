I love me some Chicago. I and was determined to fall in love with the Chicago food staple - the deepdish pizza - so trying Giordano's was a must. I really wish I could give this place more stars, but here are the reasons for docking of two stars: 1) Took forever. We were seated promptly, but we didn't get our drinks for the longest time. Deepdish pizza naturally takes a long time to make, but the wait was almost unbearable considering we were starving. Good thing we ordered some fries to tie us down during the 45 minute wait. 2) We settled for this place instead of Gino's East. We were a bit a way from that place and was too lazy and too hungry to go there. Perhaps we should have. The thought "maybe Gino's is better" lingering in the back of your mind keeps your from fully enjoying the food set before you. The pizza itself wasn't bad. But it didn't exactly bring tears to my eyes when I sunk my teeth into the colossal piece of pie. I will definitely give Chicago deepdish another try next time, perhaps at another place, though.
