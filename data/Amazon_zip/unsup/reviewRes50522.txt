Big Jones is the type of place which I would go for a special brunch occasion. The creole/cajun Louisiana style comfort food should be enjoyed and experienced in moderation. We walked into the country farm style little nook and were immediately greeted by one of the owners. He admitted that although he did not know much about the style of food prior to establishing the restaurant, they did a lot of research and traveling to nail it on the head. We were seated without a wait, and received a plate of complimentary beignets. (had reservations) They were soft, moist, fluffy, warm and dusted in powder sugar. Amazing. Remembering it was a special occassion, it was time to indulge. We ordered a plate of sweet potato biscuits with housemade passion fruit jam, crab cakes, hominy soup with homemade choriz, cheesy grits and much much more. I have never been to New Orleans, or experienced this type of food before. So I can not tell you if it resembles the true recipes. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be as fatty as much of the offerings we received. The omelette was stuffed to the rim with cheese. The grits eventually cooled down, and thickened and solidified. The home made andouille sausage was outstanding, as was everything else. However, most people would go just for the food, I would come back just for the amazing service.
