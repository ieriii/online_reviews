I have lived about 3 blocks from here for 2 years now and always wanted to go. Every time we walk by there is a line out the door. I knew it would be a long wait so I told my wife to start getting ready and I walked on over to wait. When I went in they said it would be 1.5 hr wait. No problem I just propped up at the bar and started sucking down the Margaritas(REALLY GOOD). My wife arrived about 30 minutes and 4 Margaritas later and we still had no table so we decided to just eat at the bar. Great Idea as the bar staff was very nice and quick to get you everything.  We started out with the guacamole which comes with 2 types of salsas on the side as well. All 3 were perfect and I couldnt ask for better. Then, we ordered 3 items off the light menu (kind of like Mexican tappas) and 1 item off the regular menu. We got the Cerviche, duck carnitas, and chicken taquitos. The large item I got was the carne asada. Everything was very good and came out farely quick. As we were paying our bill they were wrapping up my 1/3 carne asada that was left and the bartender dropped it on the ground by accident. He had the kitchen make me a whole brand new one. I couldnt believe it I told him not to worry about it but he wasnt having it. I have been to every Nice Restaurant in Chicago, and the service and atmosphere here rivals them all. If there was a place to put 10 stars it would have it. This place is dangerously close to my house and I will be back often.
