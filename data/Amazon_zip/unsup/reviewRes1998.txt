Truly "encased meats" has been added to a list of my favorite words thanks to Hot Doug's. Wow! Between the exotic animals going into the sausages and Friday's duck fat cooked fries. Wow! Holy Shit! Hot Doug's you have won my ever enlarging arteries over. By all means Do go here, Do experiment, and you will not be disappointed. Unless of course you suck. In which case your goddamn opinion doesn't matter anyways! P.S. don't be discouraged by the line around the block, it's a tiny lil' joint with not much seating. But tough it out, seriously, it's worth it!
