When Buttercup and I moved into our nearby corporate housing at the top of the year, Bin 36 was our first official meal as Chicago residents. The staff was welcoming and the food & drink perfect after a long day of unpacking boxes, and we've been back MANY times since, lately coming down from Lakeview at least once a month. At Bin 36, you'll find a dozen or so reasonably priced wine flights, and a smallish but well-selected menu of apps and meals to go with them. (The parmesan cheese gougeres with truffle honey are a personal favorite.) They also do some fantastic cheese boards & charcuterie. Wines and food rotate regularly, so even regulars like us find something new on each visit. Also, wines are available for purchase, and Bin 36 does a great job of locating value-for-the-money wines in the $15-$20 range. It's also a great place to take visitors, especially those who are staying nearby. It's a nice escape from the Hubbard Street high-fivin' hair-gel-usin' scene, and you can actually hear the person next to you talk without yelling. Conversation is good. One of our favorite places in the city. Ask for Chris or Michele. They're fantastic.
