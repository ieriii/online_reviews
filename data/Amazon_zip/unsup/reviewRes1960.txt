This one is long overdue, seeing as I went back in September, but nonetheless - I still have to say this place is amazing. We waited for almost an hour and a half, and I can't say it wasn't worth it. Duck fat fries + 2 of the best hot dogs I have ever eaten. No lie. So good. You don't know the possibilities and potential of hot dog's until you go to Hot Doug's. And the kicker, Doug serves every customer, as probably the happiest guy you'll ever meet. Worth the trip & the wait.
