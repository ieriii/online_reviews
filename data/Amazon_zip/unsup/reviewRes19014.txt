Um, yum. Talk about layered flavors and one-of-a-kind menu choices. Fresh, clean, tasty. This dine-in or carry-out shop seats 40 and the lines are almost always long. For a good reason. They get it right. I had the Milanesa: crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. ($9) Thoughts: The torta bread was pretty crusty & heavy for a torta, but the fillings made up for that. The only other thing I noticed was that the crispy chicken was a bit too crispy - the outside layer almost reminded me of what the breading is like on breaded pork tenderloin. (But, the meat was still light and fresh.) You kind of have to take aggressive bites if that makes any sense. Ha. Everything on there was delicious! I did have a churro, too. Someone slap me because I've never been a huge fan of churros... but it was definitely tasty, sweet, crispy. All in all, my meal was delicious and unique. The green salsa served with my dish was the BEST I've ever had.  If I go back I'll be sure to try their guac and some carnitas. Mm-mm.
