This place is amazing and highly recommend.We wanted a night we could remember but not with the attitude. It was my fiancs 30th B-Day, they guys don't care but others... We went on a Friday night, the crowd was diverse and lively. Our initial seats were in the main dining area, a two seat booth. This was to close to comfort to our neighbors and asked to be moved to the bar tables that looked over the main dining room; smartest decision ever made by this guy. We ordered some cocktails from an extremely friendly Indian waitress that complemented my fianc. We ordered the chefs suggestions with wine pairing and the red carpet treatment never stopped.By the time of the final pairing we couldn't eat any more. Our wonderful waitress (I wish that I could remember her name) boxes everything with a smile.
