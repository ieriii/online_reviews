I don't know how I lived in Bucktown for the past three years and never ventured into Coast, but I am so glad I finally made it! Yummy sushi, not too expensive (for sushi) and a great atmosphere. Me and a girlfriend split the fancier rainbow roll, a crunchy tuna, and a spider roll. All were well made and fresh tasting. I especially liked the seaweed salad. Only downsides were that we got seated at a bad table and a waiter completely doused us in champagne when a popped bottle went array. To his credit, he apologized and offered free dessert. Recommended.
