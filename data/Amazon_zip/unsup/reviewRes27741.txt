We did the tasting menu paired with "wine, beer and spirits" at Graham Elliot. It was phenomenal! They were able to accommodate the husband's hatred of fish (subbed the halibut with chicken) and my nut allergy (subbed the chocolate almond dessert with a strawberry one). At the end of the meal, they presented us with two printed menus stating what we had that evening, even accounting for our substitutions and thus new drink pairings. After we paid the check, our server asked if we wanted a tour of the kitchen. Hells yes! This was the coolest moment I have ever had in a restaurant, the kitchen was amazing and they were rocking to "Forever Your Girl" by Paula Abdul. The staff was all super friendly, this was such a treat for me. I cannot wait for our next trip back to Chicago to go again, Graham Elliot Bowles is a genius (and has the coolest glasses!)
