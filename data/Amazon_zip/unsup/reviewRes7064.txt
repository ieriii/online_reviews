I've been twice and am just going to say it. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. So far, I've had the pulled pork and the kobe sliced brisket. Both were flat out awesome. The spicy BBQ sauce is my preference. Just enough spice. The service here is why this place earns five stars. Because, despite the affordable prices for dinner, the service is more reflective of a $100 a plate type place. Finally, this place has a fantastic assortment of bourbon, and makes a mean mint julep. You could just come for drinks and leave happy, but you'd be robbing yourself of the opportunity to try some truly great food. I plan on going back as many times as possible before the the rest of the Gold Coast discovers it.
