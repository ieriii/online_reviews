I'd been starving for sushi for a while now so a group of my friends met up at Coast about a month ago. We BYOB.  The atmosphere at Coast is very hip and modern. The clientle were good-looking. The noise level is pretty high, so you will have to shout if you're at the other end of the table. The tables are very close together so expect some chair banging as you dine. We ordered a lot of rolls and nigiri pieces. I can't remember all the rolls we ordered. Everything was pretty delicious.  We ordered a Gomae appetiizer and it came out in a small piece looking like a piece from a roll. I've had better gomae at other places and much more for the money. The salmon nigiri pieces were fresh and delicious. I wanted an oyster shooter, but they don't serve that at Coast. Bummer! There were 6 of us and we got out of there for $35 per person. Not bad considering the quality of sushi and the amount that we ordered. I like Coast. I think their sushi is good, deserving of 3.5 stars, but since I can't do 3.5, I'll give it 4 stars.
