Mayan Palace is a great little place! Good solid Mexican food at affordable prices. (Almost as affordable as places like Taco Burrito House but WAY tastier-although not that TB House isn't appreciated a 3am!) The atmosphere is adorable, the tiny storefront really packs in the tables so its very cozy. Margaritas are great! The service is absolutely phenomenal! I was shocked at how friendly and attentive all the staff was! Like Rebecca T. says below, you really feel like family!
