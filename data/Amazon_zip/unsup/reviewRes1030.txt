Your best bet is to go mid-week (summer is busiest) after the lunch rush. I went at 2 p.m. on a Monday and the line was only about 40-45 people -- I say that, too, without a crumb of irony. It's busy, folks. Why? It's good, really good. All good restaurants are, by definition, overrated, so why even have that conversation? It's tasty, fun and worth going with friends and people visiting from out of town. They will take pictures of the wall and walk away happy. Everyone wins. And Doug is a nice guy and will engage you in conversation when he's not super slammed, so chat him up briefly. Out-of-the-way place (unless you live in Avondale for one reason or another), but it's quickly becoming a Chicago hub. Oh, and bring cash. They don't take credit cards, and now that I have gone about seven times, I am just starting to remember this fact.
