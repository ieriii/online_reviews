"There are no two finer words in the English language than 'encased meats,' my friend." I would wrestle a bear to have this place in my home town. Yes, the wait is long but I have never been more certain that it was worth it than the day I mustered the gumption to patiently wait 1.5 hours to achieve a glorious spread of four savory sausages and to be dumbfounded by delectable duck fat fries. I was in a sausage stupor for the remainder of the afternoon. We ordered the Sauternes Duck Sausage with Fois Gras mousse, the Spicy Smoked Alligator Sausage with Remoulade and Blue Cheese, Merguez Lamb Sausage with Harissa and Goat Cheese, and a simple Chicago dog named the Marty Allen. I wish I could describe the flavor of the duck sausage with fois but the flavor was so subtle and beautiful that any words I express here would just be an injustice to the Tour de Force that it is. When I think about that hour in which I was being sated by the glory that is Hot Doug's, I start to believe that memory will meld into my subconscious enjoyments the way the smell of my grandmother's house did or what it was like to make a fort out of sofa cushions as a child. Is this all hyperbole? You can't afford to doubt me and be wrong. Despite the last paragraph, I am not a generous person when it comes to restaurant reviews so I hope that this grand review conveys some inkling of the enjoyment I had eating here. On top of the food quality, the service was great. We waited in line for 1.5 hours to get to the counter and realize it was cash only. I repeat: Cash Only, so take heed. Even still, I quickly asked a server if there was an ATM I could run to and he said just put the order in and you can pay us after you eat. Awesome! What trust! They weren't even annoyed by this request! So if you even find yourself in the tri-state area and have a remote chance of going, you should. I don't think you could forgive yourself if you knew what you missed.
