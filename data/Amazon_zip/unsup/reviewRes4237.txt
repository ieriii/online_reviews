I think it's appropriate that my first Yelp review be at the first bar I went to, the day I turned 21 (which was yesterday). I went with 5 of my friends and got there around 7:45 and we were able to find a booth that could sit us surprisingly comfortably near the front entrance. The live band began playing around 8 o'clock and we were luck enough to have found a seat. (We could've sat closer to the stage, but we wanted to sit together). The music was great and only got better as the night progressed (whether that was from the alcohol or the band playing better, I can't tell you, although I'm pretty certain the band just got better and better). Everyone there was into the music and often times, I felt the urge to get up myself and just groove along, although I didn't, which I regret. But I digress. The drinks were well made, at least in my opinion. I haven't been able to try many cocktails other places, since this was my first bar I could legally get into. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Surprisingly, the drinks came out rather quickly despite the large crowd inside, and my friends and I definitely appreciated that. Overall, I could only think about how much I wanted to come here in the future, perhaps with a lucky girl, and sit closer to the stage. It's a great atmosphere, and I enjoyed myself very much.
