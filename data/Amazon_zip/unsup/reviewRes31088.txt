So, I was came to the beautiful city of Chicago to visit my sister and can't help but always anticipate new places I'm going to be grubbin at. I came here based on recommendations from my co-workers who came here during a business conference. They just raved and raved about how this place was the best culinary cuisine. So, I said "ok, I'll go see what this place is all about" and sure enough I wasn't disappointed. Dinner (more like sampling) The Beef Lollipops - were carnivore YUMMY. Mmm...I can still taste the sweet marinate on the meat. SO good!! And it's quite the popular dish because I saw a lot ppl ordering it. The Firecracker Sushi roll - Two thumbs up with a kick a spicy kick that is. The Escolar "the great white tuna" - it was good but $9 for two small pieces (?) I'll pass next time. Dessert Ridiculous - Yes, that's what it's called because it's really quite a unique carrot cake dessert filled with Ice Cream. This was my highlight of the evening. Calories on this bad boy - who CARES! It was sooo freakin good that it was worth taking a picture but I chowwed it down before I remembered to take it. LOL! The only con to this place is the prices for the small amount of food you get. I would recommend going for happy hour because a lot of their popular dishes are HALF the price. Ambience was cool! Very energetic and great people watching place.
