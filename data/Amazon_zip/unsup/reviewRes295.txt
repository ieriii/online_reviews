If I could give 10 stars, Alinea would get them all. Ate there two nights ago and am still completely awestruck. All other food seems like slop now. I"m completely ruined!!! Took pics and/or video of every course (lots of action on the plate there!). If you're interested, they're at http://picasaweb.google..
