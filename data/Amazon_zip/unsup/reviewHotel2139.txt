Went to Chicago and decided to try out the Intercontinental hotel in Chicago. We were updated to the Vice-Presidential Suite (nice!). The room was dated but impressive. The room was probably setup 15 years ago, and had minimum maintenance since then. The floor tiling was clearly worn. The suite is on the 35th floor. The wind at that level can be severe and there was clear wind noise from the windows, to a level where we had to close the door to the bed-room to be able to fall asleep at night. Maybe time for an upgrade. The room has two bedrooms and a nice living room. No less than 3 restrooms, 2 showers, so quite nice. The beds are very comfortable. The daily internet rate is $19, which is a bit steep, for mediocre speed. The room has an internet terminal and there is wireless access through iBahn. The hotel elevators were good and well maintained. The lobby is attractive and the bell stand quite effective. The front desk was slow in processing but very courteous once they serviced us. There is a Starbucks just off the lobby. Nice! They have flight information available in the lobby, very convenient. The restaurant on the mezzanine level is OK but not great. Great place to stay if you want more of a historic visit to Chicago. Great location, but this is a hotel that has not seem much updates / maintenance since 1980. Some people like that style and others are allergic to it. At the price charged I am disappointed that we did not have free internet and the rooms are dated with noise, ...
