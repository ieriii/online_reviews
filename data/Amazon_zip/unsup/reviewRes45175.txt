I really love this place. I live about 4 blocks away and have now been there three times since it opened (including last night). The previous reviews (at least the positive ones) have covered things pretty well. Two things I want to add: 1. They now TAKE RESERVATIONS. I think this just happened within the last few days. I made a reservation yesterday on http://OpenTable.com and even though we were about 15 minutes late, there was no attitude, and we were seated right away. 2. For those of you who like good beer, you have to try one of the two specialty beers they list at the bottom of the wine menu. They are brewed in a very small brewery in Italy and are very high quality, well crafted beer. The cost ($25 for a 750 ml bottle) might shock you, as it did me, but it was at least as good as any wine on the menu (same size bottle). I love this place.
