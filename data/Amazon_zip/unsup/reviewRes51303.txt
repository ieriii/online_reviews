Garcia's is one of those unexpectedly reasonably priced places to eat that lies in the heart of a not so reasonably priced area! The food is pretty decent, their tacos are huge and the meat is well seasoned, the chips and salsa on the table are great and they have good enchiladas. Try a combination plate so you can sample some of everything! The best part is their drinks, from the Horchata to the Margaritas they do them very well. The large Horchata is huge and creamy with just enough sweetness and cinnamon to almost feel like you are drinking a dessert. The margaritas are also well balanced and huge, my favorite is the coconut, it is to die for! All in all great place for groups or a date and they are open late when most of the other business in that area are closed, so parking is pretty easy if you are looking to get a late night bite to eat!
