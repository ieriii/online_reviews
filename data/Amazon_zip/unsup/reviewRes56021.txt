My fiance and I went to this restaurant since it had been recommended by a friend. We were very let down- the quality of the food just wasn't what the pricing would suggest. First, we ordered the roasted autumn squash tart- which was decent but nothing to rave about. We also had the potato/semolina dumplings, which were terrible. The tomato sauce tasted like it came straight out of a jar of Ragu. It definitely was not worth paying $20 for. We also ordered the caramelized lobster and were again let down. We paid way too much for just a mediocre meal- there are so many other restaurants to eat at that I wouldn't recommend this one. The presentation of the food was nice, but not very high quality.
