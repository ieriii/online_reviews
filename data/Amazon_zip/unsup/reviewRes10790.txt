This place is amazing! If you want to treat your expanding waistline or your thunder thighs this is the place to visit. The heath bar pancakes are ridiculous, I still have yet to try the caramel and pretzel pancakes but they are next on my list. Yes you can get these short stack too. The rest of the menu is incredibly good and the service is fast. The only thing that isn't fast about this place is the wait. You will wait. And wait. And wait. I've gone early in the morning, I've gone later in the morning. It is bad all the time. Usually 45 minutes. Just warning you now...
