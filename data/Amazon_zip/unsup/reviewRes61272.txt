I was quite impressed with the ambiance, service and salad bar at Brazzaz. The food was good, the lamb, shrimp and pineapple outstanding. My only complaint is that they paid no attention to how your coin was flipped (either black for no, thanks, and orange for YES, GIVE ME SOME!). This tended to interrupt the enjoyment of the food as you were constantly making choices in mid-chew! If you choose to go, make sure you are HUNGRY and don't fill up too much on the salad bar (they had salmon and capers the night I went, yummy!)
