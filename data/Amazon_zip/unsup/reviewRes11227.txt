I'm lactose intolerant for years now. a little bit of cheese (even with the aid of Lactaid) and I'm doomed for a nite of pain, suffering, and general cursing out of the gods... With that said, I love Piece pizza! I found that I can order the plain New Haven style pizza and ask for light parmesan cheese and I won't get sick later on. Although I'm still cautious so I chew a tablet of Lactaid to help with the cheese digestion. Anyways, on my pizza, I get sausage, pepperoni, black olives, and artichoke hearts. Yummy!!! I can't get enough of it. The best part is that my gf and I order a large to dine-in. Then you take half home, bc it's a giant pizza, to eat the next day. Damn! Piece pizza is oh-so-delicious the next day as well as the flavoring soaked in over nite. The restaurant is big and loud and crowded. Expect a wait on weekends, so go early like 3:30P if you don't want to wait.
