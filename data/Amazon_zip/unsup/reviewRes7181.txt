Sapori Trattoria can be best described as an unimpressive if decent Italian restaurant in Lincoln Park. Though I swear by their stuffed chicken (containing mushrooms, provolone, asparagus, sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts), it is certainly not worth the mid-20$ price tag it carries. Their bolognese, sporting a $19 price tag isn't even described the adjective "decent". It was poor the first time, and didn't even pass the key test for large Italian pasta dishes: it didn't reheat well in the oven or microwave. The wine list? It features similar vintages to the bar down the street from me, but at least the prices aren't as marked up as the cuisine.  Some of the few advantages of this restaurant include the free parking (1.5 blocks north, first-come-first-serve for diners) and the numerous OpenTable 1000-point table slots during the week.  Come here if you're interested in expensive, unimpressive food, and head to many of the other Lincoln Park Italian options if not...feel free to message me for recommendations, as I have many.
