I feel like writing a review for a place that has 500+ reviews already is somewhat silly, but what the heck. I lived in Chicago for five years, and never made it here. I changed that when I came back this past weekend to visit, and I'm sad I waited so long! I came for lunch shortly after they opened, hoping for a seat at the bar. I waited patiently, with the most tasty mojito in-hand, ready to pounce on the next open seat (this is a bigger feat than you might imagine, when waiting among fanny-pack wearing tourists and pushy broads with designer handbags). I didn't have to wait long, and when I got to sit down, I wanted to cackle and shout out "haha, suckas!" to the others waiting behind me. On to the meal. I ordered the Pato en Mole Verde de Cacahuate (yes I copied and pasted that shit). Holy effing crap. Hands down the best beans I've ever had (who knew they could be so different when they're 3 times the cost?) - and the duck breast was sheer heaven. The homemade tortillas were the icing on the cake, as they were warm, buttery, and damn tasty dipped in the sauce and wrapped around chunks of food. I somehow ate the entire plate (what can I say, my hotel didn't have a fridge!), and was definitely in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon. Definitely the best meal I had while I was in town. The bartender/server was quick and friendly, even with the mass amount of people up at the bar eating and ordering drinks. When I'm back in Chicago, I am definitely going to make it a point to stop back here.
