That whale sure does makes good pizza. This is the best pizza I have EVER eaten... and I have had a lot of pizza. The carmelized cheese rocks, the best part of the whole pizza. I have never experienced a more unique pizza than with the straight-up pepperoni pan pizza. I would give them 10-million stars, but that ain't possible so I guess Five Stars will do. The best part of the whole deal is that they have a bar in there... and yes! You guessed it! They serve some crazy bourbon drinks! So come one come all! Yeah, definitely forget Pizzeria Uno, Due, Giordano's, Lou Malnotti's and those other places... go here!!! Now!!!!!
