Pleasant atmosphere - good for medium-sized groups or just one or two. Interesting food choices - I had the cranberry and yellow corn pancakes which were amazing. $4 for 'fresh squeezed' juice seemed a bit much for the glass size. Definitely would go back and am interested in seeing their other locations.
