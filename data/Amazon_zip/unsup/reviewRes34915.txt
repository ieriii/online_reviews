Decent rolls at great prices. BYOB is always a plus; for some ready 2 buck chuck goes great with flavorsome sushi. All you can eat for 19 bucks and I enjoyed almost everything! I had a Chicago roll that was yummy; give that a shot. Service is my only complaint; it's mediocre at best. +1 star: The group I went with got a little rowdy and the management didn't seem to mind.
