Went here mid-January. My BF and I had reservations a week in advance, and ended up getting into town a little later than expected and dealing with an unexpected last-minute housing/hotel crisis - so before we knew it we were an hour late for our reservation on a Saturday night. We called to see if we could still make it, and the receptionist - sounding a bit huffy and annoyed - told us that we'd be welcome as walk-in customers. We expected to wait a long time for a table - but when we got there, we didn't even have time to order a drink at the bar before our table was ready. Service was just OK. Our waiter took probably 10 minutes to greet us, then another 15-20 to deliver our drinks (it was busy, but still...) and a really long time to close our check. The banquette tables are almost uncomfortably close to each other - a neighboring diner's backside grazed the top of my cocktail as he was returning from the bathroom (...eww). The food was better than I had expected. I had a tamarind margarita, which was interesting. We split the ceviche trio and chips/salsa as apps. After living in Peru, I'm hypercritical when it comes to ceviche - I would give it a 4/5. One was phenomenal, one was really good, and the other was nothing special. For entrees, I had the pork loin with a red chile sauce and my BF had the duck in a winter mole. Both were delicious. We left really full. The price point was fair. I'd go back.
