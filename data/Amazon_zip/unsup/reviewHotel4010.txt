For the price we got this place for on Priceline, this place was wonderful. One of the more centrally located hotels in Chicago that's still affordable (at least in the off-season). It's not right in the middle of everything, but it's just a couple blocks up from Michican Ave. right along the Chicago River. We had a partial view of the river from our room, which was pretty cool. The bathroom was probably my favorite part of this room. I really liked the backlit mirror for some reason. I know it was cold outside, but the water did take a very long time to heat up (both the sink and the shower). The bed was comfortable and the room was clean, though there was a small towel on the floor in front of the bathroom when we first arrived and one of the pieces of art on the wall looked like it had some grease/fingerprints on it. Not a big deal, but attention to detail could have been a bit better. The walls weren't particularly soundproof either - there was a baby that was screaming for a good hour or so in the room next door to us, and it was pretty audible. Luckily it wasn't until around 9am and we were already awake anyway. Although we did get a great price on the room, there's two primary reasons I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of four: $9.95 per day for internet, and $52.00 per day for parking. I know it's the middle of the city, but come on now. Also, the business center is only open until 5pm every day so you're basically forced to pay for the internet if you need to print something. The girl at check-in was nice though and in general we were very satisfied with our stay here. Hopefully next time I won't be bringing my car if I stay here again.
