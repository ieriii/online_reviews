I came here about a month ago with work peeps for lunch. It was a Friday at about 11:40 am and it was already hopping (they don't take reservations). We had a larger party (8 people) but we got seated fairly quickly. Inside space is really small - they do have an outdoor area with those table heater lamp things, but can't imagine going here if it's any chillier than 60 degrees. Anyway, waitress was alright, and the food was good but not as amazingly awesome as other yelpers have said. We did try the bone marrow dish and it was so gross - either to fancy for my taste or it was made wrong but it was just so, so gross. i get gross shivers just remembering it while typing this up. We also had a winged "friend" join us in one of the meat dishes - not a good way to finish a meal. We are guessing it flew in from outside. The hostess was very accommodating and sent us over some free desserts but at that point, we didn't really want to touch any more food! Worth a try once (if you aren't footing the bill), but I'll be taking my taste buds elsewhere.
