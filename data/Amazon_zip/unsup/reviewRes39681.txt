I don't know about other people, but if you're looking for a real nice legitimate Korean hole in the wall, this is it..  amazing, fast service, pretty rush, but hey its part of the experience.. drinks are great, and you get to cook with real coal fire..  i dont know what to say other than this place is fantastic...
