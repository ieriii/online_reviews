Overall great place.   First, my two complaints - first of all the caprese salad was made with cherry tomatoes and had no balsamic and was priced at $10.00 - yikes.  Second, the baked ricotta...blah.  Yuck.  It really tastes like eating lemon flavored chalk.  I should have trusted the server who said some people love it and some people don't.  I always assume I will love it.  Oh wait, another complaint.......$2.25 for teeny tiny bottles of pop that my kid is just going to knock over and break, come on.......get some plastic kids cups and a fountain to boot.  Anyway, that aside, the pizza was really good.  We had the salisccio (sausage) and the prosciutto e rucola.  Both were good, decent sized.....2 pizzas fed 4.   4 bottles of pop, caprese salad, 2 pizzas, 1 cappucino, gelato and baked ricotta - $65.00.  The best part....the owner sent around free cannoli.  Now these should be on the menu.  Light, crisp, not too sweet, delicious.
