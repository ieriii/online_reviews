I am absolutely a fab of Wildfire and its impressive that I've eaten at both this one and the one in McLean, VA and have had the same great experience. This review of course focuses on Chicago. I have been several times and have not been disappointed. I went once for dinner and once for the reverse happy hour. They have amazing drink specials (all day of course) and the food has delivered every time. The reverse HH is 1/2 off all appetizers from 9pm - close. This is a great way to try some of the different offerings. I had the pizza, friends had crab cakes, shrimp, and some other goodies and talked about how great it was. Someone else ordered the steak and it was massive and he said pretty good. I think my favorite is the House Salad. It is gigantic and can probably serve 2 - 3 people but it is amazingly delicious and fresh. The drinks are pretty solid as well and they have something for everyone. A wine flight, mixed drinks, martinis, the works. Service is pretty good too. Me and a group of friends were just having a fab time and did not know the place was closed (and had been for a few minutes). The server was never rude or pushy and that is always appreciated. I will be back!
