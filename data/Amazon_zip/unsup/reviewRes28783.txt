Love Frontera. I've dined here quite a few times, and everything is always sooo delicious. Their menu is seasonal, but staples are the amazing guacamole (occasionally with sundried tomatoes thrown in) and margaritas. Before leaving Chicago, I went back to Frontera for a final hurrah, and had the Enchiladas de Pato al Pasilla which were amazing.  If you're a Chicago Foodie, or even just visiting Chicago, definitely bookmark Frontera...but remember that they don't take reservations and the wait can quickly reach 3 hours (especially on the weekends)!!
