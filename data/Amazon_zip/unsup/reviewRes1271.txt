I had to wait more than an hour to eat at this place, but it was so worth it! I had the mountaineer here which was the game of the week. It considered of a bunch of meat like elk, venison, antelope. And it was really good, but as good as that was, my favorite is the foie gras hot dog made with duck sausage and truffle aioli. SOOOO GOOOD!!! It tastes fatty but you have to try it at least once! Also ordered duck fat fries which were also good. It was a lot of food. Fries come in a large portion.
