I love Bad Apple, it's my standard go-to. I admit that's because it's a stones throw from my house, but it's my first 'hood based go-to, and I've lived in North Center off and on since 2000. The beer list is uh.mazing, and I've found some new faves on it. The food is better than your average bar-with-a-full-menu, but I think they want to be more than that. The menu is interesting and unique, they even have house-made organic ketchup (that, yes, totally tastes like marinara sauce). The veggie burgers aren't bad, and they are made in-house, but they don't have the best texture (they use a lot of falafel mix) . But the foods tastes kind of pre-made, I'm not totally surprised by the reviews that complain of cold ingredients. If you're in the neighborhood, Bad Apple is a great place to go to, they serve food until 11 and the bar is open until 2 (weekdays, I'm not sure about weekends). Service is great, prices are fine, it's totally worth checking out!
