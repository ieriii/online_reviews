just ok! decorated great! warm cozy feel! food was not outstanding, it was just ok. nothing to brag about. prices are a little steep. i would think this is a great place to catch a game and if the place is packed and all cheering for the same team its probably a lot of fun. the place draws you in because it looks so good from the outside you just want to try it.
