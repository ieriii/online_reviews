Service was horrendously slow--took about 20 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that the hostess has seated us. Also had to remind the server a few times to bring certain items. It's more expensive than it's Ethiopian neighbors to the north, and you don't get more food (i'd even say probably less) without any noticeable spike in quality.  in short, go to diamond or ras a mile or so north of here.
