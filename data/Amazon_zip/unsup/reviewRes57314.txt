I LOVE Coast. It is by far my very favorite place for sushi. And it's BYO --can't ask for much more. My husband and I go there at least once a month. ...And with three kids, time together is pretty precious. Atmosphere is fantastic and Danny's (small bar around the corner) is a great little place to wait if you can't get your table right away.
