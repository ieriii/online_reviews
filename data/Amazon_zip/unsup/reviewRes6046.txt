PROs - amazingly delicious and succulent food. seriously, nothing was a miss and it came out in great time. - going in a group maximizes the dishes you get to try..and believe me, you'll want to try it all. - the establishment is welcoming and vibrant, and the plating is minimal and perfect. - excellent for people-watching. CONs - wait time. it's almost inevitable. the good news is, they have a bar and there's a bar across the street that makes for a good time while you wait. - the tables are beyond sticky. we saw them wipe it down, but we literally had to apply force to get our glasses or plates a-movin'. eek. - noise level. i was practically screaming if you can get past the cons (and trust me, you can and you will!), stuff your little heart with italian goodness* and sign that ridiculously cheap bill with a huge grin on your face! --- *ricotta + honey comb vasi. aka greatest appetite-whetter of all time. marscapone polenta + ragu of the day (i don't care what it is, you MUST get it). roasted beets + walnuts + crme fraiche + candied walnuts antipasti. cacio e pepe paste (how could this be so simple yet SO rich and delicious?). pizze della terra (foraged mushrooms + braised leeks + taleggio + truffle oil). and, of course, the cannoli sundae (sweet ricotta + crushed cannoli + pistachios + candied oranges + chocolate sauce + whipped cream). with tip, i paid $24. un-freaking-real.
