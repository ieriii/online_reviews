We were able to get a great deal travelocity so this is a nice hotel than we can usually afford. It's in a great location right at the end of Magnificent Mile, and perfect for bus rides to the downtown area, as well as Wicker & Lincoln Park. The staff and door men are very friendly and accommodating. The rooms are beautifully decorated with classic B&W photography and comfortable which a flat screen tv and complimentary coffee. The bathroom is really beautiful and the rainfall shower is AMAZING! i wanted to shower three times a day! another nice feature is that the elevators respond very quickly and are a good size for such an old building. and there are three of them so it was really easy to get to and from our 7th floor room. ice machines are only on three floors so we got lucky that one is on the 7th.
