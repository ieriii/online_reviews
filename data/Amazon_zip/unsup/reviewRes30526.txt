My girl took me here last nite for my early bday dinner. It was very dark inside, maybe too dark, but that's part of what their elegant vibe is going for i guess. Loved the live music...jazzy version of hit me baby one more time while enjoying a delicious martini? Count me in...the dirty belvedere martini with large caper berries was wonderful. Starters - amazing shrimp cocktail. Brought tableside with dry ice, was great presentation and maybe the best shrimp cocktail I have ever had. Ahi tuna tartare was delicious. We got a lobster roll that was a little underwhelming, kinda bland in my opinion. My bone in filet was awesome, cooked perfectly medium rare. She got ahi tuna sashimi, that was very good. Enjoyed both as leftovers that did not disappoint. Sides we got were the lobster mashed potatoes that everyone raved about, they lived up to the hype. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the staff, they were very good, but were almost better cold the next morning rather than served hot and charred? Ended dinner w/signature warm butter cake that they wrote 'happy bday peter' on, very nice, very delicious. We didn't take the leftovers of that home, why, I DON'T KNOW!!! We were stuffed by then and were not thinking straight. Overall, very good meal. The service was insanely attentive and awesome...the martini comes with two servings, shaker left tableside...it was not empty until I drank all of it, Drew (server) topped me off everytime he stopped by. It is very pricey, but it is very high quality, you pay for what you get. Nice spot for a special occasion. After the meal it took almost ten minutes to get our car from valet, I am nitpicking, but with their prices, I am allowed to. I still give Joe's Stone Crab the edge.
