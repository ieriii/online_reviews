There are so many new and fabulous brunch places opening every weekend, that I'm concerned for the Gold Coast's oldest cafe. In fact, I'm pretty sure a handful opened in the 45 minutes it took between ordering our eggs and them actually arriving. I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a wait for a table for two at 11AM on a Sunday. My out-of-towner friend and I came looking for eggs and bottomless coffee and weren't disappointed. However, we weren't wowed. I'm a fan of the innovative "classic" brunch--that means fruity pancake flights, potato "hashes," modern European pastries I've never heard of, etc. The sweet options on the menu seemed pretty classic and safe, although I was intrigued by the brie and banana liquor stuffed french toast. The savory options seemed more adventurous, although there were a variety of pretty standard omelet options. I chose the Lox Eggs Benedict which replaces hollandaise sauce with Salsa verde. I enjoyed the dish, but the salsa verde pretty much over-powered the lox. My friend ordered the veggie hash and was pleased with the variety and quantity of the vegetables. I love bragging about Chicago brunches to visitors and promising an unforgettable dining experience. At the end of the meal, my out-of-towner mentioned the fabulous bruch she had LAST TIME she visited. Taking her to a Chicago relic seemed like a good angle for a visitor, but history doesn't excuse a ridiculously long wait for the food, lackluster dishes, and a rather musty decor. Come into the 20th-Century Third Coast!
