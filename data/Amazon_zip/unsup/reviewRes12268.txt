Piece Brewery is such a great place!  First off, the pizza is DELICIOUS!, and apparently reputably so, by Chicago pizza standards. Secondly, you can get a beer sampler, which comes with like 6 shots of beer! I thought that was pretty snazzy. They have a really great selection of beer. My one complaint is the SERVICE!!! Every time I've come; the servers have been completely unfriendly and had attitudes of entitlement. Having been a server in the past for many years, I know that it's hard to keep up the good spirits incessantly, but that's the name of the trade, ladies and gentleman. I'm not going to give you a 20+% tip unless you truly deserve it. If you slack off, do not check back on us, or do not smile, see ya good tip. And I hate doing that. Still, the food and beer and ambience is so good that I cannot give Piece anything less than 5 stars, despite the lax service. This place is sooo busy though, so you will likely have to wait. But it is worth it! They also have a pizza to-go counter next door to the restaurant - so order ahead!
