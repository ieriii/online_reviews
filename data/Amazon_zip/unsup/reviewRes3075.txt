Can't...stop...ordering...if you don't like this place you need to have your head examined. Everything at this place is great but you need not concern yourself with anything other than the fried chicken. They put an addictive chemical in it that "makes you crave for it nightly..."  Seriously, after moving here from New York I was interested to see how it stacked up against Momofuku Noodle Bar's chicken dinner and it was right up there. PLUS, they delivered. PLUS it was 10% of the price. PLUS I didn't have to wait 7 months for a reservation. So to say I was satisfied is a slight understatement.  What are you doing right now and why aren't you ordering?!?!
