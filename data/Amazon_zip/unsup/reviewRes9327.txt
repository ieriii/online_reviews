Ok- this is not for the food at all - I didn't dine here. But the service. I foolishly printed out directions to a Yelp event sans name of establishment.. Seems Le Colonial shares an address with the "Drawing Room." Anyhoo.... The host, a distinguished older gentleman, kindly ushered me in and out. He really was sweet. I want to come back to actually feast!
