First time eating here and we had an incredible time! The Bad News: we were told the wait was 1-1/2 hours when we checked in at 6:30 which was okay with us, but then it turned out to be 2 and 1/2 hours! The Good News: we sat at the bar while we waited and had the most incredible bartender (Brooke) - she was smart, funny, mixed a mean drink and comped us drinks and food because we had to wait so long - the restaurant needs to pay her more whatever they pay her b/c we left happy b/c of her and we would have left really angry had she not been there! Also, Joe the wine steward kept us laughing and was the only other person to tell us the truth about how long we'd be waiting. When we finally did get to sit down, it was worth the wait. The food was incredible. Between the 4 of us we tried about 10 dishes, and didn't have one disappointment. The real standouts: any of the pizzas, Focaccia di Recco was the best (crispy filo dough, cheese and honey), the vasi (mini mason jars), hearts of palm salad and the crispy pork antipasti! Not much room for dessert, but we shared one butterscotch pudding, which was great, not too sweet. We will definitely be back, but maybe on a week night unless we are assured of a spot at the bar with Brooke bartending!
