Excellent breakfast. Went with my husband, 3 yo son and mother in law. I hadn't been in over a year. We all raved about what we had. I had the omelet of the day, husband had the skillet (SHRIMP!), son had the teddy bear pancakes and MIL had bacon and eggs. Can't go wrong with anything you order. Staff is very friendly and perfectly helpful. There was a homemade cherry jam that tasted like cherry pie. I wish I had more to spread it on, it was beyond tasty. I've never gone for dinner. It is a must now. Very good coffee too.
