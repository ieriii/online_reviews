I had high hopes, many had put this on their "must eat" list. For everyone else at my table, I would agree. but alas--my meal was ok (high flavor, medium execution) but my accomplices to brunch had the WHITE CHOCOLATE & 4 BERRY CHEESECAKE FLAPJACKS (no not a typo) and it wasn't nearly as cavity inducing as one might think! Not to mention the overwhelmingly pleasing tomatillo salsa scramble.....i think i chose poorly......
