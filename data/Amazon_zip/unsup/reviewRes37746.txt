Meh. I'd give Hopleaf 3.5 stars if I could, but not four. Having been told that Hopleaf was The Violet Hour of beer, I came in with pretty high expectations. I'm a beer snob, so I was pretty excited. The food was great, the beer was great. The sheer volume of the selection was impressive. For just the food and the beer, I'd give Hopleaf a solid 4 stars, but really, I wasn't as blown away as I expected to be. The place was packed and our server was plain not nice. After a discussion with her about seating our medium sized group (about 7-8 people) we were told that we needed to split into two tables on the patio, which was fine, she gave us very confusing directions about where to sit, and glared at us, and in fact bitched at us a little, when a friend of mine took his beer with him from one of our tables across the patio to another to carry on a conversation. She seemed to have realized she was not being a good server about half way through our visit and became very nice - I think she was just overworked, and I felt bad for her- but all in all, it was an unfortunate experience. I'd like to go back on a less crowded night/at a less crowded time, and maybe it'll be better.
