Made reservations for an early dinner on Sunday before the David Gray show. I had been here once before for a drink in the bar, but this was my first time dining here. Overall, it was just OK, especially considering the high price tag. My SO and I split the mussels vindaloo to start and they were really tasty, as was the warm loaf of bread. However our "mains" left something to be desired. I ordered the "carmelized" lobster and quinoa. Not only was the "lobster" quite mushy, I had a sneaking suspicion that it was really langostino, not lobster. My SO thought that his fish and chips had too much breading. Nice wine and beer list and it's got a nice atmosphere. I'll stick to having drinks at the bar, though.
