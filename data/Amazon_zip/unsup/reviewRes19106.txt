Came here at 530pm on a Friday and was ready to eat! There was hardly any line and we got a seat right away. This place is more Mexican than Rick Bayless. The hot chocolate is authentic and delicious. I had the Aztec, which is spices and cocoa. Also ordered the Ahogada sandwich which must be eaten in house because it comes with a yummy soup for soaking. So g-o-o-d. Pork was tender and flavorful and the sauce was rich with tomato and spices. Definitely finish off everything with a churro. Must must must! Churro churro churro! Go!
