Had their house special ceviche which was very tasty and not too citric. For entree, the halibut was fresh but the filet was pretty thin. Husband had the Thursday night goat special which was really tender and the cheesy mac'n cheese was heavenly. I found the waiter a bit rude as he only asked my husband how his dinner was and didn't even give me any eye contact. Hello! I was the one paying.
