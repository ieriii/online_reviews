So far, this is my favorite indian place in Chicago - with a disclaimer that I have not been to Devon and in general am not an expert by any means. I've been a few times and everything we tried was good, service was prompt, drinks were pretty good. I especially liked their garlic naan and their baingan bharta (eggplant). Definitely give it a try.
