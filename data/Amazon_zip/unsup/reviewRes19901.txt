I ate here 4 months ago and I'm still having fantasies about this food! A friend wanted to check it out for a late dinner so 4 of us showed up around 8:00 and waited in line for about 40 minutes on a Tuesday night to order. I got the Cochinita Pibil Torta and it was one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever eaten. Perfectly tender and salty pork and a very slight punchiness of the pickled onions. The habanero salsa was hot, so go easy on it but it really brings out all the flavors. Everyone was more than happy with their tortas and caldos. We all got hot cocoas and split some churros for dessert. I got the Barcelona with a Dulce de Leche shot and I could not finish it. It was delicious but super rich. That and a couple of churros could have taken the place of an entire meal. Although leaving feeling pretty overstuffed, I'm quite certain I dreamt of the meal. I had to have more! On my way to the airport the next day I risked missing my 1:15 flight home and took my chances by going back for lunch :) The XOCO salad with carnitas was hands down the best salad I have ever eaten. Black beans, crispy tortillas, avocado lime dressing, yum!! I had to bring home evidence of this magical place, so I got a box of breakfast treats to take home to my wife. Ginger-lime muffin, some sort of spiced apple-pear crumbly bread. All fantastic. I can't say enough good things. I cannot wait to get back to Chicago so I can go another round with this place. Bless you, Rick Bayless.
