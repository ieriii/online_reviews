We recently moved to Chicago and this was the first place we decided to try deep dish pizza. We ordered a tossed house salad and a medium 12" pan pizza with extra cheese, onion, sausage and pepperoni. This pizza was absolutely delicious. I had my doubts about deep dish pizza opting for thin crusted NY style slices but I now am on the fence. I definitely want to return to try a few different toppings but overall we had a great experience here. My soda was constantly full along with our waters and the salad was refreshing, topped with carrots, black olives and tomatoes. We only finished 1/2 the pizza and brought home the other half to have for leftovers!
