Ate here a couple years ago and it was decent. Ate here a year ago and it was ok. Ate here a couple months ago and again last week and it was disappointing. The primary problem was the service - the food's fine, if a little random in appearance and portion (most are small, but some items are really outsized...the lentil salad was enough for 4-6 easily). But when it takes 15 minutes to have a drink order taken, there's no explanation of the menu items, and drinks are shoved down between other glasses...I'm not coming back and paying $50 a person for it. The cocktails are good; the food's good. The staff seems to be increasing in suckiness with each passing year. There are lots of other places to eat in Chicago, and I'll stick to trying some of them rather than coming here again. It's disappointing, because this used to be a great place and I'm sure it might still be, but my last few visits just haven't been up to par.
