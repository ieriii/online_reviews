Having discovered this place a few years ago, I was saddened by the fact that they wouldn't deliver to me since I lived too far south. I'm not really a huge pizza connoisseur but I'm pretty sure Art of Pizza is one of the best, and rivals that of Pequods which may be the best of Chicago. However, it's hard to judge for me when comparing the best of the pizza places. At least give this place a try, I mean, the tribune did rate it #1 afterall. Before this review I realized that I now live close enough for delivery, I'm looking forward to night class ending so I can order some pizza!
