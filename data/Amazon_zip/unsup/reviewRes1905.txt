Different and delicious! True to the legend, the line was around the corner, just past the back of the building. Big deal. It moved at a decent pace. It did start to rain, but by then I was under the awning- ha! Total wait, just over an hour. Doug has a great personality- he keeps a good rhythm so the flow in & out is steady. My two 'dogs' were a ribeye steak sausage with fried onions and blue cheese, and a uber garlic pork sausage with roasted garlic on top. Both were fantastic. I chose them because they sounded so unique. I igured the standard menu could wait for another visit which will happen, just on a day I have the time to stand and wait.
