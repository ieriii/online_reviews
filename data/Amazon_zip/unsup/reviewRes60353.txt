This is some of the best sushi in the city and the prices are very reasonable. The sushi chefs may be the fastest in the country. I am always impressed at how fast, fresh and innovative the sushi is. The staff is very welcoming and attentive. They work as a team and it never feels tense there. It is very quiet too, no loud music, but a lively and relaxed atmosphere.
