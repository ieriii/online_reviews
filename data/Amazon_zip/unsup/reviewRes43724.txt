Review is for lunch only - I have yet to try the weekend brunch. This is a bourgie little cafe that has some excellent sandwiches with some unique combinations of meat/cheese/bread. My choice was a ham and havarti on a pretzel roll. The meat was plentiful, and the chips were extremely tasty. I mean it - loved those chips.There is a nice selection of Boylan's and Pellegrino sodas. I also found wireless access there. My only complaint was that I couldn't find any free reading (Timeout Chicago, the Tribune, and the other papers there were all for sale). Looking forward to checking out the brunch there soon.
