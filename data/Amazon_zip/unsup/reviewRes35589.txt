Come here if you want tasty, high-quality, authentic food with large portions and great value. Don't come here if you want trendy, overpriced, new-Asian cuisine. Also, a note on the service: a previous reviewer mentioned that she though she had to work extra-hard to get attention from the servers because she wasn't Asian. As a frequent patron of Chinese cuisine, I'd say regardless of your ethnicity, it is often necessary to speak up to get attention from your server. I've found this to be the case in most blue-collar Chinese restaurants, not just in the US, but also in China and Taiwan. That's just the way it is.
