Sufficed. Needed a quick, cheap, centrally located one-nighter and while customer service does vary among different staff members and departments, it works fine. Got there too late to try for any upgrade deal. My floor was a bit loud at times. And in the morning I was entertained by the alley I was facing. An open garage business with guys moving stuff in and out struck me as kind of funny. Enough for me to whip out my camera. I'd return under similar circumstances.
