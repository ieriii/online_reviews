A veggie burrito for under $5. Are you kidding me? And BYOB. Are you serious? I love this place. I have dreams about this place. The food caters to the most voracious carnivores, yet also offers a wide variety of authentic Costa Rican food for those veggie lovers. The empanadas are some of the best around!
