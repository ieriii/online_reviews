Based on some of the reviews, I made a reservation with some sense of being disappointed. TRU turned out to be one of the best meals that I have ever experienced, including creativity, service, and overall enjoyment. At first the atmosphere seemed a bit stuffy, and the coordinated water pourings a bit hokey, but as the evening went on I appreciated the attention to detail in both the service and food. The sommelier was great with a sense of fun. The 6 course tasting menu showed more creativity than Moto. On the whole, this was worth the money for an exceptional fine dining experience.
