Fact: I used to Love this place Fact: I don't love this place as much as I used to; tear  After being away from Chicago for two years I was pretty excited to get my late night burrito fix at a place I used to frequent, La Pasadita. Ahhh the memories, stumbling in at 2am for a veggie burrito, yum. I came in yearning for a veggie burrito but ordered chicken instead; it was just good, not great like I remembered. I went back a month or so later and ordered the veggie burrito, can't go wrong with that, right? It too was just ok. The burrito lacked the flavor and depth I remembered. One more time, this time I ordered the steak burrito, hmmm...now this is something I would be interested in (i.e. Bob Ryan from Entourage). The steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. I will continue to return to La Pasadita, late night and otherwise. I give this place three stars simply because it seems to be hit or miss, it is not a "on point" as it was once. Still pretty good burritos though .
