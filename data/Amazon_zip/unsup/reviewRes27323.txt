2 Words - Cheese Enchiladas. What to say about this dish? It is wonder. I decided to visit Nuevo Leon after checking out the reviews on Yelp. This place is casual, family-friendly, and rowdy (food-wise). I ordered the cheese enchiladas with mole sauce. They were simple and wonderful. They are cheesy and a bit sweet and should be every girl's go-to when they want to splurge on deliciousness once a month. Trust me. I know Mexican food. This is the best you will find, unless you are motivated to book a flight and get away from the windy city that is Chicago. Well done, NL.
