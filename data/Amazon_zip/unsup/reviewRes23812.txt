Two words: Tilapia Casado. Oh, with Cuban rice! Soooo gooood. We also shared the "Award-Winning Vegetarian Burrito," and although I'd deem "Award-Winning" to be a bit of a stretch, it was still "Mighty Tasty." With a bottle of white wine from Red & White across the street our evening proved to be an authentically delightful experience.
