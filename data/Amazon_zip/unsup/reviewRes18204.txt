This is my family's go-to place for out-of-town guests or nicer family dinners, and everyone we take here falls in love. I can't say enough good things about this place. The service is wonderful. It is BYOB. The food is fantastic. Portions are huge. We always get a couple orders of bruchetta and calamari for the table, and they are fabulous every time. I'm always hesitant about calamari because so many places overcook it and then it's chewy, but not here. Every time I've had it, it's been perfectly done. For main course, we usually order a few to share for the table. two people could easily split one dish because the portions are so large. That's why we love coming here in big groups, it keeps the cost down and you get to try some of all the delicious dishes they have on the menu. Even when we share dishes, there is too much food. I have never left this place without a doggie-bag. This is a great neighborhood spot. Small, quaint and phenomenally delicious. Everyone should try it... more than once.
