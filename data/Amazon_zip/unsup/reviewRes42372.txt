The handful of times I've been here have all been great nights. The atmosphere and decor, better described in other reviews, make you never want to leave. The interesting and delicious menu is icing on the proverbial cake. P.S. If you don't feel like spending $10 for a Ketel and soda, they have a never ending deal of PBR goblets for $2. You're welcome.
