I love this place. Great combination of Japanese and Thai food. I must admit my guilt pleasure is complimentary food. I occasionally get cravings for different types of food at the same time. (For example, Tacos and Pizza, Wings and Sushi, - Call me weird for that one) Back to the review...their special Maki is great, their soft shell crab maki fantastic. All the traditional Thai dishes are fantastic too. Their Drunken Noodle has a nice spice to it.  My wallet slim because of Indie Cafe Thai & Sushi.
