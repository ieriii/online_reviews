Tonight was my third time dining at Bonsoiree. All three dinners have been delightful. The food here is consistently delicious. The "consumer advisory" , the killer lentils, tobacco ice cream, and the eight bite-size chocolate desserts really popped for me on this new menu. The motoyaki remains one of my favorite dishes, ever. Heaven in a scallop shell. A few times I've been underwhelmed by a dish-- the rabbit on the fall menu, for example-- but really, nothing big enough to make this any less than a five star restaurant in my book. The ambiance is classy but casual. The excellent service and chic, intimate space make for extremely pleasant, laid-back dining. BYOB is icing on the cake, allowing you to customize your dining experience. Each time I've visited, it's felt a bit like my own private dinner party. I love eating here! This is a great place for a date, dinner with friends, entertaining clients, a celebration...it's very versatile, especially given the BYOB aspect. You can come tete-a-tete for five courses and a bottle of wine, or with seven friends and seven bottles for an evening of epicurean indulgence (to the waiter who obliged our request for some beat-boxing that night: thank you, and, I'm sorry...). I hope to be back again soon. What a gem of a restaurant!
