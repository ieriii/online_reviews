Great atmosphere with a young bar scene. I had high expectations and some of the food was not that impressive. I would skip the Ceasar salad- the croutons are amazing, but the rest of the salad lacks flavor and is sparse. The gnocchi was the best dish I tried. Skip the fish and try a meat dish. The desserts looked amazing, although we were too full to try. I would go back for dessert and a drink, but wouldn't run back for the food.
