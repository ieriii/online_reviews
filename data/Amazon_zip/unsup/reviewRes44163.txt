I recently moved to Uptown, but having lived a mere 3 blocks from Wakamono for two years I already find myself craving their delicious food! There are MANY Asian and Pan-Asian restaurants along Broadway in East Lakeview, but this restaurant should always be your first choice. I completely agree with some of the menu items others have highlighted here, but that yellow tail ceviche really is no joke - It's a little chunk of heaven in your mouth. Also, I know this place is BYOB, but do yourself a favor and remember to order (and share) one of their pear martinis (or three) - wowza!
