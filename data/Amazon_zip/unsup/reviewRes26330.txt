I've had nothing but great experiences with Pequod's Pizza... We usually get delivery, and it's always still delicious and hot when it arrives. The ingredients always seem fresh (green peppers! Not squishy!) and are definitely plentiful... We ordered a pepperoni pan pizza and jalapeno poppers last night, glorious! The above as well as the carmelized crust makes it my go-to pan/deep-dish pizza in Chicago.
