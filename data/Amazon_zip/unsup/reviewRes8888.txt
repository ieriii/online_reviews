We went to Noon O Kabab with a group of 8 guys for a friends graduation dinner. I had never heard of the place but my friend S wanted all of us to try it, so we gave it a go. They have a parking lot in the back and you can easily find street parking in this area if aforementioned lot is full. We walked in and upon first glance, it seemed like a regular neighborhood restaurant: nothing too fancy and pretty basic decor. We were seated promptly by the friendly wait staff and I proceeded to order an Efes Pilsner, a Turkish beer, mainly because I like beer. For our appetizers, we ordered a Hummus, Baba Ghannouj, and a Persian Salad. The hummus was good although a tad heavy on the olive oil. The Baba Ghannouj was spectacular! You could taste the roasted eggplant and it was delectable. The salad was, well, a salad.  I had a tough time decided what my main course would be. I had just worked out and I was hungry and wanted to try every meat on the menu! I consulted my friend S who had been here before and he recommended the lamb. I ended up getting the Lamb Kabob and Koubideh (ground sirloin) and I was not disappointed. the lamb was juicy and really flavorful. I enjoyed the ground sirloin even more than the lamb and I attribute that to the texture of the sirloin. I tried a friend's chicken, which was decent, but I wouldn't order it at a Persian restaurant unless I had dietary restrictions. I came to the conclusion that they really know how to handle their meat at this restaurant! My meal came with a side of dill rice and some tomatoes, which added a nice omnivorous touch to the platter. We finished our meal off with a round of tea for the table, which was allright as well. The bill came and at average of 15 dollars a platter, the price was right. I would definitely recommend this place to someone who was looking for some authentic Persian fare at a reasonable price.
