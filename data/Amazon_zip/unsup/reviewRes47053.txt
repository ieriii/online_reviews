This review is long overdue... This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Hell, it's probably one of the best that I've ever been to. Literally, EVERY time I have been to Uncommon Ground to eat, the food has been a conversation-stopping, need-to-embrace-the-moment type of experiences. I could list specific dishes, but because Uncommon Ground is so focused on local, organic ingredients, the menu changes due to seasonality. A definite plus. I have been here over 10 times and only once has the service been poor - and that was due to a catty gay server who seemed a little too pretentious to be working there.... granted, the food that night - like always - blew my mind and my palate, so our servers attitude had little effect on me. I have been here for brunch, lunch, primarily dinner, drinks - and they are consistently fantastic. With one exception (which is why I'm giving them 4 stars) - The desserts. The desserts have been just as consistently horrible as the food, ambience, & service have been wonderful. My partner and I have repeatedly tried to give dessert a chance, and it has been awful every time (I believe we have ordered dessert at least 6 times). Which is a shame because having a meal that is out of this world followed by a dessert that is mediocre (at best) - leaves a fairly neutral impression on the experience when I walk out the door. Therefore, my partner and I have decided to skip dessert every time (no more chances) and the entire dining experience has been BLISS. God, I love eating here. And you will too - just skip the dessert. (Also, when summer rolls around, check out the Farmer's Market and tour the rooftop garden - simply incredible to have something like this in the city.)
