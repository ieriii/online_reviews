As a tourist in Chicago, this place is great! I've never met such friendly waiters - frankly, they were friendlier than all of New York combined. I felt like I was in fairy-tale land. It was a refreshing change from the rudeness that exists all over NYC eating establishments. The portions are also gigantic. I ordered a cup of lentil soup for dinner and was served at least 3 servings, which is double what I needed. The omelet was great and came with the best home fries I've had in a long, long, while. Not the chopped potatoes with peppers and onions, but actual griddle fries. The pancakes were not only large, but also light, fluffy and delicious. With butter, nuts, bananas and syrup, however, yikes! This place isn't for the health-conscience. There was so much food that unfortunately, I wasn't able to even think about dessert.
