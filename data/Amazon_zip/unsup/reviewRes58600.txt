It's not often that I describe a burger as melting in my mouth, but the Slow Burn burger did just that. Even as a spice lover I was a bit intimidated by the list of peppers topping the burger but the combination of flavors was perfect. So perfect that I stuck around and let a dozen exotic beers melt in my mouth too.
