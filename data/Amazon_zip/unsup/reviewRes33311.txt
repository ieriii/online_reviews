This place was just as amazing the second time as it was the first. We stopped in for appetizers while waiting for the car to have its oil changed across the street and I swear, this is one of the BEST places to eat in Chicago. I've never had such amazing cucumber & tomato salad or eggplant spread in my life. The flavors were just to die for. I wish I could afford to eat at this place daily.
