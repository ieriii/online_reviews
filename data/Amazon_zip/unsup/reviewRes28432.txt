This is by far my favorite pizza place in the city! The pan is delicious! It is similar to a deep dish, but, IMO even better. The crust is doughy and crunch all at the same time, and the top of the crust is caramelized in some wonderfully delicious fashion. Don't even get me started on the toppings! They put so many toppings on there it puts Giordano's to shame. We had a pepperoni, mushroom, and green pepper pizza and you couldn't even see the cheese, there were so many toppings! The pepperoni was also some of the best pepperoni I have had--very flavorful! I highly recommend this place!
