I have to say the half priced margarita is the only thing saving this place from a 2-star review. I had so much hope for Mayan Palace, and my experience started off okay. I came here with two friends a couple months ago. The front room is really beautiful and that impressed me. The guac was also good. I got a combo plate with a chille relleno, taco, and tamale. I thought the chilli relleno sucked, but so few places are good at that I forgave them, the tamale was covered in mole-and had I know this I would ask them to hold it, but the taco was good. But it's a freaking taco. I came back on a double date and we were seated in the back. The back is NOT as nice as the front. It was raining outside and it leaked all over the floor near out table. I got enchiladas verdes, and the just were not that good! And for this price, that is not acceptable. I'll only be back for margaritas and apps!
