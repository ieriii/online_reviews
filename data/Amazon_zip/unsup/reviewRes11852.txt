I am a pizza snob and this place fills my craving. Try a white pizza with fresh tomatoes and basil - it's fantastic and I am addicted!! The beer made on the premises is excellent as well...along with a great selection of imports like Duvel and Hitachino. YUM. It only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes service isn't so great, but hey, it's a pizza place not charlie trotters.
