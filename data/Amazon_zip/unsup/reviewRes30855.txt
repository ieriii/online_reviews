I stopped here for dinner on the recommendation of the front desk manager at the Westin Hotel nearby. As far as SPG properties go, that Westin is pretty cool and so is the front desk manager. But this is a review of Sunda. The first thing that struck me was how busy it was for Thursday night; they were packed! Luckily the kickass front desk manager at the Westin called ahead and got them to seat me at the sushi bar. The decor is pretty hip and the crowd seemed pretty hip, too. There was a lot of good people watching.  The service was a little bit on the slow side, but the food more than made up for it. That, and the manager of the restaurant, Angie, brought me a very delicious whitefish treat just because she was glad to see a solo diner. So, they get extra stars just for being friendly and generous. Summary: go here, eat, have a nice time. You'll be glad you did. If you end up drinking too much here just go get a room at the Westin because they are cool, too.
