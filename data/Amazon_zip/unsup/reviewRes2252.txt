second trip to hot doug's, equally as good. here's what i tried: - cognac-infused pheasant sausage with goat cheese and pomegranate-raspberry creme fraiche - duck sausage dog with foie gras and truffle sauce - duck fat french fries (standard) where does he come up with this stuff? as per usual, this is a perfect place to take guests (primarily because it gives me an excuse to go) to experience a uniquely Chicago establishment. we had about a 30-min wait... not too bad.
