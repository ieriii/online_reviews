This place is constantly good! Yes is crowded at peak times, but if you go for a late lunch you there is no wait. Good lattes, egg dishes, salads and sandwiches! I have been there many times over the years and I have always enjoyed it. You order at the counter and the service is fine. Note to new mom's don't try to bring in your fancy stroller because it gets too crowded! I made the mistake and waited until my little ones could actually sit at a table to allow them to return. Great place to meet friends for lunch and seriously the food is always good. Oh...the cupcakes are yummy too
