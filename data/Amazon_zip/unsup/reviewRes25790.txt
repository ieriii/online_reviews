I'm trying to decide whether to give Geja's Cafe 3 or 4 stars because I think it deserves 3.5. I had a very enjoyable time and I liked the food but I guess I wouldn't say that it was amazing? I went with a friend rather than on a date, so perhaps some of the romantic atmosphere was lost on me. Anyway: The good parts: I liked the cheese fondue a lot. I'd read some reviews saying that it was bad but I liked the flavors a lot. I thought it tasted good with the bread and the fruit. The meats and veggies were good too but the dipping sauces confused me a bit, seemed like there were too many flavors going on. Also, mmm I loved the chocolate dessert fondue. I love chocolate in general and it tasted verrry good with everything they gave to eat it with. We also had a nice bottle of white wine that was very decently priced. I also loved the salad that they gave us and thought it was nice that they finished with coffee. My friend used a groupon but I still don't think it was all that expensive (without the groupon) for the amount of food we had. The bad parts: The food was all good but I wouldn't say that any of the ingredients were top quality it was just decent quality. Also, they literally pack the restaurant with tables. I swear that I'm a pretty small person but I had my computer bag with me and I could have sworn that I was going to knock into every table I passed. Even when I was going to the bathroom (with no bag on me) I had to dodge waiters and tables that were directly in my path. And yes, every single item I wore reeks of oil! Yikes, everyone was right! But I had fun and I would return.
