Ok, I'm not the pizza fanatic in my family. That distinction goes to my son. We stumbled on this place a few years ago and were not all that impressed with the outside--hard to park, small etc. But, we were hungry so in we went. There were reviews on the walls, tables crammed in a small area, and a line to order -- my rule: 15 minutes and I'm gone. Good thing we waited. Holy c r _p (!) this was good. . . and I'm not all that fussy about pizza and I prefer a Lou Malnati's type of crust, but this I'll go out of my way for. My son is the afficianado and he just raved-- "it's the sauce. . .". There you have it. Enough said.They recently expanded so its not so cramped. Put this place on your list.
