Date night? Character on the barside. Begin with Rick's Marisol draft with the Jicama fruity crunch. Add shots of Frontera red pepper sauce to the Torpedo Molotes. Classic Queso Fundido remade new with Samuel's artisanal Jack. You will enjoy the noise with a local Matilda and grilled knob onions. Pancho's recommendation did not disappoint: Bass, emerald rice, molcajete - PURO SABOR.
