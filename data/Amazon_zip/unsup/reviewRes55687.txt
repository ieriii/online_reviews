I first saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives but I didn't plan on stopping in until I Googled All-you-can-eat Crab Legs for my husband's birthday. This is not a normal diner, they serve cereal at the bar in the back and have their whole menu on chalkboards on both walls. I made reservations a week in advance just to be sure we could get in - I would suggest this because the line was pretty long when we got here and pretty long when we left. You start off getting a pretty decent portion of crab legs with parmesean corn and coleslaw, after that they bring you out one crag leg at a time and you can order more corn and slaw if you'd like. He also ordered a 40 of Miller Lite, yes I said a 40 oz.. The crab legs started off great (especially for what you would pay at Joe's or Shaw's) but as the night went on and they busier they got, the legs came out very salty and mushy from the overcrowded boiling water. After about an hour, we gave up another round because they were almost inedible. I'd suggest getting in early and getting out. We'll definitely be back since they have great seafood specials and overall the food was good.Checking out their website recently, it looks like they took off their Wednesday rib night special...bummer.
