Grand Lux is a solid spot for a quick lunch/dinner (or hideout from the tourists/other shoppers).  The spot is similar to it's sister (Cheesecake Factory) in that the menu incorporates almost every type of food imaginable. You can have tacos, pizza, pasta, burgers, fish...you name it, they have it.  The decor is a bit upscale from Cheesecake in my opinion and the spot just off of Michigan Ave is bright and airy and friendly. There are numerous spots by the windows for those who like to see people walking the streets (currently bundled up in 10 degree temperatures...). The food is always good. Nothing super fancy, but tasty with large portion sizes. Service is usually pretty good, though lags when busy (last time, we had to wait about 20 min for our bill).  Overall, it's a nice spot to stop for a break. Price-wise, it is reasonable and more economical than some spots near Michigan Ave.
