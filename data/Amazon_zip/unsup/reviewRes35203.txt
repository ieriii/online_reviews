Duck was fantastic. We had a reservation, and they served us almost as soon as we sat down. Leading with duck and mantou, followed by duck bone soup, duck noodles, and duck fried rice. Overall, a delicious and filling meal (managed to satisfy 6 hungry college kids with 2 ducks). Service was pretty solid too, no-nonsense and efficient. I think it came out to $17 a person for the meal, which is a little on the high side for us but not bad for a once-a-season meal.
