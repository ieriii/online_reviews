I must get wine if I do come back to this place. I believe they have a good selection of drinks to choose from. This place is packed! When I went here, there was a long table which the staff seated several different groups at once. I didn't mind that part except it was a little loud to hear what my friends were saying. I don't remember what I ordered but the food was great and overall, I enjoyed eating here.
