I am a huge fan of Gilt Bar. The ambiance (music, lighting, decor) is unique and laid back, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the food is fantastic.  Then menu is pretty expansive and everything I've tried is great. A few recommendations: the Paloma - deliciously sour but sweet tequila cocktail Triple cream dlice de bourgogne cheese with apricot preserve & herb salad Bouchot Mussels with white wine, shallots and herbs - big, succulent mussels in a rich (but not too rich) broth Gunthorp Farms Roasted Chicken - simple, juicy and delicious; probably the best chicken I've ever had (and i'm very picky w/poultry) Kennebec fries Brussel Sprouts with bacon And last, but most CERTAINLY not least, the mint chip chocolate chip ice cream is homemade, loaded with chips and to die for.
