I can only speak for the lobby/bar area that every hip hotel seems to have these days, but damn if they don't mix some good cocktails. After an evening of beer and wine, a few of the heavier drinkers in my group of co-workers (i.e. everyone under 35) decided to head here for a nightcap. Although I spent much of the next morning wishing I had just gone back to my hotel, I enjoyed a very delicious cocktail in the form of the "Lakeshore" that evening. If I remember correctly, it was some sort of vodka/gin concoction with honey melon and cucumber. Delicious, but deadly!
