Pequods is by far the best Chicago pizza. It doesnt get the recognition it deserves. The part of the crust that looks burnt is the best part. Only thing they can work on is the service. Our waitress wasnt friendly or attentive, and it wasnt busy. But overall this place is worth the mediocre service.
