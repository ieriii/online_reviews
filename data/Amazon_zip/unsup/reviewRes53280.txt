In a nutshell, it is a sophisticated place with good food. The only thing I dislike about Alinea Restaurant is you need to book room months before actually visiting the place. I guess, this comes naturally with being one of the world's top restaurant. Coming to the food, I was pretty much impressed with the way it was presented. Forget about the actual taste, but only the presentation manages to convince you psychologically that the food is awesome. Having said that, I would also like to advice Alinea Restaurant to work on its service. The service you get here is definitely not anyone would expect from a high-end restaurant. This is the only disappointing factor I came across.
