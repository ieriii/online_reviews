On a weekend trip to Chicago we decided to use Yelp to help us find a delicious place to eat... and Yelp pulled through!!! Chicago Q. We walked the mile and found a cute clean looking white building that looked like it belonged in the country side on England. After being seated they brought us delicious homemade bread and butter pickles and homemade BBQ chips! Delicious! The wait staff was so attentive and brought us more refills then we could handle. Luckily we arrived early enough that they were still serving brunch so of course we ordered a bloody mary and a mimosa. When it came to dinner we all ordered something with Kobe Beef. It was perfect! I got the Kobe Beef brisket that come with 4 sauces and a huge hunk of Delicious corn bread. Needless to say everything at this place was fantastic and I would and have recommended this to friends visiting Chicago.
