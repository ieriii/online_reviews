In a word: mmmmmmMMMmmmmm 'twas packed so we ate at the bar -- bartender was awesome, super friendly, good story-teller and knew the menu well. All great attributes in a bartender. Long story short: Beers -- great! Encased meats -- great! Burger as big as your face -- great! Bravo Logan Square! You have a gem.
