A love letter to Fogo 2 Go: I love you Fogo 2 Go. I love everything about you (except your prices..they are a bit high...) I love all of your pizzas - every single one....even the awkard breakfast pizza with the egg and canadian bacon on it. I love how you are just as good the day after I order you as you are the moment you arrive at my door. You are the best pizza I have ever had in Chicago - wait..in Illinois - no, that doesn't even do it. You are the best pizza in the world - maybe even the galaxy. I would eat you every day if I could and not weight 900 lbs. I love you that much - but frankly I don't want to be fat so I have to curb my love a little bit....I have recently moved out of your delivery area and it breaks my heart. Thankfully I have a car (or my boyfriend does which is practically the same thing...) and he can drive me to your pizza heaven goodness. I will make the trek for you Fogo. If I lived in China I would fly back to Chicago just for you.  Fogo - you complete me. Samantha
