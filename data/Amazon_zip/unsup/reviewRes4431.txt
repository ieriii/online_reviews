It's been about a year, but I can't forget how cool this place was. It's a great bar to hangout and listen to some classy music, like jazz or big band. This is the bar where Al Capone used to hang out at. You can easily get sucked back in time with all the classiness in here. We were on our way to the airport but lucky enough to have a few hours to catch a glimpse of the roaring 20's at this swanky spot. They don't have food, but you can bring food in from one of the restaurants nearby.
