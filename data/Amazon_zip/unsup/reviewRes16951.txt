Came here for valentines day '09 and was very happy! We had quite a wait, for the Saturday night V-day, even with 10:00 pm reservation!!!! The chips and guac was great, my pork was amazing, boyfriend's steak was just ok. Our Mac n'cheese side was delish. The atmosphere is amazing. It's a huge space with lots of great people watching. Must try Carnivale!
