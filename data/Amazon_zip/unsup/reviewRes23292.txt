I frequent Irazu with the Jason E. below and am one of the people who love the potato tacos (or are the taquitos?) Anyways-- I'm all about the shakes-- I like them with water instead of milk, especially the fruit ones. The service is extremely friendly and speedy-- but the place is definately a tight squeeze when full-- But its part of the charm i guess. Two things that take away a star tho-- (1) no dogs on the patio-- I understand why they dont do this, but in the spring/summer my dining decisions are based almost solely on being able to bring my pooch with me (2) cash only-- for gods sake people- i realize it is a pain in the ass for retailers to use credit cards (fees and the like) but in the end-- if i dont have cash on me i'll opt for someplace else (who carries cash nowdays?)
