We entertained some clients the other night- a Thursday- and I cannot imagine a better locale for that sort of engagement. Really we couldn't be more pleased with our aesthetic, culinary or dining experience. We started with some delightful cocktails, apps to share and entrees. All were very well presented and constructed. I would definately return on my own or for business.
