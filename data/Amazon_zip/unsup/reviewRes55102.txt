WOW, What a wonderful time we had. Were do I start. The staff is AMAZING. The bartender made us a new drink we had never had before and she (Jenn) explained how she prepared the drinks. Very fresh and delish. She also suggested a nice bottle of wine for our meal that was outstanding. Now the food. We live in Missouri and raise cattle so we are very critical when it comes to beef and the preparation. Had the pot roast, the best you will ever taste in your life the flavors blended well I had the pasta w.homade panchetta, again the flavors were outstanding. GET the fries. Best dining experience I've had so far in Chicago. We will be back again and again
