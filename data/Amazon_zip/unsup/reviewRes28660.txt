One of my favorite meals ever. Went for lunch and had to come back for dinner. The sopes were delicious. The Enchilada Mole Pablano were incredible. My buddy had the Puerco Milanese lunch special. Outstanding! The wait at dinner was over two hours on a Tuesday night. I hung around the bar and found a spot. I met another solo diner and was able to try two tamales (yummy) chips and salsa (ditto) and had the Ribeye for an entree. Everything exceeded my expectations which were pretty high. It's a lot of money for "Mexican food" but not for a memorable meal. Highly recommended.
