THis is a pretty cool place to eat/drink. It looks kind of like a scene. I've mostly gone in groups or with friends, but is a perfect date place if you're trying to take someone for dinner. Very cool lounge upstairs too for drinks, although not cheap, drinks mostly over 10 bucks. If you have a big group make a reservation. My favorite item is actually the pho appetizer. THe decor is very cool. Kind of has this jungle decor (but fancy jungle not janky), and all the waiters are dressed in traditional Vietnamese outfits. THey play cool lounge music the whole time you're there too so you end up feeling like you're at a really cool place.
