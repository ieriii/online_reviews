I made the trip out to Fox & Obel because I had a $50 groupon that I needed to spend. And wow, I was definitely unimpressed with the store and its offerings.  First of all, it was pretty small and the aisles were somewhat tight and hard to maneuver around. Second, the prices for the food definitely seemed overpriced. Now, don't get me wrong - I don't mind paying a bit more for quality food, but the prices here made Whole Foods prices look cheap in comparison. The beer and wine section was pretty tiny as was the cheese. But, there was an interesting array of chocolates, pastries, jams, spices and sauces to choose from. Perhaps I would have been more inclined to try the items if they didn't cost so much. Maybe it's just me, but I'm not really willing to drop $11 to $12 on a bar of chocolate! And, I'm a chocolate freak so again, I don't mind paying a bit more for quality items. I didn't see that much staff around. The woman who helped us at the prepared foods counter seemed nice, but our cashier wasn't nice at all and seemed irritated that my boyfriend and I didn't unload our cart full of items. We were the only ones in her line so what were we supposed to do - hand her each item individually so she could scan it? Needless to say, I don't think we'll be making any special trips to this place anytime soon. If we want any "gourmet" items we can easily stop by the local stores back home. Maybe I'd try the cafe, but after reading some of the reviews, I'm not sure about that either.
