Well, the chicken is definitely crisp. The Korean Seoul sauce was pretty tasty. However, my chicken was a bit dry but still good,  The French fries were so truly a puzzle. They seemed horribly overcooked but not burnt. Absolutely NO taste or texture just sticks of petrified vegetable.. This isn't something you could eat everyday but definitely a treat once in a while. Just stop at five guys for a take out order of fries.
