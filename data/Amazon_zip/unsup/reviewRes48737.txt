I've longed to go here since they opened. Well, I finally dined here on Sunday for dinner. -Hostess: warm and friendly -Main waiter: too scripted and you can tell he goes over the menu and beer list way too often. Disappeared too often and we waited a lot. -Seating: communal and not my style. We were seated on the corner of the "L" shaped table. Because we sat in the corner of the table, my man and I stared at strangers the entire time. -Food: *Oysters (dozen chef's selection) The BEST in Chicago, hands down. *Country ribs (not what I pictured in my mind when ordering) 3 or 4 boneless strips of delicious pork and acorn squash. *Skate fish ($20 and it was a small portion.) Not my favorite dish and I probably won't try that again. *Frites with 2 eggs was alright but nothing special.  -Drinks: Had the Samuel Smith organic lager and Krankshaft Ale. Loved the selections!!! Overall, it was OK. If I go back it will be for 3 dozen fresh shucked oysters from both coasts but that's about it. We went home and made spagetti for dinner to make up for meal.
