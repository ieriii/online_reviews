Arrived with reservations and were seated right away. The beer menu is lame, but my wife's Sangria was tasty, and their specialty drinks were a little more extensive (and expensive). Tried a bunch of stuff, most of which were above average. The Bacon Wrapped Dates, Empanada con Espinaca, and Patatas Bravas really stood out, as well as the Chef's Cheese Mixto. Plenty of flavor in the dishes, and like anywhere else, you have to try as much as you can until you figure out what you like the best. Of course, this approach will allow you to ingest some less savory dished, but I've yet try something I absolutely disliked. Wasn't a huge fan of the Verdosa Salad. My wife's Gambas (Jumbo Prawns) were intimidating (staring back at her LOL) but she liked them. Definitely worth checking out if you have some cash to burn and want to try something new. Call ahead, make reservations, and leave the kids at home for this one.
