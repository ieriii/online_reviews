When my friend wanted to go here for dinner I was skeptical. How could I feel full having a crepe? Boy was I wrong. Every since I have been craving a dinner crepe from Icosium! Their crepes are light and fluffy and include tons of ingredients: veggies and meat. The one crepe completely filled me up and left me satisfied.
