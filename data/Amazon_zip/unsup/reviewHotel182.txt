I grew up in Chicago and early last month I came with my four year old son for a visit. We had a horrible experience with the front desk but everything else was perfect. I really liked the rooms and every other experience with the hotel staff was just fine.  Here's where I found impressive. After I filled out the survey, the head of security emailed me because I'd only rated his department an 8 out of 10. I told him that I could have very easily given him a 10 but I found it ironic that he'd reached out to me because it was the front desk I had a horrible experience with.  So he connected me with the head of rooms. After much phone and email tag, I finally was able to communicate why the front desk fell WAAAAAAAAAAAAY SHORT. The rooms manager then gave me a free certificate for my next stay. Wow. Totally unexpected. That's awesome. Guess we'll be staying there again.
