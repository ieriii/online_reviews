This place has what we now lovingly refer to as the "WBTB" aka World's Best Turkey Burger. If you are a lover of turkey burgers and have tried them frequently, you should be familiar with the fact that most of them come out dry, flavorless and like a hockey-puck. Not here. They're super juicy, filled with seasoning and they let you substitute it for any of their other fantastic beef creations. My friend doesn't like "meat that's like meat" but she is obsessed with this burger.  I've also tried the beef burgers...I had the Division burger. It was done Med (like I asked) and is stuffed with mushrooms, onions and gouda, then topped off with bacon, more cheese, BBQ sauce AND comes on a pretzel roll. Are you kidding me? Freaking ridiculous.  They have some pretty great drinks too...they're a little $$, which sucks, cuz they're so tasty you suck'em down like Kool-Aid and then you end up with sticker shock for lunch. But I suppose if you have self-control (unlike me), you'll be ok.
