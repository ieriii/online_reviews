Great experience here last week, our server was amazing, I would say one of the top servers I've ever had. We ordered the mussels and Bison Tartare and both were amazing. You get a huge bowl of mussels in a great broth with some rustic bread for dipping. I was actually quite surprised as to how good the mussels were. The Bison Tartare was excellent. It had a nice kick to it and the meat was super flavorful. I loved it! I will definitely be returning after last weeks experience. Start to finish everything was great!
