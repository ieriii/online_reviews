A breakfast/brunch place on Sunday morning at 11am with open tables and no line? I've always thought those were magical unicorns, but apparently they DO exist...in The 3rd Coast. And I'm not quite sure why...the food is FANTASTIC. Light, fluffy omelettes, slabs of applewood bacon, thick slices of marbled rye toast, strong coffee...this may just be my new go-to brunch spot. Of course, the menu is substantially more limited than Yolk or Eggsperience or the new kid in town, Hash House, but if you don't need the choice of a gazillion types of omelettes, you'll be quite happy here. And they have pretty good chilaquiles, which are hard to find in Chicago. Service was pleasant and attentive and the vibe is very casual and laid-back. Think coffeehouse that serves stellar food. Prices are a bit steeper than other brunch places, and there is a $1.50 upcharge for egg whites only (sad face). But to save the "waiting in line headache," it's a decent trade. I'd never heard of The 3rd Coast before, and perhaps no one else has either. That's fine--I'd like to keep it that way, because we all know that waiting for brunch blows.
