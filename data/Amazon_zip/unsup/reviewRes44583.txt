I walk by this bakery every morning on my way to work and it takes a lot, I mean A LOT, of will power not to stop by and pick something up. That's even after consuming close to 1000 calorie breakfast at home. But I gave into the allure of Alliance a few days ago - bought the 'everything' bagel with cream cheese. Yea, this bakery has awesome cake, pastries, little cookies full of joy and even surprisingly tasty 'harvest' salad. But the BAGEL. O. M. G. For once, I couldn't wait to get to work, sit down, spread the cream cheese all over the bagel and stuff it in my mouth. Seriously, every bite of that bagel, even when not toasted, was so amazingly good. Bready, hint of sweetness, soft yet tiny bit crunchy on the outside, with pungent garlic and onion bits, plus just the right amount of rock salt bits here and there. I say, there was a party in my mouth. I'm not sure if they make the bagels there. Regardless. Best bagel ever. I like Alliance a whole lot, but the only reason I give it 4, instead of 5, stars is that the sitting area could be brighter.
