This place used to be hit or miss for me (I don't know if the brunch has gotten better, and they used to have an amazing chili dog that's now gone), but then I discovered the reuben. It tastes EXACTLY like a real reuben. Now I crave it all the time.  They also have booze, which is cool. Sit outside during/just after rain and you'll get eaten alive by mosquitos.
