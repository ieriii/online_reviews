Let me tell ya about Garcia's. The service is the worst - but that is only because they have 4 or 5 servers total and it's busy nonstop. I'm actually kinda over Garcia's at this point...no, wait. I have a love hate relationship with Garcia's. If you can sneak a meal in the back bar, that may be your best bet on a Friday or Saturday night. Their Carne Asada Burrito Suizo keeps calling me back for more. There's no arguing with this monstrosity of gooey chewy goodness wrapped inside a huge flour tortilla - it has a mind of its own. It knows things. My last burrito told me to give Garcia's at least 4 stars or it was going to send Hayzeus after me. So, let's talk about the pitchers of margs that come full to the brim, with glasses that are already full. Can you believe that? Believe it. If the food never gets to your table, just order a pitcher of margs and wait - I promise you, it will taste that even better when it finally gets into your mouth. That is the golden rule of burritohood. Thanks.
