Love to be able to get a slice of stuffed pizza rather than an entire pizza. Being able to get what I want rather than what the hubby wants is a plus. It was $3.25 for a slice of pizza so I was geeked! Hubby though is crazy. Our bill ended up being $16 since he always orders way too much food. Drives me nuts since I'm trying to be good and he's always influencing to be bad with that garlic cheese bread (wow, was it yummy!) The only problem was that there wasn't enough "Stuff" in my stuffed slice. I asked for the spinach, mushroom, onion slice and it hardly had anything other than cheese and bread in it so I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise it was pretty darn tasty.
