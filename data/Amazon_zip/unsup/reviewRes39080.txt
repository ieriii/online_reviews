Pros: -Authentic Korean food -Korean-speaking Korean workers -Nice seating arrangements: towards the back, there are short tables for Japanese-style sitting -Safe location -some (yet often crowded) lot parking Cons: -nobody who works there speaks really good English. -my wife got sick off the eel roll -MSG ALERT: they mix MSG in with the sushi rice! Also, not much on the menu that does not include MSG. -Sushi tasted like it's been sitting out for a while (not frozen, but not fresh) -expensive for the quality of food...we paid $33 for 2 small entrees. It's not bad, but definitely NOT a place where you'd say, "Yeah! Let's come back here again!"
