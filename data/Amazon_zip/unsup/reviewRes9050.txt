The food was ok. Best thing I tried was the chicken soup....I inhaled that thing! It was literally gone within seconds, not minutes, seconds! It was rich and yummy and oh so filling. It has veggies and some grains (barley I believe) Sounds so good on a cold winter night. The soup was a 5 everything else a 1 kabab was overcooked and rice was tough. but i'm a iranian food snob, so it might not be as bad as I'm making it out. so we settle on a 3. Thank you noon o kabab for your amazing soup! Delish!
