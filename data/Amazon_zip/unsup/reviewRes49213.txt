I'm infatuated with Alliance Bakery. I think about it all the time and I have to talk myself out of taking a quick stroll to grab a coconut macaroon bar. (If only I knew the nutrition facts...) I'm usually in and out of there real quick because there's something kind of embarrassing about going into a bakery and buying goodies for yourself. If you only buy one thing, it's pretty obvious that it's for yourself. But if you grab a FEW things, it could seem like you're going over to a friends place for some afternoon tea...at least that's my justification for picking up more than one delectable item. I've never been in the lounge and after reading the reviews, I don't think I will, ever. I'd rather enjoy my baked goods in private and not have to pretend to study.
