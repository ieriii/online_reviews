I would actually give India House 3 1/2 stars. They have good service (sometimes a bit slow in terms of getting the bill out, but that's to be expected at an Indian restaurant. They want you to enjoy your meal). Their food is decent. The lunch buffet dishes don't have quite the kick I would like. The restaurant definitely has some nice decor, and I think that is reflected in your bill. Don't get me wrong. The food is good, but I think it's just a bit pricey. I will continue going to Devon Street and Gaylord's for my Indian cravings.
