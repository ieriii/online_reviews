I go here for one thing, and one thing only: the Bison Tartare. Oh. My. God. I have never eaten anything so delicious in my life. At first, I was really hesitant, and kinda grossed out..but all that needed to happen was for me to take a bite. I've been a believer since! I had the mussels too, which I wasn't THAT impressed with. I've had better. But seriously? The bison tartare....I could eat 2 orders all on my own. Yum.
