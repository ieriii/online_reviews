Really good food, alot of it, and reasonably priced. Plus we got to bring our own bottle of wine! (there is a corkage fee). The only downside is the ambience itself--the floors ceiing and walls are all hard surfaces (tile, marble) and sound carries a lot in here. Can feel a little like a cafeteria.
