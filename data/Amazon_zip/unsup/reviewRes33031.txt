What filling breakfast... wow... I was full until dinner after eating at Yolk. When we arrived the place was PACKED! There were people waiting inside and outside. We got in queue and was told the wait would be around 45 minutes. No problem on the wait because my friends and I can just hang out at the park across the street haha. By the way, make sure all of your party is present when they call your name because you won't get a table unless everyone is there. I ordered the "eggs benedict" because the menu boasted that it was voted best in town lol... well... I can't say it was the best in town but it was pretty darn tasty. I especially loved the potatoes, best part of my plate. You get a lot of food on your plate as well... meat, fruit, bread, eggs, potatoes... so full... Some of the other things my friends ordered were "banana nut bread french toast", "hey ricky", "countryside skillet", pancakes, and coffee. I'm pretty sure everyone enjoyed their meal because they kept eating even though they said they were stuffed lol... If you have time for a wait, then I recommend you stopping by for a bite at Yolk.
