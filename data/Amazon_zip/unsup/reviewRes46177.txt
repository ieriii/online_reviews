I do not think that the Grand Lux cafe is anything like the Cheesecake Factory. The food is sooooo much better here! I have visited the Grand Lux while in Vegas and it is fantastic food. The Chicago restaurant is just as yummy! I usually have the steaks and add a side of eggs, but I decided to try something different. The clam chowder is to die for. It's creamy, rich and chocked full of fresh clams. I also had a side of fresh greens with the house dressing. It was fantastic! Then came the buffalo bites and sticky wings. My husband and I hate that we had to share, but there was plenty of food for us both! This place is amazing and I HIGHLY recommend it!
