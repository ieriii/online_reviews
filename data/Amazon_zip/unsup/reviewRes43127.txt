Wow a cool space!!! great decor inside and very, very calming/relaxing. Nice mix of people on a Saturday evening- young, old, glam and not so glam. Food was GREAT! had the mushroom truffle pasta that was outstanding and the house salad- dressing was amazing. Drinks are about $10 a pop and well worth it as they are different than the usual. Drinks are handcrafted and staff seems to be knowledgeable. Basement is a great concept of a speakeasy. Totally worth going down there- drinks there, however, are cash only. Reason for only 4 stars- our server was less than stellar- waited along time for drinks and service- def. will be back- upstairs bar is not that big, so plan on coming for food- outdoor seating as well!
