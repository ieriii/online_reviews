Chicago may brag about BBQ, but this place finally delivers on the quality. The food is just great. I was lucky enough to take a tour of the kitchen and the manager pointed out the various woods used for their respective meats, the massive smoker, mentioning where and how much they bring in daily. They clearly know exactly what they are doing. The collard/mixed greens are perfectly firm, yet tender. The mac n cheese is rich and creamy. The WINGS- whoa. A+. It's really a great place. Most BBQ joints around town are just that. Joints. This place is a top notch restaurant. It is a top tier place, but not so high end that they tinker with your meal- you won't get "their version of pulled pork" or anything like that. You get real BBQ, a nice setting, and great service, too. I've been here a number of times and have not yet had a slow or negligent server.  Overall, a great place that I hope stays around forever.
