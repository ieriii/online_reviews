Great location, great food, great decor, OK service. Working in River North, this is a great place to meet friends or take clients. Last time the girlfriend and I brought a couple from Louisiana. Needless to say they were a little baffled at the way we do things up here. The decor is superb. Modern yet comfortable. Great seating arrangements around some interesting architecture. The lighting is comfortable for a dinner setting and does not leave you squinting to see your company. They were actually filming a http://Match.com date when we were there, so that may have helped with the lighting. The food was great. I arrived late and had to catch up as everyone was finishing up with the meats. The salad bar was filled with multiple selections of vegetables, sides, and everything you could want in an upscale salad bar. When the meat came I was so happy. Definitely the best part of the meal. Great cuts of meat, and a lot of different options in case you aren't strictly in a beefy mood. The habenero glazed chicken and the ribeye definitely were the best. The only problem was getting one of everything. I felt bad, but I kept flagging down the same guy to try and get the last few samples I had yet to try. Took about 15 minutes, but I finally got them and was satisfied. Overall service was decentbut the manager did check on us a few times to make sure everything was satisfactory. That made me feel better. Great date venue, as well as for guests. Be prepared to spend a decent amount of money, especially when drinks are involved.
