My roommate and I really like this place. So much we've had it twice in two weeks. My spinach quesadilla was delicious and her steak burrito looked yummy! We ate it up and had leftovers for later! Another thing we loved about it was the large guacamole was huge and super fresh with chucks of avocado. They throw in two bags of chips for plenty of dipping. We had asked for a side of sour cream, which was pretty big, not some little plastic shot glass-like cup. The guy at the register was super nice and asked if we wanted some salsa too and give it to us fo free! We will definitely be ordering from this place again.
