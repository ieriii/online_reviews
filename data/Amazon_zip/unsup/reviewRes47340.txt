The food is not bad, and it's clear that the owners have invested much time and treasure into this place. Now that we've gotten that out of the way... I like to drink; I like to eat. I cannot stand to do either of those things here. Everything about the place feels so tacky and forced. From the lasers, to the fog, to the "dozens of plasmas", to the bizarre interpretation of metal (Nickelback? Three Doors Down? Creed??) it just feels like the Chucky Cheese version of metal. The odd promo events for flicks like the latest Jennifer Aniston paycheck vehicle don't exactly exude metal either (though maybe 90 minutes of prison). If the faux metal stylings weren't so central to The Lockdown experience, this could be a three or four star neighborhood bar and burger joint. As it is, it's a loud, obnoxious place that I can't enjoy lingering in. The place is wildly out of line with the neighborhood aesthetic. I'm not sure what neighborhood I would expect a bar like this thrive in, but it's not mine.
