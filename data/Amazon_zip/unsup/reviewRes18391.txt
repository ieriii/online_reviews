Whenever people ask what I would want to have in my perfect meal, I always have a hard time coming up with a definitive answer. However without a doubt, my perfect meal, last meal, meal if no calories existed, whatever hypothetical you want to pose, would definitely feature XOCO's hot chocolate. Damn. Wow. Holy sh!t! The hot chocolate here is perfect. Thick consistency. Sweet but not cloying. Rich and full chocolate taste. Slightly acidic/tannic. If you order the Aztec you get some heat to boot. I also split the soft-serve with salted caramel and bacon maple streussel which was equally delicious. While the tortas and caldas are undoubtedly sublime, coming here with my girlfriend just for dessert made for a great end to our evening out downtown. If you see the line looks too long during dinner time, try coming back for dessert. You won't be disappointed!
