A generous bowl of basic pasta for $8.00. A nice bowl of fresh soup for $4.00. That's the way Italian should be. And that's probably why The Pasta Bowl has been around for such a long time, giving Lincoln Park residents (and probably a lot of DePaul students) a reasonably-priced dine-in or take away option for Italian. In a recent visit here for lunch, six of us ate for about $40.00. Now two of us only had bowls of delicious lentil soup. But the rest of us had spinach salad, sides of meatballs with sauce, the mac 'n cheese with broccoli (Mmmm) and pasta with clam sauce. Share and share alike was the order of the day. We got efficient service with a smile, and there was no need for doggy bags. I had not been here in quite awhile and I was happy to be back. The Pasta Bowl makes a great take away place for a picnic in the park, lunch or dinner at home, or dining in. Not much on ambiance, but practical, tasty and a good value. I never could understand $30 per person for pasta. And I'm happy when there is a purveyor of pasta who agrees.
