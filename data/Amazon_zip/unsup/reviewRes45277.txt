Second visit tonight. This place is amazing. The flavors! The service! The charm! It might be my favorite neighborhood Italian place in Chicago. Highly recommended: the pastas, any of them, although the agnolotti w/goat cheese, orange and fennel pollen is beyond words. And the polenta w/spicy rapini starter, another fave. And the (fantastic) wine selection allows a "by the glass" quartino, which is the perfect amount. Had a different waiter each time and have just adored each one, making for two wonderful evenings. I was happy to see that they were crowded tonight, on a Monday. So hopefully they'll be around for a long, long time.
