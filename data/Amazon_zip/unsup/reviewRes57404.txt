My wife and I frequent the Mayan Palace fairly regularly and unfortunately our great dinner was overshadowed by an unpleasant experience at the end of our night. A young lady who identified herself as the owners daughter yelled at me and two other patrons outside of the restrooms. She was eating a full dinner at the bar during dinner service and didn't like that the two gentlemen in line in front of me were discussing using the restroom. I suggested that maybe she shouldn't be eating within a couple feet of the restrooms during a busy dinner service but she wouldn't hear of it. She was quite rude an I was embarrassed for her. It seems like daddy's girl has a lot to learn about the restaurant business. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in Chicago to put up with that nonsense.
