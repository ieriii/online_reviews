I Traveled from Cleveland, Ohio to come to Hot Doug's I seen this unique place on No reservations. I made mistake. I tried to just up and go to hot dougs thinking that I can just drop in and get me a hot dog and leave. So Cleveland is a Hr behind so I looked at the Chicago clock I realized I should just leave my hotel and GPS.my way there.. Nada.. I didn't know I used my yelp to figure out what time they closed and to my Surprise 4pm!!!! I rushed there I got there and turned down the street and there it was I made a left on West roscoe and to my Surprise there was a line 3:58p Friday mind you. I parked and walked in line I was behind a kid that had a Hot Dougs T on he turned to me and told me the three hurtful words... Sorry were closed..:(... I made it my determination to come back it was labor day weekend so they would be closed on Sunday and Monday I seen this line out the door so it must be worth it. I tried again around opening time 10:00am I made another mistake got there at 10:22. Line out the door again I am staying in this line.!!! I'm going to get the full experience. I was last in line and nobody behind me for 15 mins or so... Then people from everywhere bus, bike, taxi ,walking OMG !! This place must be the truth!! My turn came to enter into this place. For one the smell GRABBED my attention!! I was in the doorway then to my Surprise Mr. Doug himself was taking orders I asked him to give me all the suggestions I went madd and ordered the foie gras n duck sausage wild game sausage which was Alligator,Smoked yak, the K C Carr which was Shrimp, pork, mustard grits, also regular Chicago's own dog two others ate them all by the way...EXTREMELY GOOD!!! I But the ABSOLUTE BEST!! Duck Fat Fries!!!! Dear God!!! Sooo goood!!! Satisfaction I tell you. I frequently come to Chicago but I nnnever been here. But for now on I will put this WORLD land mark on my agenda for now on! Well worth the wait!!!
