Great pizza and even better appetizers!  Goat cheese w/ marinara and toasted bread - truly undeniably fantastic! wish there had been more bread but the pizza crust was a perfect substitute.  Medium Traditional Red Pizza -half pepperoni and mushrooms -half sausage, banana peppers and black olives I like how the pizza's not too cheesy and there's a good amount of toppings. I don't like how the crust can't support the toppings - everything ends up sliding off before it can make it onto your plate if you don't hold it correctly but the flavors make up for this one flaw. And when you get to that end crust - its like a whole other world. Crispy and buttery with a good crunch! Not one of the best pizzas in town but definitely a good spot if you're hanging out with a group of friends who love beer and pizza!
