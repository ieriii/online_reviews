My girlfriend and I went there for lunch just today because I have been hesitant to try the place out since I remember the restaurant before it at the location and wasn't impressed at all with it.... Anyways, I am very glad that we came in! The portions were excellent and a side order of fries (had to have them after reading reviews about them!) with the Mana Mou omelette was more than enough to fill both of us. The smoothie we had (peach mango smoothie on the specials) was quite fresh though I don't think the fruit was ripe enough as it wasn't that sweet... It was still very good though! So the food is very good and I liked their smoothies. It was because of service that I had to take away a star. I read some other reviews complaining about the service and I was hoping that this wouldn't be the case. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't good. Our waitress who took our order could of been having an off day, but she really didn't pay any attention to us and wasn't very friendly at all. The busboys were great as water was always full, but they weren't obtrusive even when clearing plates. It just didn't make up for our waitress. I had to go back to work and we could of been out of there 20 minutes before if our waitress wasn't just sitting at the juice/coffee bar. I will definitely go again for the food! Just hope the service of some improves!
