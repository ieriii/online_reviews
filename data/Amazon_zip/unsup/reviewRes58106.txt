My husband and I just went to this restaurant on 8/11/11. I ordered the General Tso's chicken and he ordered the orange chicken. This is actually the second time I've been here, and I can't see myself returning. The chicken was so hard and tough that it was difficult to cut and eat, especially without a knife. The texture of the meat was also a little questionable. It was extremely tough and unlike any chicken I've ever had. The sauce over the chicken was the only thing I liked. While we were there it was really uncomfortable because in the middle of dinner the manager went off on one of the cooks and waitstaff. He was yelling so loudly across the restaurant that the whole restaurant turned to watch him. I thought I saw the manager even hit the cook a few times. The manager looked like a time bomb ready to explode as he walked throughout the restaurant and then out the front door and back. He signaled the waitstaff constantly and it was stressful watching him. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.
