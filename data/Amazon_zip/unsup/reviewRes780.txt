Hot Doug's, Hot Doug's, my favorite place to beeeee! Expecting to try different places in Chi-town during our visit, we ended up at Hot Doug's twice in one week. About an hour wait, but SOOO WORTH IT!! Prices are reasonable and everything on the menu is heavenly amazing! My favorite out of all is the foie gras one and some chile/spicy one. Duck fat fries are yum yum. Love the crowd, no rude people or anything like that.
