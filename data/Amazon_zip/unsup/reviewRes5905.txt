Individual little key lime pies. Not slices. Pies. SO CUTE. We had these adorable teeny tiny pies catered in to the office for my boss's boss's birthday. I always like free food at work, but it's especially fantastic to get a mini-key lime pie! We need more office birthdays, stat. The pies are so tasty, just the right combo of sweet and tangy (and so beautiful with the fluffy whipped topping and key lime zest). They're almost too much to handle in one sitting...which is why my leftovers (and some others, I'm sure) made it into the office fridge with passive-aggressive warning notes written on the box. You know, friendly reminders such as "Touch this and I'll kill you!" or "This pie has cyanide in it!" or "I spit in this dessert, still wanna eat it?" It's that delicious. My infatuation with the key lime pies made it really easy for Stacey A. to drag me out to Wildfire for dinner. I am in love with several things about this place: - They will make your steak blue for you. This makes me happy, because I kind of like a cold center. - Bearnaise sauce. My arteries hate me, but my stomach just loves me. - Our waiter described the 007 Martini as "Veeeeery veeeery strong. So much gin." I'm going to go enjoy my food-coma now...
