I love Pizza. I love Beer. Piece is a pizza place that makes their own beer and they do both very well.  Saturday afternoon and this place is hopping! Started with their Kolch style beer which was great and moved to the white pizza. Crispy, chewy crust, thin and perfect with my beer. The ambiance was lively, had the games on TV and you could just see everyone having a great time.  It reminds me of a neighborhood joint - but bigger.
