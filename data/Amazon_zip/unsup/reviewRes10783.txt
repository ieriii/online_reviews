With 818 reviews, I can't imagine what one more would do...but I'll write it any way! Somehow I've managed to avoid Piece, not on purpose, but just out of my lack of interest in big, sports-type pizza places. We decided to go here the other day during a hockey game, and it was really fun! The service was ideal: laid back and not naggy. The environment was pretty nice too, I was surprised at how big the space is inside. The high ceilings help to alleviate the roaring of hockey-ees. Also, Piece is the kind of place you'll most likely see other people you know there. I don't know why...and I've only been once! Anyways, the food was darn good too. I ordered just a lunch-size mini pizza with veggies and it was great. It also wasn't too expensive. Good place!
