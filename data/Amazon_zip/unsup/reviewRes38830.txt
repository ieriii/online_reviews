I have eaten here several times, and order pizza delivery at least once a month. Their sauce is great, and the thin crust is crunchy-just the way I like it. If you pick it up and tear a hole in the bag on your way home, it stays crunchy longer. I love the Chicken Vesuvio-LOVE. I could eat just the sauce with their great bread and be happy. Salad bar is average, but tasty, and they have that sweet creamy garlic salad dressing that I can never get enough of. Service is always good, and the atmosphere is that perfect cheesy Italian that I cant get enough of. Even better because I love the food! They have a full service bar and a live band, not sure if its only on the weekends, or what-but the people watching is highly entertaining. I have also used the catering service and was surprised at the price. Not bad at all! While this is no where near fine dining, it is FANTASTIC family dining done very well.
