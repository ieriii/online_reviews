This is a fantastic high-end restaurant if you 1) love meat, or 2) love unique restaurants. The decor is very unique and the atmosphere is wonderful. We went for dinner and enjoyed attentive waiters, dimmed lights, beautiful food presentations, and great service. We were interested by the woman on a bungee cord who danced through the air as she tended to their multiple-story wine case, we were surprised by the freshness and selection of the salad bar, but most interesting of all was the main course. When you're ready, you flip your card over and waiters fly to you with various cuts and kinds of meat. Don't want it? That's fine. Want more? That's fine too. Want it a little more done or less done? Just say so and they'll have your piece out shortly. It's like a buffet of meat that comes to your table. Don't forget to turn your card back over though because within a few seconds, you'll have a heaping plate full of the most varying meat cuts you could have ever imagined, and you wouldn't want it to get cold! Don't worry though, all you have to do is flip the little card over again and the servers will bombard you with new fresh meat again. I don't think we saw the same kind twice, and they were great about special requests and accommodations. One in our group doesn't eat much and wasn't feeling well - all she wanted was a few things off of the salad bar. We offered to pay for just a salad bar, but the manager didn't even charge us for it. That's the kind of place Texas de Brazil is. As long as you like meat (and bring an empty stomach!) you will love it!
