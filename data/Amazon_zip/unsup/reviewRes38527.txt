If you like beer, I mean REALLY like beer, like you roll it around in your glass, sniff it like the guy from Sideways and savor the carbonated goodness as it glides down your throat, then this is your place. The Hopleaf is a haven for beer lovers. With a menu (yes that's right, a MENU) of beers from all over the world you're sure to find something that makes you drunk. I might suggest the 10.5% alcoholic Delerium Tremens. Or, you could just close your eyes, flip the pages and point. That works well too.
