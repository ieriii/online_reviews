This place has one of the best Indian lunch buffets in the city. And, yes, that includes the many restaurants on Devon. The price for the buffet is about $15 but it's well worth it. The buffet changes their items from day to day, so even if you go there a couple times in the same week, you're guaranteed to try new things. Also, the naan is delicious and the tandoori is always tasty. The place can be a bit crowded during weekday lunch time, so go early (11:30) or later (12:30) to avoid the crowds and waits. I have dined here for dinner, but it's so expensive that I would not recommend it. While the food is really good, you get a lot more bang for your buck if you go during the buffet time, and can try so many more things. Indian food is never meant to be enjoyed by just having one dish! Additionally, the place is clean, nice atmosphere, and the waitstaff is generally on top of their game,
