They don't take reservations, so big groups will be hard to seat. Thankfully, there were just two of us so we only waited only 10 minutes. The matre d' was not friendly or helpful. He didn't suggest us anywhere to go while waiting (there is no waiting area)...I had to ask if they had a bar etc. This is when we discovered Wangs which is next door and connected to Wakamono. Wangs ended up being the best part of our night and we returned after our meal. Back to Wakamono...the menu seems extensive at first glance, but after further inspection, it was not very original. Most of the specialty rolls have either mayo or cream cheese.  We still tried one, and the mayo was so heavy that we couldn't taste the fish. We had the seared tuna appetizer, but that was bad too---not the fish, but it was so soaked in butter that my date couldn't eat more than one piece. We therefore ordered sashimi (more $$). Finally, were able to taste the fish and it was actually quite fresh. Also, pretty loud atmosphere-at time shard to hear my date.
