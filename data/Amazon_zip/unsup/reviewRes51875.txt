Went here on a whim after walking down Mich Ave. The server did tell us that the thin crust takes about 30 minutes and the deep dish about 50 minutes. Um, OK, guess we can keep the 6 young kids entertained. First up: Thin crust pizza. Just OK. We typically like our thin crust lighter on the cheese side, and this was heavy cheese. Crust didn't seem to have much flavor. Sauce was tasty as well a pretty good pepperoni. But 30 minutes? Its thin crust! Then came the deep dish about 25 minutes later: Sauce was again very good, as well as the pepperoni. The crust really made the pizza a 3 star pizza. It was too crunchy (hard)..and the texture was like a hard biscuit. It was deep dish, maybe 3/4 inch thick...not the thickest thick crust I've had. Overall...it was just OK. Maybe better planning would have helped by ordering ahead of time, but we'll see about a next time. We're from Detroit, so no stranger to really good pizza. In fact, the local Chicago deep dish place (Buddy's does not count as Chicago style), Pizza Popalis, beats out Gino's East...much better crust (a buttery, almost layered soft biscuit type crust).
