I started eating meat again when I came here; their chicken enchiladas in green sauce are perfection. Except for the kind of crazy decor it feels like you just sat down in someone's home and are eating a meal prepared just for you and your friends. I enjoy the slightly grilled, freshly baked tortillas that come for everybody. I don't know if it's really b.y.o.b., but we did, and no one seemed to mind. I would come here a lot more, if it weren't so far away. For all of you who have a car or don't have to take 3 el lines to get here, if you are in the mood for Mexican food, why go anywhere else?
