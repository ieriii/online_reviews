This was my first time having Ethiopian food, and honestly, I was impressed! it's weird at first because you aren't really eating so much as dipping a sponge like bread into different flavored sauces. You can order meat like beef or chicken to go with your entry. My favorite drink was the coffee. it was a Turkish blend and absolutely delicious. I have never had coffee quite like this before. I would recommend going if you are feeling bold and want to try something new. Oh, and did I mention that they are vegan friendly??
