Shaw's Bar is worth the tight fit, for friendly faces, and a kick ass oyster bar! If you want service in the bar, Jessica will warm your heart, and suggest awesome sushi rolls! Maybe I will venture in the dinning room someday, but I like the high energy, while I peel my crab crab legs and eat like a cast away! :-P....
