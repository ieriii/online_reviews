My third favorite restaurant in Chicago (behind Frontera and graham elliot) but of course Sapori is way more affordable. I am addicted to their gnocchi with pesto sauce and grilled chicken. Plus, they have a great wine list and friendly service. Two pointers: 1. Always bring a coupon (or go on Mondays for the family style deal). You can fill out the review that comes with your bill and they will send you a $14 off coupon too. 2. Always make a reservation. They're on open table, so it's easy.
