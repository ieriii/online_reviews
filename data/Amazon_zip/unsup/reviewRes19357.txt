The Gage is another must visit whenever I'm in Chicago (which unfortunately isn't enough). A must have are the scotch eggs. A hard boiled egg rolled in sausage and deep fried served with a side of grainy mustard. Simply amazing! We split one on this visit although I wish I'd gotten my own. The mussles were recommended to me by the GM at Publican as the best in town. They did not disappoint one bit! They come in a vindaloo sauce with a long thin slice of garlic toast. We killed the mussels and bread and ordered some extra bread for dipping. By this time I was pretty full but I had the Gage burger coming. This was the only disappointment as I didn't like the malt roll (it had a rye flavor to me and I don't like rye bread). I still enjoyed the meat but couldn't finish. Instead of fried I subbed brussle sprouts. These were creamy, cheesy with a little bacon. Delicious!! I highly recommend The Gage. I suppose due to my burger I could give 4 stars but I should have known better on the malt roll.
