Had to write my first review after visiting Piece and was so disappointed. Had heard nothing but good things about this place and wanted to try.  First the pizza was OK, the beer was good, the Caesar salad, not so much. It was papery lettuce with zero taste dressing and anchovies thrown in.  The service is a conundrum, with some nice people, the hostess, male bartender, our male server. But the snarky doorman and the rude female bartenders, just wow.  This place is extremely crowded, with a young crowd, and I know why. I don't know why anyone would tolerate long waits in a crowded place for hit or miss service and just OK food in a really loud setting.  Was excited to try it, but bummed afterwords. Many other places to enjoy good pizza without attitude.
