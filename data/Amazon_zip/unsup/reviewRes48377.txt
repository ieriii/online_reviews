Here's the thing. The fact that I can't bring myself to recall exactly what we ate save for a few things speaks VOLUMES- I can recall the entire menu that we ate at Bristol on opening weekend! What a beautiful space though-- the interior is amazing. But VERY LOUD. Like "can't hear the person next to you" loud. The food was good, but just good. The basque stew was good but not worth the $18 we spent on it-- the crabmeat was tough from being overcooked and the mussels weren't that great either. Beer selection was also good, but it's no Hopleaf. I will HIGHLY recommend getting the Java Stout from a small brewery in Louisville-- quite possibly my most favorite stout ever, super smooth and chocolatey without tasting too sweet. Service was just okay-- they're obviously very big on coming to the table every five minutes, which is something that drives me bonkers. Don't ask to take my plate if there's still food on it. And please don't ask more than once. Also, not a big dessert menu-- would've been nice to have something sweet after all the beer. All in all, I recommend it, but maybe go during the happy hour and do small plates as a group. For a special occasion out with me and my man, it wasn't anything spectactular.
