It's pretty simple. I could say a million things about how wonderful this place is, but I can also say it in a short few. Amazing food. Wonderful selection of beer. Yes, most of the beer here is pricey. If you want Bud Light, go to Bar Louie. The servers can be a little cocky, but just give it right back to them as if you know exactly what you're ordering, and they'll leave you alone. The only sad thing for me is that, being on the south side, this takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r to get to - but always well worth the trip!
