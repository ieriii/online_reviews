Fabulous, mind-numbingly extensive beer selection and above-average pub grub. If the downstairs bar is crowded -- and the downstairs bar is almost always crowded -- ordering a drink can take eons and may lead you to suffer a massive coronary from pent-up frustration. Table service outside of the restaurant is spotty as hell. Poor staff. Hire more of them.
