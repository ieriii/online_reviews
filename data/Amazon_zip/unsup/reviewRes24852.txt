Came here a few times while in grad school at UIC and always loved the atmosphere. Now I work in elsewhere on campus and just used Artopolis for catering last week. I was very impressed. Ordering was a breeze--plenty of detailed information on the website and the people I spoke with on the phone were pleasant and efficient. The food went over really well, especially with the vegetarians in our group. I especially liked that they had a lot of options that could be served at room temperature--a variety of salads, fruit, assorted mediterranean dips, mini desserts and those yummy mini artopitas (love the spinach ones!). Nice for warm weather and/or functions where you don't have a lot of time to spend setting things up. Everything was packaged nicely and delivered ready for presentation with serving utensils. There are a lot of favorable reviews on here of the actual restaurant, but I wanted to give them a nod for their great catering services.
