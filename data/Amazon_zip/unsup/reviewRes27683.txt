Very good, but maybe not crave-able. We shared the half (sausage, spinach, onions) and half (sausage, olives, mushrooms, onions). Seemed to be top-notch ingredients and good flavor overall (LOVED the spice on the sausage). I liked the crispy/chewy crust (is there cheese in it?) but husband was not a fan. Would consider if in the area, but maybe not as a destination.
