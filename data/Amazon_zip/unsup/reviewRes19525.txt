4 1/2 stars I wanted to save my 100th review for someplace special and this is it. The Gage. I can't help myself. I can't stop going to The Gage. Is it me, or is just getting better day after day? This place is more than a pub, the owners call it a gastropub and if you've read anything outside of yelp on this place you'll know that the chef is constantly working to create unique and delicious dishes, and not just in the name of science. The dishes are accessible and they taste amazing. Go luxe and start with the NC 17 Fondue or Goose Rillettes with whiskey cherries, don't pass on the peppered hanger steak "salad" and indulge in caramelized lobster. The tuna tartare just about the best I've ever had, and their "local" sausages are simply incredible. Their burger is one of Chicago's best, to be sure, but don't too quick to choose; consider the seasonal slow-roasted halibut with white asparagus and morels. Art, on a plate. For dessert I like to move back up the menu to the Second course and order the daily cheese selection. Please sir, may I have some more? The service is as detailed as the dishes. Waitstaff is berfriendly and efficient. The room is quite cool too, even being street level, which can be problem for some restaurants. Who wants to sit in traffic [don't answer; I know a lot of you love dining on the sidewalk, it's just not my cup of tea]. The bar at The Gage has some very creative mixologists who can pull a Guinness just as adeptly as they can shake a mojito. Get thee to The Gage. I'll see you there.
