I'm a huge fan of this Wildfire and have eaten here a few times with family. I love their cocktails, and they not only have great steaks (their signature), they also have a variety of other selections for those who don't like or just plain don't eat steak. The interior is gorgeous and really feels like I'm in in an old fashioned mansion, cozied up to the fireplace. Although the restaurant can get a little noisy it's never so crazy that you can't hear your conversation. Every time I've been here service has been wonderful. The bar area looks really fun to me as well every time I come here. If I ever, in some moment of insanity, moved in with my dad, I think I'd come for happy hour every day!
