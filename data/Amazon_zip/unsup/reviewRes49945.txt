i've been to fifty/50 many, many times. of course, because there's always a reason to go back = THE WINGS! the wings are definitely, hands down, the best wings i've ever had. they're HUGE, crispy and juicy. i usually get regular, bone-in wings with ranch. just a forewarning, they fry them in peanut oil. i am allergic to peanuts, but the allergen is usually not in peanut oil. however, it does give a stomach ache. now you should understand the dedication i have to these wings. a little gas never hurt anyone, especially for these wangs of heaven. the burgers are very good, too - you can choose your own toppings and the selection is vast. chipotle aioli is good, fried onion straws, egg, etc. the waffles fries are my favorite (i recommend the chipotle aioli to go with) and so are the sweet potato fries. as a side, the cornbread is sweet and savory, with bits of corn, and the asparagus is cooked to perfection with a bit of lemon on top. as for the nightlife, it's your run-of-the-mill sports bar, and the crowd is pretty similar to what's around there. you won't find many hipsters, just older yuppies, if you will. 50 is one of my favorite sports bars to go during the summertime. the deck is open, the TV is outside, and it's bumpin'. the servers are super nice, too. i love drinking outside on a beautiful summer day. good memories (you know who you are).
