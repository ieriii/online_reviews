Went here the other night with a friend, everyone is surprised when I pick steakhouses as I am a life long vegetarian but I find Steakhouses generally have amazing sides! And with Ruth's I was right again, the chop salad was bizarre looking but very good, Asparagus and mashed potatoes were fantastic!  My friends steak was good, he had the Filet and he said it was very good, he ordered the shoe string potatoes as well but beware it's a HUGE order! I had a hurricane at the bar waiting for my table and it didn't taste like there was much alcohol in it, so after that we stuck to wine.
