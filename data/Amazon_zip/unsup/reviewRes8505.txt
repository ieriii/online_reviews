Bianco Nero flavor was good, and I loved the simple red sauce on the Margherita--very Italian. But overall a little pricey for limp crust! I lived in Italy and expected thin and crisp. Quick for take-out, and no, the crust wasn't soggy from steaming in the box. We opened it as soon as we got into the car. By contrast, the tartufo was fantastic and worth every penny.
