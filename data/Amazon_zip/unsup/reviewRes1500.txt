We were fortunate to find parking close to the place but at the same time turned off by the long line of hot dog enthusiasts that extended almost to the next block. The first thought was to come back on a slower day but then it was Wednesday afternoon at 2pm. It could not be slower than that. So we lined up. The line moved quite quickly and soon reached the owner who was taking the order. My gut was telling me to order one of each dogs but I restrained myself to order a Keira Knightley and my wife ordered a Selma Hayek. We each ordered duck fat fries. We absolutely loved the dogs but I was not able to taste the difference between normal fries and the duck fat fries. I am not a big fan of hot dogs normally but I really liked the dogs here. Selma Hayek, as suggested by the menu was not as hot as Keira Knightley though.
