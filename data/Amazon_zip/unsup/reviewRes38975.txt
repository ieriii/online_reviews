Talk about some Old School Chicago! If (excellent) margaritas with your Italian food, accordian players and singers accompanying your evening, and twinkle lights indoors sounds like the most amazing night possible - then you cannot go wrong at La Villa. To me, this is heaven. Here is a secret about this place: if you want impossible amounts of food to finish, you must order the eggplant parm which (from what I could tell) is the only dish that comes with the salad bar, soup AND a pasta side - holy cow. Talk about bang for your buck. Now, I will say the food isn't the BEST Italian I've ever had, but it is definitely decent - and I consider myself an expert on the subject, being an Old School Chicago Italian. If you want amazing food, go to Sabatino's - If you want an entertaining, really fun, great meal - go to La Villa! We celebrated my BFF's birthday here, and the whole staff was terrific.
