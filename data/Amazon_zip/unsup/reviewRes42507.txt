The best Salmon I have ever had! I cannot stop talking about the salmon. I am a seafood lover and have eaten salmon since I was 10 years old. I have not tasted anything that compares to what I experienced at Gilt Bar.  Let me take a few steps back... a friend was looking for a spot to celebrate her birthday. She found this joint through Yelp. We decided to make reservations and try out Gilt Bar on a Friday night. The minute we walked in, we loved it. Our waiter (Johnny) was super friendly and welcoming. Before we could put our order in, we digested the atmosphere, admired our surroundings and agreed that we made the right choice. We started off with a glass of Malbec paired with the sweet balsamic roasted garlic & olive oil on toast--magnificent! We were very tempted to order another but we decided to order our entree. We decided to try the Salmon-- and in case I have not conveyed my feelings for this salmon enough, it was AMAZING... and the capers were the icing on the cake. Once we devoured our meal, we decided to sit by the comfy couches to finish our wine. We also noticed some people ordering some food while they sipped on their cocktails in that area (which I thought was a cool alternative). I am so going back soon and taking the hubby with me, because not only is it perfect for a girlfriend's day out...it is perfect for a hot date too!
