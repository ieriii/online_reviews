I came here with a friend who said 'You have to try this place! And we might see a celebrity' So I said, 'uh. yeah!' The atmosphere is incredible. I feel like everybody should go here at least once. I just got a tequila sunrise, which was delicious. I can't wait to go back and try some food sometime. Side-note: The staff was hilarious and awesome. They were so much fun! For real, if you live anywhere in Chicago, be sure to check this place out! Tip: $5 valet parking.
