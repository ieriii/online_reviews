My second visit here confirms it: best thin crust pizza and an amazing beer selection. I understand that pizza is kind of a personal thing--one person's "awesome" is another's "OK." That being said, I've had some good pizza in Chicago, both thin and Chicago-style deep. Sure, Spacca Napoli is good; and Lou Malnati has a special place in my heart. But this place is most remarkable. I don't know how they do it, but Piece's crust is just about perfect: just thick enough, crispy but not like flat-bread. And they have the top figured out too, with three different styles. The beer selection is great too. Yesterday I had a Canadian bottled beer called "La Maudite" that was just right for me: full bodied and satisfying, but not so heavy that it was overpowering. Give it a try. The room is so-so, with most of the seating at long communal tables. Lots of TV's around usually tuned to some sport event or another. Service is friendly and efficient. Both times I was there after lunch hour, so I don't know how busy it can get. But from reading some of the other reviews here, I'd say be prepared for a wait if you're there at "rush" hour.
