Everything's excellent. Especially the Wasabi mashed potatoes, the Godzilla roll, the deep fried crab rolls (not sure what they're called) and pretty much everything. Service is great, price is right. BYOB is certainly a plus. It's got my vote for the best sushi in town. Cool place, great food, right price. Go here and you won't go wrong.
