The porchetta paired with the risotto was absolutely delicious! I had to stop myself from licking the plate. My boyfriend had the strip steak and he felt it was very flavorful and very tender. Our wait was only 10 minutes if that-- we were seated very quickly. And our server Ryan was very attentive and helpful. I want to come back here for brunch.
