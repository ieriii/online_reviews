Pequod's does a nice job of making a pie that is half way between a deep and pan pizza. Its not too cheesy and not too crusty...its just perfect. Though I will say, its much better at the restaurant. Its good when delivered, but better pipping hot in the pizza dish. The restaurant itself could use a makeover, but I suppose that's not the reason to go there. I really enjoy thin crust, but when I want to go deep, this is where I go.
