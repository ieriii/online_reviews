As a former resident of Chicago I always make it a point to get my hands on some deep dish pizza. This time it was a traditional sausage and if didn't disappoint. I recommend you be prepared to wait and keep the number of slices per person to 2. This ain't New York style thin crust where you can devour nearly a whole pie... Customers can put away about two pieces on a good day at Ginos!
