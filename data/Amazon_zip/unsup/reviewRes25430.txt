Have been several times prior to this evening and found the food especially good. But tonight must have been an off night. Each dish was overcooked or soaked in too much oil. Was very disappointed, as I'd invited a friend to treat him for his birthday. There are so many excellent tapas restaurants in Chicago with much more exciting and well-executed food and far better prices.
