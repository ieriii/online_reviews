the purple pig wrapped up in a pretty little bundle? small plates, communal seating, long hours, and located on the mag mile! highlights: roasted bone marrow with herbs (creamy and luscious, paired perfectly with herbs/capers), pig's ear with kale, peppers, and egg (adore the crispy texture mixed with the gooey egg yoke and acidic 1-2 punches of pickled peppers), and chicken kabobs with fried smashed potatoes (incredibly juicy and worked well with the crisp potatoes dipped in tzatziki). disappointments: braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (the meat was very tender but was extremely salty to the point it was inedible and was returned to the kitchen and replaced with another dish) and meatball sliders (lacked flavor and was a little off-putting being served on brioche buns). i'd actually rate this a 3.5 based on those lackluster dishes, but rounded up given their overall charm and kind staff. looking forward to another visit to try their other dishes. i'm now craving their fried pig's ear dish... nom nom nom...
