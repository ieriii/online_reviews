out of the big three... lou's, gino's, and giordano's... this has to be my least favorite. they are known for their stuffed deep dish... a little different from the normal deep dish. i felt as though the cheese overpowered everything. believe me... i love cheese but i like to enjoy the whole essence of a pizza. the overall texture was more soggy than i would have liked it.
