I am not really one for big box restaurants, but if I am going to one, chances are it will be Grand Lux Cafe. There simply is no way that you can go wrong with that choice. The wait can be long, depending on when you go. Because it is in close proximity to the Magnificent Mile, there is the constant flow of tourists and locals who appreciate good food. The portions are large, huge, colossal, wow! For my most recent visit, I tried the garlic shrimp pasta. Wow! Love all over the plate and I was quite happy after all was said and eaten. Ordered the molten chocolate cake for dessert and that was so ridiculously wonderful. I cannot say that I will return any time soon because the last thing I need is to fuel my food addiction more than I have already.
