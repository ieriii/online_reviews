Visited last night to cash in a Groupon, so take this with a grain of salt for that reason if you're inclined. First visit to this or any similar restaurant, too. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, but weren't seated until 20 minutes after that - and it took another 10 before we could get plates and hit the salad bar. While we waited, we took a seat at the mostly empty bar and noticed a number of empty tables. It appears they were short staffed, rather than short on space. Our poor waitress seemed to be spread too thin - we didn't get the mashed potatoes and bananas she talked up until we were nearly done eating, and it took 20 minutes for our water glasses to be filled. Plus another 20 minutes at the end of the meal after we asked for the check for it to come. The meats were good, the salad bar too. Food was a solid 3-4 stars. She appeared to be trying hard, and it looked like other guests were having similar issues, so all I can figure is that they were badly short of staff on the last night of a groupon. The place wasn't packed by any means when we got there at 9:20pm (first available reservation!), so it made for a pretty poor impression overall. We tipped well and got out... eventually. Fairly or not, I'm chalking it up to management issues.
