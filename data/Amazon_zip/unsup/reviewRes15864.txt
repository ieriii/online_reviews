This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is very romantic, the service is wonder (after being there only a few times, many of the staff will recognize and greet you by name) and the food is just to die for. The pasta is amazing! For something that will change your outlook on life, try the Farfalle con Scallops. It can get a little crowded later in the evenings, especially on Fridays and Saturdays, so plan ahead.
