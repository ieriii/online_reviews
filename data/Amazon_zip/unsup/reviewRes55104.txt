Boyfriend wanted to try this out so I complied. We went there last night and it's all I can talk about today, telling so many people. We shared the smashed red potatoes, the cauliflower, ahi salad and by far the best thing was the cornbread. I know, cornbread? But seriously, it's the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. My bartender (we sat at the bar to eat), was so informative (Zach) He knew his stuff inside and out.....go there, try for yourself!!!
