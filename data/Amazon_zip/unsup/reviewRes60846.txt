1st time at Zed451 and the great experience began as we walked through the entrance to a fabulous ambiance and welcoming host. We were seated immediately upon arrival and provided with an informative explanation of the seasonal signature dishes and harvest table selections.The harvest tables had a wide variety of items that included an amazing seared ahi tuna dish. The selection of cheeses was also more than satisfactory.After enjoying the harvest tables, the Zed451 experience got even better as the assortment of signature dishes were brought to our table by the chef. Among the most succulent dishes were the Buttermilk Sirloin, Amaretto & Pistachio Duck Breast and Fire Grilled Ribeye. (Wow, my mouth is salivating thinking about it as I write this!) The service was superb and friendly as the waitstaff and chef were available to answer all of our questions and additional requests for our favorite signature dishes.Overall it was a fabulous dining experience and met all of my expectations. The ambiance, service staff, chef, menu selection and tastiness of the signature dishes puts Zed451 near the top of my "will return again" list.Love this place!
