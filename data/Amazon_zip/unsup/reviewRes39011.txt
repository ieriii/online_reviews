I easily get lost in reading reviews of Longman & Eagle for hours. Each negative review I spot sends me down a rabbit hole of negativity that was created by individuals that I would advise to discontinue visiting restaurants. If twenty percent of your reviews are negative, perhaps I should hold your hand and choose food for you the next time that you dine somewhere. I would hope that Kuma's always has a better burger than L&E because that's the only thing that they're known for. I don't want to know what place you'd rather dine at that's better, but not in Chicago. If you feel like the menu is somehow pretentious and confusing, perhaps you should embrace the Information Age and pull out your phone to learn a thing or two about food. That's what I do. If you often end up waiting for hours to grab a bite here, that's what you get for working from 9 to 5. I'll never forget the day that I called my dad to let him know that he was wrong. A life without alarm clocks is possible, unless I'm taking a nap. For now, I will continue visiting this place to confidentally get some of the best food that I will likely ever have in my life.
