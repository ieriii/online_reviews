Bad Apple + a trip to Half Acre brewery across the street = an awesome start to a Saturday.Bad Apple has awesome food, delicious blood mary's and a pimp beer list. I'd definitely recommend trying this place. The staff is really friendly, the space is always clean and the service is good. Price point is totally reasonable too.
