I've only eaten delivery from here so i have no idea what the restaurant is actually like... that said my experience was extremely positive. We started with hummus and baba ghannouj which were both delicious. They have a wide variety of kebabs; poultry, fish, beef, lamb and veggie. I decided to try the beef and got the Chenjeh (ribeye) & Koubideh (seasoned ground beef) kebab combo which comes with really great dill rice and grilled veggies. Everything was great, i can't wait to eat here again!
