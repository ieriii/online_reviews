This was my first experience dining at a Brazilian Steakhouse. I enjoyed it but, I can't say that I would pay $50 per person for what I ate. I prefer my meat to be cooked medium rare. Majority of what was offered was cooked medium to well done. For me, it doesn't matter what cut of meat you bring, if it's cooked medium to well done it's a waste! There were a few selections of medium rare and they were very good. Great seasonings to give a delicious and slightly smokey flavor. The other star was removed for the long lull in between meat offerings. Each of the offerings were brought out simultaneously. Then, there wasn't any for a noticeable period of time. I guess we could have revisited the salad bar, but we were there for the meat. The buffet was very good. The oysters definitely help makeup for the lack of medium rare meat. The service was great and overall we really enjoyed our experience. I just hope the next time we visit they will have taken my advice and offer a better variety of preparations.
