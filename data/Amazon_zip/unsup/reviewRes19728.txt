I can give this place 5 stars based on their churros alone...but the rest of the food is good too :-p. The ingredients are all very fresh and the meats come from range-fed, hormone-free animals. I tried one of the soups and one of the sandwiches and both were really good. Be prepared to stand in line. During the summer it is very hot and cramped, even a bit claustrophobic. Regardless, the food is worth it and you may just get to see Rick Bayless as well.
