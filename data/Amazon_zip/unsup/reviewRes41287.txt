Our dinner at Ruth's Chris during Restaurtant Week was absolutely wonderful. Even though it was a busy Saturday night, we were given a great meal and superb service. First - We were seated on time (which I now find impressive on any Saturday night in downtown Chicago). Second - Our steaks were awesome. We did the Restaurant Week $33 menus and it was a great dinner at a great value. I think the 8 oz. filet is the perfect portion for a rich, juicy steak like that of Ruth's Chris. Third - We had a really great waiter Brian. He was very attentive, and he made us feel like royalty in the way he served our table. It's so rare you get a waiter who really listens and goes the extra mile....we totally appreciated him. It was a great experience!
