When I first arrived in Chicago, everyone raved about true Chicago style pizza. "It's to die for", said one my friends, who admittedly loves anything that would scare the pants off of a health freak. Fortunately, I am not a health freak, so I was happy to indulge in this culinary treat.  I had very high expectations about Giordano's, because everyone raved about it. To be fair, Giordano's does makes a quite good Chicago style deep dish pizza. For those who haven't been initiated, certainly give Giordano's a try. Just make sure you show up early, because it will definitely take a LOOOOONNNNGGGG time to get seated, as this place is always busy with tourists and locals. The ambiance is enjoyable, but the service is not good. The servers are pretty abrupt, and it can be a real pain to try to get a refill on your soda. If you order your pizza for take-out, make sure you check in with them regularly, as they rarely call your name until a good 20 minutes after the pizza was ready. Despite the hype I wasn't that impressed, and at $25+ for a medium sized pizza I was expecting more. Still this is good pizza so give it a try.
