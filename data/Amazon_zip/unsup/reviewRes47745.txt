Went for the brunch, and the service was amazing. 5 stars for the service, 3 stars for the food. The waiters/sous chefs were sooo warm and hospitable and the volume of food was ABUNDANT. Unfortunately everything was oversalted for my taste and it was leaving me with a need for some bread which they didn't have. Keep in mind their salad bar has no leafy greens, just prepared salads already doused in oil/sauces. But definitely indulgent.. the cinnamon roll is OMG good.
