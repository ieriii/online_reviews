The first time I went here it became arguably my favorite restaurant but the second time was not so good. Either way you can't really go wrong if you like meat. This is a meat eaters dream. It is relatively pricey but its more like those places you go once every year or 2 for a special occasion. You could go more often but then you'd risk cardiac arrest. I'm definitely going again in the future but honestly I'd rather eat tango sur on a regular day. It is much easier on my wallet.
