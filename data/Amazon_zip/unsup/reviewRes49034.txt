Went for brunch last Sunday while visiting Chicago from SF Bay area. We had a ball! Loved sitting at the communal table (folks in Chicago are SO friendly!) and tasting numerous delicious treats. The sticky bun was perfection - not too gooey, just right. But the cranberry-ricotta toast was even better. Husband and I fought for last bite. Delicious little green salad with basil-buttermilk dressing that took it beyond the level of ordinaty butter lettuce salad. What else did we try? Sausage, bacon, a pork shoulder and grits dish - they all were top notch. But I can't forget the scrambled eggs. I know, why would I even order boring scrambled eggs in a place like this? But they were the BEST, creamiest, most lovely scrambled eggs I'd ever had. Service was great, too - friendly, attentive, all that you'd want. I highly recommend Publican for brunch. Salilvating now as I think of that sticky bun...
