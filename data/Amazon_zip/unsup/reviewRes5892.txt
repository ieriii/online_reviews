I went here at 630 on a Monday night and it was pretty darn busy. I met up with 3 lovely yelpers for dinner and boy- oh- boy was I im-puh-ressed! The others got nice yummy looking cuts of cows but I was in more of a chicken mood and the chicken dishes I wasn't really feeling either, so I got myself the Teryaki Chicken Salad and it was quite yummy. I also got a side of wild rice and shiite boy! I could have eaten a whole vat of that stuff. Everybody really seemed to enjoy their meals as well. As dessert, we all loved. Myself and the two ladies opted for the half order of the Oatmeal Berry Crisp. And the only man ate the entire 4 scoop sundae by himself, after a new york strip steak, a vat of soup, and bread. Here are all the Useful things for you: 1. Make a reservation, they are expected unless you plan to dine in the bar area. 2. They have petite cuts of meat if you want a smaller portion of meat. 3. They have half orders of all their desserts except the sundae and the chocolate souffle. 4. Be prepared, quite expensive. 5. Make sure you have ample time to check out all the pictures they have in the front area, there is one picture of 4 women eating spaghetti without hands, one girls' boob is totally out of her dress.
