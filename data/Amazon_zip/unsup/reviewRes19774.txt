We were downtown for the Festival of Lights and decided to turn to Yelp to help us determine where we should stop for dinner. When we saw the number of reviews XOCO had, (over 1,000.... CRAZY!), we knew we had to stop. As we approached the building, there was a large coach bus sitting there. We saw a line of people and thought it must be people waiting to get on the bus. WRONG. The line of people was for XOCO. XOCO Rule #1 - expect a line. A super nice guy from XOCO came outside to talk to the people in line. We were debating whether we should wait or not after he said it would be about an hour. He convinced us that we should.... so there we stood. We waited.... and waited.... and finally it was our turn to order our food and see if this over-hyped restaurant could really live up to its reputation. The guy was right- it was just about an hour wait. All I'm going to say is that it was probably some of the best food I've had in my life. Seriously. Based upon a recommendation from the aforementioned employee, I tried the Milanesa - a Torta made on the griddle: Crispy Gunthorp chicken, black beans (made with pork), artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa -$10.00. All of the flavors blended perfectly. I washed this amazing sandwich down with a glass of their homemade lemonade which was insanely tart... but delicious. After we finished our sandwiches, they brought out the churros that we ordered with some chocolate sauce. Fresh churros. I watched them making the churros as we stood at the counter to order. They definitely taste better than your average churro you'd buy from a street vendor. I wouldn't say the chocolate sauce was fantastic, but the churro definitely was. Now... the only problem is that I live in the burbs and will have to drive myself to the city and pay to park, just to partake in the wonderful food XOCO offers. But.... it will all be worth it. XOCO is a must try... even if you have no idea who Rick Bayless is (I didn't).
