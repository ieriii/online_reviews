I have been wanting to try this place for so long and it completely failed my expectation. First of, the service was HORRIBLE. It took 15 mins for us to get a menu, 20 mins for our drinks, 20 mins for our appetizer, and an hour for our entrees. I mean I was ready to walk out of there before our entrees came. I feel like they pulled the dishwasher guy from the back and made him a waiter for the nite... very inexperienced. Food wise, margaritas were awesome. Problem is.. it's $12 for a shot glass size margarita. Appetizer were delicious. Again, small portion. And the long awaited entrees were nothing special. I was expecting to be blown away. I wanted to order dessert cuz I love dessert. But I didn't want to wait another hour for it. Overall, we wanted to just finish our food and get the hell out of there. After all this, we received a bill for $94. Seriously?! Seriously!! Enough said.. I've been to all the restaurants in the city and this is by far the worst restaurant experience in my life.
