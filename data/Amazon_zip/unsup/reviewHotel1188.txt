Location, location, location. Obviously if you are in Chicago for a conference at McCormick, then staying at this Hyatt is very convenient. However, getting around town can be a nightmare. Taxi lines were often 20 minutes or more, and there is almost nothing nearby that is worth going to.  The Shor bar and restaurant meets relatively low expectations. The drinks are decent, and the food is uninspiring, but edible.  Finally, the rooms are staid and cold. They have zero character, as if the decor was an afterthought to the location. I have slept in nicer rooms at 2 star hotels.
