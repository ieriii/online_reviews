Just tried this place out today! Service was good. The casado plate is good. The milanesa sandwich was a little bland. The oatmeal/banana milkshake was delicious. Overall, food was good, but nothing I would write home about. Will def be back to try other dishes noted by Yelpers! Warning: the milkshakes are big (and thick) so ask for it in a to-go cup and take it with you if you don't finish it.
