The little shack is the best! You won't be needing any ambiance. Just order a burrito or some tacos and eat in the car . Not out back mind you. You don't want to mess with the people trying to find parking to get in there. I live in Cali now and miss this place so damn much. Imagine my surprise when I ordered a steak burrito over here and it was filled with rice. I was like, what?! It's not like I never ate at another good taco place in Chicago. It's just that every time I did, I said to myself, this is good but not as good as La Pasaditas.
