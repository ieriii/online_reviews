OK, as weird as this sounds I am actually glad that Crisp wasn't around when I lived in this neighborhood, because if I did I would probably have eaten here constantly which (while utterly delish) probably wouldn't have been great for the girlish figure. ANYWAY, Crisp is here now, and if you haven't stopped in, what are waiting for?! Think you don't "like" wings? Been there, done that? The Spicy BBQ will smack you upside the head with flavor and make you a convert for life. The "Buddha Bowls" (aka be bim bop) are also outstanding and make for a great nibble in-between orders of wings. Because you can't eat just one...
