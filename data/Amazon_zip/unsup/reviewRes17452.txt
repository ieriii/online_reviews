Had dinner Friday at Carnivale. This is the 2nd time my husband and I have been there. Both times our dinners have been excellent. This time I ordered the pork chop (never have I ordered a pork chop in a restaurant). OMG! It was so yummy. It was accompanied with fafa (which is like whipped potato's, but not). My husband ordered short ribs which fell off the bone. EXCELLENT!!! If you haven't gone you should.
