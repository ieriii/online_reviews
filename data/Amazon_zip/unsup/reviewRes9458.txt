I was excited to hear the news about Sprout offering a brunch, and child free at that. A group of us attended their brunch soft opening this past Sunday. It was well worth the money spent. The menu is inventive, offering dishes from rabbit hash, to Caesar omelets, sturgeon lox platter, and lamb eggs Benedict. I opted for the latter. The lamb was extremely flavorful; very tender and more on the shredded side. It was served with leeks and fresh green beans which together tasted like a green bean casserole. It was served on top of what I can best describe as lightly fried croquette filled with a green pea compote. It was topped with one poached egg and mint leaves.  The service was excellent and very friendly. I was the first to arrive of our party. I was greeted with nothing but smiles and bright attitudes. I cannot wait to return for dinner.
