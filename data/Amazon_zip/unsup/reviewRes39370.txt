I've already reviewed Longman & Eagle once, but after staying overnight in their inn (and getting engaged there!!!) I had to update my review. My boyfriend and I chose to spend the evening of our 3rd anniversary at the Inn at Longman & Eagle, and to enjoy brunch there the next morning. Reserving a room was easy - we stayed in Room #4. After a bit of a slow check-in (heavily contributed to some credit card confusion on our part!) I was ready to get upstairs and put our bags down. The room has two huge windows, overlooking the patio. The bed is comfortable, and the bath/vanity area is GORGEOUS. I loved the simple but modern decor and the cute little touches, like the tape player and mix tapes in lieu of a TV and DVD player. While I was absent-mindedly reviewing the room, he popped the question :) We went downstairs to celebrate and were greeted very happily by the hosts and managers. They gave us champagne and a shot to toast our new Facebook relationship status (ha). The bar was hopping and we split a DELICIOUS pretzel with Welsh rarebit sauce to try to dry up all the celebration booze. It helped (a little.) The room is right above the bar, so for anyone planning to spend the evening overnight, keep this in mind. Hopefully if you've done it right you won't even notice, and the noise does quiet down before 2 am. The next day we enjoyed brunch. I had an excellent (and very necessary) bloody mary, while my fiance had a warm drink made with yuzu. He said it was very very good. He got biscuits and gravy, which are some of the best I've had, and I had a very good and light omelet made with ramps, morels, and English peas. Everything tasted delicious. Clearly my review is going to be colored very rosy by my experience here, but that's my experience. Yes, its crowded. Yes, sometimes you have to wait. It's worth waiting for. This place is always going to hold a place in my heart.
