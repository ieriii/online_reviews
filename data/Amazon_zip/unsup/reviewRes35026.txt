I have to be fair...this rating is based soley on my 3x in 3 week devouring of the same two dishes--The Red Dragon and the Omega roll. I have given up searching for good chinese take out, but when I need a quick, delicious sure thing....those will be my two dishes. Delivery super fast as well, but I hate the limited lunch hours/lack of on the weekend!
