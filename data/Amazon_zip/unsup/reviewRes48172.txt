I went to the Publican recently as a friend had offered to pay and, well, as a poor college student I couldn't afford to eat there on my own. But I'm glad I finally got a chance to go after friends had been recommending it for months. We got the platter of ham, the tomato salad thing, and the elote. The ham was amazing. I know this place is known for their meat, and I just wish I was more of a meat eater to fully enjoy it. But the ham was great. The elote was amazing as well. Such an interesting take on a Mexican dish - HIGHLY recommended. I can't remember the name of the tomato salad thing, but it was decent. It had anchovies so I didn't eat much, but my friend liked it. My only issues with The Publican are that, firstly, I didn't realize the dishes were for sharing. More like expensive american tapas than regular entrees. Had I known this, I would have gone with more people and ordered differently. Maybe that was my fault, I don't know. Secondly, this place can get really crowded. And the seating is communal, so you never really know if you're gonna be able to get a table or not... But I had an overall good experience, and I'll definitely be going back (when I can afford it).
