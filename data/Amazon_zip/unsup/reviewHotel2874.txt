This hotel gets high marks from me for it's consistency over the years. I stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers at least once a year for a global conference and it never fails to come through on all fronts. The guest rooms are spacious and very clean with all the special amenities and bed linens that make you want to stay in bed all day! The views are spectacular! Looking out on the lake, or the river or the city you really cannot go wrong. It makes our fine city look even better! The restaurants and bars have friendly and helpful servers working in them (a special thanks to the bartender in the lobby bar who brought a smile to my face the other night- you know who you are even though I've forgotten your name. Must have been all those martinis you were pouring for me!) I am here so often- that even the banquet help recognize me and say "Hi" and "Welcome back" when they see me. The Sheraton is located in a great spot- close to anything you want to do in Chicago and the concierge is always willing to toss out a new idea or two (especially helpful when all your global friends keep wanting to go get "Chicago pizza" or go to "Navy Pier" which, while great, are really not what I want to show people about our fine city! Valet parking is a breeze- just know that you need to take the elevator by the front doors down to the parking garage to pick up your car. It will not be brought around to the front of the hotel. Great location- close to everything Chicago has to offer, clean and spacious guest rooms, meeting rooms with all the necessary items to make sure things go smoothly, AND great help? Now this is a hotel that I don't mind coming to time and time again.
