Aside from Indie on Broadway and Thorndale, this is my favorite Thai place in Chicago. They probably tie for best Thai :) The service is quite cold, but trust me, you won't care once you taste the food. I get the same thing every time because it is sooooo delicious. It used to be #51 on the menu so my gringo-ass would call it that. Then they switched the menu around so I had to learn the name: Khao Soy!!! It's a coconut curry, rice noodle, chicken, vegetable extravaganza. Order it medium or spicy. The broth is out of this world. Perfectly hot, sour, sweet, salty. Uggghhhh! I want it now. The first time I got it, it was served with the thin vermicelli rice noodles. Then they changed it to the wide egg (?) noodles. So now they probably hate me because I request it to be made with the thin noodles ^_^ hey as long as I tip good, right? For apps: go with the tiger cry. A simple yet succulent beef dish with a ridiculous dipping sauce. They are always busy, so if you get delivery, expect at least an hour wait...worth it! The only thing I've gotten there that I wasn't fond of was the tom kha gai...I've had better...but I forgive them. If you eat there, it's BYOB, and there's a liquor store next door, attached to a really depressing bar.
