My girlfriend and I recently took a special trip here as I had a craving for a traditional Chicago Dog. Living in downtown Chicago I was all too familiar with the local places and wanted to try something new. So I ventured to Superdawgs, its a bit out of the way but as it is a Chicago Icon I felt it deserved a visit. Perhaps my expectations were too high going in! It was a very average hot dog and should not be considered a Chicago best.  1. The Hot Dog has no casing therefor there is no snap when you bit into it. 2. They dont use celery salt 3. Though I appreciate the wedge of tomato its much too big to incorporate into a bit of the dog. 4. Ditto for the pickle 5. The bun is over steamed and soggy due to being stuffed into a box with fries. 6. The mustard and relish was sloshed together so you could visualize or taste the difference between the two. 7. Bun doesn't have enough gluten in it to stand up to the large toppings and hot dog. 8. You have to reassemble the hot dog as everything is just thrown into a box. The key to any topped hot dog is have all the toppings incorporated into a bit. This is where this hot dog fails.
