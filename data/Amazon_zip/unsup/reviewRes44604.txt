This was our first stop for Chicago pizza. We got off the plane, found our hotel, and immediately went to this place for some deep dish (stuffed, I guess) pizza. This was around 4pm, neither of us had eaten too much since we'd been traveling all day. We split a 10 inch, and completely lost interest in food for the rest of the day. It was the strangest thing, I felt a little sick immediately afterward (from consuming dough and cheese very quickly topped by two beers), but after that, it was like I had just gotten all of my eating done, and could focus on other things. I didn't feel bloated or gross, just un-hungry. It was a little amazing. If I lived in Chicago, I could just eat here once a day and be set--it would be totally efficient. Our server was in training, so she was a little clueless, but she had a senior employee with her who was the model of waitstaff. He managed to always get us new drinks right when we realized we needed them, and he served the first pizza slice with a delightful flourish. The pizza itself was delicious--we had mushrooms, green peppers and sausage on half, but I can't compare it to other Chicago pizza hotspots, unfortunately (there wasn't enough time!). I will say that growing up in the midwest and sampling the best deep dish pizza that Fargo, ND has to offer, this stuff was much less greasy, and I'm drooling a bit as I write this. I will absolutely go back here next time I'm in Chicago.
