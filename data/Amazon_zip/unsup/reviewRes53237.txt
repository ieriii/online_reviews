I was running errands around lunch time and passed this place. I thought, "Why not? Happy I made that last minute decision. I walked in and was greeted with a really warm restaurant. It wasn't hot that day. But with the kitchen working I guess it can get hot but turn the air colder for guests and the cooks! I was hot just standing in their waiting for my sandwich. No matter. I was taking my bistec sandwich to go. There were so many options and everything looked tasty. I have never had Cuban food before so I went with something safe my first time. Prices seemed a little high. My sandwich cost over $7 and that was for only a sandwich. No drink or sides at all. When I arrived home and took my first bite, I knew I was going back. The sandwich was packed with flavor. It was also rather large so I ended up not feeling so badly about paying more for a sandwich. They have a nice patio out back and am planning on sitting there the next time I go.
