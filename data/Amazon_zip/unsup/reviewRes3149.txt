Gracious, this place is AUHmazing!!! I cannot wait to go back and try something new. I ordered the Chi Chicken Bowl...It was SO good that I was more focused on the food than my company....whoops! :) It's a quick eat kind of place - Communal style dining with long tables and benches - which is always fun! But my favorite thing about a place like this is when they put the sauce on the table so I can try all the different flavors - perfect! But, seriously. Go to Crisp! SO, SO, SO yummy!! And cheap! :)
