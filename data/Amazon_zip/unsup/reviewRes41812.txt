Restaurant review Pho for LIFE! I have come down to argyle for Ba Le and noticed how busy this restaurant is at the corner compared to all of the other restaurants around this area and I knew I had to visit. The place is bustling and all of the wait staff is wearing camo. The menu is enormous (i.e. Joy Yee large) including multiple entrees from pho to fried noodles/rice to lemon grass pork. I can't even describe how many items are on the menu, but I beelined to the pho section and was excited to see the large Tank pho which has multiple meat protein and ample amount of noodles. The broth is crisp and flavorful. I did not find it salty as other reviewers described. This is also complemented with a plate of basil, green pepper, and bean sprouts. This was delicious and I did not leave hungry. Although the pho dish is 8 dollars, what entree can you find that cost less now when you go out to eat. As long as they don't skimp on the meat and noodles, 8 dollars is not bad at all. Unfortunately I did not have room to try anything else but maybe next time! Pro: Large pho dish hits the spot, expansive menu, friendly staff Cons: small restaurant, you might have to share a table with someone else. Hidden gem: unfortunately no discounts found here
