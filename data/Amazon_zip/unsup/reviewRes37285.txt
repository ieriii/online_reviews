This is one of my favorite bars in Chicago to try interesting beers. Their menu is also interesting, but I can't say I remember what I ordered the one time I've eaten here. I prefer to go to Hopleaf to try new beers and for good conversation. Bell's Hop Slam provided the fab Brett D. and me with ample inspiration for good conversation. In fact, I almost bought a six-pack of it the same night for our BYOB sticks and rice excursion. But the beer packaging failed to mention anything about "ample notes of Grapefruit on the back end" and 10% alc. by vol., for a night to remember, along with a hangover you'll never forget! Seriously, Hop Slam is one tasty beer that packs a wallop! I love the laid-back atmosphere to the Hopleaf. It has the atmosphere of a lively German Rathskellar or a hip college hangout. Except hip college kids seem to be in awe of striking blondes! Can't blame them one bit, but the Hoparazzi seemed to take an unusual interest in glancing at us all night. Guess we looked like we were having too much fun with our Hop Slams! I love the Hopleaf! And Bell's Brewery, I loved your beer, and we'll be in any Hop Slam ad campaign you want to run! Just please have some "Chaser" on hand as partial payment. Call me!
