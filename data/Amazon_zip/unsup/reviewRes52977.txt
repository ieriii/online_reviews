My lady and I absolutely love this place, possibly our favorite restaurant in the City. We live at the other end of the block, and having been to 90 Miles before this location opened, we were thrilled when they opened up one down the street. The food is simply incredible, nothing too fancy, but all around great flavors and (from as best I know) authenticity. We probably eat here twice a month on average. They just started sit-down service, and...coincidently, the prices went up just a little, which was a little disappointing the last time we went in. But, I guess you can't blame them when they've been serving great food for less than they could be making, business is business, right? The owners are wonderful people and always make rounds around the restaurant to greet their guests. We usually take a minute to say hi on our way out. The staff are always great as well. The atmosphere is perfect. Old 1970's-ish news clippings and murals adorn the walls. Great music always. Love the new covered patio (and pretty well done), hopefully it holds up to the winter cold. How's the food? Everything is awesome. Sandwiches are great for an all around lunch appetite. Dinners are even better because they come with some of the best good ol' rice & beans you could ask for, simple but perfect.
