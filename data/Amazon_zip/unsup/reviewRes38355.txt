I don't know what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said in the 160 reviews that preceded mine, other than to lend another opinion of legitimacy to the good ones. I had a Lagunitas Sirius Ale before dinner and a Saison du Pont with the mussels which I had to order of course. There wasn't a single thing about this place I didn't enjoy except that they don't have some amazing type of super sampler which I could have used to try the other 10 food items and 50 beers I wanted to try. We waited about a half hour which didn't seem that bad since we found a couple of spare chairs to hang out in up front.
