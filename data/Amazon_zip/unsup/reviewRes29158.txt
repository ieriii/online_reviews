Pequod's is amazing! My honey took me here when I was pregnant...needless to say, he made many more trips within that nine months! I am a fan for life...the caramelized crust is divine!!! I would recommend it to anyone who wants amazingly delicious pizza...hands down the best I've tasted in chi-town! matter of fact I think I'll call them on my way home and have some pizza for dinner..yum!
