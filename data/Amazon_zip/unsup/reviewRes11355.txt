We came for the allure of thin crust pizza in a deep dish town, and stayed for the beer . . . I've been to Piece many times since moving to Chicago, and every time I leave happy and satisfied. The pizza tastes fantastic, from the crust (thin the way I like it), to the sauce (lots of delicious tomatoes), and then the plethora of both veggie and meat toppings. Plus, I love their no-cheese options, great for the lactose-intolerant or those watching their waistline. And, if you order pizza according to the high end of their suggestions (i.e. a medium feeds 3 people), you'll leave with full belly and a full wallet. Plus, their home brews are delicious, and it's always interesting to see what seasonal ones that have on tap to try. I especially like their high-alcohol content brews. Now I just need to invest in a growler and do more take-out, since the worst part about Piece is the long wait that seems to be unavoidable. Quality for the Cost: 8 Service: 5
