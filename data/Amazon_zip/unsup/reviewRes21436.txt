AT 3pm on a Saturday, we were told the wait would be over an hour. So, we opted for takeout. In retrospect, I think the line moved faster than the staff told us it would, but oh well. The lemonade was surprisingly delicious, but I was disappointed at the tiny glass they give you for $2.50. The food was awesome. Can't say enough good things about how tasty the cubana totra was. If this place was a tad less pricey (and if the wait for a sandwich wasn't so ridiculous) it would be 5 stars for sure.
