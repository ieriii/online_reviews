I have been to Frontera Grill a few times over the past few years, and I have to say that I like the food more with every visit. This most recent time, my husband and I went there for brunch on the weekend. We found some seats at the bar, which is always a fun place to sit. Originally we were seated at the back food bar, but I just wasn't a fan of the location. Anyway, I had the best catfish tacos of my life there--the fish itself was so perfectly grilled, with a nice smoky taste. The accompaniments were perfect. My husband had an egg dish that I can't remember right now, and I think he liked it, but we agreed that the fish tacos were better. Of the dishes that I've tried at Frontera, this was by far my favorite. On a previous visit, I remember having a vegetarian dish that consisted of goat cheese balls with a sauce and white rice--good, but probably not worth the price tag. In my experience at Frontera, the service has always been cordial, but not terribly personal. I have experienced the same at Xoco (though now that I go there quite often, the staff is much friendlier) and my one visit to Topolobampo. I guess I'm a fan of warm personal interactions with staff, but I understand that restaurant experiences can't always be that way, particularly when things are very busy. In any case, I do like the food at Frontera Grill and will enjoy going back in the future...probably at lunch, when the lines aren't crazy.
