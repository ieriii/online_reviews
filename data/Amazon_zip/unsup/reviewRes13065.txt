We have been going to Cafe 28 for a few years now ever since we discovered their mojitos which are the best in the city. The steak comal is very good as are the empanadas in the Taste of Cuba appetizer. Service is great and we like the hidden coziness of the back outdoor patio. Definitely a gem to check out!
