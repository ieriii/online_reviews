This is a really good place. I would say 3.5. The food tasted great, although the bread was served cold and I've been to places where it was served warm and it really does make a difference. The main dishes were served just above room temperature, I'd like it to be much hotter. We ordered the sharing plate which was fun. Also the fountain drinks are hit and miss: a few of my refills were just seltzer water. The service was great and attentive. The atmosphere was very clean and orderly and the music not overly loud, a perfect blend. I didn't know what to expect from the restaurant considering the neighborhood near the red line stop looked rundown and sketchy but the place was safe, brightly lit and easy to find. Would definitely go back.
