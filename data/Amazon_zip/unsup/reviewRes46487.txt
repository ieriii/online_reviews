R.J.Grunts is the first Lettuce Entertain you restaurant. My work friend loves the salad bar. Our group of 6 ate dinner there on Wednesday night for her birthday. 3 people had the salad bar for dinner. It includes soup, tuna noodle casserole, chips and salsa, etc. They do a nice job of keeping the items fresh and stocked.  I ordered a wrap with southwestern seasoning (the name escapes me). It was very good and very well seasoned. I opted to have veggies instead of fries since my friends were having salad for dinner. The fresh green beans and carrots were guilt free and delicious. My friend had a burger and found a sticker in her fries. It wasn't a big deal; she had already eaten the burger and wasn't upset. She mentioned it to the waitress as a heads up, and the waitress comped her meal. The waitress easily could have gotten away without comping the meal, but I was pleased that she did. As for ambiance, it is a bit cramped. There isn't a ton of space and the restaurant was full. The walls are decorated with pictures of famous people which make for something fun to look at. For American food and cozy atmosphere, Grunt's works.
