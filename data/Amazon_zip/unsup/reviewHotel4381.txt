I Pricelined a hotel in the loop and ended up with the Palmer House for a last minute trip to Chicago on June 2 - June 6. Thanks to reviews I read on TripAdvisor I knew to request a room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms - I was able to get one on the 20th floor at no extra charge. The room was huge and very comfortable. We didn't have a view but that didn't matter much to me. What a great location! Walkable to Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The hotel is also right by major bus lines and the CTA red and blue lines. We took the blue line from O'Hare and only had to walk about 2 blocks to get to the hotel (trip was about 45 minutes). There are 3 hotel entrances so you can enter/exit on Monroe, Wabash, or State streets - very convenient. Just be aware that the Wabash and State street entrances close after a certain time in the evening, probably around 11pm. Also be advised that lots of eating establishments in the area close early - you'll be out of luck if you're hungry at 9 or 10pm! The hotel has about 12 elevators but they only service certain floors so we only had access to 3 and they were VERY slow. On a side note, I have Cingular and I had very spotty reception in the room. Lots of dropped calls. All in all we had a great experience at the Palmer House. I would definitely recommend it if you are able to get a good price on Priceline.
