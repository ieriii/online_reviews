If you don't mind being cramped in like sardines, you might enjoy this place. I agree with other folks - definitely try to get a private booth - you will feel more comfortable. Also be prepared to have a very slow and leisurely meal - the pacing between courses is a little alarming for those of us that "want it fast, want it now" kind of mentality.  Lots of regulars and seniors think this place is the bomb. I was fairly impressed, but not blown away. The food is good, but nothing outstanding. I did get a kick out the strolling musicians though. I kind of like that cheesy schtick with my meal!
