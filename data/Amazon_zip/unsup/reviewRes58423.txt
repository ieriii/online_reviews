Ok if you like fried, creamy seafood this place is for you. I could not believe how awful the seafood selection was. Pan fried everything with Alfredo this and that. Come on. I figured they must have to hide the last of the fish with all the spicy hollondaise. I was very unimpressed and the service at night was just nothing compared to the morning breakfast diner that this place should develop and drop the seafood wanna be place.
