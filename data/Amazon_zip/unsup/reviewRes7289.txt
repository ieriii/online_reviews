Came here yesterday with a friend- the food was very good but the experience wasn't amazing. The first three things we ordered they were out of. We ordered the Insalata Di Pesce Tapas to start, then about 10 minutes later the server told us they were out of it. Would have been nice to have known that oh maybe 9 minutes earlier. Then, we tried to order the Braised Pork and Lamb- they were out of that. The server then decided at that point to inform us of the other many items they were out of. Finally we settled on a few dishes that they actually had. It took FOREVER for the food to come out. Literally forever for two small Tapas dishes. The Angoleti di Spinaca and Truffles (Which was amazing, and my favorite thing we had) and the Milk and Honey Baby Back Rib (which were pretty good and my friend loved). We finished up with Jumbo Shrimp Marinated, that also took a very long time to come to us. They were good, also.  We had two drinks each and did not want to wait around another 25 mins for desert, so we just decided to leave. The server was nice but the food just took forever and they were out of many items we wanted, so that was a drag. I'd come back, but won't be in a huge rush to do so.
