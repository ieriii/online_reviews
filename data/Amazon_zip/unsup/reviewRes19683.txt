Coast, I dig you. Judging by my list and other reveiws, I am obviously a big fan of sushi. So when I saw the write up on this month's Chicago magazine on Coast with the gorgeous food-porn pictures of the sushi, I literally dropped my plans to grill out and caught the bus to Coast. Neato thing #1: Our waiter was just plain awesome. He knew all the specials front and back, made solid recommendations, knew the somewhat obscure wine we brought (and gave it the thumbs up), joked around with everyone, and pretty much was a total pro. Neato thing #2: Coast has a really interesting menu. A lot of the sushi places I go to (as a notorious cheapskate) are, well, totally basic. Even the basic makis at Coast had a twist on them. My absolute, total favorite was the spicy creamy. I have never had sushi literally melt in my mouth like that. The texture, the flavors, all of it were just perfect. And for 8 bucks. Score! Neato thing #3: BIG ASS MAKIS. 'Nuff said. Not so neato thing: Meh on the tempura. Shrimp tempura rolls have been the barometer by which I measure sushi places in the past. Coast just threw this formula out the window because their shrimp tempura had a flavor remniscent of Long John Silver's, but everything else was freaking fabulous. Onto more neato things. Neato thing #4: Huge selection of sashimi & nigiri. I tried clam, bonito (some sort of awesome tuna cousin), and black tobiko. Apparently they have sea bass also. Way more selection than I'm used to seeing on sashimi menus. Neato thing #5: Their desserts here are really awesome looking. I'm used to green tea ice cream, weird looking puddings, or nothin' at sushi places. They had something chocolatey and really pretty here and the girls at the table next to me got it and I couldn't stop ogling it. If I hadn't been stuffed to the gills (BAD PUN ALERT!), I would have gotten one too. Overall, mostly quite neato and definitely worth a go.
