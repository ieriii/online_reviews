I go to this place quite often because the service, food and free valet parking is wonderful. If you are hungry, try the family style menu (2 or more people) for $19.99. It includes 2 apps, a greek salad, lamb or chicken main dish with 3-4 sides, dessert and coffee. It is hard to beat that amount of food for that price anywhere in Chicago. I love their kabobs as well, and just thinking abount their greek salad makes me want it as I write this.  It is more of a family restaurant than a romantic place, and there is always a good buzz of laughter and people enjoying themselves.
