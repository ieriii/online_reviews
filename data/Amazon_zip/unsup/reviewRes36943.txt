I've been here a few times. I think today was my fourth. Let me just say that I'm so glad they recently started opening for lunch and serving food. It was my first time actually eating there today and I had really amazing food. For $11 I got a CB and J. It was cashew buttler and a really good fruit preserve with cheese that reminded me of ricotta. The sourdough bread was toasted perfectly and melted the cashew butter, cheese and jelly. But that was nothing compared to the. best. macaroni and cheese I have ever had in my life. It was melt in your mouth crazy delicious with baked bread crumbs on top. Think stouffers except one million bajillion times better and satisfying. There were chips somewhere in the mix but after all that food + a Virtue hard cider draft I was so full. Anyway I'm sure a billion people have reviewed how great this bar is for its beer selection and I'm not sure what beers I've had in the past here... I've just known they've all been on tap....and sat at the bar three out of the four times. It's really difficult because it's limited seating but the rest of the place is huge. They also play really good music.
