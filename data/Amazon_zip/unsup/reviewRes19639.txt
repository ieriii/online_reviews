Nope. Not a fan. I understand the appeal, but I just don't see it. At first, I thought that maybe my distaste for the place was due to Gage being a more formal restaurant then I was expecting. High prices; small portions: I get that that's how such restaurants are, but hear me out... IF a restaurant is SO fancy that it can charge $20 for three scallops and a three-inch line of sweet potatoes drawn with an icing bag, how can it justify a waiter being drunk? Yep. Drunk. All four friends in attendance will agree. Imagine a creepy James Spader character who can't quite keep his eyes open. Imagine a waiter who keeps complimenting the ladies while continuously hiccuping. DRUNK. So, does this restaurant have low standards for its employees? Does it assign the drunk waiter to the table of younger patrons? Here's the real question: regardless of WHY we had this experience, should this restaurant really have such a high opinion of itself?
