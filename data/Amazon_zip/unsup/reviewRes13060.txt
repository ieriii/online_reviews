My hubby and I visited TdB for his birthday since he is the meat-eater of the house and wow did he eat MEAT!!!! I don't think I've ever seen him this surprisingly happy! I made reservation for seating near the wine rack as another Yelper suggested (good call!) and oh did we get a show. The food was beautifully presented and just mouth-watering. I am vegan so needless to say I did not get my money's worth even with the salad bar pricing. However, the ambiance and servers were worth it. I haven't gotten any good coupons yet but as soon as I do, we'll go running!!!!
