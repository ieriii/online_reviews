I don't know how to explain the feeling I've had twice after indulging in Cafe 28's pork dinners. The short of it - I had to get up from the table to step outside for a breather, because the flavors were so wonderfully intense. And married with the intoxicating aromas and perhaps more intoxicating caipirinhas, it was all too fantastic to stay seated. The other mentionable -- for some reason, my husband and I always have life-changing conversations at Cafe 28. It's surprising to me, because the atmosphere is not one I would describe as overly romantic, but there's something in the air, perhaps, that just works for us.Cafe 28 is a gem.
