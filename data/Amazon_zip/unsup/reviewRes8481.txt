If not the best pizza in the city, easily in the top 5. The dough has a great chewy quality despite being thin, and the toppings are about as fresh and well presented as you can get. The menu is narrow, though. I understand that true neapolitan pizzas have a pretty limited number of ways to prepare and top, but I don't see a reason to stick so close to doctrine. They've got a great crust and while they have 16 something pizzas listed, they're all basically minor variations on 3 or 4 different pizzas. I love them all, but I'd go back way more often if they had more variety. The atmosphere tries to be intimate and friendly, but it comes off more as classy pizza parlor. The wine choices are only decent, way outclassed by the pizza. The staff are friendly and helpful.
