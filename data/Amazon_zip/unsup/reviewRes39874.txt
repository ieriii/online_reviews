I came here for the first time today for brunch. Longman & Eagle has sort of a casual, rustic feel -- I really liked the exposed brick, the wooden tables, the large windows, and the lighting fixtures. Whoever designed this place really paid attention to detail, even down to soap containers in the bathroom. Plus, I have a random obsession with ampersands and I loved how they included the ampersand on the menus and the sign outside. With that being said, the food itself is great as well. My boyfriend and I were promptly seated and brought water and coffee. I ordered the duck hash and my boyfriend had the crab benedict. The duck hash was highly recommended by our waiter and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. He did warn me that it would be very "fatty." It was slightly on the oily side and was pretty heavy, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My boyfriend also liked his crab benedict, which I tasted and seemed like lighter than the traditional eggs benedict and was less salty than my dish. Even though our waiter was attentive and friendly, our dishes took about 20 minutes to come out, which seemed way too long for the type of food that we ordered. Our food wasn't even hot by the time it came out, just lukewarm. In addition, I noticed that the couple sitting right next to us were waiting for about 10-15 minutes before their waiter took their order. We went at Sunday around 2pm and it just didn't seem that busy to justify such slow service. On a random last note, I would recommend wearing plaid to this restaurant to fit in with the crowd. Haha...
