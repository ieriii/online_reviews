Every trip to Kinzie I've had so far has been a business lunch and I have yet to be disappointed. This is the perfect atmosphere for a mid day meeting or a client lunch. They offer the feel of a well worn suit accented by an experienced wait staff and a varied menu selection far beyond just a quality cut of beef. You can find affordable lunch sandwich selections as well, so no need to worry if you drop in with a friend and have to use your own coin. Some of my favorites are...the daily specials (I have had a number of seafood successes this way), the steak risotto, sesame encrusted ahi tuna, penne pasta, turkey club and prime rib sandwich. For dessert I highly recommend the butter rum cheesecake...YUM! This is a mainstay on my list of quality business lunch destinations.
