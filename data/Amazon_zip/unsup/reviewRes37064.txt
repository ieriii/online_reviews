First time at Hopleaf, I definitely had high hopes. You must must must order the mussels!!! Just delicious and they give you a huge and generous portion!! And the mussels come with bread and really good pomme frites! And the price for them wasn't bad at all! The atmosphere is really cool. I'm not sure how else to describe it. The beef briskett platter is definitely enough for two people if you aren't that hungry, the meat definitely melted in my mouth. The mac and cheese that came with it was also yummy! --- after my second time there, i'm going to give it another star. The roasted beet salad is amazing, it has a good variety of veggies and fruit and the pistachio vinaigrette is a party in your mouth. I never realized salad could taste that good. My friend ordered the rabbit, it does taste like chicken. But we agreed that it was too pricey for rabbit. But yes my suggestion is get there early! Like 6pm if you don't want to wait that long.
