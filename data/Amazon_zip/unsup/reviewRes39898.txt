I went here with my wife on a Friday. The service was leisurely and made for a lovely evening out. We tried a series of plates instead of entrees, which turned out to be a great idea. The bone marrow was excellent (though the rock salt garnish was unnecessary), and the scallops over succotash were also splendid. The cocktails were delicious, and we liked the wine selection. I like their whiskey selection and will definitely be back again for food as well as drinks.
