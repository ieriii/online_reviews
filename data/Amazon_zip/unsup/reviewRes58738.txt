This was a very disappointing experience. We ordered the tasting menu with pairings. When we left we were still somewhat hungry and were disappointed that there was only about 1/4 of a drink poured (at most) with each pairing. This wouldn't have been so bad if the food and drinks came out together. On most courses the drinks came out significantly before the food which wouldn't have been a problem if there was enough of the drink to take a few sips before the food came and then still have some left to taste with the food. There were a lot people working, but rarely did the same person bring anything to the table which may explain the poor timing. The table next to ours received 3 courses while we waited for our dessert to arrive. And consistent with the prior courses--the drinks were out for 2 of our neighbors' courses. There were some highlights. The atmosphere is great. The halibut, chicken, and steak that were served were excellent. Each bite was a new experience. Overall for the price of the "experience" was far too costly for the gaps in service and to leave feeling unsatiated.  Fine dining in a casual atmosphere is a great concept, but the casual atmosphere still demands spot on service and execution.
