Piece is one of the few places that this Jersey girl will eat pizza in Chicago. It doesn't claim to be NY style and it's not, but it's still good. I suggest getting the red or white, both are delicious. And what better combination is there than good pizza and good beer? I'm a Golden Arm kinda girl, it's light and crisp and that's how I like my brews. But the others are all good too, depending on what mood you're in. Atmosphere is pretty good, though it can get super packed with a few too many frat types on a busy game night or a Saturday. Seems pointless to write another nice review about Piece since everybody else in Chicago already has, but hey, here's one more.
