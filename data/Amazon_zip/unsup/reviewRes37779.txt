Very over rated. Granted they have an extensive beer selection but it is noisy,hard to gray a seat, and the bartenders are so busy it takes forever to get a drink.  I was also there a week ago. I had the cb& j which was delicious! I wasn't in the mood to drink so I ordered a coke instead. Hopleaf charges you for a refill of plain old cole.... Ugh. Thus makes them sound cheap.
