We sat at a high top table, off the bar. It was a Friday night and the place was lively. The manager & our waitress were attentive and friendly conversing with us throughout. When you're traveling into a new area, it's nice to find a popular locals spot like Shaw's. We had a great time, loved the crab cakes and shrimp cocktail.
