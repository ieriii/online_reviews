Extremely disappointed at the overcooked crab and lobster which you would expect to be the best dish out of the entire menu giving that it is the crab house. Broccoli sidedish did not taste fresh, mac n cheese sidedish was made of dried up PENNE pasta (need me say more?). Got medium-well filet mignon when I ordered medium filet mignon and the beef did not taste fresh. I've had seafood that taste ten times better than this with half of the price. I sure will never return to this restaurant.
