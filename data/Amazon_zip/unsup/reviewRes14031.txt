Happiness: Brunch, Beer, Battlestar Galactica. In that order. Revolution Brewing Co. exceeds in 2 of those 3. The hype is warranted. Somehow every experience has been tastier than the last. Could life get much better than mussels with leek, apple, and blue cheese? FRAK YEA IT CAN: Pancetta Biscuits & Gravy. Despite this being a brewery, the beer tends to be the effective & witty sidekick to the meals. The space tends to be a tad loud yet I find it extremely comfortable. And apparently everyone except for me has had to wait much more than 5 minutes to get a table. Maybe I'm constantly lucky? But a little less lucky since I moved away from Logan Square and RBC.
