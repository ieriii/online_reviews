Like most reviews acknowledge, this is one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. There are those of you who may be impressed that this is one of the principal places where big firm lawyers take their important clients out for dinner, even though this is hardly one of the most expensive places in town.  Others may be appalled. But the critical thing to focus on is not the spectacular venue and the excellent food, but rather on one of the best Italian wine lists in the City. If you don't know anything about wine, no problem. You'll probably do just fine by tossing a dart at the wine list--the restaurant serves very few mediocre wines. But if like me you are a wine snob (I admit it. There's nothing to be ashamed of) then this is your chance to shine as you try to intimidate and shame your less learned and less sophisticated colleagues. You might make a horse's behind of yourself in the process, but that is a small price to pay for the privilege of glorying in some of the best fruit of the vine Italy has to offer.
