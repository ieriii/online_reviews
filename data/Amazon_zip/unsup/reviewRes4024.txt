Here's some history on "the Schwa": If Alinea didn't open in 2005, Schwa probably would have been the city's best new restaurant. Michael Carlson was named one of Food & Wine's Best New Chefs that year. Then they received 3 stars from the Trib. Finally, Chicago Magazine named Chef Carlson Best New Chef of 2005. Well deserved for a fantastic restaurant. The good side of schwa (and it is a REALLY good side) is that chef Carlson is operating an incredible BYOB that turns out dishes that are on par with Avenues, Blackbird, etc.  Both starters we had (quail egg ravioli and lobster ) were good, as were the two entrees (pork tenderloin and scallops). The pork and lobster were my favorites and I was thinking about the meal even days later. The dark side of schwa is that because of all the accolades, everyone wants a piece of it. Additionally, because chef Carlson refuses to expand the restraunt's capacity beyond whatever he and his two/three assistance can accomodate themselves, there just isn't enough room for everyone who wants to go here.  I've seen some other reviews where people have had trouble getting reservations and gave it one star based on that alone. That seems somewhat irresponsible to me. It's like deciding you want to go to a restaurant in Minneapolis and then complaining that the drive was too long. It's a SMALL restaurant that EVERYONE wants to go to. Of COURSE its going to be hard to get a reservation and OF COURSE they are not going to be spending loads of time fielding questions and answering phones. They run a small operation (which I completely respect) so you need to call during the hours they answer the phone and expect a 2+ month waiting list for weekends. If you are willing to look past the fact that its not a "Lettuce Entertain You restaurant" and put up with the extra effort required, I think you will find that it's well worth the wait once you get there.
