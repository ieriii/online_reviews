This was my first visit to Chitown, so of course some deep dish pizza was a must on my list of things to do! This was one of the top 3 choices of recommendations from people. I was also pretty excited to see the environment, which I heard was crazy and covered with graffiti from top to bottom. My lil cousins were with me so I thought it was only fitting and entertaining to come here. As soon as we entered it was just how I imagined if not more! My family and i looked around amazed! Truly, A graffiti lovers paradise! Word of advice tho, bring your own markets or white out pens! They unfortunately don't have any for you to use, unless you purchase them. The pizza was deeelish and the epitome of what i imagined Chitown signature deep dish pizza to be. We had the classic pepperoni and cheese as well as their hamburger pizza. Pizza was thick, cheesey and gooey and just yummy. Their hamburger pizza was creative, but I've had better. Definitely looking forward to my next return to Chicago and Gino's East, this time I'll be sure to bring my own white out pens!
