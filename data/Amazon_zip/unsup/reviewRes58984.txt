This is my second visit to Sunda. I remember having a great experience here the first time also. I had the watermelon eel appetizer dish last time which I thought was kind of strange but it ended up surprising me in a good way. The sweetness and freshness of the watermelon mixed really well with glazed eel.Anyway, back to last week. I ordered an Asian-style bbq pork which tasted better than the ones I normally get from my Asian joint in the South Loop except that it's 3 times more expensive here! I also had the Chilean Sea Bass, which tasted really fresh and cooked to perfection. This place rocks!
