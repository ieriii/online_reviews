Pretty good food for good prices. I ride my bike by here on the way home, and the smell coming from this place is like a tractor beam pulling me in. We ate here a while back before they put in the outdoor patio. We thought it was ok, and hadn't been back in a long time. Since then it was on Check Please and they built out the outdoor seating, and now business is booming. We stopped to pick up a carryout order the other night. The food is really good, but the wait times are kinda long. I had the Chicken Casada. Very tasty, and a great deal. I also had the oatmeal shake, which I wasn't too impressed by. It wasn't blended very well. Very runny and then just a bunch of ice at the bottom. If it looks like there isn't a long wait for the patio, I'll probably try it again soon. But the way it's been lately, I may have to add this on my list of places ruined by success.
