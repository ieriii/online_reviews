I've been to Piece a couple of times and it was good. However, my last visit wasn't that great of an experience. Regardless of group size, expect a wait. And if you have a large group be sure to call in a reservation well in advance. Unfortunately my group didn't do that. So we ended up waiting a LONG time. At one point in the night the host lost our reservation too (not sure how you could forget about a large, and loud, group like mine, but it happened). We ended up taking our business elsewhere. The pizza at Piece is good, and they've got a large beer selection... but the wait there is just a bit much.
