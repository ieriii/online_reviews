The service really, really, sucks(Pertaining to the host/server with the ponytail, straight up ..... rude.) I came here for the CB&J b/c yelpers were going on about it, but it was just O-K. Perhaps I expected too much? But everything else like the tilapia sandwich and the onion rings and the condiments that came with it, were awesome. Too bad service sucks... well, the bartender was really nice(bald man w/beard).. so.. +1 because of him. +1 for pretty good food.. and +1 for nice bartender man. That is all.
