I really don't understand how this restaurant does it. I have never had a bad experience here and never had a bad piece of fish. The girls and I hit up Coast the night before Thanksgiving (sorry I've been slacking Johnny T!) and it was fabulous. We ordered the White Dragon....four times. My friend is obsessed with this roll, and she has every right. The roll is frickin amazing! The creamy and crunchy textures are perfectly balanced by the spicy mayo. Our server thought we were insane; we were there for quite some time and put away an impressive amount of sushi. The place was, as always, packed and the sushi was excellent. It's safe to say I've tried every roll on the menu with a few exceptions...everything is magnificent. Really though. I recommend Coast to any person that enjoys sushi and have converted a couple along the way. I always recommend reservations...this place is normally bumping. BYOB, limit to a bottle of wine per two people....their somewhat new policy. Kind of annoying considering all that says to me is, " Eat and get out." I get it...but when you have that much business, take care of the patrons! I'll be back....on Friday!
