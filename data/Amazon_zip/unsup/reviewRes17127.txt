I went here on a Friday night and sat in the lounge area. The energy was great and we didn't have to wait for a table. I ordered the ceviche sampler which was fantastic. The service was great and very friendly. I would definitely like to go back soon and sit in the main dining room. I wasn't able to try any of the entrees or desserts, but everyone around seemed very happy with there meals. The drinks were great and even my pickiest friend was able to find something on the menu to enjoy.
