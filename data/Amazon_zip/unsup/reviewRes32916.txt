Like so many other reviewers, we had Demera's Groupon. We had a very lovely time! The space is quite attractive. Some other Ethiopian restaurants we've been to are really dark, but Demera has lots of windows and a nice open feel. They were super-busy because the Groupon was ending soon, so I wouldn't say we got tons of personal attention, but the servers were friendly, helpful about explaining options, and we didn't feel neglected. I'm no Ethiopian food expert but I've had it a few times. Demera's food was good--not amazing, but tasty. We especially enjoyed the variety basket of fried sambussas. We let the server pick out our entree sampler with a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes. Normally I prefer the vegetarian options, but in this case I thought the lentil dish was the weakest one, and the cabbage was ok but nothing to write home about. The meat options were more flavorful. A bottle of wine came with our Groupon so that's the only beverage we got, but it looked like they had kind of a fun cocktail list too. Not something I've seen at other Ethiopian restaurants I've visited. I'd certainly go back to Demera if i was looking for a meal option in the area!
