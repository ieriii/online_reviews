Oh I wish we could have eaten lunch here because the menu looked great. We wound up going for a quick breakfast of churros with chocolate dipping sauce and the brick oven french toast with pecan and bacon crumbles. Add in two coffees to go and some outside seating and what a perfect way to start our Saturday in Chicago!!!
