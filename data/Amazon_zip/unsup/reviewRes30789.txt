I'd actually say 3.5...damn this no half star thing... Ok, so I admit it, I have omnivore guilt. I always feels so bad about picking a restaurant, not realizing that my vegetarian and vegan friends are not really welcome, but instead the restaurant is obligated to come up with some second class dinner option while I enjoy my medium rare lamb chops and creamy mashed potatoes. I see how uncomfortable my friends look, the self-consciousness in their eyes and fake smile as they pretend the pasta and probable jar sauce they've just been given are as enjoyable as what the rest of the table is chowing on. It was this guilt, that lead me to almost give the Chicago Diner 4 stars. But, I couldn't in good conscience when what I really I meant was; this place deserves 4 stars...for a veggie/vegan restaurant, that is. I can't show favoritism just because there aren't many eateries that are explicitly for the non-meat /non-dairy lovers. Breakdown: 1. There are no fries. It is not a diner if there are no fries and sweet potato fries absolutely do not count. 2. Avocado tostada- this just wasn't a good idea. I mean, there were flavors... did they intrigue my palate? did they meld? Not really. Are there more delicious veggie/vegan friendly things you can put on a tostada besides quinoa? Absolutely. It didn't add anything to the dish besides grainy texture. And! Tostadas are already messy, try eating on with tiny grains piled on em! Plus, the tortilla was meh. 3. Nachos- were tasty, but my (dairy) cheese was burned in the middle...conveniently the burned spot was localized under the guac and sour cream so I didn't realize it until I was half way through the plate. 4. This has no bearing on the stars, but what's with the no ice thing? So, sorry veggie/vegan friends, but this place is just ok. Will I be back? Probably, but I'm not in a hurry.
