Caro Mio has a cute, romantic atmosphere. It's a small cozy restaurant. I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed. The food was excellent- traditional Italian food just as it should be. The menu offers many choices from pasta to veal to seafood, etc. They lost a star because they do use ALOT of garlic. Also, the service was a little slow and we had like 4 different guys coming to our table. Other than that everything was really good!
