I just love wine flights. Really, it's so exciting to try a little sip of this, a little sip of that...swirl sip smile. And even better than one flight is two! We had a flight of whites with our salads and a flight of reds with our entrees and a little sherry with our dessert. The food was amazing - amply portioned salad and a just enough gnocchi to almost finish the whole dish and still leave room for a couple bites of dessert.
