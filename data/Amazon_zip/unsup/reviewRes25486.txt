This is my favorite cafe. The food is consistently good, and the service is excellent. I have been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner, and have always been seated right away. The food selection is excellent, and the desserts are amazing. I have also ordered delivery from here, and was very happy with the food and service. I would highly recommend this cafe.
