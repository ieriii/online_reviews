An excerpt from Stuff White People Like: "Historically speaking, the music that white people have kept on life support for the longest period of time is Jazz. Thanks largely to public radio, bookstores, and coffee shops, Jazz has carved out a niche in white culture that is not yet ready to be replaced by Indie Rock. But the biggest role that Jazz plays in white culture is in the white fantasy of leisure. All white people believe that they prefer listening to jazz over watching television. This is not true." Lololol. Oh well. Maybe I'm too much of a social guy to be surrounded by fun friends, not able to talk, and still be expected to have a good time. The music was good, and I get that it's the focus of why you're there. Definitely a stop for anyone coming through Chicago, but I don't know if I'll come back. Unless New Jack Swing becomes the new Jazz by the time I'm 50. Protip: When you arrive, chances are you'll be stuck standing. Make sure to be standing near a booth or table so you can grab it once those people leave. You feel kind of dickish, especially if you just got there, but sitting beats standing.
