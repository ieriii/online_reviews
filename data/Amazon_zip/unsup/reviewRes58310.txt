I'm not a vegetarian, but I used to be, so when my vegetarian sister suggested we hit up The Chicago Diner for brunch yesterday I was a bit excited since she'd been telling me nothing but good things about the place since she moved downtown.We arrived as they opened and we were the only ones there.That being said I was a little disappointed in the service, they were prompt with the food, however 5 or 6 people, all employees, were lounging at the counter as we ate talking and joking (some of it rather crude, which is unprofessional to me but maybe I'm making too much out of it). That being said, the food was spectacular. We split the BBQ Wings which were out of this world. I never would have thought that meatless BBQ Wings would taste better than the real thing. I had the Biscuits and Gravy, and while the biscuits were a little tough it was still delicious and I ate every last bite.I also stole a sip of my sister's pumpkin chocolate milkshake and it was to die for, tasted just like pumpkin pie, but better.The food at The Chicago Diner makes me want to give up meat again, if I could eat there everyday something tells me it wouldn't be so difficult.
