LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. All the servers are super friendly and attentive and the menu is VERY low priced for the flavor and quantity (most pastas are $5.50-$10). (the clams cappellini is served with a huuuge pile of noodles). Soups are awesome, salads are always fresh, and the pasta will keep you coming back. They also have good beer specials AND you can order bar food from the "other side" bar which is connected inside. Oh... and they deliver. Bonus.
