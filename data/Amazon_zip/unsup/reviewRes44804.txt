Deep dish spinach pizza: five stars Speed of service for Friday night take out: five stars (literally waited only the required 35 minutes for my pizza to cook) Everything else: one star I've had different variations of the deep dish stuffed pizza and hated them all. As a NY pizza lover, the nonItalian-ness of the pizza always bothered me. It tasted odd. The toppings stuffed inside always grossed me out bc toppings should be on top and get crispy. Then friends came to visit from NJ and they wanted Chicago deep dish. I caved and got us Giordano's. To prove my point about the awfulness of the pizza I got a small thin crust. They agreed it sucks. Buttery flaky crust for pizza is just odd. But I also got the spinach pizza. Mozzarella and spinach topped with tasty marinara. There was so much spinach that the pizza actually wasn't overwelmed by cheese like the others are. I can actually say the spinach pizza is actually craveable. When I get the urge for pizza, Giordanos spinach will hit the spot.
