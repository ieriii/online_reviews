I am a meat eater period! Ruth's Chris used to be my favorite, I love going to steak houses and pigging out but his place has become heaven on earth to me!  For a little over $50 per person, you get eat 16 different meats (unlimited), a way, way, way, above average salad bar and 3 unlimited sides (all incuded in the per person prce)! Usually I go to a steak house and pay $40 for one steak and no salad bar or sides! It's is WELL, worth the price and the staff is amazing. From the front desk people to the outstanding waiters! Plus the decor is beautiful! This is the only place to go if you like to eat meat! It is the only place I have gone since I moved here from New York 2 years ago. I swear I have been there at least 10 times! Also, if you don't like meat, you can get the salad bar for $30. It's even good for kids, again, it's all well worth it! Just flip that coin to green and enjoy!
