I'd give this place 3.5 stars. 2.5 for the food, 4 for the service and overall feel of the restaurant. I found the food mostly average and underwhelming for Italian fare, but the Monday night Family Style deal is a great value and filling.  Family-style gave us an opportunity to try many different items. The lobster-filled pasta was disappointing. Great to use lobster only when you can taste and enjoy it, which we could not in this dish. Mushroom risotto was gluey and gritty, and the Bolognese was ok, but the pasta overcooked. Both salads and appetizers were just fair.  Our waiter Matt was great and the owner or manager (not sure) very attentive. Good local place to share a meal.
