I now consider it a travesty that I never ate here when I lived in chicago (and steve and ginger worked here!). Anyway, I came here with a work party of 8 on a Tuesday night. I knew all the right people, so we were seated in a semi private circular table in the oyster bar. It was perfect. On Tuesday nights, they have live music, and while I approached the idea with some trepidation, the band was really, really good local blues. Way to go! I started with the 12 Oyster sampler, and it was one of the best I've ever had. Perhaps it was the Oyster shooter to start, or the martini, but those were some of the coldest, briniest, sweetest oysters I have ever had. Seriously, I almost ordered a second dozen. I ordered the Bay Scallop entree, and while I'm very partial to sea scallops (and the hand caught ones especially). These were also fresh, sweet and they were cooked perfectly. The sides of sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes were delish. All in all, a fantastic meal at a real establishment. I loved it. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town.
