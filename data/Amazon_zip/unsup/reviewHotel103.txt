THe rooms are nice with a retro feel, kinda small but that didn't matter to much it was just a place to sleep. I was upset that the maid didn't do a cleaning on the third night we were there. In addition, upon checkout the staff did not say a word. He just asked my room number and said bye. A small " how was your stay would have been nice." Although, I admit the service men that helped with luggage and taxi were very welcoming and they actual asked how the stay was. The location is the best part of this hotel .
