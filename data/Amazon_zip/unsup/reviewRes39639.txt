Wow! I try not to get carried away with my reactions or reviews but after returning here several times for different occasions I have to admit I've been thoroughly impressed. While the place is always packed and it isn't the most comfortable, you've got to understand that going into it. If you're looking for comfortable, quiet and relaxing you're in the wrong place. I don't knock any points off for that because they don't portray themselves as a place you could quietly hold a conversation. Anyway, the food is amazing, the cocktails are amazing, the staff is courteous and knowledgeable and my experience has yet to fall short of great. I'm still curious about the lodging they offer upstairs and plan on having a review on that shortly. Our first visit was with a group of 9 so we actually ordered everything on the menu. This was wonderful as we were able to literally try everything. the creativity behind many of these dishes was very impressive. Not being a vegan by any means or even close to vegetarian like some of the people in my group I must say I was even surprised by their vegetarian dishes. Too often a meat based establishment falls short creating good vegetarian alternatives. Can't wait to go back!!!!
