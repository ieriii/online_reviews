I must say I love this website. I found this restaurant through Yelp, and I finally made it there tonight. The line was pretty long as I was warned by other yelpers (and it's a rainy Wednesday night). So I can only imagine how bad the line gets on weekends. It is a very casual place. The bottom line is that it was worth the drive and the wait. Their pizzas were very good. As I mentioned in my other reviews, I have a background to become picky about Italian food. OK.. Let me be honest... it did not top the pizzas I've tried in Naples or in other parts of Italy(And I was in Naples recently), but this comes pretty close to the best pizza I had in Italy. Definitely the best Italian style pizza(Italian style is my favorite, hence the best pizza period) in Chicago! One small complain I had was that fresh mozzarella cheese on my pizza wasn't exactly melted. I also think that it could be cheaper. One pizza is just enough to feed one. Maybe you can share two among three people. We had a small appetizer($8), two pizzas($15 each), a glass of wine($7), a diet coke($2), a tartufo($4.50), and a cappuccino ($2.50). I ended up paying 70 bucks (for two) including tax and tip. So it's not exactly a cheap pizza place. But the food is good enough, and I don't mind paying for slightly over-priced pizzas. The service was also remarkable. It was pretty darn busy, and the waiter was always there before I needed anything. Definitely check it out! Yelpers-Thanks for helping me discover Spacca Napoli!
