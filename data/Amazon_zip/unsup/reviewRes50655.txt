I loved it. My wife and I have been twice and the experience both times were very nice. Beautiful decor, obscure southern soul music, attentive wait staff, and very good food. I especially enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with the spicy mac & cheese on the side. Make sure you get the sweet tea made with simple syrup. They have good vegetarian options as well. My wife had black bean fritters with a side salad with home made green goddess dressing. YUM! They do cook some dishes with peanut oil so be careful. If you have food allergies let them know. It made me feel like I was in Savannah again.
