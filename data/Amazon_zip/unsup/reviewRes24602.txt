We came for desserts on a sunday night. We were drooling over the display of the cakes, but we had to wait for our waiter to take the orders, which took a while. She finally came and apologized. We ordered valrhona - very good royal - ok mango yogurt mousse - great. loved the flavors la symphony - good, loved the dark chocolate hazelnute praline - good opera butter mocha - bad, too stiff tiramisu - ok, interesting layering loukoumades - too sweet. i thought the cakes are good, but slightly expensive. i thought the space was empty and the service could be better.
