Carrot papaya smoothie? YES! They have a great selection of juices and smoothies which I really love in a place. I dont care for the service some of the times and I am still confused as to why places (like this one) that get so much business have a cash-only policy. Don't be mad at me for not understanding. I just don't. No one has explained it to me. Feel free to do so. The food is great. It's comforting. Should I choose to eat a lot of it, I won't feel bloated and sick afterward. They have a great selection of vegetarian options. It would be cool if they had a better salsa for the chips they bring out to the table. They have it in a little ketchup/mustard bottle squirter thing which means I have to either put a couple drops on each chip or put it all over my chips risking future sogginess. I live near here and will make regular trips for their juices/smoothies.
