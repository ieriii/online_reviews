Great food, great ambiance, great service. Kinda pricey, but if you have a groupon like we did, it is well worth it. I recommend doing the pre fixe deal....super creative menu, i was like, whaaa? then the next crazy thing came out and i was like huuuh? then the next....you get it. I never ate rabbit before this and it is really good, the desserts are unreal also, and my friend is one of the dessert chefs. Chocolate Mint leaf? Ah thang you. Try it if you have $100 burning a hole in your pocket.
