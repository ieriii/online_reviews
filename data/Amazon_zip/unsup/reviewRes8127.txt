Yum. Yum Yum. Yum Yum Yum. The pizza is awesome, and I'm not a pizza fan. The crust is thin, crispy, a little chewy and not too heavy. They come out super-fast too, so if you're hungry that's good. If you're looking for a pizza that isn't too doughy, with fresh ingredients, then this is the place to come. Love!
