Fabulous BYOB creperie with a very nice staff and I just love the fact that when you order a crepe here it comes with a cup of soup. Mmmm. Not being a crepe connoisseur, I decided to go with something more savory because it was dinner time. I had their Greek crepe which was stuffed with feta, spinach, tomato, olives, and I added their lamb sausage to it as well, which gave it a bit of a kick in the spice department! The crepe came with a cup of their vegetable soup which had a beautiful orange color to it and tasted just wonderful. I can't wait to come back and try more of their crepe sensations or come up with something totally new by building my own.
