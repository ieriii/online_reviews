Went there with my ladyfriend for an old school date dinner. We were doing the Chicago tourist thing and this seemed like a logical stop. We got dressed up and pretended like we were from out of town. The place is definitely like a theme park ride about mobbed up old restaurants. The waitstaff was mostly attentive and friendly (comped us a dozen oysters when I asked where they might be after a short wait) and the seafood orgy was top notch. Definitely not my usual style, but I'll go again some day. Crown Jewel: The classy, classy, service. The perfectly mixed cocktails. Avoid: The Oyster Bar looked pretty obnoxious.
