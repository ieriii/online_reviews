Dirty martinis really are a girls best friend, and when you're stuck on the Eisehower or as A&E has now introduced me to this new nickname-the Heroin Express you're going to want a drink to nurse away any grievances surged through racing cars. So enough venting, meeting up with some friends who had already been in the bar tossing back a few appetizers and tasty beverages I stumbled in late but could only stare in appreciation at the many plates of delicious mini pizzas that were getting ordered like candy. With the bill already at the table as I sat down, I ordered up a martini to try and catch up to some degree but was completely thrown by the atmosphere inside. The restaurant is pretty vast filled with many booths and dark wooden tables that make for an intimate setting in an active eatery. Old Jazz themes a-go-go which only add to the ambiance, but really from the scents waiving overhead I'd have to say were the biggest addition to spending a meal here. Several dips were ordered within the group and from the sounds of it-the dip was dish delish. I especially loved in the bar the little mini carafe at each table that was filled with spiced peanuts for those millying about slowly nursing their cocktails and deciding which entre to order. Again, I'm saying this with confidence-I honestly think this is an area go to for plate size individual pizzas considering your options. The dough looked full and not dried out whatsoever and could easily be devoured in mere minutes. I curse the traffic that made me late and had to sit through all of the foody temptations! Service was above par and we even had a waiter who stopped in and chatted for a few minutes, very lovely service that would make me want to come back for seconds-and an actual meal apart from my liquid diet!
