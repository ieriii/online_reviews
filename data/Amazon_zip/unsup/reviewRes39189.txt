Awesome. I always default to this location. Service is super fast and polite. The owner manger looks like a korean soap actress, and she runs shit nice and smooth. Here you will get a much broader selection of side dishes than you will at some of the local competition's locations. The beef quality is fresh and nicely marbled. I was born in Seoul, I eat here. I think it's great. What more do you need to know?!
