Garcia's is perfect. Great little fast food Mexican restaurant in Lincoln Square. I have their number in my speed dial and love every meal they offer. Whether it is the Cheese Enchiladas Suizas, the Guacamole or just a Veggie Burrito, this place is great whether you go there at 2pm or 2am. Best late night Mexican place in the Lincoln Square. Great customer service and wonderful food at all hours of the day.
