Seriously! No really! Come on people we live in one of the best cities in the world for great food and this is what we come up with!? I have lived in the Wonderful City of Chicago for my entire life and have searched for the " New York Pizza " for most of it..... I heard about this joint and just had to go....... And all I could say was WOW!!! At 10PM on a Friday night this place was packed! 10 people in line and no parking because they have 6 delivery drivers using their entire lot. As I stood in line and observed I grew hungrier and hungrier and finally..... There it was the Art of Pizza was before me... I tried a piece of stuffed,pan, and thin crust. I could not believe this pizza was what all the rave was about. It made me realize there are a lot of folks out there that have been deprived of GOOD CHICAGO PIZZA.... I traveled a good distance to get the pizza and would not recommend anyone else to do so! Keep looking people! This ain't it!
