Where do I begin? I am in love with this place. Lets start with the deviled eggs...amazing! Get the early because they run out. The panini with salami and goat cheese is amazing. The pig tail is something to try. I did on a dare and I loved it. Did I mention those eggs?? Order two orders. Also if you are not a brussel sprouts lover ou will love the way they make theirs. Be adventurous. I guess a lot of things change on their menu. There is a guy that works at the front whose name is Joe. He is one of the best hosts or managers (not sure) that I have dealt with at a restaurant. Super friendly and knowledgeable. Also this place gets very crowded almost every night and especially in the summer. The fact is this was my second attempt to get in. The last time was in the summer and the wait was about 45 minutes. We couldn't wait. Ask about the wine classes they offer. The couple next to our group emerged from the basement of this place after having a class and they raved about it. That being said there is an EXCELLENT wine selection. Joe the guy I mentioned was great at helping us choose. Zero parking here. Also you will be sitting pretty close to people. Elbow to elbow at big tables so be prepared for that unless you get lucky and snag a small table or you want to sit at the bar. Either way this should be on your to eat list while the food and the service is still top notch. Wish they would open one further north with easier parking. I would eat there 3 times a week!
