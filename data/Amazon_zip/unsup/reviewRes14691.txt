This place is cool. Their brew is adequate at best though. I felt the Whit, IPA and Porter to be best. However, they have a good beer selection over all. The food is excellent, however if you plan to eat try to get there during off hours. This is simply due to the fact that I have not been there once that was less than a 2 hour wait. All in all, a great addition to Logan Square and MUCH needed.
