This is a nice alternative to Frontera Grill when you are looking to still get a taste of the Rick Bayless experience. The tortas are downright phenomenal--I'm subtracting one star though because I'm never full after just one sandwich. Most of the sandwiches have very lean portions of meat (with a few exceptions). I cannot speak for the caldos, which I have been told are extremely filling (I'm not really a soup guy). Chipotle Chicken: delicious. Extremely flavorful and the tomato sauce that is used is the perfect complement. Portion of meat is quite small though. Choriqueso: fantastic as well, but not nearly enough meat...could eat two in one sitting. Milanesa: breaded chicken--really damn good, and probably the best value for your $ as far as portion size goes. Pepito: shortribs...yet another torta that does not disappoint. Would definitely get this one again. Cochinita Pibil: suckling roasted pig. Tasty but there's not enough flavor when you compare it to the others. Goat Barbacoa (Saturday special): Downright incredible, and I don't even really care for goat. This sandwich is simply poppin with flavor. Churros: yummmmmmm. Not a bad deal at 3 for $4. It's definitely a privilege to live walking distance from this place--I keep missing out on trying the pork belly because it's sold out every time I go on a Wednesday! Check it out.
