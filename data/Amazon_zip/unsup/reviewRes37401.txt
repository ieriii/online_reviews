I feel dirty for liking this place so much because it's expensive, more posh than any other grocery store I've been to, and not too close from where I live. But the produce is great and the food is always well-stocked. The cafe is also amazing. The food here is so good, I would seriously come here everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could afford it. The sandwiches are reasonably priced and super delicious.  Fox & Obel is like the preppy sister of the more grunge-y, "alternative" brother, Trader Joe's. F&O is also open pretty late (until midnight, I think) so you could even do some grocery shopping or grab some grub after a seeing a movie (because AMC River East is like right across the street). Great location, awesome food, great selection of goods! Wish it weren't so bad for my wallet.
