NOT BOTTOMLESS Being quite the regular bruncher while living in Baltimore and leaving my brunch partner behind, I haven't gone since I've been back in the city. Well, thankfully she came for a visit this weekend to get me back into the swing of things! I'm glad it was here too. I had been wanting to try this place, and being the good helper she is, she had done some homework to find this place too. Perfect! We get here and the wait is about an hour and a half. No problem. We put our name down and shop on Milwaukee for most of that time. After we finished we headed back over to the line and soon after we're seated at our table. (the hostess is fun-she gets you excited for getting called in next). You have to understand that my friend and I usually went to brunch at bottomless places, but because the reviews were so high and we weren't in it for the drinking on this day, we were okay without the bottomless option. I don't think anyone would ever get in if they had that option, no one would leave! Especially because they have raspberry pear, black raspberry grapefruit, and orange mango mimosas And bloodys too! Boy were those raspberry pear mimosas good. They were fresh that's for sure. Our food: the chocolate tower French toast and beef tenderloin eggs Benedict-divine. The meat was melt in your mouth good and the French toast sauce was to die for. It was a creamy banana flavor. I don't know what the toast was, maybe raisin or something, but it worked. The display of the food was really attractive. Because there is usually a crowd on weekends they try to et everyone in and out really fast. This is okay by me since I like fast service! They were quick to box our food and bring out check. We were out the door in less than an hour and left more than satisfied. Bongo Room has made me determined to keep on brunching.
