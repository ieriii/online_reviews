It's cheap. It's authentic. It's local. But it just doesn't taste as good as Chipotle. Anyone saying otherwise is just lying to themselves because they like that it's cheap and authentic and local. Meat quality is questionable, and the steak is a little chewy. All that said, the steak does have a really good grill flavor and I dig the corn tortillas. And that horchata is incredible. I got adventurous and went for the tongue taco. It was definitely tender, but I've had better flavored lengua elsewhere. The green salsa in the bottles is also awesome. Spicy and alive with flavor-probably the best part of the meal, in my opinion. Bottom line-cheap, authentic, and local. But come on, it's NOT the best taco in Chicago people.....I'm sure it would be tastier intoxicated, but then again, I'm pretty sure everything greasy is. I think el burrito mexicano will remain my go to drunk mexican food.
