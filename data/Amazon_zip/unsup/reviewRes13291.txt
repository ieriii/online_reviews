I am in LOVE with Revolution Brewing Company. I ended up here on a Sunday afternoon whilst flying solo and went to the bar for some IPA sampling. I wish that they sold their beer in bombers, but alas, they only sell in growlers and I already had a growler sitting in my car (that needs to be drank ASAP) so I had to pass. However, I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE because the beer was excellent.  First, let's talk about the ambiance. Super simple wood, concrete, modern fixtures, and clean lines. Almost like a chic warehouse. Also? There was Metal playing the whole time I was there. *SWOON*...oh, how I love Metal bars. \m/ Second, the hostesses and bartenders were the bomb. Great service, super friendly, knowledgeable about the beers, and everyone was really cool too. I would sell my soul to the Devil to work here. Seriously. On to the beers. I tried three IPAs that were currently on tap: Iron Fist Pale Ale: Dry-hopped with Centennial, Cascade, Chinook and Amarillo hops but super easy to drink. I had this last, after the more hopped up IPAs, but it definitely should have been my first as it was the least hoppy of the three. Anti-Hero IPA: YES! Super hoppy but not overly so. Good flavor and aroma with no crazy malt backbone to make you have that thick-stays-around-forever mouthfeel. Double Fist (Double Iron Fist IPA): HELL YES. THIS is what I will come back for. This beer had a really good citrus hops flavor and aroma and wasn't TOO hoppy or malty. PERFECTION.   Revolution, I love you.
