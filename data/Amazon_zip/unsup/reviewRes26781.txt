MMMMM sweet sasafrass this pizza is damn good!!!!  Good bless Pequods. I really do love pizza (who doesn't really, maybe people who like to kick puppies)....and Pequods is fan-freaking-tastic. To each his/her own, and I know not everyone loves this place, but I know FAR more people that do love Pequods and drool at the though of it as I do. I typically order just a basic pepperoni pizza and find myself drifting off into a happy place as I eat it....oozing with cheesy gooeyness, just the right kind of crust with the right thickness. 5 Stars.
