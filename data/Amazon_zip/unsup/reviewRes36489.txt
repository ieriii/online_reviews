Been going here for quite some time, now, and it still fits the bill. Happened to go here last week for some post-birthday sushi noms, and did not leave disappointed. My dinner mate and I maxxed out on a selection of rolls, including but not limited to: LaFiesta, Volcano, Philly. The LaFiesta is my favorite, hands down. What began as a seasonal special is now on the regular menu, and it packs a punch with its little slices of jalapeno on the top of each roll. The quality is consistent, the portions are good, the prices are legit (though I always end up spending a bit more than I bargained--yea, better add a sweet potato tempura roll onto that--but never break the bank).
