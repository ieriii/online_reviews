Oh Anteprima...I used to love you but last Saturday night you left us waiting over a half hour for our 9:30 reservation. Then at 10pm when we came back to check in, we were told that there were still 4 tables ahead of us. What did the hostess do? Shrug her shoulders and offer our party of three two spaces at the bar. Sigh. Your food is good but your service needs some polish. We are pretty easy diners but you left us feeling neglected and unappreciated.  The two stars is for last time I had a good meal there.
