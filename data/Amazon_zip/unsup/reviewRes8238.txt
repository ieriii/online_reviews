Definitely the best pizza in Chicago from a pizza purist standpoint at least, being from Jersey I think am qualified to make that sort of determination. Although I love Chicago food, I find it frustrating that it is easier to get good pizza in San Diego then it is here. If you like light, wood-fired, tasty fresh ingredients this is the spot. We literally stumbled upon it about a year ago and are so glad we did. This authentic Italian Pizza here in Chicago, not New York or Chicago style, Italian.  Fresh mozzarella and sauce, if the pizza has sauce, is applied in the perfect proportions to every pizza. They have an amazing seafood antipasto and the what I think is homemade mozzarella is the best I have ever had, that includes several trips I have made to Italy. If you want authentic Italian Pizza without having to worry about paying "tourist" prices, navigating Roma traffic or snutting in stinky Venice air this is the spot. RrL
