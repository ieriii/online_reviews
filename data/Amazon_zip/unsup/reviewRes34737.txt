I'm going to write this while I'm still angry about it.  I've been going to Sultan's for around 5 years now and have never been treated the way I was tonight.  My fiance and I ordered our favorites and got them promptly and headed to the register. The guy behind the register, I believe is the son of the lovely woman who owns the market. I set our food on the counter, but the woman who had paid before us stopped to ask for a plastic bag. It was pretty loud in there and she was shorter than the register and very soft spoken when she asked him for the bag. He appeared to ignore her and ask me what we had so he could ring it up. Trying to be gracious, I stopped and told him that she had asked for a plastic bag. With a look of entire detest on his face, he snapped at me, "I heard her, I speak English."  I'm sorry. Did I walk in wearing a KKK outfit and start yelling about white power in this place? Do I look like the Governor of Arizona?  Where did he even think for a microsecond that I didn't think he spoke English?! I'm a regular patron there for crying out loud! I calmly told him with a smile glued to my face that I knew he spoke English, I just wasn't sure if he had heard the soft-spoken girl hiding behind the register in the very busy, very noisy restaurant he was trying to deal with. Obviously since all the changes with staff, not only has the sandwich making gone down hill (I enjoying my sandwich in one piece, beautifully layered like they used to do it, as opposed to all the ingredients crammed down in the bottom until it's bursting at the seams and nothing but mush), but the treatment of their patrons has too.  I was completely insulted by his attitude and his comments. For the record, I've had plenty of people assume I don't speak English either (I'm Puerto Rican and Pacific Islander), but I've never bitten their heads off for it. My suggestion: Learn some customer service techniques or be prepared to lose a couple of your regulars from down the street.
