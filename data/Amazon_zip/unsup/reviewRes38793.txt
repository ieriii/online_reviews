They definately have a great selection of beers, particularly those of the Belgium style and I debated giving them more stars but there are a few issues. I think Hopleaf may be a victim of its own success. It gets very crowded and loud, conversations can be hard, unless you like to scream. One Saturday evening we waited over two hours for a table, I guess that's what we get for arriving at 8. But on the plus side that gave us the opportunity to get even more blitzed on beer. Some people have complained about the bartenders. Some are more attentive than others but I have never had a rude one. The servers I had have been fine too. Once our frites were cold but the server promply replaced them upon our drawing her attention to them. I wish their kitchen opened earlier at 3 instead of 5, but what can you do? I'll still visit but I think the best plan is to get there when they open at three, snag either a seat at the bar or grab a table in the bar area, drink until five then order food. So what if you're starting your evening early, all the more time to have fun.
