My fiance and I got our birthday cake from Alliance and it was amazing. Not only did it taste great, but it was so classic looking. It was everything that we wanted and more!  I also think they have the best cookies. I love their insult cookies, don't ask why. I'm not particularly mean spirited, but they were really funny. Plus I love their frosting on the sugar cookies.  I will be getting my next birthday cake here!
