I've been going to this place for a long time and prepare yourselves for a SMOKE FEST lol it gets packed and smokey! The service is ok I commend the nice hispanic male waitor who attended to us very well but some of the Korean waitresses can be a bit snobby and don't really pay attention to the customer's needs nor understand....the food is incredible with side orders galore like potato salad, tofu, kimchee and seaweed, bbq is amazing.....enough said
