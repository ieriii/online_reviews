This place is amazing. They shouldn't be forced to call themselves a steakhouse, because this vegetarian felt equally at home. Maybe just a delicioushouse? The cheddar biscuits with tangerine butter you start out with are incredible. Everything on the harvest table is worth trying. Some things maybe you should get two bites worth: the mushrooms with the feta dressing, the asparagus, the pineapples, and the potato salad in particular. Oh, and the homemade mozzarella. So, so unbelievable. My friends who are meativores really enjoyed everything... I tried some scallops and some catfish-- both were phenomenal, and this is coming from someone who's mostly lost the ability to taste differences in meat and seafood. Zed451 brought all of my palate back in one evening. Their cocktails are fantastic and inventive, especially the cranberry old fashioned (the bourbon lemonade is great too). The service is unbeatable-- the (sous-)chefs who present the meats really do make them in the kitchen! And their pastry chef deserves awards... Try their peanut butter and jelly ice cream. Even if you don't have room, this is impossible to regret. Everyone here is impossibly friendly and knowledgeable and good at what they do... They even made me a special tofu and vegetable skewer when I was just planning to indulge without remorse on the harvest table. Don't pass up a chance to come here, and if it's nice enough to grab a drink on the rooftop, DO IT. It's absolutely gorgeous up there.
