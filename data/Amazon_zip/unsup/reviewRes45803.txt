Stopped here for brunch on a Sunday. I had a Mexican inspired dish that I can't remember the name of,and I absolutely loved it. Others in my party ordered omelettes and pancakes, and they all seemed great. Service here is spectacular, and the prices are fair. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood.
