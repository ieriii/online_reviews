PIECE. i love everything about you including your dorky name / logo. but then again you are so much more than a "Luigi's" or "Giordano's" so only a cheeky title will do. i'm going to come right out and say i got really drunk and ate pizza combinations that had no business being together [clams + goat cheese + jalapeno] while there. and i wouldn't have had it any other way.
