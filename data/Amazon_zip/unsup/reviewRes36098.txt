The waitress seated us at a lovely window table, and served us tea and coffee promptly. She didn't visit us too much or too little, although we felt a little rushed at the end. I had a really delicious omelette with goat cheese, served with little red potatoes. My boyfriend had scrambled eggs, red potatoes, and bacon. I loved my dish, he only approved of his. His orange juice was warm, though. What the hell. Coffee was delicious! The indie music was hilarious. It was some Sigur-Ros time shit. Kind of intense for breakfast..The waitresses were sweet, too. TL;DR This is a nice little place to brunch and chat, but not incredibly spectacular.
