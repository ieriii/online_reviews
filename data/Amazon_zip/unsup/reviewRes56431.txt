We came in for dinner a couple nights ago and they were packed. I mean there was an actual line! The owner was nice, and we were pretty grateful. He had given everyone waiting on a table eggrolls and dumplings. By the time we got seated, the food was fast and the service was great. I do apologize because we did sit until they closed and the owner looked oh so tired but told us we may sit there until we want to leave. I decided to come back for lunch. I came in yesterday and they were quite busy. That's good to see. The food is still wonderful. And the prices during lunch is even better. Plus you get so much food. I love the fact that I could leave here always full.I'm figuring that this place is great to throw parties. I might just make a reservation for my sister's graduation. Figuring by the way the place gets filled up, I think I might just have to make reservations everytime I come.
