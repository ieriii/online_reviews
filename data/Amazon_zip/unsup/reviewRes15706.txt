Most of the time we just get delivery from here...fast and easy. However last Saturday we decided to venture and eat in Calo. We had great service and a very friendly staff! I got a glass of white wine and we ordered a medium thin crust pizza with onions and half sausage. Mmm. It's even better than delivery, if that's even possible. Thin, crispy cracker crust, TONS of cheese, sauce and toppings. It's perfectly proportioned in terms of ingredients. It's a little pricey to eat in, especially with the wine, but it's hard to beat a fresh Calo thin crust right out of the oven. WTB more pizza NAO
