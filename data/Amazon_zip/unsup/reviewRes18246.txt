Fat Girl likey the Bad Apple. I was very surprised that they served poutine here. I was even more surprised that it tasted awesome! Now I have a reason to go back to Canada, because I want to compare it to the original. I ordered the Frenchie Burger, that had fried onions, truffle sauce, and spinach. I'm glad the spinach was fresh and not cooked, because I love fresh spinach and hate cooked spinach. The truffle sauce was really tasty. They have a really really really long list of beer, which is pretty awesome for a place that is not a brewery. (somebody please correct me if I'm wrong...) I'm not much of a beer person, but I would come back to try their ciders.
