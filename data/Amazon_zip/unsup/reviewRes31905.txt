Nice cultural diversity among the crowd, and despite being under tons of stress (it was Saturday nite plus the last day to redeem Groupons), the staff were the friendliest I've ever had anywhere. We noticed from Demera's online menu that GF injera was an option, which meant that my wife didn't have to sit on her hands and watch me down the whole thing myself. If anything, the GF version (made from teff, I'm thinking) was superior to all others, especially in its rich brown color. And the honey wine? Wow! That was tastier than any mead I've ever had. Hell, it was the only wine I've ever thoroughly enjoyed. E and I have never, ever before finished a bottle of wine in one sitting. All in all, a fabulous feast--we staggered out of there, seams ready to burst.
