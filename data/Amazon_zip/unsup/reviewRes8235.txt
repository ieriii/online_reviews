Once when I was a little kid I ate so much at Ponderosa that I could hardly walk out and I sat in the car and cried as my parents drove us home. I hadn't come close to that feeling til I went to Fogo de Chao. Sure, my belly felt like it was going to burst and just breathing was a big effort, but I was happy, in a meat induced euphoria! I agree with others when they say not to eat for a while before coming here, you will need the extra room. Make sure not to go too crazy at the salad bar...it's all about pacing yourself at Fogo. If you go early at lunchtime you beat the crowds and it costs significantly less. The service here is excellent, our waiter made sure that our favorite meats kept on coming to our table and worked very hard to make sure we were happy with our meal.
