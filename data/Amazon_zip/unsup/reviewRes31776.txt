I'm scratching my head over the some of the so-so reviews. We loved this place! My wife had the Pumpkin Pancakes, my father-in-law had the Garden Omelette and I had the Nanadict - all superb. We had fresh squeezed OJ and coffee which were also great. Then I ordered a Mocha to go.. and it was maybe the best Mocha I've ever had... organic milk, chocolate and Metro coffee I think they told me. We will be back and often. It's so fun to find a place that wows you like Nana did us this morning. This is on-par with Meli Cafe and Sweet Maple Cafe.
