I've been here twice for brunch and was impressed both times! Big Jones is Southern coastal cooking- I grew up in the Florida Panhandle and my family is from New Orleans, so I know the food. Big Jones delivers.  One thing that struck me was how fresh all the ingredients tasted and how balanced the flavors in each dish were. Big Jones relies on local and sustainable farms for most of their food, and I tasted the difference of that attention to detail in the food.  The beignets are not quite the same as you'd get in the French Quarter at Cafe du Monde- Big Jones gives them a bit of a tangier, yeastier flavor (almost like a sweet sourdough), but they are still a deliciously indulgent appetizer. I've had the Eggs New Orleans and the Cheddar Corn Cakes. Both were excellent, but I preferred the Eggs New Orleans- tasty crab cakes and an amazing sauce. The Cheddar Corn Cakes were a bit on the salty side (granted I prefer less salt in general in favor of other spices), but overall yummy and more than satisfying.  My sister had the grits and loved 'em. The sweet potato biscuits were okay, but a bit dry.  The staff has been very friendly and the service quick both times I've visited- other yelpers must have visited on busier days (although both of my visits were on weekends around 11:00am, seems prime time for brunch). Overall, I would recommend Big Jones for a change of pace for brunch. If anyone in your party is vegetarian, however, most of the dishes will be off limits, as they often involve seafood or pork in one form or another.  I'm sure they'll still find something tasty, they just won't have as many options.
