My boyfriend took me here last month. Our server recommended what we should ordered and got the following: - Trout, amazing but watch out for some fish bones - Chicken, my bf was a fan... I thought it was okay. I liked that the chicken seasonings and oils rubbed off on the fries that came with it -- made the fries really tasty. - Serrano Ham, melted in your mouth and not too salty - Fried Eggplants w/ aioli sauce, could've skipped this... it's just battered, fried eggplants, nothing special. Service could be better. Our main server checked up on us once. I told him about the fish bones but didn't really seem to care. I think we ordered too much food so I think our server was just trying to get a bigger tip since we were unfamiliar w/ the menu and he was the one who suggested what and how much to order. We certainly could've done w/o the eggplant as our vegetable (our server thought we needed a vegetable dish with our order -- fried and battered discounts any vegetable quality of the eggplant, really). I would recommend getting just one big dish and a couple of smaller plate items. I would recommend the trout for your main dish. Nice ambience and decor.
