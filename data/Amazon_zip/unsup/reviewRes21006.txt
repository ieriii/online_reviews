I came here on a busy Saturday night. Although we had reservations for four, my two friends decided that that would be the perfect night for relationship drama, so it ended up being just my sis and I. I loved the fact that the place had a relaxing bar atmosphere, but was done up so that it was definitely more upscale. Our waitress was great and was the kind who didn't mind listening to our questions, and offering up some great suggestions, even though you could tell she was super busy. She even recommended some drinks that were no longer on the menu, and they ended up being perfect. Although we didn't venture too far into the menu, both of us ended up well fed and happy with our choices. My sis with her fish & chips and me with their regular burger, which came w/ its own separate plate of fries. Dammit, this is why you should not do reviews at ten in the morning - now my ass is hungry.
