This is good stuff. There are some solid deep dish pizzerias in the SF Bay Area (Zachary's, Patxi's), but this pizzeria trumps them all. I ordered the Special (sausage, green peppers, onions, mushrooms) which arrived at my table about 45 minutes after I pre-ordered it. Beer selection on tap was simple - 5 choices with two being local breweries. Hungry people beware - at 9pm there was still a 30-45 minutes wait for a table. Expect to wait at the bar with a beer before sitting at your table and don't forget to pre-order or else you will kick yourself waiting for the pizza to arrive. Well worth the wait though and I will be back.
