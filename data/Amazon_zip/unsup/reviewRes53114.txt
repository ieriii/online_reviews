I have to agree with Susan K. I went there for the fist time and ordered a steak with rice, beans and yuca. If you are a eater like myself you know when you are served low quality food. Everything served there did not match the money that you were spending. The restaurant has gotten bigger, yes but with that said it has lost its touch and flavor of cuban cuisine. Its just another mediocre restaurant with "Cuban" on its front door. I really wanted to love this place soo much! What a dissapointment. For the same price and better food i prefer to stick to Sibouney on Western Ave.
