This is by far my favorite bar in the city. I make it my destination for any kind of celebration, as long as it's just me and a few friends. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said, The drinks are fabulous, the decor is outstanding, I can even deal with the bitchy service I get every once in a while. (Only once in a while, depending who's hosting.) It's definitely a place that is more of a treat considering the price, but it is well worth it.
