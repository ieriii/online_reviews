truly amazing food, FIVE STARS.... however the wine pairing was poorly explained and the lists should be printed out for review. The Sommelier could have been nicer and should have explained that some wines were meant to last three courses.  The Desert was improved over last years tobacco mint sundae. This was the last time due to the Cryptic crappy wine pairing, lack of wine list and weird wine pricing. They should implement an ala carte wine pairing with actual prices per glass instead of a flat rate. The wine was great but the way it was handled was so bad that it brings down my overall rating which is a shame because the rest of the place runs so smoothly..NEXT.
