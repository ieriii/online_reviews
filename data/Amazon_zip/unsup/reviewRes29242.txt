I don't get the hype about this place. Since moving to Chicago a year ago, I've heard so much about this and how hard it is to get in. So we decided to try it out for brunch, when you can get a reservation. Food was fine but nothing special, portions are small, and prices are high. Definitely wouldn't bother going back, as there are other modern Mexican places I've been that are better.
