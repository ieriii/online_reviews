Admittedly, I'm not really sure what Cuban food is supposed to taste like so I had my reservations after reading some of the previous reviews about this not being super authentic Cuban food. Authentic or not, the food and the experience was awesome. Bloody Mary was nice and spicy, appetizers were generous and delicious (i tried the green tamales and quesadillas). Carne a la Parilla is probably in my top 5 Hispanic style steaks i've had in chicago, nicely marinated, tender complemented with a plate of roasted vegetables.
