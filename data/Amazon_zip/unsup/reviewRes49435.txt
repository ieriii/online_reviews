Once our server stopped rambling on and on about the minutiae of the food and its origins, my experience got so much better. I'm happy with any glass of wine put in front of me, even Franzia, so I'm not the best judge of wines. The cheeses were delicious, and again, if you aren't too picky about the flavors, I think anyone would enjoy the cheeses Bin puts forward. It's great to try some local cheeses, too, since we're all so used to great cheeses being imports. However, they had a goat cheese that was sourced from some farm by Urbana, Illinois and it was the best goat cheese I have ever tasted--reason being that it was very mild and subtle. That's the kind of goat cheese I like to get down with. I had pepper encrusted swordfish over mashed potatoes, and it was delicious. The swordfish was perfectly seasoned, and the texture was very firm and the taste was oh so fresh.  I was a bit peeved that the server tried to talk me out of the dessert I chose...I take recommendations well, but he condescended and therefore lost points with me.
