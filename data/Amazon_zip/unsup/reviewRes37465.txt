I've popped in for casual meal before heading to the movies at AMC River East. I like the cafe. Good food, pricey. Grilled cheese and tomato soup. Classic winter comfort food that I crave.  The store is waaay too expensive for me to actually shop here. It may be good, but it's just too much. The bakery looks delectably tempting. If I hadn't been going to the movies, something tasty would've been mine. Overall, it's good. The cafe is a highlight, but for actual groceries, be prepared to pay.
