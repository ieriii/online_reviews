2 1/2 really. The worst of the three Brazillain steakhouses I've been to. A common trick for buffet restaurants is to oversalt the food so you get thirsty and fill up on water. I expect this everywhere but this place took it over the top! EVERYTHING was EXTREMELY SALTY, the meats and the salad bar offerings. I had to spit out the sausage it was inedible! The salad bar was very limited on top of it. The service was the best but doesn't make up for the food. The little pop overs are perfect! But I will never go back when I know Fogo or Brazzas is much better.
