clearly, this is one of those "places to eat before you die" joints. three of us came here on MLK monday at 10:30, ready for an hour plus wait. (btw i don't think ANYTHING is delicious enough to wait more than an hour for). luckily we waited about 15 minutes since it was just opening. everything we got was pretty solid. i was afraid the hype of it all would make me hate the place, but luckily the encased meats spoke for themselves. the highlights were definitely the foie gras & duck sausage (of course, a lovely combination!), and the elk sausage (surprisingly not gamey and very delicious! the mustard and cheese combination was yum). the celebrity sausage of the day was a chipotle chicken sausage and was just too smoky for me to the point it was bitter. i was not a fan of those flavors. we also ordered a corn dog and the atomic bomb or something, hello spicy!!!
