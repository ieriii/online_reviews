This is the most unique bar in the city. I've been many times and it's been a consistently impressive experience. The drinks are incredible. It's a great date night or girls night. Sitting at the bar is something everyone should try at least once. The bartenders are true entertainers. Even the small plates food is good. And bonus - a cozy fireplace in the back room for the cold Chicago winters.
