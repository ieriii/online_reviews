We ate at Alinea on February 19. From our first interaction with the staff to the final goodbye this was an experience totally out of the ordinary. The service was outstanding, the wine pairing creative and fun. The food was surprising, fun, creative and innovative. We didn't love every single one of the 17 'courses' but all of them were well thought out and brilliantly executed. We got a tour of the kitchen which was great and the 4 hours that we spent here were worth every penny. There are a few restaurants in the world that operate at this high level and we felt really fortunate to live in a city that houses a restaurant like this. Alinea really has to be experienced.
