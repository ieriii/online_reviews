I went here last week with my Page looking to sit outside. Unfortunately, they did not have the patio set up yet, but it was getting a little chilly so we just sat inside. We were told it would be an hour wait, but we were seated in about 30 minutes. Bonus. After we sat down, we ordered an appetizer and enjoyed a glass of wine. Before we got our appetizer, the chef came up with a small pasta dish in his hand and told us there was an expo coming to the area featuring different cuisines of Italy and offered us their entry. Bonus again. I love free food. It was spaghetti with a bit of basil, tomato sauce and cherry tomatoes. I am not one who normally likes tomatoes on their own, but I have to say, these tomatoes were to die for. They were bursting with flavor and fairly firm. There was not the normal explosion of goo in your mouth. I could eat them by the handful. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the basil was very nice. We ordered two pizzas, one with mozzarella and basil and one with prosciutto. They were both delicious. The pizzas are not cut here and the knives were not designed to cut through the prosciutto so one was a little hard to cut, but the flavor was great.  After the meal, I thanked the chef and he was most appreciative. Everyone at this place is wonderful. It is a great place for some light pizza, which can be a nice break from Chicago style.
