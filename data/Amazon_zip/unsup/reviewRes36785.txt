I think Indie suffers a bit from trying to do too much when they could excel at a few things. The menu feels more like a short novel, and the sheer number of choices is a little overwhelming. Certainly I understand why they would go with both types of cuisine, but in the process I think they miss on a lot of mediocre dishes.
