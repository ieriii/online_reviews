Barely edible! After reading all of the positive reviews, I was so looking forward to trying Pequod's pizza. I ordered a medium, cheese, pan pizza for takeout. The box did not feel very hot, and I opened it to find lukewarm, soggy pizza. The cheese was not melted, and looked like layers of sliced mozzarella on top of thick bread with sauce on top. Even the charred edge (caramelized crust??) of the pizza was cold. The only redeeming quality was the sauce, which made the pizza barely edible.
