Finally the words I hear on Top Chef, I was actually able to try at Davanti! Polenta - Check Pork belly - Check Truffle sauce - Check Some mushroom sauteed in some animal part - Check Why I don't consider myself an adventurous eater, I loved Davanti and everything....repeat....everything is exceptional here! Came here for my office hoilday party and while they don't take reservations, get here early and seating isn't too bad. We sat at a high table in the center of the restaurant and it was perfect! The decor is rustic-ish with candles in those 'Ball' jars, candelabras, brick, soft lighting and wood everywhere. Since we had a large group, we had one person do the ordering, so I can't tell you exactly what we got. But if you read my note above...it doesn't matter because everything was delcious. My favs were the grilled bread with ricotta and honey, olive oil polenta, one of their pizzas, foccacia, pasta with black pepper and the chocolate mouse for dessert. The wine was also delicious and the staff brought the food out in a timely matter and the wine kept on coming. We had a wonderful time and for a party of 15, the place worked out great. I was really impressed and I already have plans to go back and take the parents this time!
