Had a very bad experience here.  Sultan's staff was extremely rude, slapped the wrong food on my friend's plate, and when she asked to correct the order, he called her a 'b*tch'. No apologies from the manager, instead he further reprimanded us not being clear. It seemed the entire staff there were stoned, lethargic but pissed off at the same time.  Well, we sucked up the rudeness and sat down... only to find our table crawling with cockroaches...When we got disgusted and decided to sit outside, there were mice scattering under and around the chairs. Anyways, we had a very very bad experience here. The food was mediocre at best, the place was FILTHY, and the staff extremely rude and very mean. I've never seen so many unhappy faces from staff in a restaurant before.
