I like Hopleaf. Great Beer list ...mmmDaisycutter Ale!! And interesting food, although I will say that the portion-to-price seems weak. Your concept says "Big Beers, Hearty Food, Exciting Menu" but then the plate comes, and well, the balloon deflates. Clearly there is a winning combination here, judging by the crowds and the near two hour wait almost anytime... but for myself Hopleaf will only be that occasional restaurant.
