Stopped by for a quick sandwich and plantains to go. I think this might become my favorite sandwich restaurant. Very nice people, good comfort food, and extremely reasonable prices. Some have reported the food can be bland so I suggest the hot peppers. The peppers and avocado made my sandwich tasty.  This is not a fine dining establishment, but it is the kind of restaurant where I can see myself being a regular. The parking is a bit of a drag, and the place is a bit small, but I think the food is worth it.
