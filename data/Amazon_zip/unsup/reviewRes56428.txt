So I was sick a couple of days ago and decided that I wanted soup. And what's better than some Pho? Chicken Noodle Soup (american) is officially KICKED TO THE CURB. Basically most of ALL my friends order Pho when they're sick now.I of course had to order the Beef Pho. Plus an order of Shrimp Spring Rolls. DELICIOUSSSS. I love how everything comes on the side; the fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, and lime. Who could forget the Peanut/Plum Sauce that comes with the rolls or the dark sauce and hot sauce that comes with the soup. I like mine with extra hot sauce. Just talking about it is making me want some Pho.So because I was pretty sick, I did order delivery for the first time. The owner was so sweet! Knowing that I was sick, he sent me Hot Tea. He promised it would make me feel better and of course it did. And it was really good tea! He also had said it would take 45 minutes to an hour which was sad to hear. But to my surprise the delivery person did make it to my place in about 30 minutes. NICEEEEE. Crazy thing was, the food was still HOT! Yummy in my tummy. And to top it all off, he sent complimentary oranges. What's better in this type of weather than some vitamin c?    :)So, on a good note, I can say that if you don't want to leave the house or your lazy or your stuck somewhere. Order for delivery, it might just be the highlight of your day. Hope I helped make some decisions out there lol.
