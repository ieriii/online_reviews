Everything was different, I didn't like their bread, and the food was spicy which is not my fav, but the shrimp and lamb were okay. I had heard good reviews about their honey wine, but they said they didn't have any. I liked their tiramisu, but not that much. Coffee came in a strange pot which was nice. The staff were friendly, and overall, not a 5 star restaurant, but 4? yeah, we had a good time there. Hint: You'll have to wait for a long time for your food to come. Get some sambusa if you'll get bored. Don't go there late if you have to go to work early the next day.
