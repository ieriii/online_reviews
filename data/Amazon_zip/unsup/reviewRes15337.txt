My husband and I went here on Saturday to celebrate our anniversary. We went for brunch and had an amazing meal. We shared the egg and pepper pizza and the pork belly sandwich. Both were delicious! The bun on the sandwich was melt-in-your-mouth good. We also enjoyed a couple of brunch drinks...beer with OJ...yum! Would not usually think of a brewery for brunch, but was so great! Our server was friendly and knowledgable too. A great experience.
