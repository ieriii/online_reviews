I've only been to Meli once for breakfast -- on the morning of the Chicago marathon -- and it was outstanding! I had the Raspberry Marscapone French Toast - it was absolutely delectable. I'm a hard person to please at breakast - I always regret getting salty over sweet or sweet over salty. But not at Meli - the french toast was so amazing I had no room for regret!  The service was all pretty Greek girls (which reminded me of that one episode of Seinfeld) and they were very attentive. Anyways, I highly recommend for a low key brunch!
