Great food, its fast, and its a great deal. I usually get Kefta Kabob with Rice and Lentils and top it off with Baba Ghanooj with LOTS of red chili sauce. This place has something for everyone, especially veggies or vegans. The salad bar is great also btw. Menu: http://www.chicagofalafe They also do delivery.
