Alright tried it out on Tuesday half price burgers. I suggest going ealry before 6 or later after ten. We arrived around 7 and ended up waiting about 40mins. However I must say the best veggie burger I have ever had and if u check in on yelp u get a free beer. I went for the "electric chair" and it was the perfect amount of spicy. It took quite awhile to get our food but it was well worth the wait. Staff was friendly. Patio is a plus
