I hit Big Jones with some friends on a Saturday evening, based on the raves another friend had given their brunch. Their coastal and creole food with a twist is just the right kind of comfort. I started with the Blue crab cheesecake, followed by the fried chicken salad and one of the best sidecars I've had in a while. All were very good. The blue crab cheesecake was a real standout, served as it was with a drizzle of five-pepper jelly that struck just the right balance of sweet and savory. One of my dining compatriots made a meal of appetizers and sides, opting for the bean salad and pulled pork topped grit-cakes. The grit cakes were delicious, and judging from the fact that my pal polished off her bean salad with a satisfied smile, I gathered that was alright, too, The only blemish for the evening was my other friend's selection, the ham and cheese sandwich with a mac-and-cheese side. The ham was thick and tasty, but she didn't like the pimento cheese it was paired with at all. The mac was also pretty uninspired, though not actually bad. But perhaps in an era of mac that's been buttered, bechameled, truffled and smoked by every chef this side of the Mason Dixon, we expected too much. In all, two out of three diners in my party really enjoyed our meal, and will happily head back for an evening of fresh, seasonal, coastal-inspired fare.
