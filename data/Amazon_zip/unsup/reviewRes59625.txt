Well, I decided to write a review since I've been noticing that most of the servers here at: "1132 N. Ashland Ave. Chicago, il 60622" are not the same as it was before. My bf and I always go here for late night snack and most of the servers that we had were very friendly and accomodating. However, I ordered for pick up and when I had to get my order the cashier/server had some attitude. Man if you are dealing with a customer please don't show that you're getting irritated. You are there to show a friendly service and not to give attitude with your customers. Very disappointing. Hope the manager is reading some of these comments here on yelp.......
