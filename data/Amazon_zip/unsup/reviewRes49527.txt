I have previously been to Bin 36 to sit in the wine bar and have wine and cheese, and had a good experience. Now I know I will never be back. I went there last night with my boyfriend, around 5 pm for a snack and a few glasses of wine. The place was not at all busy, and we were promptly seated by the manager. Then, we sat for about 15 minutes being completely ignored. A table that was seated about 10 minutes after us promptly received menus and breadsticks - we received none of this.  At one point, after watching the waiter service every single table except ours, we decided we would wait two more minutes then leave. Sadly, he never came to us. It's too bad the service at this place is such garbage, because I used to really like it!
