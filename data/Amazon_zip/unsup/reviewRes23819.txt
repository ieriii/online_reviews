I haven't written a review in awhile so I figured I was due. I love diners drive-ins and dives. I try to go to all the places in Chicago if I can. I saw this place on there and I have never had Coasta Rican food so I really wanted to try it. Wow I was really impressed. First we got the Chifrijo. This appetizer was amazing. I couldn't stop eating until the last bite. I got it mild but it was delicious. Next I got the Pepito sandwich withe ribeye. It was delicious. The cheese, onion, and the bean paste just blended so well together. Last but not least we got the empanadas. You get 3 for $8. We got the spinach and cheese, beef and potato, and chicken. Wow these we're fantastic. They were flaky and crisp. The filling was great and the pico de gallo served with it complimented the empanadas perfectly. Overall this restaurant was awesome and I will be back here in the near future even though I don't venture often in the city. Also the outdoor seating is great to sit in with this awesome weather we are having. I wish I would've gotten an oatmeal shake. I will next time.
