This was by far one of the experiences I've had at an Italian restaurant. Not only was the staff really great and friendly, but the food was delicious! If you are a fan of seafood, I strongly recommend trying the Scoglio (it comes with spaghetti, but I tried it with penne pasta). The clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops were all very fresh. I definitely will be going back soon!
