Only been here once but it was memorable. It's like Whole Foods on steroids.  I have to comment on the meat. They dry age their own beef for 21 days. I requested some NY strip steaks. The butcher picked up a large hunk of meat and hand-sliced it for me to my specifications, right in front of my eyes. And what a piece of meat! It was marbled like Kobe and the dry aging imparts a wonderful, slightly gamy, slightly funky but ultimately extremely decadent flavor. I'd make the trip into the city just to get some more of that. Wow.
