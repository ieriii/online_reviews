It's been 3 good years since we've come, mostly due to not wanting to have a long wait when we were starving, but SO GLAD I was coerced to come this morning. The red velvet pancakes are to die for. They are part of their new rotation, and gosh, that crme angleise it accompanies with is HEAVENLY, as the word derives from. They are right on point with telling you how long the wait is, not at all lying about it to prevent you from leaving and wanting to eat their grub.  The thai ginger chicken sausage is really good, has a nice tad of kick to it. Not as good as the chicken apple sausage, but a nice alternative.  Would recommend to put your name in, and check back in 45 minutes. Peruse and do wonderful window shopping. This place is well worth the wait!!!
