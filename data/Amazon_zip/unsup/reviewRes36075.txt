Amazing restaurant for your weekend brunch! I would give Meli 5 stars, but we were not pleased with our server. She was not very attentive. Having said that, once we ordered, our food came out within 10 minutes. Everything looked and tasted great. We ordered the french toast and the waffles. Both were delicious. Good coffee. Freshly squeezed orange juice. Yummy breakfast!
