I got to Yolk for Saturday brunch around 11:30. As expected, the wait was 45 minutes plus there were so many people waiting that I barely had space to move! I really wish they had a bigger waiting area! Once we were seated, the service was good. We got your coffee pretty quickly (always a good sign!). The menu is quite extensive. They offer everything from crepes and frittatas to omelettes, sandwiches and burgers. I ordered the Popeye's frittata, which was great. The cons: 1) no place to wait for a table & 2) so loud that it was sometimes hard to hear across the table!
