This place is good. Damned good. Super fine. Was looking for a pho fix in Chicago, since I had the day off, so a friend of mine and I hopped on the L and came here. It's right off the Argyle stop, and it kind of pops out at you. They sat us quick, and it's got that really nice 'Viet cafe' type of feel- alot of tables set up pretty close to each other, with all the right condiments set up within easy reach. Their menu is extensive, and I have no doubt that the non-pho items would be top notch. I saw a few other diners enjoying what looked to be some delicious dishes, and if I was in town more often I'd probably be joining them. But as it stands, the pho is damned fine. I had my usual- with all the jibbly bits like tendon and tripe, and it stood up next to some of my favourites back home. I'm sure I'll be back, and when I do I'll definitely try some other dishes. But what I had was good. Damned fine pho. If I lived in town I'd be here all the time!!!
