Piccolo Sogno was hands down the best Italian restaurant I went to last summer. The outdoor is perfect for a date with a deck and trees with lights. The food is out of this world and is well worth the price. I highly recommend the ravioli of choice for the night and the salad. Go ahead and order dessert because they are all amazing!
