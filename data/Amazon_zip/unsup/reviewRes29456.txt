I had better Vegan food in the city... just saying. I went there with my husband's cousin after a day of shopping, and to be honest I was starving! I saw that they had brunch options, so I decided to go with that. I had some sort of sausage/eggs on a bun with some sauce in that. I took too long to write this review, I don't remember the name of the plate, but you can find it in the "popular options". It didn;t really make my taste buds happy, but it was "ok". Service was great, the place gets crowded and tables are not enough far apart. Price is ok. If I go back I will try different stuff from the dining menu. The chocolate chip milkshake was awesome thou.
