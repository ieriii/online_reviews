I was very curious to try Wilde. When it first opened, every time we went to eat here it was a 3 hour wait. We finally went a few weeks ago. I really liked the atmosphere. We sat up near the fireplace. We started with the artichoke dip...very good! I then ordered a side of the mac and cheese. The side portion was huge! My only complaint about it was it was a little greasy. I thought the service was ok. At times are waitress was a little annoying, constantly asking us if we needed something. It got to the point where it was very hard to carry on a conversation. Other than that, I would definitely go back.
