If you like deep dish pizza but hate how heavy it is, then you should try this place. Their pizza is similar to deep dish but its not nearly as heavy, and the sauce they use is the best I've tasted! Its one of the best pizza places in the city (I'm a NY style pizza fan) but its definitely worth going to.
