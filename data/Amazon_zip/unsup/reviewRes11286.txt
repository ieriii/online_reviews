The first time I dined here the service was attentive, but the pizza failed to delight. It was the BBQ pizza, and it was soggy. I mention the pizza because the second time I dined here, which was yesterday, the pizza much improved. The fabled crust, was crunch as proclaimed. The tat embroidered service was a-okay too. A menu which seems to encourage experimentation with toppings is from time to time going to produce a dud. But the white pizza from yesterday is worth a return visit. Though I wish they could enliven the bloody mary a bit.
