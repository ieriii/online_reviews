First, the ambiance is great, it's like eating dinner in a wine cellar. Second, the food is really good. My server, who was very helpful, steered me toward linguine with sea urchin and crab. It was good, but I think I should have tried the octopus dish instead. The crispy pork belly that we had for an appetizer was also good. I have to say, though, for all the talk, I didn't find anything particularly stellar about this restaurant. Except the wait staff, they were exceptional.
