I have been there before and loved it.... But tonight was bad service! We had Emily and she was off big time! Waited for wine....had to remind her and then asked for salad dressing that was ordered to be on the side....never came. The manager comped a glass of wine but I can't recommend for dinner again. No acknowledgement of slow and being remiss???? Good food but not great service tonight and it was a quiet night?
