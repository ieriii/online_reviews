I just moved in across the street and this was the first place I ate out at after moving in. I have to say that it was a great first choice! The food was so delicious and the service was great. I had the salmon with sweet potato fries, my brother had the lasagna, and my mother had a delicious salad with endives. We were all very happy with our meals. The only down side was that entrees take 30 min to come out of the kitchen, so it did seem like we were waiting for a while. The good thing was that we had a bottle of wine and fresh french bread, yum! The place has a real neighborhood feel and they treat you like family. They gave us a free Tiramisu for dessert which was SOOOO good. They also told me all about free wine tastings, cooking classes and other fun events they host. I signed up for their email list and can't wait for my next visit!
