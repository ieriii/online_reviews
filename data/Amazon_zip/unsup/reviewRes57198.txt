I really loved this restaurant and wanted to give it 4 stars, but our experience just didn't reflect it in the end...We had reservations and were seated on time (which apparently, is rare). The mojito I sipped on while waiting was fabulous. The atmosphere was open and festive and I loved the music, though I do agree with one diner that they need to turn the lights down a notch or two. All in all, I thought we were headed for a perfect dining experience.The extensive wine list was impressive but our server's knowledge of what was on it was not. He made generic suggestions (albeit with flare) and then brought out each bottle of wine (15 minutes later) separately. Thankfully, I had not yet moved on to my second mojito so I realized that each bottle he brought was wrong.We tried the ceviche sampler and were very impressed with each one. I would probably go back for drinks at the bar and to snack on these yummy concoctions. One person ordered soup with our apps which never arrived. we rarely saw our server to even let him know this.Dinner Entrees were either fantastic or left much to be desired. The veg plate got bland reviews and the lamb dish got two very adamant thumbs down. The piece of lamb served was mostly just gristle. My braised short rib and the salmon special, however, were quite good. Both tender and moist and unique and bold in flavor. In the end, I will definitely be back for mojitos and apps but will choose to spend my $30 a plate elsewhere for dinner.
