I really enjoyed my dining experience at Cafe 28. We had a large group and the service was great. I couldn't believe how quickly they served the food! I had the honey jalapeo pork chops and they were delicious. I wish they had a bit more spice but still very well done. Oh yea, the serving was enough for 4 people too! The apetizers were ALL soo good - especially the gauc and bacon wrapped dates...whoa!
