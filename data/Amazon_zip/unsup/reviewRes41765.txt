After moving here from a city with a large Vietnamese population, one of my first assignments was to find a great, cheap, neighborhood Vietnamese joint for Pho, one for banh mi, and if possible, one for boba tea concoctions. Nothing fancy--emphasis on cheap. We found all three at Tank Noodle. Everything we wanted was here--great pho, excellent sandwiches, and a great mango smoothie to top it off.
