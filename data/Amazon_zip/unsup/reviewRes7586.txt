I've been here several times and it's never disappointed. If you get the lasagna be sure to wear pants with an elastic band. If you wear pants with an elastic band out to dinner, be sure to call me so I can join you because that would be awesome. The spaghetti with mussels, clam, and shrimp is also excellent, with a little spice. The wine is good, too. I get the cabernet and have never had a problem getting a little buzzed or even drunk. The place is a kinda small and can feel condensed to our claustrophobic friends. Ask to be seated in the back room and you may enjoy your experience more. Or you can sit outside.
