Like this place needs ANOTHER review but it's totally worth mentioning. Went there with a couple girlfriends and loved it. The wine selection is awesome, our waiter was fun and kept us ordering more! We each had a different wine flight and shared a cheese flight which was more than enough. The atmosphere is nice but it can get a little loud. Great place to start out the night or spend your entire pay check. Can get a little pricey so bring a date who wants to pay. :)
