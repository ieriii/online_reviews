Billy Dec joined us for lunch!  Well, not technically, but he was at the table behind us, so it was almost the same as being at the same table :) This place has had so much publicity, I thought maybe it would fall short, but not in the least. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff is as well. There was not one unattractive person that cleared a plate, filled a glass or brought out food. It was hard to stay focused! Now for the edibles...they have a really great lunch special and it's a LOT of food. For $18 you can get a salad/miso soup, a meat entree, rice and 3 pieces of Cali or Spicy Tuna roll. I opted for the Pork and Chicken Adobo and my friend ordered the Char Siu Pork.  Both had tons of flavor, but I will admit that the cut of our meat was a little disappointing. There were some tiny resemblances to parts-is-parts meat.  I got a huge chunk of fat from the char siu and the adobo had a few stringy thingies too. Also, the adobo pork was pretty chewy, BUT everything was flavored very well, so I will overlook the textures.  I'd definitely go back for dinner/drinks...they have a very extensive cocktail list ($$) but the ambiance and vibe is metropolitan, but not too stuffy.
