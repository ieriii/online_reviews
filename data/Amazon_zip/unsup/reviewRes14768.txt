Good sandwiches, great neighborhood resturant. Staff are very friendly and helpful if it is your first time ordering. We got the Cubano and Croqueta sandwiches and a side of Yuca Frita. The Yuca Frita comes with a garlic butter that is also very tasty with the sandwich. The sandwiches are big so a lot of sides are not needed. Very tasty overall. The bf went the next day by himself and got the Media Noche, he said he liked the other two sandwiches better.
