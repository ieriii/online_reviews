My boy friend and I discovered this place on one of our 2 hours Friday night Food-Quests on Foot. It was about 11pm that they had 50% off for all their menu. We ordered a an alcoholic drink. a burger meal and fish and chips for about 18 in total. It was an unbelievably price. The burgers are huge. The fish and chips definitely takes two days to finish. The food quality would be a 3.5 star if I can give one. What makes it a 4 star for me is that one special seating area - a Vintage Library (that resembles U of Chicago libraries). The library has Oscar Wilde's portraits and various other books placed orderly in vantage high bookshelves. The chairs are heavy and plush and the low and round dining tables with candles just makes this place academic and classy! Would come back.
