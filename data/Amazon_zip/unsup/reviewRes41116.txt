We came here for Thanksgiving, I didn't have the best experience at the 1st Ruth's Chris I went to but I was open for a 2nd chance- I am not fond of traditional Thanksgiving Day food, so a nice rare steak is what I had in mind- Drinks: Strong and very good, would come back for the drinks Food: My boyfriend and I both had the filets, I was ok with the butter, impressed with how much flavor the butter gave it-We had a side of broccoli and sweet potato casserole, all was so very good-The broccoli was very fresh and the casserole, oh my goodness was it good- We didn't get any desserts but I would love to go back, glad I gave it a 2nd chance-
