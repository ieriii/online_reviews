I had one of my top ten meals of all time in this restaurant from food to service everything exceeded my expectations. last time i was there i tried there linguine with muscles holy crap there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited. and being 6'3 240lb i can eat Ive never left with out left overs, so big hats off to the serving size. then the service is outstanding Ive never wanted for anything more in regards to staff they are damned near perfect. and tell you the truth i like the look and feel its an old school supper club and has a great mobster like vibe. and if that wasn't enough its price is just rite.
