This restaurant was GREAT! I can't wait to go back! The restaurant itself is realyy fun and beautiful. It makes you feel like its a high class restaurant but its a really comfortable atmosphere. The food is great and the drinks are too. Their raspberry mojitos are deeeeelicious! For dinner I had the special, it was a pork dish. It was seasoned great and plenty of food, and only $25. The server was great too, he knew all about the menu and could explain everything to me. It's food like you've never had before and delicious!
