Here's to you, Piece. This update is a long time coming and more than deserved. When I had a negative experience back in 2009, I was contacted immediately by the owner who not only apologized that the experience hadn't been stellar, but also made great suggestions for pizzas I might like should I try them again in the future. It is still slammed, of course, but the service has been great. Attentive, friendly, and even patient when one is indecisive! I'm not sure if there was just something off with the pizza that was chewy and greasy. I was advised to try something other than pepperoni on a white sauce, and try I have done. My new favorite pie is red sauce with pepperoni, bacon, spinach and goat cheese. Oh delicious!!! Another fave is their white pizza with potato and bacon. Mm... I skip the bar while I wait because I don't like elbowing bros still, but often order a pitcher with friends of my favorite beer, the Worryin' Ale, a brown ale with flavor packed into it. I'm partial to hitting up Piece when it's not quite so busy. Shout out to Barry, the Thursday night karaoke DJ, who plays the hits. Thanks, Piece staff for proving me wrong!
