ZED, you made me love you. I didn't want to. But you made me love you. Your Sunday brunch was divine. The coffee was perfectly brewed, expertly poured and delicious even black. The rather giant cinnamon bun that accompanied it was complementary and perfectly iced. But this is not what made me love you. You had a sumptuous open starter buffet of gourmet foods arranged by type. Harvest grains, fruits, delicate cheeses, pastas and sweets. Even though this was available to merely whet the appetite, I almost decided to skip the main courses and gorge on the starter buffet. But this is not what made me love you, ZED. The chefs wandering by with entrees were the main attraction. Each dish was more delicious than the last, and Zed, you are responsible for making me try and delight in crab cake for the first time! But this is not what made me love you. It was the MAPLE BACON. MAPLE-drizzled? NAY. Baked, slowly, in a sea of maple syrup until the flavor was infused into every savory, chewy bite. The maple bacon sold me on you ZED. You are pricey, and worth every penny.
