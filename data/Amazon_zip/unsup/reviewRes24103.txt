If you're looking for excellent, authentic, Greek food in Chicago, this is on the top of my list. If you're looking for new-age Greek fusion with baby greens, American size fountain beverages, and vegetarian options, this is NOT the place for you. Business lunches here are perfect, you can take your time or tell the staff you're in a rush. I walk from the Sears Tower in the summer, in the winter I'll cab it just to beat the cold. Its also a great place to have a drink and appetizer before a Blackhawks game. My favorite dish by far is zucchini with skorthalia, just like my Yia-Yia makes.
