I still like this place but my latest visit makes it hard to not say anything. I was there with some tourist friends of mine since it showed up on their list of places to visit. Why wouldn't it? A cheap cover and live music every night, in a legendary space that has the first poetry slam every? Not so fast, junior. The staff has always been a bit pretentious but they were helpful this time. Except for one guy, the door dude who said I gave him six when I know that I gave him two fins. I put up a fight but my two guests were already heading towards the front. I can't say that I didn't enjoy myself that evening but it casts a damper on the experience that night and on this place as a whole. Boo
