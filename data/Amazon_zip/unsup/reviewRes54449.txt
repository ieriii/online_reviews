Chicago Diner is the best hands DOWN! The service is great (granted I'm friends with half of them), the food is to diiie for, it's a staple every time friends come in town... My boyfriend and I love the Diner... The Radical Rueben is BY FAR my favorite thing on the menu. Followed closely by the wings, nachos, black bean burger... and well, everything. I think the only thing I didn't like there was the gyros.. but I'm just not a fan of the seasoning of gyros. The sweet potato fries are awesome, as well as all the other sides. Everything there makes me and my tummy happy. I had the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough vegan shake for the first time the other day and OMGOODNESS i died a little. First vegan shake ever, and I've been vegan for a year and a half. Chicago Diner, is there anything you can't do right? :)
