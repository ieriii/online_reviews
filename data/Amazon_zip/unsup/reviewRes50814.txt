I've dined at big jones on several occasions with family and friends and have ALWAYS had a good experience. If I had to describe the food with one word it would be RICH, which is not to say that it lacks finesse - there is plenty of that too! The only dish I recall not loving was at brunch nearly a year ago - pulled pork and grits - which had delightfully rich grits but nearly inedible pork due to an over-vinegared barbeque sauce. However, for that one poor dish, there have been 30 great ones! On the same visit I ordered a ramos gin fizz (one of my favorite cocktails for the morning after) which arrived without key components - namely cream and egg whites. What I was served is know as a silver fizz, not a ramos. Oh well! It was still delightful regardless! On subsequent visits the fried artichoke hearts, beet salad, fried chicken, shrimp and grits and anything pork related have been stellar! The service is always warm and welcoming and I love eating there!
