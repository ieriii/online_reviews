I used to be a super fan of this place (probably because I started eating there when it was BYOB), but it seems to have gotten too big for its britches. Really bad brunch experience - but I really thought they'd do something to make it up to us (they did bring us RAW pancakes among other problems), but we got nothing but a big old "oops", some attitude that we were upset about it, and the bill. I really think I used to love this place because they seemed to care and were trying, now the attitude is more of the "we know what we're doing OBVIOUSLY so why are you bothering us with your concerns". I'll go back and hope they might just have been having an off day, but I fear my old friend and I might just be in different stages of our lives now.
