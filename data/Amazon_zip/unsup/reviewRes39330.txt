Looks like there are enough reviews about food (which was awesome), so I'll comment a bit on the drinks. Tried the white whiskey flight, which was definitely a unique experience. Can't say I enjoyed the white whiskey more but appreciate Longman giving me the opportunity to try. Bitter Redemption was my favorite drink, stronger than the Old Fashioned. Also got to try the Beaver Beer, which was ok, and this hot bourbon drink which was a nice way to finish off the meal. The bone marrow is a must order, probably the best out of all four preparations I've tried so far in the Chicago. Service was spot on. The only minor complaint is that the front entrance gets packed really quickly and it can get a little awkward standing so close to the diners. I understand why they don't take reservations but it would probably solve the crowding.
