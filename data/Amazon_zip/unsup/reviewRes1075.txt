ALL Hail the King! Doug Sohn the Emperor of Encased Meats. Wildly imaginative combinations that always work, step out of your comfort zone and live a little there are many non traditional Dogs that are just awesome. If its Friday get in line now for Duck Fat Fries! Yes the Waits can be very long but its a great opportunity to mingle with fellow Food lovers. If your not adventurous dont fear even the regular Hot Dog is excellent, I'm partial to the Hot Hot dog, thats a great combination I wish more places would pick up. Oh and Dont forget the Green River!
