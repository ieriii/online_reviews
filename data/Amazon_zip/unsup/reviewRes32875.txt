Sunda was recommended by a friend and I went with a group of 8 women there on a Saturday night. It was perfect in every way! The ambiance was great and fun. The food and service was excellent. We could not have been happier with our dinner and it was an excellent choice. I will be back with groups of friends or just my husband!
