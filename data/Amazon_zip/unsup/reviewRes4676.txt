Came here for the second time and confirmed this place is more than worthy of all five stars. In my opinion, this is one of the few "hyped" up places in Chicago that actually lives up to - and exceeds - its great reputation. Everything that I tried was absolutely spectacular. I am one of those (admittedly somewhat obnoxious) picky eaters who is afraid of trying things that are foreign to my (admittedly somewhat bland) palette. A note to those like myself: trust the Pig. Do as it says. Enjoy. Did I know what was in most of the dishes? No I did not. Did this bother me one bit? No it did not. Did this stop me from joining the clean plate club? No it did not. I pigged out (pun intended) and had to drag myself home to lie down in a delightful, swine-induced coma. 100% worth the wait.
