This place has a really cool atmosphere.The decor is totally modern, creative and chic. The chair backs are probably 6 feet tall and very trendy.The drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.Even though there was only a handfull of people inside, a line existed outside...I guess they want people to want to come in!
