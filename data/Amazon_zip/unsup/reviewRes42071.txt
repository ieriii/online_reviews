Went there for a late lunch (about 2 PM) today. There were still quite a lot of people dining there at that hour. The service was fast and attentive. We were done and out within 35 minutes. The lunch was about $30 for both of us without any drink. I ordered Vermicelli bowl topped with BBQ pork and the husband ordered the stir fried wide noodle with seafood. The flavor for my noodle was slightly above average, but I won't say that it is so great that I would want to go back again.  Also, I suspect that they use MSG to add sweetness to the dish. I am slightly allergic to MSG (slight headache afterward). The pork is well grilled and flavored but a little bit on the salty side. They do give you plenty meat, however, I feel the noodles and veggie are a little less in proportion to the meat. Overall, I think the dish is okay, but for $9, I guess I would assume a slightly larger serving for the dish, especially for lunch price. My husband was happy with the noodle, but feeling the seafood has not much flavor to them at all by themselves (some sort of frozen mix seafood pack?). I had a few bites of his, I didn't think it worth $14 for it. I think our conclusion is : this is a restaurant that it is okay to try it out if you happen to be in the neighborhood and do not have a better plan for any special restaurant, but will not want to go back as a special meal (like what we did today.)
