Headed here on a week night for a friendly conversation. It wasn't too busy, got some beer and pizza. A little bit pricey but I pay extra for good branding, a sense of character, and micro brews. The pizza (I got the "White" with jalapenos) was super garlicy. It wasn't bad, but it really was just bread garlic and cheese ($11? really?) and jalapenos ($1.50 extra? really?). It's Wicker Park. Giordano's has better pizza, but you come here for the atmosphere. Few things are better than pizza and beer on a school night.
