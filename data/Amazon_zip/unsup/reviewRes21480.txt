I'm not quote sure how it happened, but Superdawg has become my home away from home this summer. It's worth the long drive, especially because you can tote your 'dawg across the street and scarf it down in the pretty park/forest preserves. The last time I did that, a crazy lady came up and engaged us in highly entertaining conversation, telling me my shoes were "dorky", that she used to drink Old Style "but then I switched to Bud when I turned 30" and asking the guys if they'd consider marrying feminists. But I digress. The food is delicious and charming, the Supersodas are pheonmenal and bloat-causing, eating in your car is a fun novelty, and the place is just as cute as a bug. The last time I was there, a dude with a Ditka mustache angrily plopped his Superdawg box on the counter and said to no one in particular, "Five dahllers for a frickin' haht dahg!" Yes, it's 5 dollars for a frickin' hot dog, but it's a one-of-a-kind frickin' hot dog.
