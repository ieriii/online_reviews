Wishbone is a bright, homey space with excellent Southern-style comfort food and is my go-to brunch spot when I'm in Roscoe Village. I love this place equally for an intimate, romantic brunch and for girls' Sunday fun day. This place is always packed, whether you arrive at the height of brunch or the tail end of it, so you know everyone else is happy here, too. The wait is pretty reasonable, though. Wishbone has some of the best eggs benedict options in the city - put your hands together for the crab cake benedict and cheese grits! The mango mimosas make me smile, too. Not a loud, overly buzzed smile, but pure satisfaction. Can't wait for summer - this place has a great patio with wonderful foot traffic from Lincoln and School.
