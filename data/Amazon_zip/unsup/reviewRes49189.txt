I go to Bin 36 each time I come to Chicago for business. I've taken colleagues, clients and partners here for dinner and it never disappoints. The food is excellent, the wine choice extensive, and the best part is the massive cheese menu.  The one issue that keeps it from being 5 stars is that the service tends to be a bit slower and less attentive than I would like. It could be that they simply don't have enough staff on hand.
