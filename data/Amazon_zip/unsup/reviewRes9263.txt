I came in from a windy, wet snow to eat dinner at Le Colonial last night. The place was warm and inviting. After checking our sopping wet coats, we were promptly seated off in a cozy corner. The ambiance is nice, can be romantic with the right person, and the service is top notch. The prices seem fairly high, but it's a French menu with Vietnamese influence, what do you expect, right? That menu has some interesting twists on the usual plate. Who would think of filet mignon in sauce with yams? Hey, I liked it! The Snapper had mild chili flavor for Southeast Asia, but I rarely intend to go out just to fry my tongue. Altogether, the people that work there are what makes this place worth going back for. We weren't served as much as engaged in conversation with the waiter, who was really polite and nice and fairly clever with a sense of humor. The food quality is good, though I thought the Snapper was better prepared than the saucy filet / yam dish which was a little too runny for me, I'd have preferred thicker sauce preparation. But that's just me, It was plenty good in a strange way. Oh, and the drinks are fun to shop through. The cocktails are also interesting takes on the otherwise typical. Everything seems properly matched with French Vietnam, with a guava daiquiri - yay!
