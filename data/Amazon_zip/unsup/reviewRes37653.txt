A bunch of us came down from Evanston to celebrate a birthday here. I'd never been before and I liked the atmosphere and selection. It was crowded (as usual I hear) so we did get jostled a bit but we were still able to snag a couple of tables close to the bar. I liked my blonde leffe and actually finished the whole thing, which doesn't sound remarkable except that the glass was pretty big and I usually don't finish my drinks because I get really red, hot, and itchy (curse of the Asian flush, sadly). So, I'd have to say that the drinks are worth the visit! Also, I didn't know about the mussels (should have read Yelp first), but I thought the frites with aioli were addictive - so slim but full of flavor!
