I think this is my new favorite breakfast/brunch place. I've heard alot of good things about the Bongo Room and I was finally able to try it out this weekend. The wait wasn't too bad (30 minutes) but you're whole party has to be there when they call you or else they give you're table away. I loved that it was cute place with cheap prices. Most other places would charge upwards of $15 for similar entrees. I had the croissant sandwich which was just hte right amount of food. My friend had the vegetarian croissant sandwich and loved it- it looked relaly good with the avocado, sprouts, etc inside. My husband ordered the breakfast burrito and really enjoyed it too. They had so many things to choose from so I'll have to go back to try more. I really wanted to try the chocolate pancakes which looked amazing. The service was quick but almost a little too quick. Towards the end of our meal I kinda felt like they were rushing us out.  But then again maybe it was just the hungry glares I was getting from everyone standing by the bar.  I totally loved the Bongo Room and will definitely be taking more out-of-town guests there again soon.
