Not sure what's going on here, but this pizza is definitely not the best pan pizza in town. I only tried the pan, but I think it tastes similiar to Digourno's, and given our options in Chicago, I am just not into it.  The following Chicago Pies are more MY style: Pizano's (Pan) - good butter crust, great sauce Lou Malnati's (Pan) - Same Family as the Pizano crew, similar taste D'agostinos (Thin) - Sweet Sauce, GREAT THIN Gino's East (Stuffed) - I love the sausage patty - grew up getting this. Remember, you are not a bad person if you like this pizza. This is only my opinion and I stand firm. However, I do hope you agree with my picks above. Let me know what you think.
