I am at a place called the Greek Islands. I ordered chicken Rigamati. My dad went here with some of his work friends and said that the food was very good. The place is huge and the decor is unbelievable. My dad gave it a rating of 7.5. We just had our appetizer and it was very good. We had some octopus, and everyone loved it except me and my grandmother. We also had Saganaki, which is something I would certainly order again. In the next paragraph I will tell you how the chicken Riganati tasted. Keep in mind I'm ordering off of the kids menu, so if you are an adult, you might find the dishes I am ordering on the regular menu. Even for ordering off of the kid's menu, my dad says that the chicken Riganati should fuel any grown man. I would highly recommend ordering it. My brother ordered the lamb Rosa Marina. He loved it also. I would give this, a 1 being the worst, and 10 being the best, an 8.7.
