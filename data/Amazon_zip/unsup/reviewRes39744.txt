This is one of my favorite stops while visiting Chicago. My friends and I love this place. I'm married to a Korean and have eaten lots of it in Korea and here and this place is one of the best. I love the Prul style of cooking. They do it right with real charcoal...it's not right until you are inundated with a thick covering of smoke which permeates your body the next morning! The food is very authentic. I recommend the Dak Kalbi, Oh Jing Oh Bokum, Prul Gogi, and everything really. Seriously, I'm really picky about Korean food. This rivals what you would get in Korea. There are so many side dishes you don't have room to put your arms/hands on the table. It's always a great time, especially with Soju!
