I cannot say enough good things about Kinzie Chophouse. I work in the area and I really enjoy the atmosphere and the staff. The steaks are out of this world. The staff will bring a tray of meat by your table to show off their selection. I am a total foodie and this place is tops in my book! Right now they are doing a winter menu - 3 course dinner for $20.00 - AMAZING!! Check it out, you will love it! Cheers!
