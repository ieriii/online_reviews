Meh. My initial review is based on the Thai food, which simply doesn't hold a candle to the better options I enjoyed in D.C. when I lived there; I'll have to give the sushi a try and see how many stars that bumps Indie up, because their options on that side of the menu do look tasty. Keep in mind that I know a bit about Thai cookery, to the point that I get curry stocks brought to me by a friend who worked in Thailand for years. So, I'm a harsh judge, and if I expected good grub, what I got was barely adequate. I went for takeout, asking for "Thai spicy" up front, and ordered a trio of straightforward classics: spring rolls, tom yum, and basil chicken. The presentation of the spring roll was pretty (loose, untucked ends flying high, woohoo!), but the tamarind sauce was thick and flavorless, and the ingredients themselves not blessed with any particular snap. Pretty but bland is still bland; a proper spring roll has a certain crunchiness, and the tamarind a certain piquance; both qualities were entirely absent. Then I tried the tom yum, which was was very good--spicy, harboring a good pair of shrimp, and with that right amount of tangy lime-y flavor; this reassuring bit of yumminess left me hoping that perhaps the chicken would end this meal on a high note. Sadly, such was not the case. Remember, I asked for spicy, but what I got instead was merely oily, too-finely ground (and therefore that much more oily, not especially flavorful, and mixed in with overcooked and infrequent peppers, onions, and green beans, and with the most flavorless basil I think I've ever stomached. It wasn't the worst Thai dish I've ever tried in Chicago, but it wasn't far from it. So, basically, the tom yum is what gets this place something higher than the lowest possible review, and as I mentioned before, maybe the sushi's all that and the proverbial bag of chips. However, if this is the state of Thai in the Midwest, then leaving DC has given me at least one source of regret.
