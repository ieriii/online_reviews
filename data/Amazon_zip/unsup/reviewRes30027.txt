If i have 1 day left on earth, this will be my last meal! that's all i can say. With a group of 4,everything we ordered was perfect. Perfect appetizers, perfect main dishes and perfect dessert. Seriously, this place is just simply perfect (on the food side) HOWEVER, big minus point is that the front desk staffs were very unfriendly. We waited for 2 hours to get seated, which was understandable because i knew how the place was so famous. But that doesn't give them an excuse of being a huge b_tch to us! I wanted to order a bottle of champaign to surprise my bf and paid at the counter so it's not included in the table bill that he paid. I asked them to help me pick out which one i should get. I asked a guy " which is the sweetest? I like sweet champaign" He said "they are all sweet" well, okay..so i asked " My bf likes dry taste, which one would you recommend?" then he said " they're all dry" really?? so they are all sweet and dry?? they are all the same??? really?? so why would anyone spend 200$ on one bottle when they're all the same?? seriously i needed help there that's why i asked. I was so annoyed by his ignorance. The girls there weren't that nice either. I know there were many people but wasn't it us who bring the money to the restaurant?? smiles would be appreciated.. thats it.. all i can say is that the food is from heaven! it's the best food i ever ate. but front counter service stinks! ( waiters are fine though)
