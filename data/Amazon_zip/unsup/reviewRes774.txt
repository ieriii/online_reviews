HOLY CRAP. I freaking love Hot Doug's. To be honest when I saw Doug I didn't really think he was all that hot. That all changed after my first bite. Every Doug does instantly became sexy. Sexy, sexy, tubed meat. Yes I had to stand in line for quite some time but I knew this going in so it wasn't much of a bother, especially since Doug definitely delivered on the hype. The duck fat fries were good but I don't think I would have noticed them from regular fries if I didn't know any better. For the dogs I got the Frois Gras and Atomic Dogs. Easily the best two "hot dogs" I've ever had. AMAZING. So amazing in fact I almost didn't want to finish. I mean it was so tasty I simply didn't want the meal to end. Eventually it did end and my love affair with Hot Doug's began. I've only been once but I plan to go again and again, totally lived up to the hype for me!
