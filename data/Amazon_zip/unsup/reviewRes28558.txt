I've gone here quite a few times and enjoyed the heavy cream pastas - mostly in winter. Usually I have the pollo farfalle. Once in a while its undercooked, but usually its pretty good. Today I ordered from here via delivery. I had the B.V. pollo and ordered diet cokes. The pasta was great, but they delivered pepsi...not even diet pepsi. I may be a stickler - but for those of you like me, they didn't even tell me that they were going to substitute with Pepsi. But on top of it to send me non-diet. I called and they offered 2 free diet Pepsi on my next order. Ugggh. So...I ran out to the 7-11 to get some diet coke. In summary - I may go in to the restaurant again, but will never order delivery from them again. Edit: I was very happy to unexpectedly get a response from Justin - the manager - who was very understanding about some of the issues that I had and was committed to making it right. Honestly that made all the difference to me as someone who is a stickler for service. The food is great - I'll continue to enjoy the farfalle and the B.V. Pollo
