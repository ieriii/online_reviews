Me and a buddy of mine were hungover this Sunday evening and had a serious craving for some comfort Mexican food full of cheesy goodness. I suggested we try out Las Palmas but ruled it out do to the price. We didn't feel like paying over $20 per entree for hangover food. After driving all over town looking for a good Mexican joint we finally settled on Mayan Palace after driving by it. It looked welcoming and was next to one of my favorite Italian restos, Sappori Tratoria. I wasn't sure what to expect but both me and my friend left very impressed and will definitely go back again. The food was exaclt what we were looking for. The salsa was good, however the chips could have been better, i.e saltier. We ordered spinach quesadilla as an appetizer and the chimichangas for our entrees with a chili relleno as a side item and some queso dip for some comfort. The food was very good and hit the spot. It was perfect hangover food. Clean environment, nice decor for a Mom and Pop joint and extremely friendly staff/ Our waiter, Alex, was awesome! He was one of the best waiters I've had in along time. He treated us as if we were VIPs. When we left he asked us our names and said he would try to remember it when we return. How many waiters give you that kind of personalized attention these days?! Because he gave us such excellent customer service, we thought he might have been the owner but he wasn't. He said he just started working there within the past year. I will definitely be hitting this place often in the future. If you go ask for Alex as your server. Also, an FYI, they have half price margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Hope this helps.
