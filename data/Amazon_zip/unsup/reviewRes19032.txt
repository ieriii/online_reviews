Made an impromptu stop here this past weekend after hearing good things from a friend of my wife's. I knew I was in for something good when I saw each patron drinking a unique American craft or Belgian brew in matching glassware. A couple wonderful Racer 5 drafts for the wife and I. The sandwiches and custom-spiced fries were quite tasty and the burger being served to the guy next to me absolutely made me stare in admiration. This was one of those "damned" corners of North Center when I lived in the 'hood, but I think these folks are really making it work. Invest in some hinged windows for the "too cool for A/C, but too warm for ceiling fans" days and I'll be a fan for life!
