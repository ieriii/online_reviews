When I ever have a craving for hummus w/ pita and char-grilled rib-eye, I think of Noon O Kabab. The food here is outstanding. On the weekends, this place is packed and recommend going there early. There is no corking fee, if you bring your own alcoholic beverage. What I usually order there is Oxtail stew and 2 rib-eye skewers w/ dill rice.
