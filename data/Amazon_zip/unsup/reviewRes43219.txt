I'm a huge fan of this place for breakfast and brunch. It's become more popular, so don't be surprised to see a substantial wait on weekends. Over the course of about a year and a half, I've probably tried more than half of their menu and not found a bad item yet. General gestalt -- egg-based recipes are killer, as are the pastries. Brunch Highlights - Brioche French Toast -- Super fluffy & a bit rich; it's a slice of paradise Huevos Rancheros -- not up to New Mexico standards by itself, but a really fresh pico and a creamy, spicy sauce nicely top it off Breakfast Burrito - Again, not a southwest contender, but a fresh combo of beans and pico without ending up sloppy or greasy like most Chocolate Croissant -- yes, I could just eat this for breakfast; it rocks For pastries, you could literally close your eyes and pick anything. My favorite is their cranberry muffin, which is moist without being too buttery. Lastly, gotta get the coffee. They have their own Intelligentsia blend and unlimited mug refills -- so good you'll pee yourself in no time. Service -- When it's really crowded, the staff can get a bit pushy about managing the line. It's a hipster neighborhood. Don't expect fireworks for enthusiasm, but they aren't jerks.
