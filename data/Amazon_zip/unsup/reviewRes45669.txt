I really wanted to love Wilde. It's pretty, it's close to my job, etc. But I have been there several times now and every time I leave disappointed. Today we ordered carry out and when we got it back to work it was missing the side sauces we had asked for as well as the coleslaw. I don't like cole slaw so I didn't really miss it, but damn it, it should have been there.  We had a burger and a chicken sandwich. They both tasted the same-bland bland bland. When you can barely taste the difference between beef and poultry you are in trouble. Other visits were hit or miss. I like the little cod brittles appetizer, but the fish and chips entree isn't very good. The Reuben is tasty at first but gets boring fast. The Irish BLT is so salty that I spent the rest of my day chugging water to make up for eating it.  I think this place has great decor, a fabulous location but until they learn how to season their food they are going to be off my list.
