What can be said about Hot Doug's that has not already been said before? Drove by around 1:30 pm on a recent rainy Thursday and was pleased to see there was virtually no line, so decided to stop in. Ordered the foie gras and Sauternes duck sausage with truffle aioli, as is apparently customary in this establishment. And while I had read from other yelpers that this in itself could suffice as a meal, I wanted to try other flavors as well given I am not sure when my return trip might be. Plus I saw some people (of normal proportions physically) tucking into 3 sausages, so seemed to be the norm here. Initially planned on ordering a bratwurst, thinking it might perhaps offset the richness of flavor of the first sausage, however as I approached Doug to order, I sort of felt as if this was a cop out in a place where you could order any other number of flavor combinations. So also went with the rosemary and garlic smoked chicken sausage, and coupled the sausages with an order of cheese fries for good measure. Grabbed my drink, took a seat by window, and my order came out promptly. Overall the sausages were definitely like nothing I had ever had before, however in hindsight I think that choosing these 2 sausages was a bit of a mistake. Altogether way too rich and in a sense was overkill; left feeling stuffed and like I had exhausted my taste buds as opposed to contented and pleased with my meal. It is hard to argue with the success of this place, however I am not sure if you will ever catch me braving an hour+ line in order to eat their sausages..
