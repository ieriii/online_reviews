I agree with Jasmine M. Thanks to Rick Bayless cooking show, the expectations for fresh, authentic Mexican food are pretty high. When we went, we were struck with a sense of "ho hum" -- and not for cheap, either! The best thing we had was a 50-year-old tequila. P.S., when it's busy they may try to shove you into the basement seating area. Don't do it. It feels like abuela's basement rec room. Stay up top to see and be seen.
