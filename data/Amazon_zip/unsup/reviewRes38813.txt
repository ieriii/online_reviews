This is a great place for beer lovers (or explorers) with a huge list to choose from. When I went, the crowd was young professionals and male-heavy. It feels cozy because of the wooden decor and dimmed lights. There are 2 floors but it is not easy to find seating, especially if you're a large party. Location is probably the biggest barrier for a lot of us in the winter, but I'm excited to revisit in the summer when the commute is nicer
