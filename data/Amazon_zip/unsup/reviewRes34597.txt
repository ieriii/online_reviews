I like this place, I don't think the food is the BEST Middle Eastern I've ever had (even at a little corner kinda place like Sultan's is, try the North Kedzie Area (4200 - 4800 North) for really good Middle Eastern Food), but in Wicker Park/Bucktown, there's no other little place like it, the food is fresh, prices is good, and the people (hipsters, dipsters, etc.) watching is worth it. My fave is the well-stocked and very clean salad bar and the pita sandwiches...
