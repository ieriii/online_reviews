I'm not vegetarian, but I think this place kicks butt. I have eaten here over 10 times (my boss is vegan) for both carry-out and dine in and I can honestly say that I've always liked the food here. Although it is entirely meat free, you can get either soy or dairy cheese. The wait can be long, this place is usually pretty hoppin'... during the weekends especially. There IS parking on the street, or in an alley right next to the diner. Do NOT park in he 7-11, they will put a boot on your car. The staff is sometimes flighty and not always the most attentive, but do a good job. Would recommend the... Santa Fe Salad Chips and Guacamole Potstickers Sweet Potato Fries (my favorite thing here) Hot Chocolate
