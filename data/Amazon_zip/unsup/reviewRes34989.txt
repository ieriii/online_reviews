My friend and I dined here last night. We both had the 2.5 lb broiled lobster with drawn butter. WOW! Better than I can make it at home :). The steamed manilla clams with white wine were a great appetizer to start out with. We did not partake in wine, because we had quite an agenda after dinner, but they seemed to have a nice selection. The next time I come back, I would really like to try a glass of their Casteel Reserve.
