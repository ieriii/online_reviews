The Good: Cocktails, clearly. That's what this place is all about and it doesn't disappoint. High quality alcohol and what appear to be thoughtful and talented people behind the bar putting it all together. If this is where the review ended, 4 or 5 stars, no doubt. The Bad: When you project an image of exclusivity in your club, and charge the prices they do, you expect exceptional service. Unfortunately this was not the case. The bouncer was rude and it look a long time to order a drink, get a drink and get the check. Every step of the way there was an uncomfortable time gap. Now it's possible someone had called in or quit so I hate to jump to conclusions but it did negatively affect our experience.  Bottom line: Didn't have the best experience service wise, you may have better. Worth at least an attempt for the cocktails alone.
