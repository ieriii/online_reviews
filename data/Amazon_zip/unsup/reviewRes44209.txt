I decided to boycott this place forever when they told me that they wanted to charge $25 for a cake tasting for my wedding and then when I asked what happens to my $25 if I don't pick them I got "Well, we're very sure you'll pick us, but if you don't, thank you for your $25 donation." F. U. Anyhow, since that was over a year ago, I decided to walk in and let their bakery goodness overshadow their cake confidence. I'm happy to say that I'm glad I went in. I had a hazelnut and chocolate cupcake and Oh Mm Gee was it fantastic. Husbo had the tiramisu...Crazy freaking good.  Do I still hold a grudge against alliance? Of course. I'm not very forgiving, however, another bite of one of their scrumdidilyumptious cupcakes helps my grudge slowly dissipate.
