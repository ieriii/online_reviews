I'm writing this review for basically just one dish that I keep ordering through GrubHub. I have never been to the Bistro in person. I'm one of those people who pick one dish and stick to it. I ordered their Veal Paprikash and it was sooooooooo delish. If you order delivery, they always send some bread too, which goes so well with the meat. I always feel bad and guilty about eating veal, but it's just so tasty. The meat is perfectly cooked. You don't even need a knife. The Polenta is very tasty, and the dash of sour cream adds to the richness of the tomato-y sauce. I definitely recommend it.
