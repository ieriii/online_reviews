We went there a few months ago with a groupon. It was just okay. The oily smell was pretty aggressive. In there defense however, I think it may be because of the 'basement' like layout with minimal free air space. I thought the portion sizes would give you more for your money. I personally liked melting pot better. The server was really nice. I wouldn't suggest against going there, but it was just not the best experience for me.
