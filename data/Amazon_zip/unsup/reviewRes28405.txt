A Mexican friend of mine loves this place and took me here. Late Sunday evening, I drove past the restaurant and had to turn around, traveled through the alley behind the place. I had three huge rats playing in my headlights as I drove past. Once parked at a pay meter, got inside. Rather dark and cramped. Menu was interesting, ordered the steak tacos, my friend got a huge bowl of beef soup that had nuclear grown sized carrots in it. All in all, good food, very reasonably priced, but service was spotty, not the cleanest establishment I've ever been in.
