I consider myself a well traveled individual. Since i have to China and Japan, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I was mildly disappointed when the host didn't greet me right away. He was on the phone, looked at me and kept talking. I stood awkwardly waiting for a good 3 minutes. Finally an asian girl who may have been a manager walked to the host stand and didn't smile or greet me either. She looked very serious and like she was in her own world. Strike 2. When I was finally sat at the sushi bar, I opened the menu and started deciphering the menu one section at a time. I was recommended the oxtail pot stickers and duck hash salad for my starters. I loved both dishes. I also enjoyed the truffled tuna tataki (sp), I love anything with truffle oil. As I waited for my food, I enjoyed watching the liveliness of the environment. However, the only thing that kept ruining this energy was that same manager lady. She stomped around with a serious face and just didn't seem like she enjoyed her job. She should try working in a place that doesn't require face to face interactions with guests. 2 thumbs up on food and service, get rid of the street walker looking manager. IMO
