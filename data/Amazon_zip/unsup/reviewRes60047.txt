Las Tablas is an amazing restaurant with an amazing staff. Went there last night for my sisters birthday party.Our waiter advised us not to get appetizers if we were getting the combo because of the size, and then when we tipped him above the auto 18% because he was AMAZING, he reminded us that gratuitiy is included. Great staff that really wants to meet the needs of the clients, rather than gouge us w every dish. Our waiter (i didn't catch his name unfortunately) was very attentive, friendly, and funny.Three of us shared the Large Combinationa which was fantastic. All of the meats were cooked perfectly--tender and delicious. Another guest had the Paella and raved about it! Overall amazing experience.
