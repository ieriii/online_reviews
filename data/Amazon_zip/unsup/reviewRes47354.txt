Expect good burgers and nothing else. We went on a Tues. when burgers were half off , which I wasn't aware of since it's my first time here. We were a group of five and had to wait AT LEAST an hour to get seated. Although many tables opened up, and many smaller groups who got there way after us left before us, the host/waiters were not smart enough to put two tables together! At some point throughout our hour wait, I stepped outside for a couple minutes, when I tried coming back in the host told me I had to wait outside because it was too packed inside. Why on Earth would you make me wait outside when my group is inside? So rude. However he did let another couple in before me because he had once again an open table for two. After repeatedly telling him to let me in, where my group was already at, where I had JUST BEEN AT two minutes ago, he finally let me in. (Wow..) So then we finally get a table and the waitress comes to get our order right away. We weren't ready because who would have known but reading a menu in pure darkness is VERY HARD. Anyhow she leaves and doesn't come back for another 15-20 min. We order and finally get our food, which was pretty fast relatively to the rest of our experience. However, it was a little uncomfortable once again eating in a pitch black room. Anyhow, the place is super loud (bad music) but the waiter, waitress and bus boy kept checking up on us, which was nice. Will go back again for the burgers, but maybe only in a group of 2, and probably in the summer so I don't have to be in the darkness/ avoid the terrible music.
