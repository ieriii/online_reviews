I have a clear view of Fox and Obel from my bedroom window. This is bad. This is bad because Fox and Obel has some of the best food you can buy in downtown Chicago. Being as it's the best, as I mentioned, it is also expensive by your typical grocery store standards. The differences, however, between F&O and your typical grocery store are many, indeed. Thus, whenever I stare out my bedroom window at the beauty of Streeterville, The Loop and Lake Michigan, there's F&O - beckoning me down to the street, to walk the paltry two blocks for its incredible meats and cheeses, its wines and high-end liquor, its fresh baked breads... the list goes on. One could easily empty one's bank account - and add inches to one's waist - if one were to give in to the calling of F&O on a daily basis. In short, this place is GOOD. I have to offer one caveat, however. F&O has incredible food and drink, to be sure. Food and drink that is pricey because it is made well. Food made without unnecessary preservatives or impregnations or (blech) corn syrup or disgusting treatment of animals. Food made by human hands in France or India or Russia or right here in Illinois. Food that you can't get in a "regular" grocery store. F&O also has a number of items that you CAN get in a "regular" grocery store. Same brand, same product, same flavor... twice the price. With this in mind, the savvy shopper must understand that there are some items at F&O that you can walk across the street to Dominick's and buy for half the price (or, if you're feeling particularly cost conscious, you can cab/drive/bus it to Target on State and buy for a third the price). You can also suck it up and support your local market. Your call. All things considered though, Fox and Obel is a Five Star outfit, and thusly deserves five stars. You want the best? You've got the best - at Illinois and McClurg in Streeterville.
