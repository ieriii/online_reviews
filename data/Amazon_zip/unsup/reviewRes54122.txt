My boyfriend and I stopped in here for an early dinner (or a late lunch for us) for his birthday. I've been curious about this restaurant for a while now and I couldn't afford Frontera Grill or Topolobampo, so Xoco was perfect. We had probably a 5 minute wait, so I guess we were really lucky. I had the Choriqueso( Homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan Jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. $9.00)was delicious! The verde salsa it came with was amazing. My boyfriend had the Cubana (Smoked Gunthorp pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack, chipotle mustard. $11.50) and he really enjoyed it. To drink, I had the Agua de Jamaica and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend it if you like sweet fruit teas. For dessert, we had a piece of the Choco-Flan and a Churro...Both were to die for.  For the two of us, the bill was about 35. Not bad at all for an excellent dinner for two in Chicago.The only thing I didn't like was that you had to ask for a take-out bag. At first I expected them to ask if we wanted to take the rest of our meal home, but after a while, I saw the people next to us go up to the cashier and ask for one so we did the same. Another thing that I didn't like was the seating. Most of the seating has you facing a wall. That made me feel odd, but the food definitely made up for that!This was our first time to Xoco and we both were extremely impressed. Also, we were able to see Rick Bayless! I didn't want to sound like a fangirl, but my bf and I did say that we enjoyed the food and he said thank you. It was a unique experience and I loved the fact that we were able to see him.
