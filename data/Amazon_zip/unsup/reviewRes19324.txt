I was going to give them five stars, and then I realized that I waited in line for 50 minutes. Granted, I was with a good group of people, people that I can actually spend 50 minutes (and then another hour eating) without awkward silences, but I'm hard pressed for many occasions in my life that I would willingly spend 50 minutes waiting. Maybe for my wedding. Or that international flight. But not for tortas. Granted, when I sat down finally with my glass of water and a warm, crusty chicken tinga torta, it seemed all to be worth it. The torta had the perfect amount of kick in it, and the chicken was tender. The pickled onions and the avocado provided a great balance of gooey and crispy. Totally worth it. We finished the meal with churros and Aztec hot chocolate. The dipping chocolate definitely got passed around, as it was too rich for just one person. Great experience; great service. Hey Rick Bayless -- wanna open up a restaurant in O'Hare? Oh wait...
