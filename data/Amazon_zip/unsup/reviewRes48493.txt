Poor lil piglet, Ive never tasted a piece of fat sooooooo delish!!!! This was a really tasty treat, that I cant even begin to describe. You almost have to live the moment to understand where im coming from but trust me you will understand.  Obviously this place isnt made for your healthy veg summer diet. I had to make the sacrifice coming here knowing that my fav piece of meat is one of their delicasies, even though I try to eat it as least as possible.  At the sametime, I'll make this as easy as possible and give my best recommendations: The best - Porchetta - Basically a fat filet, but seriously the best piece of fat Ive ever had the hints of rosemary and roasted apples accented this perfectly! It seriously just melts in your mouth, but smacks your pallette w/ flavor.  Must get - Dover Sole/Hamachi/Lake perch/Potato Salad/Spicy pork grinds Should try - Pickles/Farm Chicken/Oysters Wasnt impressed - Country ribs All in all this was a fabulous place the family style portions are decent, the wait staff is great, nice hip place, this was a winner! Hands down!! Enjoy this feast this isnt a normal ethnic restaurant you are coming to!!! Love me some Oink Oink here!!
