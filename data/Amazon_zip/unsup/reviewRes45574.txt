edit: I said before there were good specials on the weekends. This is wrong, there are only specials period on Thursdays. Minus one star =p My favorite bar in my area so far. it's huge, the interior decor is SOOO SWEET (seriously, just grab a cold one or a something something on the rocks and sit in one of those huge leather chairs by the bookcases, you feel like the man). Haven't tried the food, but from the menu it looks like they serve Amy's sausages for brunch... and those are my fav. I last went there with some friends on a Thursday night, and we had great, friendly service. It was kind of empty though.
