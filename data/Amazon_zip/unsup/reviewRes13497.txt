Nice pub to drink and/or have a drink at. The place itself is pretty big with plenty of seating....but it does get packed because of it's popularity. I recommend getting there a little early if you want to get a table or have dinner. Only 1 bar, but it's huge and sits in the middle of the place. The bartenders are very nice and helpful, whics is good if you're not sure about some of their micro-brewed beverages. Food was really good also....I recommend the burgers or the crispy porkbelly with egg sandwich...yummo!!! They also have some great tasting appetizers that could serve as small plates....bacon fat popcorn and porkbelly with watermelon are must haves.  The breakdown: nice place but can get crowded and possible long wait for table, service is good(better service from the bartenders than the wait staff), and the food is awesome if you're looking for pub grub.
