No one can question the beauty of this location, but when trying to get some sleep for the 1 night of vacation that I had, I was woken twice by the noisy drunks in the hall. No, Palmer House is not responsible for their behavior, but they are responsible for the entirely non-soundproof doors!  Beds were lovely, tv was very nice, etc, but there were a couple things that were broken in the bathroom.
