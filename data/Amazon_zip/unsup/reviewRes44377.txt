Alliance Bakery was the first stop on this weekends cupcake crawl. This place got some nice feedback on my recent talk thread so It was a must-see on the list. I'd like to make the point that this is a review of the cupcake we chose, and not of the entire bakery, but any bakery that makes BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES already has some serious street cred with me. I'll admit, I was totally distracted by the black and white cookies when I walked in. Hey, I was hung over. What do you expect? But I eventually got back to the quest. So, Ms. Ellen, her lovely boyfriend and I split a red velvet cupcake. Ms. Ellen did not like the cupcake (you can read her review below), her lovely boyfriend was "a big fan" and as he has never had a cupcake before (he's British) he admitted he really had nothing to compare it to. I really liked the choice. This was not a cutesy cupcake by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, it did not look much like a cupcake at all, it was just a small, round cake. The cake was dense and moist, not too sweet. The frosting had that perfect touch of savory and didn't stick around in your mouth. It wasn't the prettiest cupcake but for the $2 price, was well worth it. I think it makes a good statement about the quality of the bakery. I'll definitely be back for a dozen of something, a cake, or just a treat for passing the time away next door. And I loved that damn clock.
