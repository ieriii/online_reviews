Giordano's is all about the cheese. Sure, you may think you're ordering a deep-dish pepperoni pizza, but really what you're ordering is a metric ton of melted goodness with some bread and meat thrown in for good measure. It's not my favorite Chicago deep-dish, but it's still pretty damn good. Unfortunately, the reheat quotient is quite low. Best to order small and eat it all in the restaurant. Oh, and unless you regularly eat enough food to feed a small country, you should ignore the "serves 1-2 people" notice for the small deep-dish and split it with three (or even four) people.
