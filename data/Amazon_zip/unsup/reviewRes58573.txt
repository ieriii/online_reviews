Very disappointed. Not much better than an all you can eat buffet. We were there late and the meats were dry. We felt rushed by the meat servers who were obviously trying to service us so they could finish their shift. We got up to the salad bar and came back to find a dirty wine glass at our table that had soiled the tablecloth. We got a half hearted do you want another table. Very bad experience.
