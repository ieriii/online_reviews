Vegan Shakes = 5 Stars, everything else was just bonus :-D But seriously, Sweet Potato Fries - everyone's got'em. Some are better than others, and these run with the BEST. Crispy and not too sweet. BBQ "Burger" - BBQ Sauce was PRIME. Tangy and delicious I couldnt get enough. Vegan cheese... okay, i hate Daiya cheese, but these folks made me appreciate it (a little) - not too much, just enough for a little cheezy texture. Patty was excellent. I like it when you can see that it has veggies in it rather than being so processed and pureed that it could be that thing that McDonalds passes off as beef for all anyone knows. Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Shake - friggin amazing. just... WOW. Get one, and then thank me. Def coming here every visit to Chicago... I want to eat all of my meals here this visit!
