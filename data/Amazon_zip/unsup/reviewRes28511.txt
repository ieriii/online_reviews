This is a hard one.. 5 years ago the pizza was mainly cheese/My Fav Pizza, now its mainly DOUGH with a little topping of cheese? I know the price of cheese has gone through the roof but come on!! It's still good just not what it used to be.. also a tad on the pricey side. Delivery however is ALWAYS Piping Hot.. Sorry!!
