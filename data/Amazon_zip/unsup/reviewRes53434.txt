Best restaurant in Chicago by far! From the moment you walk in it is a beautiful journey. I was nervous because I just dined at Moto, and it was poor at best.The inside of the restaurant is breath-taking. The service and food is impeccable. The servers were not in my face, but if i needed something they were right there to help. There were different homemade breads with every course just getting better and better. Moto needs to take notes on how to cook and execute! I opted for the 22 course because my husband insisted, but I was so enthralled that we did. It lasted about 4+ hours, but went by so fast. I have only heard about the hot potato cold potato- and i still am thinking about it! I asked the server if the chef could sign my menu, and he DID!! Truly, a memorable experience i will never forget!
