I have to say I have mixed reviews on this place. I come here every now and then only because I have to. I guess their Butcher and Bakery section should have notable mentions. All my clients want their meats from here. I don't know squat about meat but desserts I do know about. Yeah their cakes are yummy! They do have some unique items I must admit. Their deli section can lack flavour and their cheese selections aren't that great. If you do want something unique guaranteed they can get it for you. They have a coffee bar which is nice and their Sommelier can help you in such a way, you can end up spending your whole paycheck. Tempting... That's how I will some it up. If you have lotsa moola to spend then go here. I'm not a big fan, but I always leave there with something in my basket.
