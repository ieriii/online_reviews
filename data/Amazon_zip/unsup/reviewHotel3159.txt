I'm a fan of The W chain, and this property surely doesn't disappoint. It's a stone's throw from the Navy Pier. However, the driveway is a mess. It's really small, and two cars makes it so crowded. There's really only room for cars to go in one direction, but since there are entrances/exits at both ends, vehicles end up playing chicken. Whoever planned the driveway was probably smoking crack. Good thing I wasn't driving. I just felt sorry for our cab drivers.
