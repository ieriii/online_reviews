Hands down best Chinese I've ever had.  I had a guest from China visiting and wanted some Hot Pot. She had actually been here before and suggested it. I wanted all vegetables which is not on the menu but they put together a gorgeous plate for us. It came with a split bowl for cooking. One spicy and the other was just soup stock. Three sauces of which Di instructed me to add a spoon of each to my bowl. It is all you can eat but by the time we finished the gigantic plate they brought us I couldn't even think about eating more. That was a week ago. I've been back since for a plate of Baicai which was quite good and now I'm going back today for the Hunan Vegetables. It can be a little pricey for Chinese but so worth it. If you go at dinner time, 7 PM be prepared to wait in line. It's very busy.
