I only come here for the lunch buffet, because of the delicious choices and variety. Tandoori chicken comes with every meal, succulent and moist. Always an excellent variety of curries, biryanis, etc. and the tables are filled with mostly non-natives. The naan is always hot and fluffy. Save room for the mango ice cream at the end. Parking is a hassle (no validated parking for lunch a the lot on the corner!) Be prepared to strap on the feed bag to get your money's worth, I think the lunch buffet price has climbed to $16.95, but worth it if you come hungry. Nice decor, linen tablecloths and napkins, and the buffet never runs dry of anything. Can't say anything about the service though.
