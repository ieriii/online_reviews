I had ordered catering from here for my wedding anniversary. The owner had took my order over the phone. This man was so sweet and helpful towards me. The food had came on time and it was still fresh and hot. He had also gave us an extra half tray of tiny little egg rolls. How nice of him. It was crunchy and so good. What I loved most was that everything was in such a good portion but the price range didn't dig deep into my pockets. If I could I would give this place more than 5 stars. I would really love to stop by after I have my baby. I will definitely visit the restaurant in the near future.
