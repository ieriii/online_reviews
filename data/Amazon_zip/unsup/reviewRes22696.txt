This is totally, completely, and utterly embarrassing. I haven't been to Costa Rica, and wasn't entirely positive what costa rican food was... I know, I know, what a dumb blonde comment. And I live 2 blocks walking distance away... sigh. ANYWAY, now that I have been there once, i have been back 3 times :)  The food is awesome! I got the veggie burrito and spinach cheese empanada - perfectly crisped tortilla stuffed with lettuce, rice, tomato, hot peppers, avocado, beans, sour cream, and I added spinach and zucchini (worth the extra $1). It is super filling and healthy feeling all at the same time. Have enough people mentioned this... it is BYOB! And the food is extremely authentic and affordable. I really can't say enough good things about it. And for the spring/summer... outdoor seating! SCORE!! Cash only, but when one whole meal is under $9, you can probably handle it. LEGIT awesome. Back to try the oatmeal shake tomorrow!!
