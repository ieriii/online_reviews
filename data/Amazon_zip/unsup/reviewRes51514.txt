This place can be kind of hit or miss. I've had some really good food here, and some food that's not so special. I agree with some of the other reviews- some days the food just isn't seasoned or spiced or everything niced properly.  Service and value are also totally average. The atmosphere of the place is also unremarkable. I used to frequent it when I lived in the neighborhood but have since moved on to greener pastures.
