The ceviche? Very limey-- but if you like it that way, it's delicious. The skirt steak? Quite delicious. The spicy squid with dirty rice? Sounds gross, but is also delicious. The oatmeal milk shake? Oh. my. gosh. Freakin' delicious (and it comes in a soy variety!). So yeah. I think you get my drift. Yes, this place definitely sounds overrated, but I've been here twice now and both times have been pretty darn good. It's a small place and it may involve a considerable wait, but I think it's worth it. Oh yeah-- it's also BYOB, which is great for a cold Chicago night when you need to warm up right away. And it's family-owned which I always consider a plus. Note: The one annoying thing is that they only take cash-- which I fail to remember until I'm already on my way-- so I've had to stop by a bank that charges a $2.50 ATM fee (or use the in-house ATM). Argh.
