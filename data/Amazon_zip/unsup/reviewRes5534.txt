First of all, THANK YOU yelpers for the stellar reviews of the Purple Pig which led us there when we were home in Chi-town for the holidays. My husband & I had a phenomenal experience overall - the food is amazing, great beers & wines, fun atmosphere and awesome staff. We sat at the bar, which I'd totally recommend for a two-some. We could watch all the action happening with the cooks behind the bar & the attention from the bartender and other staff led to some great recommendations for items I usually wouldn't have chosen, but were SO glad we tried! Favorites: pig's ear (a MUST) and the pork neck rillette. The staff also had some great cheese and cured meat suggestions not on the menu, they have great recommendations for beer/wine as well. HIGHLY recommend this spot, can't wait to go back!
