I'm always leery of the yelp uncertainty principle - the knowledge that I'm going to write a yelp review of a place changing my experience of it. So I sat in quiet contemplation for a few days before I wrote this review, making sure that I wasn't subconsciously lashing out at the Publican's slew of good ratings. Nope, OK, I'm not. I don't need to tell you why this place should be five stars - I'm not the first on here to put capitals and excessive punctuation around PORK! and BEER!, and they are well-deserved. But holy cats, did I have some bad service here last weekend. If I hadn't known my dinner companion well (and that he will put up with pretty much anything for tasty pork/cheese/beer), I might have thought that he slipped the waitress a hundo to rush us out of there. Among the issues: (1) I sat without a drink for the majority of our first two courses; (2) We only HAD two courses because she never came back after the second, except 20 minutes later with the check in hand (!!) (3) I asked for the wine menu back to check out the cordials - because she TOOK the menus after course 2 was ordered - and she never came back to ask me if we had decided what we'd like. On the plus side, the Publican is straight-up cheap when you don't get to order anything. I'd say we spent (and ate, and drank) a third of what we were intending to. The Publican is way too good of a place to have waitresses who completely lose their professionalism on busy or understaffed nights. I've been there once before and know for a fact some of the service staff is top notch, so I've got my fingers crossed that this was an aberration. But I'm not going to be back to find out any time too soon.
