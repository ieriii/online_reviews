After feasting on some uber yummy oysters at Shaw's last night, I decided it's time for a review. I've been here at least 4 times in the 3 years I've lived in Chicago (thanks to my parents who fit the bill) and I have to say this place rocks! I can't give this place 5 stars b/c the portions aren't very big considering how expensive the place is plus side dishes are an extra expense. Other than that, I love that they've partnered with Shedd to inform patrons of environmentally friendly options. I love that their menu changes daily (though I was slightly disappointed they didn't have swordfish last night, bummer), I love how knowledgeable their staff is, and I especially love how quickly they deliver food to my mouth.  I heart Shaw's and will definitely be back the next time the parentals are in town to pay for it!
