first of all i would like to say i was referred to brazzaz by a good friend Shelly who also works as a waitress at Brazzaz. at first i was skeptical since i have been to many Brazilian steak houses over the years and only one delivered. from the time me and my brother who is visiting from Houston; walked in to the restaurant the staff was extremely friendly and hospitable. we were seated promptly and always had somebody at our table at our service. we started with the salad bar which at many places has been a disappointment. however the variety and freshness of Brazzaz was overwhelming. it was hard to limit the salad bar to one visit, but we managed. from what i remember the assortments of sushi, ahi tuna, many different types of salads ( green bean salad, my favourite), fresh oysters, many assortments of bread and cheeses were all delicious. we just wanted to fill up on the salad bar alone. after our outstanding salad bar experience was coming to an end our plates were replaced, immediately, with fresh ones and not more than 45 seconds had passed, when the entourage of meat starting rolling in. the servers announced the meat and served with enthusiasm. before i could even finish what i had on my plate another server was at my table with some more. A carnivores delight. meats ranging from fillet Mignon, top sirloin. ribs, chicken, and pork. Every single piece was marinated to perfection and tasted absolutely perfect by it self. no need for steak sauce. drinks were refreshed right on time with not much of a wait. after we were done, we were offered dessert, however, we were so full it was hard to imagine stuffing anything else into our belly's. All in all one of the best Brazilian steak houses i have been to in over four years and i cant wait to go back tonight.
