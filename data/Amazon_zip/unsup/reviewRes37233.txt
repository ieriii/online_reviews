I'm a bit obsessed with mussels. It's the only reason I went to Hopleaf. Mussels and fries are a match made in heaven. I've been twice now and both times I had the same thing: mussels and steak frites. They have mussels for two which makes it a lot cheaper to eat here. The belgian style mussels are really good. The broth is the perfect combo of butter, cream and booze. You get a good bit of them in a pot they sit on your table. The second time I went I got the wine and pork broth mussels and didn't enjoy them nearly as much. Maybe I only like my mussels cooked one way. The steak frites is bigger than any I've ever had. It's a mountain of fries topped with a huge ribeye steak. I'm not sure how they think it's a serving for one person. The herb butter is the best thing on the plate. It makes everything taste better. Sadly, I can't comment on the beer or any other kind of food. I will try something different the next time I go.
