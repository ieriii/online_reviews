When you walk into Sultan's Market you may be a little confused. There is a salad bar, assorted goodies on shelves and a counter to order food. Just say yes and eat it all because it is all great. I was in Sultan's a few weeks ago and had the Chicken Shawerma dinner spicy which was huge and tasty. I also got a small side of the hummus which lasted me a few days. It was unbelievable. Sultan's Market is a great place for good valued mediterranean food!
