I have really grown to like carnivale. I have never ordered anything that wasn't prepared really well! All the meat melts in your mouth and the food has some pretty good flavor... perhaps not AS bold as a lot of authentic similar quisine I have tried, but a good variety and always fresh. I also think the wait staff is very helpful. They ususally have lots of suggestions for you, and thus far, have been write on point with wine reccomendations. My first time there, the noise level turned me off a bit (the room is just completely open with high ceilings that noise is bouncing off left and right), but it was really the only thing I didn't like at first. Last night, I actually went with a goup of 5 other girls, so I was a little thankful we were in a noisy place... that way our table wasn't as noticable... definately worth a try, but if you are ordering meat dishes or lots of little extras (wine, cocktails, desserts, appetizers, etc...) be ready to buck up.
