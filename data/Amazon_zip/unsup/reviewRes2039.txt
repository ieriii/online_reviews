I know that I'm like the 100,000th to review this place...but it is just AWESOME FOOD. The phrase 'encased meats' takes on a whole new meaning after Hot Doug's. Too bad the fois gras dogs are now gone (was actually in the footage when Nightline did the story on that) but the food is fantastic. The line can suck...but if you go on a week day when it's not perfect weather, the line is quick...but, sadly, no duck fat fries. If you are a veggie...there are options. Remember CASH ONLY!!! And Doug is just exceptionally a cool guy!
