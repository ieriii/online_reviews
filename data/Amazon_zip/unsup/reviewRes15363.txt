I grew up around this place! I used to have my birthday parties here when I was younger too! They remodeled it probably within the past decade and their business boomed!! Luis, the waiter is still there. I highly recommend him! He has been our waiter when go there for at least the past 15 years! When we sit down, he already knows what drink to bring my parents!!! This is a great family restaurant and the food is so delicious and fresh! Their pizza is pretty good too. Pretty much anything you eat here is good! Their pizza bread is one of my favs too.  I get so excited when we have family get togethers and I know we are going to Calo's!!  Enjoy!!!
