They managed to live up to the ridiculous hype surrounding the restaurant, so that' saying something. It was actually as good as I'd heard. Service was fantastic, and the food was completely on another level. The sweetbreads were unreal. If you're ready to pay $200-$300 pp at the minimum, then this is the best dining experience in the city.
