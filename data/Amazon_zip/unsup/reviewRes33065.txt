Yolk is a reliable neighborhood staple for a very reasonably priced breakfast or lunch in the South Loop. I have been here several times and have always enjoyed both the food and service. Coming here on a weekday verses Saturday or Sunday brunch is much better, as you will find a relaxing, quiet atmosphere rather than the typical pandemonium of people vying for a table. My favorite thing to order is the Belgium waffles with pecans. I always request them with strawberries, instead of bananas, and they are more than happy to substitute. They are cooked to a golden brown, generously filled with pecans and served with a side of caramel sauce. The combination of waffel and caramel is to die for! I've also tried and enjoyed their multi-grain batter pancakes, with either blueberries or cranberries and walnuts stuffed inside. Two people can eat at Yolk for around 25$, which is a steal. It has a sunny, friendly atmosphere, and you are sure to walk away feeling satisfied. Yolk gets 3 stars because their menu is very predictable, I would love to see some more gourmet ingredients or unusual twists on the menu, but as a comfort-food place, its a true staple.
