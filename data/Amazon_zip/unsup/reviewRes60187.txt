Whole chicken dinner (with two sides, 1 - garlic rice with black beans and bacon, 2 - corn) was about 13 bucks. I added a small order of the Bocci Balls (wellington meatballs that are breaded, along with marinara sauce) because they are DELICIOUS and two coxinhas, which is a ball of pulled chicken fried up in a cornmeal breading. 22 bucks, dinner for two, excellent.
