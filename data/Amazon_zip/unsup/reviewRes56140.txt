The food was tasty but the portions were not worth the price at all.The server did not return change even though it was obviously more than double (almost triple) what an expected tip would be..and then was almost impossible to flag down.When we left, I noticed they were moving to clear our table immediately. Not surprising given that there was only two or three other tables in there, but when I returned the next day to retrieve sunglasses I had left on the table I was told no one had found them even though they were right on the table and they were clearing before we were through the door.While portion size is not enough to merit such a poor review, that combined with the shady staff behavior means I will not be returning.
