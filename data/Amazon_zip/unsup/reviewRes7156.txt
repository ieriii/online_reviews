Definitely will return here. Went in December for my boyfriend's birthday. We had great waitstaff that was very accommodating to my *ridiculous* allergies. I love the feel of the place, which is both fancy and relaxed. We even got a tour of the upstairs and the smokers after dinner. On to the food. Be careful with your appetite, because they give you complimentary bowls of house-made chips and pickles (both very yummy) and do not hesitate to refill them. As an app, I had the hominy salad, which was okay if not that flavorful and a little too cold. We both had the combo plates- I had ribs and chicken, he had ribs and pulled pork. The portions are gigantic and the meat is delicious. We loved all the sauces too. Overall it was a good experience. I kind of wish the menu was a little bigger or more varied, but this is a place for bbq, and they do it VERY well.
