The menu is diverse and creative. My wife had the gumbo with flavorful pieces of gator meat mixed in and I had the Fried Green Tomato BLT along with some fried okra and fried onions. After taking our seat, we were given a plate of peanuts -- explained as a Southern delicacy. They had been soaked in something and had a soft, bean-like texture. They reminded me a lot of garbanzo beans. Not incredibly flavorful, but interesting and out of the usual. I would rate my wife's dish and at about a 6 out of 10. The gator was tender and flavorful. The gumbo was slightly spicy, but not overwhelming...borderline bland but still kept my attention.  My dish was probably about a 6 out of 10 as well. The presentation was excellent. The pickled okra was a nice touch and quite tasty. The fried green tomatoes could have been a little more firm and tangy. Not sure if they were over-cooked or not. They still tasted pretty good. The bread, however, was a little too mushy for my liking. Overall, it was a good dish...if it was tweeked a little, it could be excellent. The wait staff seemed to be quite nervous, but I guess this is to be expected since the restaurant has only been open since last Wednesday. Our waitress was kind, courteous, non-intrusive, knowledgeable and helpful. The atmosphere was fantastic -- a nice mixture of southern charm and modern, chic colors and cool lighting fixtures. I would recommend the restaurant, but I think the menu is going to have to have some "heavier-hitters"...an "Oh my goodness, you have to go to Big Jones to get the (fill in the blank)." Overall, I would recommend the restaurant. The management was attentive and the owner visited our table. I think it will get better with time.
