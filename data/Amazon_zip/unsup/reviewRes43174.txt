It's a good thing that I came here with my iPod or I just might have jabbed my knife into the throats of several children while dining here today. The quality of ingredients shine throughout their dishes. The huevos rancheros make for one glorious breakfast. That was for today. Last time I was here I went the grilled panini and the time before that I had the orange brioche french toast. Though I wouldn't say that I'm 100% behind my 5 star review, I owe it to them to do so. I push the bottomless, self-serve iced tea to the max. Normally, I have no fewer than 6 glasses per visit. And, the last time I was here, I can't say that I didn't leave with a free roll of toilet paper. In my defense, I carry my own bottle of Cholula in my bag. So I'm at least not abusing the free condiments.
