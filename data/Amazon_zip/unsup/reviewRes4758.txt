I would give this place 10 stars if possible. I am impressed...My friend's husband recommended we eat here and I must say, the menu is unusual and I was not planning on taking his advice. I am so glad we did take his advice--it is unusual in a good way.  We ordered a bunch of food and shared and frankly, that's my favorite way to eat: Calamari with Fregola, Radishes, Cucumbers & Pistachios--Out of this world! the pistachios really make this dish unique. I highly recommend trying this dish. Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana--Again, out of this world! The asiago and salami put this dish right over the top. They turn what would have been marinated artichokes and potatoes to something worthy of being on the menu at the Purple Pig. Highly recommend trying this dish. Eggplant Parmesan Balls--very good! I eat eggplant at every opportunity. This was good but not like the rest of the items which I rated as out of this world and highly recommend. These balls were very good but the other items were better.... Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes--sounds basic doesnt it? This was out of this world! I don't know what they do to make this pork melt in your mouth good but god! they did something. HIGHLY recommend trying this dish. Decor--very cool and hip, service--very good, helpful and friendly. The only complaint I would have is this place is rather LOUD. the music they played was great--old classics like Van Morrison etc. If you are looking for a romantic dinner, this is not the place unless romantic for you means lots of other people talking really loud. I HIGHLY recommend this place! Try it, you'll like it
