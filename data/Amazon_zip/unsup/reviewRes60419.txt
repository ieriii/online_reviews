This place is tops.They channel the spirit of true Italian cuisine (using fresh, local ingredients when available) and execute it wonderfully.This has to be our favorite, everyday Italian in the city. Uneducated Yelpers beware. This is Italian, not American-Italian. Which is a breath of fresh air for those of us who actually crave authenticity.Bravo, Anteprima, bravo.
