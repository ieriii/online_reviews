Couldn't quite decide whether to give the place 5 or 4 stars (half-stars where are you?). Settled on 4 for the fact that the thin crust is utterly forgettable (I am a bit of a pizza snob, finding fault with pretty much every thin-crust pizza I've tried). The stuffed crust, however, is delectable. Almost as good as Malnati's, though a bit different. My fave is the Art's meaty delight, which features pepperoni, roast beef, sausage, and bacon, even though it can be a bit of a meat overload for some folks. Have gotten delivery and picked up from the place. Delivery is timely enough, though they get busy on weekends and peak hours, so that'll slow things a tad. As for other menu items, I would just avoid them, for the mere fact that the stuffed crust is so damn good, its folly to stray from that. If you seek Chicago's best thin, look elsewhere, but if you love stuffed, buttery goodness, and a blast of calories, Art's is for you.
