I Love Speakeasy. Alright so you know about the hidden door, but the line pretty much give it away. Coming early is the key, and ask to sit at the bar, its actually more exciting that way. The guy who checked our ID and led us to our seats was awesome. He was friendly. However as we sat there we waited for a bit. Our server was such an ass. He was not very friendly and when I mentioned we waited about 10 mintues for someone to greet us he got offended and he pretty much said "no you didn't wait that long." After that remark he took our orders. He did not care to hear what I go to say. Cause he definitely got my order wrong. Okay, that pretty much ruin my expectation of this place. Lets back track a little, I love the decor the place is beautiful. But I believe its a bit dark at the tables. We all have to use the candle or our phones to look at the menu. So our experience starts to get better when another waitress helped us out. She was way nicer and she actually listened. But in the end I was a little disappointed. Oh forgot to mention, what is up with the hidden restrooms? Needs better service, and a little bit of more lighting. I'm not talking about lighting the whole place up but just enough so we're not squinting at the menu.
