I love me some pizza!!! This place is da bomb! Now I haven't been in the place but they do deliver and I must say there delivery service is prompt and very, very nice. As was the order taker on the phone. The pizza is sooo yummy and for me the true test of yummy pizza is when you reheat it! This pizza past that test with flying colors!!!!!! I also had mozzarella sticks from here and they were yummy! They got a little cold but they were still delicious! I love this place!!!
