I really want to give Rev Brew a 5. I love the food. I love the beer. I love the look and feel of the interior. I love that it's close-by. But I don't love waiting hours for a table. They badly need more seating (I've heard rumors this might be coming soon--crossing my fingers!) It's no hardship to enjoy one of their great brews while waiting on Saturday night, but the bar fills quickly and there isn't a good place to stand.  That being said, it really is one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. The menu is varied, and everything I've had has been delicious. The beer list is obviously very good as well. And I highly recommend the stout ice cream for dessert!
