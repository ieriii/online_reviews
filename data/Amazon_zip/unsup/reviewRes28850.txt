I love Pasta Bowl. Hands down, one of my favorite simple, casual dining restaurants in Chicago. First off, this place is cheap. I have a sit down meal and walk out full for under $15 - in the middle of Lincoln Park no less. Second, I love the food. Yes, it might not be all authentic Italian specialties, and anyone who must have true authenticity in their dining experience might not be all about it - but my taste buds say d-elicious! My favorite would have to be the Cappellini Pomodoro. Throw in some meatballs for the carnivores out there to round it out. They put in chunks of fresh mozarella which I love. I have dreams about it at night. And the Farfalle Pollo is really good, as well. Third, the service is usually really good. The place is kind of small, so that is always a consideration, but it is always warm, it always smells good, and you can always keep and eye on your food to make sure they are following proper food safety standards. Finally, it is a little bit out of the way if you don't live nearby, so you will want to cab it, bus it, or hike it from the train. Parking in this neighborhood blows, so be forwarned! But you can always take the 36 or the 22 buses to get there!
