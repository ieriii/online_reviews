What a cute neighborhood-style restaurant. Love the high ceiling, all the windows, and the fun and colorful dcor. Since it's a no, no to do grocery shopping on an empty stomach, my friend and I decided to stuff our face before we go crazy in the Whole Food Market across the street. We started out by trying their Fried Green Tomato. It arrived at the table hot and looked delicious. We thought the tomato was a bit hard and lack in flavor. We liked the crispiness of the batter, just wished that there were more flavorful. More salt, pepper or bacon grease, perhaps? Our favorite dish was Crawfish Cakes. The dinner portion came with two crawfish cakes and two sides (of your choice). Personally, I can eat 6 of these for dinner. The cakes were meaty and had good flavors with a nice kick. The cheese grits was yummy. The Jambalaya, I ordered, was okay. I enjoyed the chicken, andouille sausage, and the cajun shrimp. However, the seasoning was bland and didn't have the piquant flavors that I love about Jambalaya. And, oh, my favorite side, the mashed sweet potato with nuts. Delicious! Service was terrific. Our waitress was personable and attentive.
