This is a weekend brunch review: I hate the Bongo Room. That is not true. I actually really enjoy the Bongo Room, but the prohibitive wait and obnoxious cloud of people out front waiting for one of the tables inside really rubs me the wrong way. I imagine that people wait in line over night, or send an ambassador for their brunch party to stake a claim on a table as soon as the restaurant opens its hallowed doors.  The food is really good, so if you have 2-3 hours to hang out in front of the Bongo Room waiting for a table, awesome.
