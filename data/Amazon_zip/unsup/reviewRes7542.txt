Am I the only one that doesn't totally dig Fogo de Chao? The salad bar was..... just okay. No real standouts there except for the potatoes and cherry peppers. The free starters that they bring to the table were decent at best. Our polenta was way too fried. The fried bananas were soggy and just plain gross. The mashed potatoes, however, were fantastic. The meat for me was just decent. A lot of my selections were very dry. I guess I'm not much of a meat connoisseur, but everything tasted pretty similar to me. It didn't seem like there was much of a variety in the seasonings or spices. I will say I did really enjoy the chicken- perfectly cooked and flavored. Our service was good, and drinks were delicious, but I won't be running back to Fogo, especially for the price.
