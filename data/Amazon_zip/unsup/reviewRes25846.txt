This place is absolutely fantastic! The tiger shrimp and chorizo soup is probably the best soup I have ever had in my life. Service is fantastic and the ambiance is completely distracting. It's beautiful. You'll have to see for yourself. Definitely try the white sangria. It's refreshing, a little pricey, but worth it.
