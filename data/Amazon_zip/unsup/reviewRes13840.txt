Hands down, the best Cuban food you will find in Chicago. I'm a vegetarian, and most people think of the ham and cheese Cuban sandwich when they think of Cuban food--You have to know there's so much more! While, I've been assured (from my carnivore friends) that the meat options are tasty, there are plenty of veggie things to be had. All of the food is made to order. I love the fried plantains and the Timba sandwich is my staple. If you're a smoothie fan, the guanabana is amazing! (As is the singing that ensues after your order.) The only drawback is that this location is very small. If you have a large group, go to the one on Armitage--much more seating there. Clybourn has an outdoor patio in the summer but you're left with much less options in the winter. I love the old Cuban news papers that are pasted on the walls, as well as the Cuban music that often makes me wiggle a little dance in my seat as I eat. This place truly makes my tummy happy! :)
