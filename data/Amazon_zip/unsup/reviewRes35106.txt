Shaw's crab house (I have only been to the one on Hubbard) is still my favorite place for consistent, quality seafood and shellfish. The food is always prepared right, with great service, which is why I gave it 5 stars. I have been here numerous times over at least 20 years, but only eaten in the dining room a couple times. To me the dining area is a bit dated and boring looking, and not where I would bring a date to impress her. The oyster bar is my favorite place to eat which is a more casual and lively place to eat. There you get the same great food and service, but with a dash of fun too! I always thought it was independent, but then I noticed it was now part of the Lettuce Entertain You group.
