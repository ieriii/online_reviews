I've been to the Publican twice and I think it is a nice trendy place with an awesome beer menu. If you want to try a great gastropub, I was recommend this place. The first time I went, we ordered some smaller appetizer style dishes, a variety of cheeses and meats which was good. Pork rinds, cheese, frites, all pretty good. The second time, we ordered more off the menu, including ribs and chicken. I had a Belgian lambic beer which is pricy was so tasty. All in all, a great place to try.
