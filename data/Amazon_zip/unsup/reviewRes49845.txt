Las Tablas Lakeview was recommended to me by a friend who had just gone for his birthday and loved it. I decided to take my group of 4 there, as I had 2 guests in town who I thought would love it too. The food itself in combination with BYOB Monday-Thursday was 5 stars, however, the SERVICE, oh the service... tsk tsk tsk Las Tablas. Didn't you see all the guests waiting for a table sneak out due to your inability to write names down on a piece of paper? Couldn't you at least PRETEND you were familiar with a wait list? We literally had to go up there 3 different times to make sure our party of 4's name was on the list. The first two somehow didn't end up on there.... After myself and a few other hungry patrons bonded over how ridiculously horrible the service and lack of organization was while we waited for the 'host' to slowly meander back to the host stand, I asked the question many of us were wondering- how do we know when it is our turn? (they didn't take our phone#'s or use a buzzing system). In her Columbian, accent, 'Oh, i know face'. okay okay lady. Lady did know my mean hungry mug by that time and sat us within 10 minutes of that point. Was this MTV's Boiling Point?! Don't mess with hungry girls.... Anyway, why this restaurant even deserves 2 stars- food was excellent, i definitely recommend the combo empanada appetizer and the skirt steak. The Yukon potatoes were amazing too and I believe I consumed a leftover one at 2am after the bars. Would I go back? Yes, on a weeknight only.
