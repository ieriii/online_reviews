we had a great meal at piccolo sogno. we came with someone affiliated with the restaurant so service was fantastic, and we had a chance to try a lot of the dishes as the kitchen kept sending free food our way. the antipastos, risotto, pastas, and the veal special were fantastic - real standouts were the pasta bolognese, the lasagna, and the risotto special (w/rabbit ragu). the hazelnut chocolate cake was also delicious. the restaurant was busy and lively - a fun atmosphere for sure. so why 3 stars instead of 5? there were 7 of us at dinner and we all brought home leftovers. i ended up getting someone else's veal by mistake and when i opened the container i found a piece of VERY raw meat (it was veal milanese which is breaded - so either the person in our party who had it didn't see that it was raw because of the breading, or they saw and stopped eating it but didn't say anything). sort of put a damper on my excitement about piccolo sogno...
