I really like Piece. In my opinion there are far too few brewpubs in Chicago and most of the beers here are solid.  I've tried a lot of pizza in the 4 years I've lived in Chicago and this is up there near the top.  Service isn't great (especially the hosts and hostesses) and I'm not a huge fan of the neighborhood, but Piece is great...it's packed every night for a reason!
