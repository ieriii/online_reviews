I recommend this place for a date night.  From what I saw on their website, it looked pretty flashy and I thought their ambitious decorating would be an excuse for slacking off in other categories. Fortunately I was wrong and their food was excellent. My favorite part of the meal was the Ceviches Mixto. Our waiter was really friendly too, explaining each part of the meal in enough detail for us to appreciate what exactly we were eating, but not hanging around us too much.  As a side note, the crowd is just as vibrant as the restaurant, which made for some solid crowd entertainment. Even with all the wild outfits, I came in pretty casually dressed (jeans and a recently washed collared shirt) and didn't feel out of place at all.
