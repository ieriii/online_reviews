I decided to give this place another shot in part because my girlfriend's family wanted to eat here for a birthday celebration. Yeah...I'm sticking with my original rating of a three star A-OK, but here's why: Decor as mentioned by almost everyone is a huge plus, except the bathroom is like two flights of stairs underground. Also, I never realized how loud it was in the restaurant. Food was MUCH better than the first time around. Adobo pork belly is the go-to entree. Among the best adobo and/or pork belly I've had in the city. I would have upped the rating to four stars if it weren't for... ...the service. Killed me again. Reservations on a Monday for 8 PM. We got seated at 8:30 PM. Whammy. Server was below mediocre. He rarely checked on us and did not fill our drinks or ask for refills once. Water was refilled once by his serving entourage, aka food runners. Not sure if I'll give Sunda another run. I think I've been fooled enough by it's looks. I will say, however, you might have a few celebrity sightings as this is a very trendy spot. Our party was seated next to Josh Duhamel and Fergie.
