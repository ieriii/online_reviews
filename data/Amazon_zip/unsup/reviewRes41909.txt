Absolutely fantastic!!! The experience was all I hoped for & more. I came here with my friend for a dual celebration of his birthday & my new job. We started with pear & berry martinis, each were delicious. Then we ordered a bottle of Pinot noir suggested by our server, Petra. It was different than any other Pinot I have ever had, but in a good way. It had a coolness & clean finish to it. For apps we split the sliced tomato & onion salad & the seared ahi tuna. The tuna was drizzled in a wasabi soy sauce and was also A+. For the steak we split the porterhouse for two & all I can say is OMG! This steak was enormous! It was about a foot long & 2" thick. It was the most tender, flavorful, & perfectly cooked steak I've ever eaten! Oh, and it is served on a hot plate with melted butter! Oh yes! I would also like to mention the service as it was top notch! The manager came by to make sure we were happy and our server was knowledgeable & friendly & really made us feel special. If you haven't been yet, you're missing out!
