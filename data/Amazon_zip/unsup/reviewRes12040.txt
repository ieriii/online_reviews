Family and I went here for mother's day... My brother-in-law picked this place due to the reviews on yelp and boy, did he pick the right place!!! The food, the waitstaff, and the ambience of the place was right on-point. I can't believe I've never heard of this place before! I ordered Carne de la Paradilla (?) and it was cooked perfect (juicy, tender, and flavorful). I'm glad I asked the waiter what he would prefer. It was great! My younger sis, Leizl, ordered seafood- the Mariscos dish. It was deee-lish! The scallops were savory and buttery. I wish I could've tried the rest of the dish, but I didn't want to eat her whole plate now... and then my older sister, Trina, had duck and even I had to say it was awesome! (Usually I can't stand the taste of duck. I'm very picky!) The texture, the flavor, and the presentation was amazing! My youngest sister, Jacqueline, had the Comal dish. I wasn't too impressed with it, but had I had a bit of a sweet tooth that day, I probably would've liked it. She had the chicken version and our family friend had the steak one. (Chicken was better!) I wanted to try their Ropa Vieja so bad, but maybe next time. All in all, this is a great place to go with friends or on a date. Service was excellent, food was excellent, and ambience was beautiful!
