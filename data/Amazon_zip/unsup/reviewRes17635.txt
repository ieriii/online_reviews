Maybe it's just me, but I felt this place was way too over priced. If I wanted to pay for ambiance and/or scenery I'd go to the Art Museum. I went there looking for top of the line Latin cuisine and walked away feeling not only cheated, but less than sated.  Our drink tab was $75 before our table was even ready (we had to wait 1hr 30 min for a table) One of us had a Cranberry Juice, she was pregnant , another had a side car, another had a caipirinha and I had a shot of Petron and a really good Amaretto Stone Sour. Our drinks were about $10 each. Where did the $75 bill come from.  At dinner I had the "Arrachera" which on the menu was priced at $17.00 and I had an "Amaretto Stone Sour" let's say it was $10 . The other 3 had the "Mama Mendez'" meal priced at $25 and let's say they each had a drink that was $10 a piece also. Okay, by my calculation that comes to about $132 plus about $15 tax, right?  Wrong.  Our bill ended up being $170 plus a $10 tip for the waitress, that in my opinion wasn't earned, for a meal with over seasoned rice and steak that was not (not trying to be funny here) even close to the quality and taste of my own, or my Latin friends.  You can not sacriifce quality food for "Flashy Bright Overly Colorful Decor". I can't get full or take that home in a "To Go Container". It was not worth it to me. Perhaps if I had been drunk I could have enjoyed the atmosphere more. Did I mention the $10 for valet parking? If I really want to break my pocket book I'll stick to going places where you know up front that you have to come big or stay home, like....Fogo de Chao. Just My Two Cents
