Enjoyable and recommended. As far as the newly designed menu, go all out and get the Repertoire (we had the spring 2012) -- two dishes that were only offered in this option were two of my favorites -- the popcorn course (perhaps to make up for taking away the free popcorn -- boo! hiss!) and the foie course (ah, foie and cherry. you are my peanut butter and jelly).  I was pleased that foie-llipops were still offered (a nice surprise since it wasn't listed in the menu). They offer it as a "course within a course" before the foie course. But my question is since the foie isn't offered in all the menus, do you not get the foiellipops otherwise? A shame, because they are so awesome. Also I think they rotate the flavor of pop rocks coating, but word to the wise, watermelon is the best! P.S. My other favorite course was the lobster. Oh lobster sausage, let's rendevous again.
