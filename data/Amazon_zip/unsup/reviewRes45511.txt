When's the last time you went to a restaurant with reservations, and they actually had a specific table reserved for you? Or...when was the first time this has happened to you? I was quite surprised when I saw that Wilde had done that for us, especially with the table in some prime real estate (right near the entrance near the open front area, in view of a TV for the Boston/Chicago game). I was a bit surprised when no one else was getting as hype as I was at the game...I guess that's just the type of crowd that comes here, but I feel like they should turn in their "pub" license. Luckily, after dinner, we headed to the back where we finally found some people who cared about the triple overtime. However, to the owners of Wilde: please make sure your TVs are on the same channel. I was watching the HD feed of the game, which lagged behind the non-HD feed that people behind us were watching. Kinda sucked hearing cheers behind us, then seeing it happen in front of us. I think Yelp hyped up the mac and cheese a bit...it was very good, but I've had better. My friend got the chicken pot pie, which turned out all right. They obliged my request to trade out linguine for whole-wheat spaghetti to go with my seafood dish. While the switch hurt the dish, it was my choice for wanting to be healthy. Silly me. For dessert, we each got some spiked hot chocolate, which is a big favorite of mine. Props to this place for having it on their menu. In short: the decor and service were great, food was all right, and not a bad place to chill for the evening. It is a bad place to go nuts, however.
