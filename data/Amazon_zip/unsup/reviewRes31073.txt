Okay, at the risk of sounding blasphemous, can I just say that after extensive research, I think the food here is mediocre? Vegans, I appreciate and respect the lengths to which you must go to find a restaurant that caters to your dietary needs. I do. But do not even TRY to tell me that I "won't even taste the difference." It simply isn't so. Now, maybe I've just been ordering the wrong food (I can hardly make toast and I trust I could make a moister vegan cake.) After my second disappointing visit, I did go a third time and (ashamedly) asked for dairy cheese instead of soy. This was a small improvement, but still not enough for me to recommend the restaurant to anyone who isn't veggie. (But hey, maybe there is something to be said for the vegan lifestyle. The waitstaff are usually pretty hot.) I realize this review makes me sound like an intolerant carnivore. However, I do happen to love the Earwax Cafe in Bucktown. And they have plenty of vegan options that I find much more palatable.
