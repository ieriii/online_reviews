We just stayed at the Seneca. It was awesome. The room was huge, king bed, living room, dinning room and galley kitchen. So much nicer than I had expected for $99 per night. The room was clean and quite. The staff was very helpful and friendly.The only reason I did not give five stars is because the TV in the bedroom made a loud buzzing sound.We will definitely stay at the Seneca again and I am telling all of my friends and family about it.
