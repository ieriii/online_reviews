If you love thin crust pizza you'll enjoy this place. The pizza is yummy. I love that you can customize the pizza as much as you want. You start off with 3 choices as the base then you choose your topping for $2-$3 per topping. The great thing about thin crust vs. thick crust is that the pizza comes pretty quickly. The only thing that I don't like about the place is that it's hot. There aren't fans in restaurant and at 6:30 pm, it was probably around 95 degrees in there. I would recommend coming here on nicer days when it's cooler outside. :-)
