I am still thinking about the taste of the combo meat Comal and that wasn't the meal I ordered!  My boyfriend and I had a Group-on for Cafe 28 and we made a reservation early because they were filled up.  We walked over from my apartment because parking is difficult. (side note.. take the Brownline to Iriving Park and save yourself the hassle of parking). Our table was ready at the time we had reserved which made me smile because I was HUNGRY!  Dan read the reviews on Yelp so he was excited about either the bacon dates (Specials menu) or the Papas Rellenas (menu). We decided to go with the Papas Rellenas since the dates didn't have goat cheese.  Our server was nice but wasn't as engaging as I would have liked. I ended up going with the Cuban Style Chicken and Dan went with the Comal. We were both teetering because I wanted to get the Comal or Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops and he wanted to get the Bistec a la Cubana. I regret my deciosn of the getting the Chicken. It wasn't at all the way it was described in the menu. It has skin on it and tasted more like Clinantro than garlic. I hate clinantro so I was so disapointed, but my sides were not disapointing. The Congri was rice, beans, and bacon mixture. yes bacon. The plantains added a nice sweetness to a very savory meal. I started eating some of Dan's comal and his was SOO good. LIke I said at the begining of the review, I am still thinking about the steak in the Comal. Dan and I switched plates and I was now happy! I lost my yummy sides but the marinade in the Comal was divine! We were so stuffed from our appetizer and dinner, we passed on dessert.  the dessert menu had over a handful of tasty sweets, but save room because the you get a lot of food at Cafe 28. I will come back!
