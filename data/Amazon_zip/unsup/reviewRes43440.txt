bottom line: i thought i'd be blown away by deep-dish in chi-town, but honestly this didn't taste that different than zachary's. now that's not such a bad thing as zachary's is pretty awesome for deep dish. this restaurant felt very, very casual and could use something to improve the ambiance as everything inside the restaurant felt very bland, save for the food.
