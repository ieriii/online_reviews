I hope to get back sometime soon. We arrived 10 mins after our reservation time, and had to wait less than 5 mins to be seated. It was much busier than I expected at 6, so glad we made reservation. All the staff we had contact with were quite nice, and efficient. We didn't have entrees, only apps and salad because we were headed to Symphony Center and didn't want to be stuffed. Cheese tray w/pairings was very nice. Seared scallops were boarderline undercooked, but tasty. Salad good, not memorable (but few are). Noise level not ideal, but it is a bustling place for a good meal and drinks, so pretty much what you'd expect. I'll be back, and entrees will be ordered. More to follow after next trip............
