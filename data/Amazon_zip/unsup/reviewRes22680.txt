The national, possibly unofficial, slogan of Costa Rica is Pura Vida or enjoy life. Well that's what this installment of Veggie Supper Club did. To start, we noshed on chips and salsas and complimentary black beans with pico de gallo. I also had some empanadas - black bean, plantain, and spinach and cheese; the spinach was by far the best of the three, but they were all tasty. I had planned to order Tuna Mixed with Rice, reminiscent of a dish I got in Costa Rica. Unfortunately, per Omar, our fabulous server, it wasn't made with seared, fresh tuna as I had hoped, but canned tuna so I passed and got the veggie burrito instead. When three veggie burritos, three different ways came to the table confusedly Omar was quick to take them back to the kitchen and sort out which one was which. My burrito was good, but not exceptional or award winning as the menu states. I wouldn't come back for that specifically, but I would come back to try some other menu items. My pre-dinner snacking only allowed me to finish half of the huge burrito, but the rest made a nice lunch the next day. This place is BYOB and cash only, but they have an ATM in front. There are also a few liquor stores close by on Milwaukee in case you need to get something on the fly. The place is small, it will be hit or miss if you're dining in parties of more than 4. Bottom line: I'd give the food 3.5 stars, but the enthusiastic, attentive and friendly service from Omar kicks it up to 4. TIP: They can make their oatmeal shake with soy milk if you're on the outs with cows. TIP: If you've been to Costa Rica bring a photo, they have a board where you can post it.
