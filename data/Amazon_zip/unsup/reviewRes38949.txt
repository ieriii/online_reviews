The food and drink at longman is notoriously good. The main reason this review is three stars and not five is because the service sucked on my last visit. Middle of the day. Half empty restaurant. Bunch of people standing around while we waited for everything from drinks, to condiments, to silverware. I had to give the Vulcan death stare at least three times after we'd waiting too long. Get it together, seriously.  The cheddar on the burger was amazing, but it almost overpowered the most important component: the delicious beef. It was still an excellent burger. The fries cooked in beef fat were pretty awesome as well. The bloody mary's are just okay. Throw some cheese, olives, pickles, peppers, and sausage on a skewer . Dunk a celery stalk in there and make it official.  At least nobody was rude (out server was actually very nice). And the food is really good. I've been to Longman a handful of times only but every time the food stands out. Next time I'm going for the chicken and waffles.
