When you walk into this place it feels like you've been transported to an upscale restaurant/plantation house in the south. The location and price point draw an upper echelon crowd so there was some interesting people watching. As for the food, I thought it was pretty good but nothing out of this world. My date and I both really enjoyed our meal and cocktails were excellent. Service was also up to our expectations. I'd recommend giving it a try!
