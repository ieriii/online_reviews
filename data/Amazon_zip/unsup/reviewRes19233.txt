One more review. WHAT IS WITH THE KID ROOM? I have children so I understand the need to accommodate children. But the side room turns into a Chuck E Cheese, with huge groups of families taking over the space. Three children pounding on the pinball machine next to me, parents ignoring screaming children...how's that for a Friday night? Can you maybe break up the big groups a bit? Or ask them to maintain some level of decorum? Otherwise, you'll lose your audience.
