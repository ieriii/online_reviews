I've been here so many times, I've literally lost count. Whenever I'm in the city with friends for an afternoon of shopping or doing lame-o touristy activities, we tend to get overwhelmed by all the dining choices at our fingertips and we just don't know where to go for nosh... So we hail a taxi, tell the driver "600 N. Michigan Ave." and all is right with the world. No, it's not a five-star, world class restaurant. But it's as reliable as it gets when you're looking for an "affordable splurge" in the the heart of one of the world's most famous shopping destinations, The Magnificent Mile. The ambiance is so rich and warm, and the service is always top notch and I've never been disappointed with the food or drinks. I'm always left feeling highly satisfied and just a wee bit spoiled. Which, in my book, is never a bad thing.
