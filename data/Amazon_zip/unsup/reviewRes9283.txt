. I order for pick up a couple times a month. Joujeh in the Garden, which is a nicely presented salad with a large skewer of chicken. Out the door for $ 14.50  The salad includes feta, olives, tomatoes, and we selected a tasty rasberry balsamic dressing.  For lunch , my wife and I splitt this. Yes, we enjoy Noon O.. Call about 30 minutes before you need your meal and it should be ready before you arrive. The separate pick up building means I am not competing with sit down patrons. We like it a lot.
