Outstanding food, and service wasn't bad either, especially when you consider they were dealing with St. Patrick's day crowds. Diverse menu for the adventurous carnivore and especially for the porkovore. The food here almost made me sick...... Only because I could not stop eating. Went back later the same night for the pork sweetbreads and the roasted bone marrow. Simply stunning. The turkey leg will defy all expectations. Was going to try to hit The Pig for a third time in one day but threw in the towel at 11:30 pm when I was still full from earlier. Will definitely return for more!
