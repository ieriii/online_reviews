I've been here four times and have had some mixed results. I love the atmosphere, the location, the beer list and - when everything goes well - Bad Apple serves one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. All of that being said, the food has been a bit inconsistent. I always order burger medium rare and my burger was clearly overcooked here on two of my visits. Also, I love their options for french fries, but, my fries were a bit burnt when I went last night. Lastly, be sure to always order your burger on a pretzel roll. The pretzel rolls are great even though for one reason or another not all burgers are served on them. On a good night, Bad Apple is absolutely, unequivocally a 5-star review in my book. On an off night, they're still a solid 3-star.
