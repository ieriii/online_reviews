I love that this place is only two blocks away from my place. I love that they have a more upscale menu than your typical bar food menu (no artichoke dip, potato skins) I love that they have a great drink menu with a wide selection of quality drinks.....from beer to hard liquor. I love that it already made Esquire's list as best bar to visit while in Chicago.
