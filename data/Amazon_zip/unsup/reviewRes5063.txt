This is a great place to grab drinks and apps after work. The inside is festive. You sit at communal tables which I tend to like b/c you get to meet new people or if they are lame, you can choose to keep to yourself. The wine list is expansive and they have less expensive options ($35 - 40). The staff is knowledgeable about the wines and offer many suggestions depending on your taste.  Great for groups!
