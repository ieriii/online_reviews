Service was extraordinary. Waiter was very friendly and efficient. The cheese fondue is my fave. Lots of spices and cheese, They give you a flame for the hot meals with which you may roast marshmallows, and then dip them in the chocolate. Make sure to cover it in chocolate for the best effect! The fruit part was my fav and not the veggiesTry it out when you can. It's well.
