this is a wonderful place to come and drink however do not plan on eating here. the menu is just bizarre....leg of rabbit wrapped in bacon, stilton mac n' cheese (ewww), and it's also expensive. also, do NOT order a salad. i ordered the $8 chop salad and it came on a tiny side plate with a soppy ice cream scoop of lettuce and other drenched vegetables. yuck! and also, what? is this a joke?
