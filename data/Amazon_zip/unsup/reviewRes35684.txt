I was driving by one weekend with my friend from brunch, and we saw all the golden brown ducks hanging from the window. At that moment I knew it would be my destiny to eat here. There are so many things right with this place. The duck is just as good as you think it is after seeing it proudly displayed in the front entrance. The seafood is fresh. Like they kill you crab and lobster to order. And there where so, so many things on the menu that I wanted to shove in my stomach that I knew I wouldn't be able to fit on this visit. Needless to say I will be back for more.
