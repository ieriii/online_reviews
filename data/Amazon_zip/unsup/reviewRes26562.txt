Never in my life, did I think I give Mexican food 5 stars. So this is a first. Things you need to know: 1) There will be a wait, but moves quickly. 2) Cash Only (average price on a dish is $6-8) 3) High Quality 4) BYOB 5) Take-out is an option, but when you sit and dine, you get several "perks" and you are spoiled with yummy starters. 6)Not a cheap knock-off of Mexican food or "tex mex". This is the real deal. This local dive is in my hood and I had a chance to frequent several mexican joints in pilsen. By far this place Rocks! No matter how many times I go I can't get myself to order anything new because their skirt steak and tamales are so good. Did I mention how good their Tamales are... They are made in house by the mom... The gauc is also heavenly along with their house-made Salsas... Go, try and leave a review on how amazing the food is as well.
