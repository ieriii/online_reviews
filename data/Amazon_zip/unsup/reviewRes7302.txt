My husband & I really loved eating here! Phenomenal service & food! We totally enjoyed the complimentary homemade bbq potato chips!! The complimentary pickles were tasty & interesting too. We had 3 different things: the BBQ flight: combo of kobe brisket, pulled chicken & pulled pork which also included 3 pieces of cornbread, bacon cheddar hush puppies and macaroni & cheese. The pulled pork, hush puppies & mac and cheese were absolutely AMAZING-while the pulled chicken & kobe brisket was also very good. I believe ithe BBQ Flight came with 4 sauces too. The service was so perfect-our water glasses were also routinely refilled & they changed out our silverware THREE TIMES! We sat outside next to a white picket fence overlooking Dearborn St & it was wonderful! Next time, I would get the hush puppies and mac & cheese (again) & would like to have the pulled pork sandwich and maybe try the ribs. This place figured out how to serve delicious food & treat their customers right!! Can't wait to go back! I recommend making reservations & sitting outside weather permitting!
