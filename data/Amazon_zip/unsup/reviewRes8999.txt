This place was recommended to us by a friend, and it got good reviews here, so we thought we'd give it a go. I was expecting a bit of a dive, but was pleasantly surprised to find it bright, clean, and larger than I expected. The wine selection is good, and our waitress gave us some tasty recommendations. They start everyone off with a plate of feta, parsley, onions w/pita to munch. We also got a small order of hummus, which was very good. Our kabobs came quickly. The meat was tender & full of flavor. And they gave lots of delicious dill rice.  We opted for tea and baklava for dessert. After all of that, our bill was still very reasonable. Our waitress was very good, very attentive. There was a large group sitting next to us (10 or so) and their waiter was cracking jokes left & right. Great find! Will go back!
