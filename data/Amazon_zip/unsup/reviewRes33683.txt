I missed this place until I realized where I moved to there was another one!  So with that said they have the BEST hummus ever. And I used to go and pick up a container with some pita all the time. OH my god its heavenly. Their food is so cheap and yummy and not your typical burger and fries cheap eats. They use such fresh ingredients and great yummy meats and falafel that you can't get enough.  Not much for sit down really since there is a very limited space to sit. But in the summer there is more places to sit outside and wicker park is only a few blocks away to go munch in the park:)
