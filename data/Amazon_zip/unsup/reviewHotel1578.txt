We held our wedding at Hotel 71 this past July, and we could not be more pleased. Now that the renovations are complete, the hotel is beautiful and suited our needs perfectly. We chose Hotel 71 based on the penthouse city views-- which are amazing. The majority of our guests also stayed in the hotel, and we received several compliments regarding their arrangements. Rebecca Lachman, the coordinator for the wedding is very professional, and helpful and did an excellent job ensuring that our wedding day was perfect and put together.
