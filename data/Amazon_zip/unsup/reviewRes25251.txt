My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to enjoy a late night dessert. Although Artopolis had a cozy environment and delicious raspberry chocolate cake, their customer service was sorely lacking. I got the impression they weren't interested in serving more customers. We waited for 5 minutes and although we were acknowledged and told to seat ourselves, no one approached us before we got up and left to investigate other options. This may seem finicky but the business was slow (it was 11:00PM) and we saw many of the staffers standing around. We decided to return. Our waitress was barely friendly and the milk I received came with some complimentary eye lashes. They were happy to exchange the milk with another and because the food was good, I'll be returning to give Artopolis another try at better customer service. For now however, it gets a 3/5 rating.
