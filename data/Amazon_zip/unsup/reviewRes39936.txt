Went here on a date (money being no object) we sampled a large portion of the drink and dinner menu. Drinks were okay (it's no Aviary, or even Elixer), and the food left me underwhelmed (definitely prefer Gilt, or Avec). Overpriced, underwhelming, crowded for no good reason (I feel like it's one of those places you go, just to say you went and then speak highly of it because you think you should). One-time experience, I'd go somewhere else.
