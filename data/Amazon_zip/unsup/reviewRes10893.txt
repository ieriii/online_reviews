Oh Bongo Room, how I love thee! Mushiness aside, I must dock off a star for the highly uninspiring savory breakfast items -- which my parents made the mistake of ordering. Are two mediocre eggs, potatoes, and toast worth the $9 (or so) price tag? Absolutely not. Pancakes, on the other hand, are a different story. The banana white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes fueled me for a day of sightseeing in Chi-town without leaving me with the dreaded sugar crash. Moreover, the coffee here is brewed to impeccability and certainly played an important role in helping me stay awake in the morning traffic. Might I also add that coffees will be refilled after every sip. How's that for outstanding service? As for securing a table, I'd suggest swinging by on a weekday morning, say 8ish. No wait time plus a quiet atmosphere will make your morning THAT much better. Trust me on this one. It's a good thing that BR is a 4-hour drive away or I'd be frequenting on a daily basis. Clearly that would be disastrous for my waistline.
