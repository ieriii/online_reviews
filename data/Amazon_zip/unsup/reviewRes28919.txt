My heart hurt while eating this pizza-- and not for reasons you would think. Having read fellow Yelpers' reviews, I had extremely high expectations for Pequod's pizza. But, sadly sadly sadly, this pizza is so very overrated. So, in addition to my heart, the hurt spread to my head because I couldn't quite fathom why this pizza is so beloved. It is a ridiculously thick slab of unappetizing crust (so much so that I sliced most of the bottom half off), followed by a nearly non-existent layer of cheese, slathered with sweet, chunky sauce (which was probably the only good thing), and finished off with a meager sprinkling of your topping of choice. Oh-- I forgot to mention that the outer edge of the crust is lined with black, burnt cheese which they call "caramelized cheese crust," but this can easily be achieved by throwing mozzarella, parmesan, or your preferred cheese on a hot skillet and letting it sit there until it burns. I adore pizza. Really truly utterly adore pizza. I do not know what this round concoction was. It broke my heart, made me unjustifiably fatter, and took $20 of hard-earned money that could have been spent on something more worth it.
