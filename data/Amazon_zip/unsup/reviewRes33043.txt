The owner of this restaurant was awesome!!!  The food was great!!!! It was hot and fast!! I would recommend everything i ordered! which is the following... *you get a complementary basket of french bread (its so good and soft) Appetizers: -Bruschetta (if you love tomato, you will get plenty!) -Saganaki Oppa! (make sure to have your camera ready to take a Picture!) -Mussels (i got the spice sauce with them, and it was a large quantity of mussels, totally worth the price!) Entree: -Chicken Schnitzel I RATE THIS RESTAURANT A 5 STAR! THE OWNER WAS JUST SO NICE AND WELCOMING! MADE ME FEEL LIKE WE WERE FAMILY!!! OR LIKE HE KNEW ME! I JUST HAD TO LOVE THE OWNER! The only problem was the waitress; she wasn't welcoming or didn't even give me one smile throughout the whole time i was there. But like i said the OWNER i give him a 5 STAR, every time he came around and asked how we were doing, he made me forget about the waitress. I would totally recommend this Restaurant! Try it! Its something different and unique!
