There is no better meal in the city....make sure to go on Friday or Saturday for the duck fat fries..I would check online at http://HotDougs.com to see what the weekly specials are....there is nothing like the tueben which is a corned beef sausage. My personal favorite was the Cranberry infused Buffalo meat sausage.
