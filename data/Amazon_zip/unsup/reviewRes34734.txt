I'm sorry Sultan's fans, but I have a bad review. I don't like to place bad reviews, but this place was not clean. It was a crazy place with no organization. No one was going near the steam table/salad bar. It looked as if the items had been there all day. My friend and I both ordered the meat combo platter, egg and cheese pie and falafel. I couldn't say a good thing about any of them. After getting home, both of us were quite sick?
