Our second trip to Wildfire pretty much sealed our feelings about the place....The food is awesome but the service is VERY mediocre.  We had a reservation both times we went and the first time we waited and the second time they sat us (two of us) at one of the smallest tables they have...The ones that remind you of 50s diners. Ugh.  We waited about 6 minutes before our server came and discussed moving tables with him. He said he had no control over where we sat and suggested we go ask the person who seats us! We didn't.  Finally, when our food started coming and our two wine flights arrived we had no room at all! We complained to the waiter again and this time he went to ask about moving tables for us. He came back and said we could but we'd have to wait 15 minutes-this was AFTER we received part of our meal! My husband was upset. He went and found the manager and asked about moving. The manager helped us moved but afterwards our service (from the same waiter) went down drastically. We got ONE visit from him after we moved tables. I watched him wait on other tables and one of the tables who arrived when we were switching tables got their food BEFORE us! Totally confused about how this happened but it pissed me off. I am not sure we will go again and I don't recommend Wildfire if you want good service.
