Las Tablas might be my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Get the entrana skirt steak - it's the best steak I have ever had. Perfectly seasoned and so so tender. The chicken and pork are also great, but the skirt steak is perfection. For an appetizer, I always go with the aborrajado - a nice combination of sweet, salty and cheesy. Just thinking about it makes me miss living in Chicago!
