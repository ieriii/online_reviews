AMAZING and SO reasonably priced. I went here on a Saturday night before a half marathon to "carb load" and it did the trick! I had the rigatoni bolognese which was amazing - they add a bit of cream to make it even more delicious. My friend had the bowtie chicken with subdried tomatoes & cream sauce that was SO SO good - we both had plenty to take home. Very casual atmosphere - they had a wide selection of beers on tap and bottled. Most importanly, service was GREAT - super quick and efficient!
