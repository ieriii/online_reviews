Tango Sur is my restaurant crush, so I was excited to try out what seemed likely to be a similar experience. Sadly, I was somewhat disappointed. Decent steak, but flavorful due mostly to oversalting as opposed to actual seasonings. No wait to be seated, but then a 50 minute wait to get our food. The explanation by the waiter was "it is taking a long time to get your food because we have a large party seated; but you don't mind? Really? I don't? Ok food at ok prices, but if you want a great night, and can handle a wait, go to Tango Sur.
