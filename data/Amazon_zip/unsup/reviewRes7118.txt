One word ... Delicious ! And resonably priced to boot ! My husband and I have been here three times now in a matter of a few months and it is consistently good. The BBQ is of course amazing, but the sides (mac and cheese, buttermilk mashed potatos, and two types of corn bread) are delicious as well. Plus you get free homeade BBQ potato chips and sweet pickles. Um yum, what's not to like (except for maybe the two pounds you'll gain stuffing your face LOL)
