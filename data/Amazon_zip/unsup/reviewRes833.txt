Hot Doug's really is the place to go for hot dogs and sausages. Hands down. Chicago-style hot dog? On the menu. Venison sausage? On the menu. Elk sausage? On the menu. I know what you're thinking, but it was absolutely fabulous. The inside is super small and fully decorated with almost every kind of hot dog and sausage-related signs and decor you can imagine. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes to just order our food. I definitely wouldn't call this place "fast" food by any means, but I think it's worth the wait. You're not allowed to sit down until after you order. Surprisingly enough, the tables turn over pretty quickly so no one is ever with food and without a seat. Once you place your order, it comes out fast and you consume it fast. I guess that's where the "fast" in the "fast food" saying comes from. The food is really good and it's fairly cheap too. I highly recommend the corn dog and the elk sausage. Also, get the duck fat fries. The bigger-sized fries are not that far off from regular fries, but the smaller-sized fries are unreal. I. Could. Not. Stop. Eating. Them. It was bad.
