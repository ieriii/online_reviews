Waited 45 minutes on a Friday after arriving at 11:15, well worth it. We ordered 2 The Dogs, 1 Corn Dog, 1 Marty Allen, Tater Tots with Cheese, and the Duck Fat Fries The Dog: ands down the best dog I have ever had, and I mean the flavor even without all the delicious toppings. Corn Dog: Also delicious, great flavor in the breading Tater Tots with Cheese: Perfectly crisped on the outside, delicious. Duck Fat Fries: Only part of the meal that disappointed. Not because they were not good, because they were good fries and not too greasy like I expected. But based on the reviews here I was expecting something like I'd never had before, and they weren't. Maybe they are unique for Chicago, but I've had similar fries in Austin.
