Oh, Anteprima how I did love you. I Yelped passionately about you (as you can see from my first enthusiastic review). I took my foodie friends there and asked them to spread the word. I returned time and time again. I loved the food but also loved the way I felt welcomed and taken care of, as if you really wanted me to be there. And then...tonight (April 29/09). It all came unravelled. The food is still good, although seems to be losing a bit of its edge. But the service, oh my. The room was attended by a vagabound crew who seemed terribly disinterested that anyone showed up at all as they chatted and lounged around the bar. We took a table for six and arrived early when the place was empty. Bread arrived - 45 minutes after we sat down. Menus were never picked up after our orders were taken. Water glasses not filled. Not one basic need was anticipated.  I was mortified because I had brought friends who had never been to Anteprima before and I had gushed about the place.  Sadly, you've lost me as a fan - next time I'll go to the Bristol where the food is equally (if not more) interesting and the staffers actually act like they're (very) happy you came in.  My advice to those who are reading Anteprima's reviews: when you make a reservation make SURE the owner will be there - he runs a tight ship. Alas, when the cat's away...you may never get your bread. Or much of anything without begging for it. Sigh.
