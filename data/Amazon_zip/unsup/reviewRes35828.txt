Called Friday night just before closing for a table and a duck for Saturday night, and everything after that was perfect. Based on Yelper insights we considered other dishes to sample more items, but our server told us the duck would be plenty. Given that there were only two of us and we and our potential leftovers would be heading to the Green Mill before going home, it was the right decision to just stick with the duck. It was as incredible as everyone else said. The fat was perfectly rendered, the skin crispy without being burnt or chewy, and the meat silky. Also loved the bao instead of the more-familiar-in-Chicago pancake. As for the service: we encountered none of the problems described by other reviewers. I think it helped that our reservation was early, at 6:30, and we arrived and they seated us even earlier. Given that we didn't order apps, our entree (the aforementioned duck) didn't take any longer to arrive than it would have anywhere else. Just enough time to have a nice conversation with my husband (yep, we do that) over a Tsing Tao for him and a sauvignon blanc for me. I think it is wise for us American born and bred folks to approach this place as we would if dining in another country: Be excited about having a new experience, don't stress out because you don't speak the predominant language (and not vice versa) and might have to do some pointing and charades to communicate, and order anything described as a specialty. If you wind up with something different or in a different quantity than you thought you were ordering, ride the wave and you might just have a great ride and a fun story. A friend and I accidentally wound up with 8 egg rolls at a Chinese restaurant in Paris, but is that really such a bad thing?
