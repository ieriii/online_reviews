This place definitely satisfied my craving for good, authentic Mexican food. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and although it is a small place and there were lots of people there, we didn't have to wait for a table. The server was attentive and very friendly. The margaritas were tasty - I had a mango margarita. I ordered the shredded beef flautas and I was hoping it would compare to the ones I'm used to back in So California. These flautas were delicious! My dinner companions enjoyed their dinner just as much as I did. It was a pretty cheap and affordable place with a laid back, no frills kind of atmosphere. I'm glad I have a place to go now the next time I have a craving for delicious Mexican food.
