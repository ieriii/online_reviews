Take it from a true Italian-- I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend it. My grandma would have an absolute fit if I brought her here. This place is just not worth the time, effort, or money.... and trust me, you will spend a lot in all three categories if you come here.  My bf and I arrived about 5 minutes early for our reservation at 9:30pm (Saturday), and one of the hostesses told us that it would be a couple of minutes (HA) and that we could go have a drink at the bar if we were interested. This was fine, except that the place was so crowded that you could hardly see the bar. We were pretty much forced to hover over people who were dining/drinking.  After standing around for 25+ minutes, my bf went to the hostess to kindly ask her how much longer it would be. She replied that there was "no way to know" and that there were other parties in front of us but refused to tell us how many. Here is the best part... as we were in the middle of speaking to her (kindly) she cut us off, pointed to the bar and again said "you can have a drink at the bar." It was as if she was programmed (to suck) and had no customer service abilities. She could see the bar and she knew darn well that it was way too packed for us to even have a chance at getting a drink. She was extremely rude and we were appalled. Unacceptable. The other hostess came over about an hour after we arrived for our reservation and offered us a random table set up in the middle of the crowded walkway that we HAD to decline. We were finally seated at a decent table shortly after. Food: Appetizers: Squash soup= Fantastic. Tri Colore salad= Very good.  Entrees: Gnocchi: Ick... bland, boring, waste of calories. Pasta with mushrooms and truffle oil: Terrible. Also very bland...how can anything with truffle oil involved be tasteless? I'm still confused about that.  Our waiter was very good... definitely the best part of our experience.
