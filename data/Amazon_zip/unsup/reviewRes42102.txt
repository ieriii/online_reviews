This place is awesome, and definitely gave me a good impression of the Chicago dining scene. The cocktails are well made with fresh ingredients. The bone marrow appetizer is definitely worth adventuring out of your comfort zone to try. Mussels and the truffle pasta are both delicious as well. Be sure to make a reservation, because they are very strict about seating.
