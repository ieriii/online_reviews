I love how this place has $8 hot dogs and they get away with it... I've even tried a few of their special dogs and honestly speaking... I never thought I'd pay more than $2-3 for a hot dog... no matter what kind of meat or cheese was on it. Overall, this place is unique and their dogs are great. Their cheese fries are my favorite... I don't think I've been there without ordering it. A few things that annoys me is that there is : 1. there is a line out the door almost every single day and the wait is close to 30-40 minutes (I timed myself). I went on a really nasty rainy day thinking there wouldn't be a line and to my amazement... the line was still there. 2. It's open from 10-4pm mon-sat. 3. it's cash only. 4. You can easily spend too much money here. Not only are their specialty dogs expensive, but after waiting in that long ass line, you feel the need to make it count. If you don't mind waiting in line for 30 minutes to get a hot dog, definitely go and try it. As for me, the long lines, inconvenient hours, and cash only policy (i never carry cash... I believe in the debit card system) keep me from coming here more often and I live a block away... but maybe the fact that I can't get it whenever I want makes it that much more appealing. Whatever the case, if you haven't tried it yet, make sure you stop by and if you're turned off by the long lines, try going there right around 3:45pm... just don't be late cause they will shut you out.
