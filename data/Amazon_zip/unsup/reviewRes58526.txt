Well my girlfriend and I dined here the other day. Not gonna lie, Great steaks on a plate. Simply as that. If you have a taste for quality steaks with nice flavor and cooked to your preference, I would highly suggest dining here.If your a super health nut I would not advise, but if youd like to endulge a flavorful night you definitely will leave satisfied. Pretty much how I felt after.So to sum it up in simplier terms. If you share the my views on a nice dinner. Try Mastro's.
