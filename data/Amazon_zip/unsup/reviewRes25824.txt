As a Chicago native, I've tried just about all the mainstream pizza this city has to offer and Pequod's is definitely high on the list. Luckily they are close by and in delivery range, otherwise, it might could be a trek depending on where you live (although I think they have an outpost in the northern burbs).  I always order a deep dish with garlic with some randomn combination of veggies. I do notice the pizza seems a little bland w/o the garlic, imo. Not to heavy on the cheese, which makes this pizza a little lighter than most deep dish, and as many have mentioned before, the caramelized crust is really delicious and unique to Pequod's - they have it down pat! If your hankerin' for some chi-town pizza, give Pequod's a go!
