meh. i wasnt a huge fan of my drink and the s'mores tart left much to be improved (too thick/rich chocolate, marshmallows not gooey enough, not enough graham cracker), but the sweet potato fries, ambiance, and ability to seat 12 at 8:30 pm on a saturday made me think i should give this place a second chance.
