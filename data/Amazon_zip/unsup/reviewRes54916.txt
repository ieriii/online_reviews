I came here with my husband about a week ago and loved almost everything... The Kobe meatballs were awesome!! Service was just good not great it kinda took a while for drinks, and it was just beer. So... I was looking forward to the marrow - it was the most disappointing dish. Just flat flavor - missing something. But the fried clam things - loved it!! I will absolutely go back!!
