I love this place. Me and a friend go here all the time and are obsessed with the chili nachos and chicken fingers. The best thing of all is the desert, if your going to order anything from this place make sure you save room for the cookie sunday or the cookie sequel. It will be by far the best $5 dessert you will ever have, guaranteed. Other than the food, the service is always attentive, and you can't not love the tacky 70's decor that hasn't been changed or probably dusted in years.
