My wife and I decided on Bonsoiree for our first anniversary dinner, and it turned out to be a perfect choice. The dining room is small, comfortable, and intimate. Two servers appeared to be handling the restaurant, and they were very seamless, friendly, and always there when needed - yet not overbearing. The BYOB, no corkage fee, feature was wonderful, and not something you're likely to find in another restaurant of this caliber. We ate the four course dinner, on a "no-menu Sunday" and each course was exquisite. Seasonal, creative, and surprising - it was the kind of meal that had us discussing which elements were likely purchased that morning at the Logan Square farmer's market (the majority, according to our server), and then, later, trying to decide which course was our favorite. It was tough deciding, but I think my fave was the opener - pan-seared Suzuki served over haricots verts and sorrel leaves, with crumbled, toasted nori, pickled radishes, and a scoop of rhubarb sorbet! Really interesting, delicate dish. We'll definitely be wanting to go back for a regular menu evening to see what it's like, but we would really recommend the no-menu Sunday. It's surprisingly fun to just arrive, sit down, begin talking and drinking some wine, and not think once about what to order. I have no problem spending some time with a great menu, but give this a try.
