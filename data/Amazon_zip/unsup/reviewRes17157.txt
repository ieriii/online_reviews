Having heard that this ranks among the top picks of many Indians I know in the city, I ventured to try this restaurant out and I was a trifle disappointed with the dinner here. What I did like immensely was their appetizer dip options and the bread (naan) - both as a side as well as an app. The curries (at least the couple I tried) were bland and unappealing and while the menu is extensive, not sure that it does justice to the authenticity of Indian cooking. The service was great and quick (which was a boon considering I was famished when I landed up here), the hot moistening napkins are great to rid your fingers of the food flavors - more Indian joints need to subscribe to this practice. Haven't written off this place entirely, but as far as first impressions go, India house doesn't make the cut for me 7/3/08 - What is that they say about first impressions?! Deceiving sometimes - perhaps! Been to India House a few times for lunch since this first post, and am seeing this place in a whole new light now. An extensive spread, that's light on the spice and grease - my type of pick. My favorite Indian food is still the home cooked kind but the House on Grand is making it's way up there.
