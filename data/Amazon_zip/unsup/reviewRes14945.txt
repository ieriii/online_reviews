This is a classic Italian place. Good value for all the food you get. The host greeted us a little roughly but I think it was because the place was extremely busy. Before we convinced him we had a reservation, he was prepared to tell us "sorry, no way". This was a Saturday around 6:00 PM. After that, there was plenty of food, good prices, and good wine. The rooms were filled to capacity the entire time we were there. I enjoyed the food and had plenty to take home too.
