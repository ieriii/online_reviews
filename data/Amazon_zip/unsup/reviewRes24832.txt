contrary to the survey answers, i would say this place is $$ instead of the $ it is given. that said: their plates are generous and i left full. of course, i probably shouldn't have stuffed myself with their greasy chips and amazing salsas. i had the potato tacos that, while yummy, seemed rather uninspired. the mister had chile rellano, which once again--though it hit the spot--seemed to be lacking in something. irazu still gets four stars bc the food, whether inspired or not, is authentic, fresh, flavorful and filling. there are lots of fresh veggies on the plates as well. i love how crowded and cozy the restaurant is and it's hard to beat BYOB. this is not a place for groups or for intimate dining.
