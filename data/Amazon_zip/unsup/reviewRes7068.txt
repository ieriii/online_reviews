This should be 4.5. I was very excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint. The food was 5 stars. Loved the pickles (so good I brought a jar home), potato chips, baby back ribs, key lime pie. I can't wait to go back to try more things (though it would be hard not to have all of those again). I love getting 4 sauces to choose from and the spicy one is great. I tried the brisket, which was good, but it didn't move me. Fries and coleslaw were solid too. I liked the braised greens with the vinegar, but that would be the first one I would give up the next time. The chocolate mousse pie was not bad, but a little disappointing. There are very nice drink options if you like beer and bourbon, and some interesting mixed drinks. I really liked the mint julep. My only complaint is the service was not very good. We had two waiters and half the service. They were nice, but took a long time to come around as the restaurant got more full.
