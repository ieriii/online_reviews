it's been nearly a week since my crisp experience and i can't stop thinking of the sass that seoul sassy sauce gave me. it's zesty, tangy, and surely has seoul. truly finger lickin' good. i got the three piece tender meal with fries and a bev. not only was i given FOUR tenders (by accident or on purpose..not sure. but didn't complain, either), i was super impressed with the ginormous bed of fries sitting in my basket! om nom!! my dining companion got the baby buddha bowl and was nice enough to let me try it. dee-ee-licious! she subbed brown rice for regular and it totally heightened the experience. aldon is such a sweet guy and that always makes customers feel comfortable and at home. can't wait to come back and try all of what crisp has to offer.
