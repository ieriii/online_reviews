shaw's gets a pretty mixed bag review from me... despite only being willing to shed out three stars to this place, i still highly recommend checking it out on the condition that you know what you're doing when you put you're order in. we're all aware that good seafood is hard to come by in chicago... so for maximum happiness, here's my advice: only order food that is still alive until it is cooked and served to you. fish & chips = yes, definitely alaskan king crab legs = hell no, don't do it... don't even fancy the idea oysters = yes, yes and yes... order more! lobster bisque = pass, it's not bad nor good cajun shrimp = disgusting parmesan crusted haddock = very good basil mojito = good and strong the service was excellent and i like the old school atmosphere at the oyster bar. no complaints there. i'll definitely be back for oysters and drinks. ps please don't be fooled by the name, this is NOT the place to order crab in any form.
