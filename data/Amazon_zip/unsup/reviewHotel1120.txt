I've actually never been in the Fairmont Hotel until I attended a wedding here last night. The wedding was beautiful and I was very impressed with the hotel. It was an absolutely gorgeous ballroom that was elegant and simple so you can do a lot with it. I haven't seen any of the guest rooms, but I"ve heard they are very nice as well.
