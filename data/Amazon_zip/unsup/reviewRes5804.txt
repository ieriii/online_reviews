Let me start by saying this is where my girl choose for my birthday (as well as a friend who's birthday is the same day) and I couldn't have had a better experience!!! The decor was rustic Italian (which I love) and was very warm and inviting. This little wine bar is a great place for a large group to share many different plates (both small and large) for a very reasonable price (our food was less than $20 per person with tip!). I definitely will be going back!
