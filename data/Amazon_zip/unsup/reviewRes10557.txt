First time dining at Piccolo was tonight with my wife and good friends. We were all impressed and looking forward going back. Its fine dining Italian Food that doesn't disappoint. At our table we had the frites to start off with which were great and for entrees we were passing around our dishes for each to try. We had the Ravioli, Lamb Meatballs with wide noodles, Lamb Chops and Short Braised Ribs. Each dish was amazing...Great atmosphere and ambiance...enjoy
