To kick off my birthday weekend celebration my co-workers and I went to the Grand Lux for lunch. I'd heard about it, some raving and some luke warm, from the various lunch bunch members, but wanted to see for myself. Word to the wise - don't go here for office lunch. There's not enough time or space in your pants for this restaurant on a work day. Every one knows already about the Paul Bunyan sized portions, menu and dining rooms - but do you yet know of the fried dough ball things? I believe their actual name is beignet. They come 7 to an order, warm, smothered in powdered sugar with 3 dipping sauces (chocolate, raspberry and the heavenly whiskey cream). Don't even bother with actual food if you want to indulge, just order dessert.  The dining room is big and kinda pretty in a white-bread, cheesecake factory, pseudo opulence kind of way. The view is nice though, especially on a sunny day. Our waiter was quick, attentive, smelled nice and talked to me about modern activism and books. I won't probably rush back to Grand Lux, because it's just not my style - I'm much more down-home, hold-the-mayo, hippie-if you please, but I can understand other people flipping for it here.
