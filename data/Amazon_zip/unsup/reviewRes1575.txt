Don't kill me for not giving it five stars... So I took my dad here in February, he had no idea what it was and we waited in line for over an hour. I swore after that I would never go back because it was just OK.... But when a avid foodie friend came to visit he insisted that we needed to go. You would have thought I learned my "line" lesson the first time but no, we ended up waiting almost two hours. I don't know if it was the excitement of my guest, my grumbling stomach or the fact that it was really great but the second time was AMAZING. Almost well worth the wait. The duck fat fries are wonderful and the dogs are original and delish. The line maybe the only downfall but it can be avoided if you get there early!
