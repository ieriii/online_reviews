I just got back from dinner at The Gage with my roommate. The place was packed, the food was delicious, and the service was quick and cute. He even showed us his tattoos - "Passion" on one forearm, and "Humility" on the other. You can't really buy wine by the glass - either get a bottle or a carafe, and if you only want a carafe (about 2 glasses worth), you've got a limited selection. The menu has plenty of small dishes to choose from, as well as the main courses. I just had an appetizer (chosen from the course 3 list) - a delicious goat cheese tart with mushrooms on top - and a side dish - winter squash with bacon. Yum! My roommate had a FANTASTIC risotto (she gave me a bite - good roomie!)
