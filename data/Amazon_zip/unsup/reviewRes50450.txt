Mediorcre food, pretty bad service, loud and annoying ambiance. The brightly colored walls assualted my pupils as I walked in off the street. My homies were here and I was meeting them. They do not know I am a Yelp elite, and there are plenty of places I could have recommended, but alas they tried to strike out on their own and do the picking. They struck out alright. I came and sat as they were finishing up, not once did I get approached by anyone A) For a drink. (it was 100+ degrees outside) b) With a menu (I literally will eat anyting, anywhere.) C) To even ask if I wanted anything. (Don't they sell stuff here?) I just sat and watched my friends labour through their meals with an all knowing smile on my face. They glanced up at me quickly because they knew what I was thinking, wack. Wack attack. I decided to try something off their plates cuz they were done and I wanted to get the taste of what they had, I sampled: Andouille Benedict: this was good Crab cake benedict: This was gross and fishy tasting, obv crab from a can. Finally after 20 minutes of sitting and stewing, the waitress came by & asked if I wanted anything. No thanks, just the check. Then another 12 minutes and the check came. Bleh, I may be back.
