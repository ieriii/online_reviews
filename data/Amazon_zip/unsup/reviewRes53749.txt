Ok!1 so I went back with my friend for his birthday and there was a crowd of us again. This time it was a million times better. I didn't feel uncomfortable being there. It was a Tuesday night and the Lady playing the piano and singing with her very fun band was amazing. I think they play there every Tuesday night. I will go back to see them again. This time was 10 times better and the bar man was such fun and a delight to talk too. I can't remember his name but he had a beard and glasses I think. He opened the hatch to the down stairs so we could lean over the bar and look down into some history. So cool!!
