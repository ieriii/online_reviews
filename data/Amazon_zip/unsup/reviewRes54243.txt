They've got a vegetarian burrito that will ruin all other burritos for you forever. If you are not a fan of mushrooms, zucchini, and plantains in your burrito (I know a lot of you freaks are out there) then you will still be satisfied. Their menu has something for everyone.This place has one chill atmosphere, too. It is great coming here in the summer time.My only VERY REAL complaint is that every single time I've come here, they either forget to put Jalepenos in my burrito (which is the case 90% of the time) or so many jalepenos that you can't taste anything else. I would recommend asking for jalepenos on the side, though, you might have to ask more than once.But definitely go, it is BYOB, and there is an excellent liquor store conveniently located across the street. It is also cash only, but (also conveniently) there is an ATM inside.
