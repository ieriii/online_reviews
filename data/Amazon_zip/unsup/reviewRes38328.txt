I'm not a big deep-dish pizza fan so take that into account when reading my review but the pizza was fine. We ate at the bar since the wait was 40-50 minutes which when added to the 40 minute wait to cook the pizza makes for too long of a wait! It's not a pie that I would order all the time but maybe every once in awhile.
