5 Stars? Are you kidding? Wishbone is one of those places that you see that looks like it may be a comfortable git. The prices seems reasonable on first glance, the menu looks appealing, the location works out pretty well and parking doesn't seem to be much of an issue.  In other words it has a lot of potential. Unfortunately it falls far short of being satisfying. Despite several visits to this location over the years (I work nearby and coworkers sometimes want to go here out of convenience more than anything) this restaurant simply is not good. Let's start with the food itself. Especially considering it is southern food it is very bland tasting, doesn't always seem well prepared (veggies are soggy, main dishes are dried out), and it has consistently been this way for a couple years.  Now if the food was great you'd still have to deal with the service. It is horrible. Simply dreadful. It is slow, the servers seem to be consistently understaffed, and when you do get a chance to talk to a severe they are not particularly skilled at their profession. They have gotten my order wrong on several occasions or will simply disappear for up to 30 minutes at a time. Any place I have to get up and go to a wait station to refill my own water because my waiter decided to take a break while I was eating is going to get less than 3 stars no matter how good anything else is. In Chicago there are so many legitimately great places to eat that I simply do not understand why people put up with a truly mediocre to bad place like Wishbone. There are just so many other better alternatives.
