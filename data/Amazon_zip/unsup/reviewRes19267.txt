This place is like a fast food upgrade of sorts. I literally thought to myself at one point in the night that I was in a classier Chipotle. Now, don't get me wrong - this Rick Bayless birthchild is a solid choice for good Mexican dining. Just don't expect to have a well-ambienced, sit-down dinner. Food: I was very please with my choice of the Pepito (from the Tortas section). This sandwich with braised Tallgrarss shortribs, caramelized onion, artisan Jack, black beans, and pickled jalapenos was a delight. My homies Cory and Carol went with the Ahogada and the Gunthorp Chicken, and we were all pleased. Topped off with some chips and salsa/guac, and churros for dessert, this eating experience was a good one. With a beer included, I spent about $20 for the meal. Ambience: not a large seating area, but great salsa music. Definitely try it out if you're in downtown Chicago...
