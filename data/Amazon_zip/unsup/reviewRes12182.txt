I sometimes sneak back to my hood....the Windy city, as I've done this weekend and visited a restaurant that my friends had been talking about for a while. Cafe 28 is a Cuban/Mexican establishment that provides a significant amount of seating area both inside and outside the restaurant.  Decor is simple with a mixture of some traditional and modern art, but there is nothing about the decor that stands out, but the food is another matter. From fresh hand made mojitos, to fresh cervecia, to the steaming and spicy Calmo (fajitas). Servers were attentive and we even had a little dessert which was a 3 flour cake that was to die for and I recommend you try it if you are a dessert person. My best friend and I came in around 7pm, but there was plenty of seating both inside and outside and we were seated immediately. NOTE: Maybe it was just my imagination, but this place had, on a Thursday night, just about ALL women? Not sure what that was all about, but a nice little bonus to the evening...at least from a people watching perspective.
