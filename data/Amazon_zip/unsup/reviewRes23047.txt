Hot dog joints are a dime a dozen in Chicago but Superdawg stands alone. It's crazy that an actual "drive in" dining establishment still stands here in 2009 but Superdawg still sits at Milwaukee and Devon just like I remember it as a kid. Dogs and drinks come to your car window in a cool box with the fries and are IMO the best it town. Always best to eat them immediatly, if you take them to go the fries and bun can get a bit soggy after 15 minutes.
