A BYOB Cuban place is pretty much a slam dunk in my book. Went here with a group of 5, we ordered a TON of food, brought our own booze, and left spending about $30 a person. Cannot complain about that. Plus the food was delicious, although I was not a fan of the goat cheese empanada (too sweet). I have been eating Cuban food a long time, and the rice and beans here was as good as anything I've had in Little Havana and quite probably the best in Chicago. The menu is quite extensive, and I am looking forward to going back so I can try my favorite Puerto Rican jibarito sandwich. If that's a success 90 Miles will be moving into 5 star land.
