My friend and I have eaten here about 5 times since they've been open. We come back for the food. It's very reliable- not stupendous but good. It often reminds me of the food you get at good trattorias in Italy - similar deep classic flavors. We are bad at making reservations so we end up waiting a fair amount if we get in at all. Last time we waited in the tiny bar almost an hour. We were finally seated and our wine at the bar was comped which was very nice. But THEN, we find that our waiter always seems to be the guy I affectionately call Waiter-From-Hell. Honestly, he is like something out of an SNL skit - unsmiling and bothered by everyone, he is unfailingly rude, unhelpful, and doesn't even do his job very well, yet for some reason he has been there the whole time they have been in business. As I read every review here which complains about service, my guess is it's always HIM...he is a large guy, stocky, 40-something with glasses and a big attitude. Everyone else there is FINE. I wish someone at Anteprima would get a clue - this guy is the worst fully-employed waiter in town. After all these years, all we do is laugh when we get him. I wish I could tell him that my friend is normally a very big tipper --- just not at Anteprima!
