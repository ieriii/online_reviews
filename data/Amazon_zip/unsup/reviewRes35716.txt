The best oysters in the City! I'm an oyster snob and Shaws has the best ones around -- they are CLEAN (I hate eating the grit), juicy and tasteful. And their dipping sauce with the vinegar is the bomb.... If you're an oyster newbie or long time fan, I recommend trying their oysters.. Their tuna tar tar is really great too as it has a lime sauce with it that makes it great! The service has always been fabulous too -- prompt and friendly.
