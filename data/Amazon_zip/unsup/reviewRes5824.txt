We went here because our hotel gave us a voucher for a free appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip. Great advertising technique of behalf of the restaurant because we might have never known about the place without it. The feeling when you walk in really is like a 1940s steakhouse. Great ambience! The waiter was friendly and gave great service. The appetizer was good and so was the french onion soup, although a fairly small portion for a cup of soup. We split the turkey burger and that was very good. All the different types of steak on the menu sounded delicious! However, I was eating with someone who doesn't eat steak and knew I would be unable to finish one on my own but next time I am making it my mission to try one. The server assistants who fill your water glass make sure the glass is never not filled to the rim with water, which is nice but sometimes a little annoying when someone reaches in front of you every five minutes to make sure you drink all of Lake Michigan during your visit. Overall, we had a great experience here. The food tasted good and the atmosphere was awesome.
