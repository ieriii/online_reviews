This place is good - great food, nice atmosphere, the lounge is awesome.That said, the staff is one of the rudest i've ever come across, ever. I work in the neighborhood, and every single time i've walked into alliance the person at the counter - actually, the PEOPLE at the counter - have consistently ignored me, not given eye contact, been entirely unresponsive, etc... I don't know if this is the store's appeal to the hipster contingent, but I've lived in several cities and Alliance is the only place that can stick out in recent memory with a staff this obnoxious. Since the place is nice and reasonably priced and the food is delicious, i can't give it a low rating... but man, hopefully they'll hire some more pleasant people than they have now!
