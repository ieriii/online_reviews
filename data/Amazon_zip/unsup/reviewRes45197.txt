After reading in Chicago magazine that this was a "best new restaurant," I was psyched to go for some good Italian. The angry critics at yelp, who never cease to find fault with any place, gave me pause in my choice to take Dad to Anteprima for father's day. Turns out, there's a reason that professional food critics exist - this restaurant is great. The atmosphere is super comfortable. The service was informal and intelligent. Every thing I tasted was awesome, and just different enough to edge this place above the generic Italian food that's so easy to find in this city. I found it to be overall quite reasonable as well. The pork was delicious, cooked beautifully. All the pastas were fantastic, with inventive use of ingredients that tasted familiar yet new. The berry tart for dessert was lightweight and tasty. The family can't wait to go back, and neither can I.
