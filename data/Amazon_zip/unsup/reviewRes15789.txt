Do you know in those annoying e-mail/Facebook quizzes where you fill out things like what you'd take to a desert island, who was your first kiss, etc.? When they ask for what I'd choose to be my last meal on earth, I will have a hard time deciding between Calo's gnocci asiago and gnocci con ricotta. The food here is put-you-in-a-bliss-induced-coma good. I also love the atmosphere. The south side of the place is romantic and candle-lit, while the north side is like a classy pizza bar. The service has always been top-notch. They also deliver, and SUPER fast.
