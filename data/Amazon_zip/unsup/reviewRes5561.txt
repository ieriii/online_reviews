I'm only giving this 3 stars because I think I didn't order the best items on the menu and am willing to give it one more try. My friend and I ordered several items, but our unanimous favorite was the butternut squash appetizer, believe it or not. We also tried the sepia, pork fried almonds, Insalata Bianca, prosciutto bread balls, and deviled eggs.  All of those were fine, maybe even pretty good, but we were not blown away. The prosciutto bread balls were even kind of too salty. Like I said, one more try and that's it.
