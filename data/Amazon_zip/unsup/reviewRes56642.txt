The food was decent at best, their portions relative to price are all over the place. Some cheaper items have a nicer portion and are better tasting than some items that are very expensive and small portions for tapas style food. Food was extremly slow coming out and we went during lunch on a weekday when it wasn't that busy so I can only imagine what the service is like when it gets busy. The place was avergage at best.
