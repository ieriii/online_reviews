I've been here twice. Both times with Yelpers. I enjoyed both visits mainly because of the company I was with. I had the same waitress both times, and she and the entire staff was very friendly and quick.  However, the food here is on the pricey side, especially given the quality of it. To say that it isn't the greatest Mexican food is putting it lightly. You can get better Mexican food else where.  It does get really loud in the back dining room, too. Mayan Palace might actually be the loudest restaurant that I've been to that didn't have have a DJ or a bar for people to hangout at. With all that said, I would still come back here with my friends on a Tuesday and/or Thursday for their excellent service and to enjoy the half price margaritas ($4).
