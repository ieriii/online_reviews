Giving that I was the last customer of the night, making it inside the building right before kitchen closed; I loved the food and the service was fantastic. I asked for a steak and asked for veggies instead of the potoates. Yes, I was a complicated last minute customer. Yes the food was fresh, yummy, and had me wanting more the next day.  I am letting the world know to go try this place! I love Cuban Food and I give this place a huge thumbs up!!!!!!! They are even exxtending the restuarant to make room for more customers, this place is really a big hit! Go check it out..... Thanks to the staff that made my dinner enjoyable and for being accommodating! You Guys Rock! Keep up your customer service and delicous dishes. Your business will keep on booming...
