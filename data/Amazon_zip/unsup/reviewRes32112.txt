The kitfo - ethiopian style steak tartar seasoned with herbed butter sauce and hot-spiced chili powder (mitmita). served tere (raw) is a definite MUST TRY!! The waitstaff are friendly and the location/parking is not bad. The bathroom can use another stall but overall the whole experience was pleasant - thanks!
