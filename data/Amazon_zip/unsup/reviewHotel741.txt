We stay here 90% of the time while in Chicago.  *It's an excellent location that is a $15 cab ride from just about everything *Good bar *Nice food in the bar...chicken pot pie! *Great beds *Clean lobby *Updated look to the rooms *Solid workout room *Attentive staff As long as it's under $300 per night, the Westin is an excellent value. And I got some!
