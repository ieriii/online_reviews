the beer menu is amazing... a little overwhelming to the average beer drinker.. The first visit, I tried pork belly with black eyed peas which was amazing! Both times i had some variation of a beet salad, which was also set up beautifully.. This last trip i tried the half farm chicken.. which was dry and bland and bad.. so maybe stick with pork products.? 12/14/09 Publican Brunch i went with 4 of my friends and everyone was amazed with all their food even the vegan guy. I want to kick myself for not getting a side of bacon though... i saw our neighbor's and i was drooling, seriously it's like 2 inches thick. meatastic!
