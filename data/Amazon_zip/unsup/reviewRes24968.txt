So not aware this was one of Chicago's "most romantic restaurants" a friend of mine and I went here... as the only non-romance relationship in the room. Well... there's the cheese. It smells. And not like delicious artisan cheeses, but the kind that smell old and... gassy. And it sticks to your clothes for days. I don't get the fondue hype. Their cheeses weren't super good, the wine menu seemed outdated, and their chocolate fondue was overkill. I saw a cute wine bar next door. DEF going there instead.
