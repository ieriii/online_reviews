Brunch was good, and the stop by on our way back home after shopping for the s'mores shake was even better! Egg/Potato mexican soyrizo dish special - good, but nothing out of this world Fresh Juice - carrot, beets, spinach, kale and apple. Weird and earthy, but fun to try. I think no kale next time. We felt good about getting some veggies in though! U-pick the veggies and fruit you want. S'mores shake - out of this world! The thickest, richest shake ever! Can't wait to get it again! Price: fresh juice and shake were pricey (like $7 ea), but if you feel like splurging they were tasty.
