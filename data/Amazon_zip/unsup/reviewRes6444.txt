It aint easy getting 5 stars out of me...without question this place gets it. Fast service, awesome food, great ambiance. Had the filet trio with different crusts and couldnt be happier (the baked potato crust was very good). The au gratin was top notch. I was really surprised with this place mainly because it was a pretty casual place...if you're in Chicago and cant eat anymore pizza, then you have to come here
