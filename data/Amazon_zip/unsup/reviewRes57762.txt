The Third Coast is home for me and my friends. We have met here so many times. I think we usually say we are meeting for coffee, but we always have a meal.  The coffee is good. The roasted carrot soup is fantastic!  The breakfasts are excellent. Some people are saying the prices are high, but to me, they seem as low as you are going to find in a regular restaurant. Most of the meals are in the $10 to $15 range and well worth it. I have been here so many times, I cannot imagine not having this place to go to. It is our automatic go-to spot. It is good for adults. I would not recommend it for people with kids. It is not that kind of place. It is good for meeting and talking or going by yourself and thinking or something.  To me, it is just a perfect place all -around. Great music, great vibes, nice tables, an ever-changing display of real art on the walls. One thing? They used to have a good guitarist-singer who would come in one night a week. They should bring back live music. It was fun to fall in after a night out and have a glass of wine and listen to some live music.
