I'm always nervous to take non-vegetarians to vegetarian restaurants. I know that if the meat-eaters hate the food, then I'll be criticized (even more than usual) for just being a vegetarian.  However, Chicago Diner was so good that I was the star of lunch!  Someone at work told me I had to try the Radical Ruben and I did just that. It was so delicious that I didn't know what to do with myself. My boyfriend's mom said she knew I liked the food because I ate like a pig.  I definitely need to go back because they have tons of yummy looking dishes on the menu that I need to try.
