Pictures on their website are deceiving. Rooms are small and elevators are sloooooowwwwww. I understand its an older hotel, but with sites like Yelp, hotels need to make sure that every inch of their hotel is somewhat perfect.  Reviews can hurt a business and its always best to make sure every area meets the customers satisfaction. Remember to request any floor below 4 or 5, because you can avoid the elevators and just walk. The lounge area was nice and our bartender/server was knowledgeable of the hotel.  Will I go back. NO! I'd rather pay more and stay in a hotel with a view.
