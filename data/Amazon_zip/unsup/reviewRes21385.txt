Oh Superdawg. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Well first, I'll cover the food. It's not a Chicago style dog, but it's really similar. The dog itself is a jumbo sized beef frank, which is perfectly steamed, along with the poppy seed bun. The toppings are onions, mustard, pickle, relish, green tomato, and sport peppers (I like mine minus the relish). The fries are crinkle cut and although they do get a little mushy in the box with the Superdawg, they are still delicious. Absurdly, I almost always get mine with a diet Coke. But you can get shakes and malts-both are delicious-or root beer floats. In recent years, I have tried the super veggies, which are battered and fried and include creamed corn. Nuggets of CREAMED CORN. I ask you? Also on my list are the tamales-both a tube and a bunch (a bunch are 4 small tubes) and the Superburger. Now, for the emotions. Superdawg, for me, has been the site of several dates (usually ill-fated, but romantic none the less), fights (it's easy since you're in your car), make ups (no, not like that), and long talks. It's also been a place to go alone for some quiet contemplation and reflection. Sometimes, if I've had a bad day or I'm facing a hard decision, I'll drive up to Superdawg, get some tasty food, and just think, while basking in the neon. Somehow it helps. You may never use Superdawg in the way I have, but I assure you it's worth it for the food. Also, make sure to grab hold of your tray before you open the door to flip the switch. I have almost never not dropped mine in the 15 or so years I've been going. But that could just be me.
