My review is a bit biased, as I never ate any meal at XOCO other than breakfast. That being said, pairing Intelligentsia coffee with a chorizo egg torta or ginger lime muffin is mid-morning heaven. I'd eat that meal every day if I could. It's also nice to eat Mexican food for breakfast that isn't limited to the heavily Americanized versions you find at most other places.
