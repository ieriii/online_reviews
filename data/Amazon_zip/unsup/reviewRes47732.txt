Dinner was soo great Saturday night, I woke up and went to their brunch Sunday morning! It was like dying and going to Food Heaven. The dinner menu included the most amazing, succulent waygu beef, sensational buttermilk sirloin, flavorful snapper, tantalizing lamb, tastebud bursting crabcakes, delectable Moroccan chicken, and mind-numbing dessert, home-made strawberry ice cream with marscapone or s'mores pie... their cheese biscuits with tangerine butter are sooo good they make you want to drive to Texas or wherever your mama lives, and slap her! I ate a whole tray of the biscuits before the food even showed up! The moscato, which generally I am not crazy about, is phenomenal with the food. ...Brunch..... Brunch needs a new name, beholden to Zed all its own. $3 mimosas. cinnamon sugar donuts. Bacon. egg benedict corn beef hash. spicy chicken and waffle. tomato basil egg fritata. duck confit hash browns. Steel cut oatmeal. French toast. egg benedict crab cake. in addition to the meat selection!!!! And not just good food... DE LI ICIOUS food. Slap me... I think I'm in heaven. AMAZING FOOD. GREAT SERVICE. BEAUTIFUL AMBIANCE AND NO WAIT (because its Brazillian style)!!!! There is frankly nothing more that you can ask for from a restaurant. If you think you can find better, you're lying!
