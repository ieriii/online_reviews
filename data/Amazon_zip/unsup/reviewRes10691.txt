Just not feeling the love and devotion this place garners... maybe I am missing something? As I don't do lines I have never been on a weekend re... dic... ulous wait times seem to be the norm on the weekend. Based on the apparent amazingness of the place and my love of breakfast as the best meal of the day I had to give it a try. Food - Meh you got 3 stars because you gave me 5 pieces of bacon, the "up" eggs were runny enough, and the English muffin was great but man o' man those potatoes dragged the review down. I am resigned to the fact that Chefs want to elevate the lowly hash brown for some reason but this was a poor rendition. Pieces were too big, seasoning was off complemented by far too much black pepper on some of the chunks. Service - nothing to write home about. Not like I was ignored but my coffee cup & water glass did sit empty a few times with the number of people milling around behind the counter it's not like there was a shortage of staff.
