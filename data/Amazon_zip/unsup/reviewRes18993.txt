The Slow Burn burger I had at the Bad Apple was better than the meal I had at Easter brunch with my family earlier that day. Got off work kind of late for a Sunday and was real hungry. Sat up at the bar, chilled out and I was able to have one of the better burgers in the city. Cooked perfectly medium rare how I like it, all of the flavors on this burger melded together perfectly, w/o overpowering each other. All in all, an outstanding burger. Kudos to you Pat LaFrieda
