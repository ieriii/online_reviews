I used to live right down the street from good old Glenn's. Nothing like tasty diner food to brighten up gray Chicago. The Reuben is awesome! the salads are good and the Seafood specials are pretty good too. Can't complain! it's a nice place in the neighborhood to go! If and when it's nice and sunny sitting outside on the patio is very nice and they even let me tie my dog to the fence and brought him water! Big plus!I actually Miss it now that I moved back to California.
