Not that this place needs my review, but I have been to Piccolo Sogno twice. It is up the street from my office and is nothing short of fantastic. I agree with Ricky, it is one of the best restaurants in Chicago, hands down. The ambience is perfect, semi-formal to formal without being pretentious. It's relaxing and enjoyable, the service was perfect both times, and as a former waiter (who wasn't at one time or another!) one can tell they have a working system. The food is incredible, INCREDIBLE. The risotto is exquisite! It's just the right consistency (so hard to do well!), the flavors combine beautifully. The olive oil and bread served at the tables is enough for a meal unto itself! The presentation and portions are perfect.  Piccolo Sogno clearly demonstrates that the secret to a fine dining experience is discovering and executing consistently, perfect balance and harmony of flavors, menu items, ambience, service, wine-list that isn't too pretentious, and portion.  Bravo!
