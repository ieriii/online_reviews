Best. Burgers. In. City. Yes, IMO it beats Kumas. Been here twice and the burgers were cooked to perfection and very juicy. Decided to try the Elvis burger (I mean with peanut butter and bacon, can you really go wrong?!). It was amazing. Simple, but amazing. The beer list rivals any in the city. Go here...but expect to wait for a table.
