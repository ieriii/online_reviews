My wife and I ate at Schwa for her birthday, this review is many months late. First off, all the reviewers who complained about the difficulty getting reservations here clearly didn't have to same level of food-related persistence that I do. I called an embarrassing number of times to get a reservation here, probably two dozen times. The majority of the time no one picked up the phone, when someone did, I think it was Michael Carlson. I got several reasons why he could not make the reservations even when he picked up the phone, that they were busy, or didn't have the "book" and that I should call back later, man. When I saw the bare bones operations at the restaurant later I understood. We showed up on time for our 5:30 reservation and the host/waiter/ front of the house seemed very surprised we were there. The whole place smelled like they had just been smoking pot. The restaurant is dark and the decor is fairly minimal, clearly the place is only about the food. I can't remember everything we ate, but the octopus, "biscuits and gravy" dish with sweetbreads, quail egg pasta were amazing. They made a corn soup that tasted like the most delicious elotes I've ever had. The portion sizes were actually large for a tasting menu, and the composed plates were beautiful to look at. My main complaint about the food is that almost every dish tended to very rich and a little too sweet. My wife is a pescetarian, and they were nice enough to accommodate her dietary restrictions. There's only one waiter in there, who is very nice but is constantly hustling to serve the food. He told us about every dish, but spoke so fast half of the time we had no idea what he said. They were also playing mid-school hip hop so loudly I could barely hear my wife across the table. Go to Schwa. It's definitely a very different dining experience, and I think well worth the effort it takes to go.
