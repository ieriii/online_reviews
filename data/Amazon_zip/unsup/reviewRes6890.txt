Sapori Trattoria is ***In Mr. Burns (from The Simpson's) voice*** "EHHHHHXCELLENT" Can't believe I lived by this place for almost a year while I was in school and never visited. Glad my girl and I came here after a hard days work. We were seated just before the dinner crowd showed up, so that was a plus. While they're a bit more expensive than I'd prefer, they deliver finely executed classical Italian cuisine. The atmospheres a little crowded, but I've been to a lot of Italian places like that. So i personally am not bothered by sitting close to other patrons. I like how deep the restaurant goes and the dark wood flooring and furniture. Their patio is open when weather permits, so that has to be a real treat. Especially if you can catch some live music. Their antipasti's and insaltae's are simple, but done with attention and care. We had their Crostini Di Avocado and we shared their Insalata stella. The crostini was a great way to start, they finished it with a good quality olive oil that I would have robbed the chef at gunpoint for. The salata was fresh, but overall just OK. I would go with their Caprese or Caesar next time. For entrees, you cant go wrong with any of their pasta or protein dishes. Especially anything with veal. I had the Vitello Ossobuco alla pugliese, this is simply a soul satisfying dish. My girlfriend had the Milk and Honey Baby Back Ribs and ordered a small portion of Rigatoni Bolognese. These were both as equally delicious as my veal. A nice bottle of Cab complimented are meal perfectly. They have a beautiful Italian wine selection and very accommodating service to assist the non wine enthusiasts. Tiramasu, duhhhhh...a must order. Sapori Trattoria is great for a late date (go around 830-9), early dinner, or anytime for lunch. The food will make you feel good, but I cant say the same for your wallet.
