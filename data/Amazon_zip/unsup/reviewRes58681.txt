We went too this restaurant tonight and I had the most embarrasing time of my life. I have never reviewed a resturant. I have had some bad meals and some good meals. I cannot say that my problem was with the meal or for that matter with the particular young man that helped us. But with the establishment as a whole and the philosophy of the place. Our bill for two came out to $76+. Kind of hefty for a mid week chinese meal. But then again this is not a problem either. OK so here is the problem. We ordered some appetizers and then we ordered the main dish the Hot Pot. They brought the food to the table and we thought that at $16.95 per person the food they brought us belonged to us. But no only the food you eat is yours. Yes the fine print on the menu says that you cannot take away the hot pot left overs, didn't see that. But then again who would expect that if you bring food to the table you are going to take it back. So why, well there could only be one good reason, because they bring you the food and if you don't eat it they serve it to someone else. Highly illegal and quite unsanitary, I might add. Why else would they tell us that we could not take home the food that was on our plate. We ended up getting into an argument in the middle of the dining room. I have never had that happened before and I have dined all over the world.So tomorrow I plan to file a complaint with the health department. These people are reserving food. plain and simple, no other reason why they will not let people take food home that is already on the table.So worst restaurant experience of my life.Oh, I forgot to mention the waiter that came yelling at us and almost dropped his false teeth from his mouth.
