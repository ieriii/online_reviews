LOVE THE BAN CHAN! I'm obsessed with Korean side dishes and this place offers more than any other I've ever been to! I wish I'd gotten to try the bbq but instead my korean friend made me try some new things. On the plus side, the fried snapper was delicious! super crispy and very moist covered in tonkatsu sauce laying on top of a bed of fishy fried crisps. On the negative side, my pork with veggies came out as pork belly even though there was pork belly on the menu and I pointed specifically to the item that was NOT pork belly. My dish was tasty, but I could only eat so much fat of the pork belly. I also wish it would've been spicier.  My friend ordered an ox blood soup, which was definitely a first for me. Pig and duck blood are much smoother and creamier, ox blood is drier...not too pleasant of a taste. p.s. tried the BBQ-they give you a LOT of meat for each bbq item order. Also if you love mackeral, their mackeral is really good! AND HUGE too. The sides are salty and fatty and soooo good with rice. A great deal at only $12!!
