First off, I had the WORST first impression of this place. I almost walked out after the reception I was served from the hostesses. Isn't a hostess' job supposed to be 1) smile, 2) say hi, 3) and seat you? Yeah, I thought so. Apparently, not these 2 ladies. I made it past them and was seated with my boyfriend in the back. I'm pretty sure we were the youngest people in there and we're 30. It was chocked full of the usual Chicago summer tourists. Our server was extremely nice and was trying his hand at jokes. I forgot his name but he had forearm tattoos. We had the carmelized lobster, the duck breast, and the rib-eye and it was all very delicious. Since we split everything, all the dishes came out split as well. I thought that was a nice touch. Even the drinks were great. I'm pretty sure even though the food and server were great, I can't get past how rude and apathetic the hostesses were and won't be returning.
