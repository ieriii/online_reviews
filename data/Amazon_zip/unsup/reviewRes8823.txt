I remember going here pre-Check Please, when it was smaller and mostly families ate here. People who grew up on Persian cuisine recommended it to me. The food was fantastic, plus the owner was always very friendly.  For lunch, I usually order feta cheese & pita sandwiches and baba ghannouj. The sandwiches are simply creamy, tangy feta cheese with sliced onion, fresh parsley in pita bread. Their baba ghannouj is also excellent. For dinner, I always order the Chenjeh & Koubideh combo with dill rice. The chenjeh (ribeye) is great cooked medium-rare; very tender and full of flavor. I also love the roasted tomatoes that come with the meal.  Came back here recently and noticed that they expanded the restaurant. The Chenjeh & Koubideh combo was great, as always. It's always good to see a local business doing well. I've taken family, friends, and my bf here and they all really enjoyed the food. It's a wonderful neighborhood restaurant.
