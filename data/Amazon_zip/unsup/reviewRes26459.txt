We stopped in to grab a deep dish za and impulsively requested to dine-in after seeing the inviting little 2-person booths. The service was great. We were greeted the second we walked in by the friendly bartender and our server made sure we were content the entire time we were there. The atmosphere was also really fun and laid back. Our glorious pizza arrived and was just as delicious as I remembered. Perfect amounts of cheese, breadiness, toppings and sauce. The edges of the crust are also perfectly burnt. I savored every last bite. We've utilized Pequod's delivery and carry-out services in the past and were highly satisfied with both. Go to Pequod's! Random fun fact: (I learned this on Jeopardy the other day) the name of the ship in Moby Dick is Pequod. So that would explain the whale theme at the restaurant!
