If you've tasted REAL pizza napoletana in ITALY, this is the only place that comes the closest. Great environment, the owner is nice and so is the service. A little on the pricey side BUT very worth it. Ingredients are fresh...OOOH the mozarella!! This is not AMERICAN pizza, so don't come here expecting thick, fat, a la Giordano's style. This place is phenomenal!! It's always busy but choose your hours or call for a reservation.
