There's very little--if anything at all--that I would change about this restaurant: + very reasonable prices for... + well executed, balanced food + exceptional service I have been disappointed by Reza's for the last time; this shall be the restaurant I frequent for Middle Eastern or Persian fare. On my last visit, our waiter recognized my lady and me from our visit last month. It's a very small thing, but that went a long way with me. That particular waiter is very hospitable, and the pride he has in his job is reflected by maintaining very high degrees of helpfulness and consideration while never being overbearing or "chummy" in the slightest. He was our waiter on both visits, so I cannot speak of the other staff. The menu is varied, and the menu card itself is helpfully organized by meat type (as seems the tradition in MIddle Eastern and other restaurants). None of the flavors in any of the dishes were out of proportion or too subtle. Slow-roasted means slow-roasted, with all bits of a lamb shank's muscle and connective tissues rendering an unmistakeable flavor while retaining all its natural moisture. Swordfish is hard to get wrong, but is positively remarkable if done right. Here, thin filets of fish are charbroiled and provide a great balance of delicate fish and delectable carbon, without being oily or greasy. The yogurt drink dough might be a bit much for some, but it was refreshing enough to warrant a whole pitcher. Unlike Karen L., I most certainly did *not* feel like I was in someone's house. That distinction would go to a restaurant like Podhalanka, but Noon O Kabab brought an altogether different, more professional, well-polished and -practiced experience with clear strengths in the food and service departments, and no serious weaknesses to keep me from coming back.
