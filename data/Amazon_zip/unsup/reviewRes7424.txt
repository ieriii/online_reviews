I went to Sapori Trattoria last week with my girlfriend and best friend after spending an hour or so on this very website going through all the medium-level Italian restaurants to be found. The first thing I noticed was there menu, which is very classic and authentic. This is not to say uninteresting: everything is quite nice and there are many inventive items as well, just nothing that in my opinion "tries too hard." It is one of the few places I have found so far that reminds me of the N. End in Boston. The wine list is ok, not great. It serves up a reasonably varied amount of Italian wines from different regions (which in my experience is very rare in Chicago), and a couple classic American favorites as well. Most importantly, the markup on bottles is really low, overall wine prices are great. On to the food! We ordered fried Calamari, and I chose the Zuppa di Pesce. Also ordered were the lobster ravioli and pumpkin ravioli. All of them were wonderful, and for 30 wing-wangs the ginormous Z.d.P was an easy 4 meals-worth! Every kind of seafood imaginable and salmon served over linguine in a light, spicy red sauce. Overall the food was great. The scallops were a touch over cooked for my liking, and the fried calamari, while delicious, was a bit plain. Service was beyond great...and they even let us order dessert and digestivo after they had closed. The atmosphere is wonderful...small, quiet and warm. The perfect environment for a date or any nice evening out for great food. I will definitely be going back!
