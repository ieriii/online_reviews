I lucked out with a reservation. I called everyday and when I called on Tuesday about 6PM Chicago time, they answered! woohoo! I really wanted to try this restaurant after reading the reviews on yelp. The restaurant seemed different, relaxed and didn't seem like they went by the book (in a good way). We got a call the day of our reservation to confirm and they told us that they were a bring your own wine restaurant. I don't drink that much so we opted not to bring anything. When we got there it was a cozy restuarant with about 7 tables and a super friendly staff. They saw that we didn't bring wine and asked if we drank. The server then poured my bf a glass of white wine. Seriously, so friendly and nice. Now onto the food. We had the 3 course meal which was supplemented by a few other small courses. All their courses came out looking lovely. Apple pie soup - super rich creamy and an interesting concept but a bit too much to have the amount they gave us. We saw how much it was given in the 9 course meal and my bf thought that would have been the perfect amount. My beet risotto - Tasted amazing but the risotto was a little hard, That did not stop me from finishing the plate.  Crab ravioli - Was a one shot ravioli with creamy sauce. It was good. Pork - It was a little lukewarm. Not too sure if it was supposed to be lukewarm but would have probably enjoyed it more if it was warmer. The pork itself looked more like ham, but it tasted great. The presentation was awesome.  White fish from Australia - It was a little off for me. I didn't think all the flavors meshed together well but that may be due to the fact that the fish on the menu was substituted for another fish? Pretzel bread - tasted great. Left me wanting more. There were a few things food-wise that prevented me from giving 5 stars but as my bf says if we lived in Chicago we would definitely go back.
