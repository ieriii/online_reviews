We live in the neighborhood and this has become one of our go-to spots for lunch and dinner. Food is always very fresh and yummy. We were skeptics for a long time before we decided to give this place a try because we are not vegetarians - what fools we were! There always seemed to be a line out front, which is a good sign for a restaurant and The Chicago Diner is worth the wait. Yum yum! Some of our favorites include the taco salad, the fire house wrap, the soul bowl, sweet potato quesadillas, the hot, hot chili and the soup of the day always hits the spot. OH and the desserts! Save room :)
