People that work here are really friendly and pleasant. Their garlic rice? Ohh mannnnn. It is so good. It's fluffy, it's garlicky, it's lightly salty, absolutely tasty. Their beans? It's hearty, seasoned well, and loaded with bacon flavor. Beans over the garlic rice? Match made in heaven. I really don't care for mashed potatoes except the potatoes here. It's warm, soft, velvety, creamy, buttery etc etc. BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER! I'm not even going to get into the chicken. Just try it for yourself. It is finger lickin' good. The whole chicken meal will give you enough leftovers to make three more meals out of it (or one. or none). Only thing I don't care for is the pita bread. It's always been stale and had a cardboard-like texture. Their pizzas are really tasty as well. The crust is fabulous. I hope they stay open for a long time because I can't imagine my life in Chicago without this place. I know that sounds really cheesy but really, try their chicken dinner. It's like the best thing ever. This place is a true hidden gem.
