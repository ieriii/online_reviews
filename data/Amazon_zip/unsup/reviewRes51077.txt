My first experience at Big Jones will not be my last. My friend and I had a huge and wonderful brunch, filled with huge cups of coffee and amazing jasmine flower tea. Our server was the best, the ambiance was elegant without being stuffy, and most importantly, the food was delicious. I will be back as soon as possible.
