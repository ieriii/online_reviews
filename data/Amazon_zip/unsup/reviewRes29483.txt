I can't help it I love this place. My favorite pasta dish is the farfalla pollo, its awesome and inexpensive. If I could move this place closer to Wickerpark I'd visit it a lot more. The servers are great the place is small but its fast and wonderful. I used to live around the corner and went visited this place once a week.
