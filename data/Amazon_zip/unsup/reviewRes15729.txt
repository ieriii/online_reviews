Absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $5 valet, can't beat that. We checked our coats in the front also... that's tip of choice which ofcourse we tipped!!! I enjoyed not having to haul my coat around... Love the decor and over all feel of the place. What a fun vibe!!!!Our server Daniel was awesome! Very friendly & knowledgeable of the restaurant & menu. Water was always promptly filled, table was always cleaned IMMEDIATELY of cleared plates. Complimentary fresh bread & butter was brought to the table to start. It was nice and soft. Yum. Drinks: We had the coconut mojitos which were delish. Appetizer: Ropa Vieja. I highly recommend it. It was so flavorful, the boyfriend and I both loved it! I could have had a couple plates of that to myself & been fully satisfied. Entree: I had the Churrasco, Medium rare, & medium rare it was. Cooked to perfection. Flavors were phenomenal & that corn... something about it. I loved it. My boyfriend had the arrachera, he was soooo pleased with it. I had a taste & it was delish. For a moment I kinda wished I had ordered that, but... when I went back to my plate... hmmmm. Dessert: Coconut cake. It was pretty good, but I expected it to be more coconutty. I loved the sugar sculpture. Had a few coconut mojitos at the bar afterward & had a blast in the photo booth by the bathrooms. I highly recommend this place. It's pricy, but sooooo worth it. They lose a star for not bringing out the boyfriends birthday dessert. When I made reservations the lady said she included it in the reservation and that at the end they would bring him a bday dessert with a candle. That never happened. They totally forgot. SMH. Had they executed that part, they would have gotten the full 5. We will be back tho Carnivale, hopefully sooner than later!!!
