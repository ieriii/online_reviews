This place is great, I have heard for years that they were good but have never made it here. We finally got the opportunity and were greatly impressed. First, the decor is gorgeous, I was thoroughly impressed by how nice it looked in there. Having no clue what to expect, it made a great impression on me. Second, the service was great from the hostess to the waiters carrying the meat, everyone made us feel welcome and gave us great service. Our waiter, Thomes (Thomas) was extremely attentive and friendly, he made sure we knew what to do and expect, we always had clean plates and he made sure that the meat we wanted was brought to us. Third but not last, the food! The salad bar is filled with great cold items like a nice fruit and greens salad, deviled eggs, smoked salmon, sushi, ham, assorted cheeses, marinated mushrooms, apple salad and much more. Everything I tried, sans the potato salad which I am very picky about, I liked very much. Hubby loved the risotto on the hot side but I did not get any of it. The meats were varied and I love the fact that you can get it cooked to the temperature your liked. Highlights-- Lamb--best I have ever had hands down Shrimp--flavorful and smoky Filet Mignon--So tender Garlic Beef--great flavor Parmesan Crusted Pork--full of flavor though a tad dry For dessert we tried the Carrot Cake for dessert, while not the best I ever had it was pretty good. All in all had a great experience and will definitely go back...oh yeah, we have a Groupon so we have to go back! :-)
