I love Rick Bayless and I've always been a fan. The food was really good. That's just what it was; good. I sort of had higher expectations of this place. The guac was ok--chunky which was nice, but very bland and served with chips that were sort of stale. (we were also served small portions of 3 different frontera salsas). I ordered the polenta and my friend ordered the smoked pork loin. The atmosphere is lively, bright, loud and bustling, but the service is very prompt and friendly. Also note---the margaritas are delicious! This is a great place to go to with large groups, friends, etc. We walked into the bar of Topolobamp for additional cocktails. Again, friendly/prompt service.
