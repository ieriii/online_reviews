I went to Hot Doug's a few weeks ago so this is a little late...my friend and I biked from downtown which made us feel a little less bad about our pork filled gluttony. We waited about an hour and a half- it was really nice out and everyone seems to be chatty in the line so the time passed fairly quickly. I went for the bacon cheeseburger hot dog- yes the pork sausage was stuffed with cheese and bacon AND topped with more cheese and coca-cola BBQ sauce, I'm probably missing something but it was very decadent and very tastey. I ate every last bite. We of course opted for the duck fat fries which were delicious, but I'm not sure how they really differ in taste from the others? just more crispy? Either way they're fabulous fries. You can definitely split between 2 people. Oh and we ordered a side of cheese to dip them in. Repulsive I know but sooo good. The only part that is highly annoying are the tourists who want to tell the guy at the counter their life story and how they've come all the way from [fill in the blank] and waiting [insert number of hours] for this and they are so excited and blah blah blah. OK lady you've had 1.5 hours to decide what you're eating order and get on with it. That shit was very annoying, have your order ready so we can eat our meat!
