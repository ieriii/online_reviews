I just went to this restaurant with 2 of my friends and I was so happy with the results! The wait staff was super nice. I had forgotten to order double rice instead of beans and made a comment that I had forgotten to do that when the food came out. The waiter immediately asked me if I would like to change it and he would be able to do it without any problem! How awesome! I ordered the enchiladas suizas with ground beef and it was fabulous! The salsa and sauce definitely had a little kick which made the food quite tasty! I will definitely be going back! Thanks for a great meal Mayan Palace! :)
