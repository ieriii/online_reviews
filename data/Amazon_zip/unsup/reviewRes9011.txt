i was just like you once, looking for that next dinner spot, scouring reviews. stop reading reviews now and make yourself a reservation at le colonial. went here for our 1year anniversary and it exceeded expectations. it wasn't too fancy, but just fancy enough. not too quiet, just quiet enough. decor and ambiance was just right. but that's all for nothing if the food isn't great. it was. we started with the CA SONG (tuna tartare). followed up with GOI BUN SO (scallop salad). i didn't even like scallops until I tasted these, they were awesome. for entrees: she had the CA NUONG (grilled salmon) and i had the BO BITET TOM NUONG (grilled filet mignon and sauteed shrimp). everything was excellent but the filet stole the show. we both had a glass of wine and the total was 100+tip. Not too bad for what we had+great service+location. I would definitely eat here again.
