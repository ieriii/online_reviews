Slowest. Brunch. Ever. When Yolk up the street had a 45-minute wait for Sunday brunch, I opted to come here with my parents, who were in town for the weekend. When we were first seated, alarm bells should have gone off when we had to repeatedly flag down the wait staff for coffee. Matters did not improve by the time we ordered. It took almost an hour for our dishes--not complex to begin with, think oatmeal, scrambled eggs, and fruit-- to reach the table. Although the prices are reasonable and the place was not crowded, do not let these facts lull you into thinking that the service will be fast.
