Wow, just threw away the food I had delivered We ordered two burgers medium rare; they were well done. Further, we got two items that were frankly unidentifiable. The meat was certainly not 100% beef. The burgers resembled soy. The only flavor came from the onion on the burger. Disgusting! The burgers were served with way-too-greasy fries and coleslaw I couldn't eat because we didn't get silverware. No napkins either. Have you no pride in your product, La Villa? Will never order from them again. Yuck.
