I really wanted to like this place... I love Vietnamese food, and I love that there's parking (with validation, it's $6 at the Children's Memorial lot). It's also BYOB. There were six of us... four adults and two kids. There were only a few other tables when we got there. The appetizers, shrimp spring rolls and veggie dumplings, were really good. My daughter had shrimp fried rice, which was pretty good and had a larg quantity of small shrimp (she ate them ALL). I ordered "mixed vegetables over crisy noodles". I'll take some blame for this one, as it just wasn't what I was expecting. Instead of some nice pan fried noodles, this was one of those birds next things, where the noodles are one solid, concrete mass. Ick. My husband had a spicy duck with noodles dish that was completely bland.  I'm always a bit paranoid in these situations... did we look so white bread that they took away the spice without asking? Either way, it was blah. We didn't try dessert... headed to Swirlz right across the street. I'm willing to assume that perhaps we ordered badly, so I plan to try delivery and give them one more try.
