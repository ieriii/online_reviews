I don't necessarily like the long lines that sometimes plagues this place, but the food is well worth it! XOCO offers amazing food that I've tried to recreate at home...but it's never as good as the real thing and I usually end up with a craving and make my way over to XOCO. You can't go wrong, whether its chips & salsa, caldos, or tortas, everything is creative and delicious!
