My friend just moved to the area and we were looking for something new and different. She read the reviews on Caro Mio so we decided to check it out. We were already looking forward to going...given that it was a BYOB. So we grabbed a few bottles of red and were on our way. It was a Monday night and not crowded at all. It was clear that our waiter was in training because the manager came over to oversee him as he was asking us what we would like and to tell us the specials. My friend and I actually had to resist laughing because the poor kid was trying to read us the specials but the manager wouldn't let him get a sentence in without interupting him.  So we went ahead and ordered. My friend had the chicken tortorlinni and I had the tri colored rolotto. My friend liked her's and I thought mine was pretty good as well. Her portion was huge..mine was a decent size. The service was good and I liked the intimate atmosphere...even if I was here with a friend. It was a great place to catch up over a bottle of wine and good food. My only complaint is that it was slightly overpriced...at least for what I got. I would love to go back another night and have this porcini mushroom sauce that everyone raves about. All and all...good BYOB!
