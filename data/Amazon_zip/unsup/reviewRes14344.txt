Wow. Just ate at Glenn's and I must say that it was really amazing. Great service, excellent food, casual atmosphere. Nothing stuffy or overpriced, just damn good seafood. I had the barramundi, which is only available for three months out of the year (our knowledgeable waitress was chock-full of fish info!). It came with a mouth-watering lime-herb butter sauce and perfectly cooked red potatoes and asparagus. My favorite from the night: the clam chowder. It had the most amazing flavor with lots of clams, some bacon and the traditional veggies. Also, Glenn's had a very good beer menu and a to-die-for bloodymary complete with shrimp and a honeydew slice.
