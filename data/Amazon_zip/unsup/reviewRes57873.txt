My first time trying anything Ethiopian was at Demera on Lawrence and Broadway in Chicago. I love food so why not...I went in with friends and we each ordered something different and agreed to share to see who ordered the best food. The service was good. They have an assortment of beers including a few Ethiopian selections. I had a native beer and didn't hate it. Nice actually!The food was served with a pancake type of bread that you use to scoop up your food with. I loved it! The servings were very big so bring an appetite.
