Without a doubt my favorite pizza in Chicago. (Lou Malnati's butter crust is my #2). I'm a creature of habit because new things frighten me which is something I've thought about talking with a professional about, but I spend most of my money on food so that's a no-go, instead I just always get the deep dish style pizza, which is like artfully cooked in these insane, probably billions-of-years-old seasoned pans that Pequod likely rescued from the Ocean floor, and they're like one of Atlantis's treasures or something and they make pizza with an indescribably crispy, caramelized crust that will make you wonder why you ever ate any other pizza, then you'll likely invent a time machine to go back in time to reclaim those wasted non-pequod's-eating-moments so that you can have the unbridled satisfaction of saying that you only ever ate Pequod's (thusly rendering your initial motivation to create a time machine unnecessary and paradoxical, destroying the very fabric of space and time... WORTH IT!).  I can't speak to the service because I've never dined-in because I'm a recluse when it comes to Pequod's pizza; I prefer to sit in pajamas like some dead-beat, do-nothing and fist-to-mouth 8 or 9 times the recommended serving and it just wouldn't be polite to do that in public and my parents raised me better than that, so I do it in my room with the door closed and I only cry a little. tears of exhilaration and unabated joy. These guys don't do online ordering because they're Luddites and I'm cool with that, I just always pay in cash so I'm not even sure if they take credit cards, but probably they do because that's the American way and this pizza is as American as the name Pequod.
