We visited the Chicago for a weekend trip Friday to Monday. I used my Triple A discount which saved on the room and gave us a free breakfast. Honestly we never used the free breakfast because it was always packed. We preferred breakfast at Eggsperience anyway, which was AMAZING! The Marriott staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered a movie in our room and it took forever to load, when it finally did begin we had missed the beginning with no way to rewind. We called concierge and they took off the purchase so we could order the movie again. Honestly, we missed the beginning of the movie again but by that time I was too tired and just went to sleep. We chose to self park instead of paying $55 a day to valet. We spent $35 per day and self park was just across the street. Honestly, we never used our car! We walked everywhere and the extra money saved paid for a whole meal! Save money and self park!Marriott has a Starbucks in the lobby which is convenient if you like Starbucks, but those employees were not as friendly as other Marriott staff. I gave the Marriott 4 stars because the sheets on the bed didn't seem to fit or were put on wrong. Every night the fitted sheet was on the corners but by the middle of the night it was completely off and I was laying on the mattress protector. The trouble with the in-room movie was a hassle also. In the end, I will stay at the Marriott again & will recommend it to others. Great quality for a fair price.
