What an establishment with true Chi-town character! Be ready for a 2 hour wait on the weekend, especially if you want to sink your teeth into those infamous duck fat fries (may I have some ketchup and a side of Lipitor please?)! The andouille sausage, thuringer, fire dog, and specials of the day (notably the smoked debreziner) were so juicy, and spewing of flavor! They grill the dogs over fire, and you can watch everything from the open kitchen. The place screams kitsch, but I don't mind it! Doug himself works the ordering station, but was actually super nice! I thought it was going to be one of those Soup Natzi/Pat's Cheesesteak strict ordering ritual deals, but it doesn't go down like that here---and thank goodness! They really are the "Sausage Superstore and Encased Meat Emporium"!
