Yes, there will be a wait, but it's really not that bad. And after you finish your meal, you'll be glad you waited. Here's a quick rundown of the three tortas (XOCO's signature offering) I've tried: Cubana - This is one of the tortas made on the griddle and easily one of the best XOCO has to offer. Flavor-packed pork loin and bacon are blanketed by velvety melted cheese in this heavenly sandwich. It also packs a surprising punch of heat from the chipotle mustard. Pepito - Another delicious offering from the torta menu. The meat was so tender, and the flavors meshed well together. The onions and the jalapenos round out the sandwich nicely.  Choriqueso - This was my least favorite of the bunch. It lacked the balance of flavor the other two tortas had. The chorizo simply dominated the torta. All in all, XOCO is a great place for delicious food without all the fuss of a formal restaurant. Chef Bayless hit this one out of the park!
