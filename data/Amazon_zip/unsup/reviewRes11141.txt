My foodie friend was in town for a short trip, just time enough for a quick brunch. She is a sweetheart when I visit her in New York and braves the veg only places, and accomodates my child like palate, so I wanted to take her somewhere up to her standards. I needed a place on the Blue line, so the local foodies told me to go here. The food was good. Super good. I'm pretty sure I had dessert for breakfast - amazing Apple Tarte pancakes. Pancakes covered in apples and caramel and vanilla creme. I've had desserty pancakes where the sweetness ovewhelms the pancake part, but that was not the case here. I could taste everything, and it was great. Foodie friend had the cranberry pancakes and bacon, and said it was all up to snuff. The portions of the pancakes were huge. When they were brought to the table, my friend said that she could see why Chicago is such a fat city. The service though - oh man. Horrible. Some of the worst service I've ever had. She was rude when she actually bothered to speak to us, huffed when my friend ordered her a tea a certain way, and just sort of threw the check on the table when we asked for it.  The food sort of makes up for the service. Sort of. I'm interested in trying their savory menu. I think if the company hadn't been so great, the service might have rankled me more. We'll see how a second trip goes.
