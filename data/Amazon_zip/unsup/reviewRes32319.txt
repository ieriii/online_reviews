I have only had Ethiopian food on one other occasion, and really enjoyed the experience. I was pumped to try it again at a different spot to see how it compared. Went to Demera with an 8 person group the other night. The food was just as good as I remembered, if not better. We tried a chefs sampler platter which is perfect when you're not very familiar with a cuisine - plus we got to try a lot for our $12.50/person. I have to say that although I am a meat eater, I thought the vegetarian dishes were some of the best. The peas, beats, cabbage and potatoes were so tasty. I don' think I've ever had cinnamon in beats before, but I loved it! Only one person at the table tried the honey wine, but judging by the face she made, I dont think it was a hit. She described it as both very sweet and very hoppy. I stuck with ethiopian beer, which I really enjoyed. All in all I think this is a fun place for a group as well as for a date...no better way to break the ice than sharing a huge plate of delicious food that you get to eat with your hands!
