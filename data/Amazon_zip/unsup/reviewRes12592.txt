I've seen this place grow from a tiny BYOB to the several storefronts it now occupies. Great atmosphere, mojitos and food. I brought some colleagues that were in town from Singapore here in an effort to expose them to some new cuisine. They loved it.  My favorite is the Honey Jalepeno pork chop. Served on sweet potatoes in an amazing sauce. For my money it's the best piece of meat in the city.
