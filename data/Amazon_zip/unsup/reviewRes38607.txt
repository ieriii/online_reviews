Let me open by saying I am a pizza snob.  I shun cheap places, ignore frozen of any kind, and only have a few places I get excited about going to. That said, Giordano's is the best pizza I've ever had. So much yummy cheese! And the crust? It's the first time I've ever enjoyed the crust. It tasted like yummy French bread. So gooood. The sauce was incredible and the bell peppers screamed with taste. I was in complete heaven when I ate here and will never forget how awesome it was. Next time, and any time, I am in Chicago, this will be my first stop for sure. Sorry Oprah, Giordano's is the reason you visit Chicago.
