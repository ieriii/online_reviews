GET THE LUNCH BUFFET. I've come here for dinner and lunch and lunch is the best bang for your buck. Lots of food for $15 ranging from chicken, fish, lamb, lots of vegetarian options of course, and ice cream. This is like the fanciest Indian restaurant I've ever been to, where else do you see your waiters in tuxes serve you food on china? The food is good and my Indian friends take me here. You know you got a good thing when that happens. I've been trying to find an excuse to come here again during lunch.
