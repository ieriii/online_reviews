This place reminded me a lot of my experience at Girl and the Goat, re: plates to share, various meat specialties, atmosphere, etc. Granted, the restaurants themselves are very different (G&G occupying a huuuuge almost industrial/rustic themed space in the West Loop and PP occupying a rather smaller space on the Mag Mile), but the quality in food is similar. My S.O. and I ordered 4 dishes to start - the bone marrow spread, charred cauliflower, the octopus and green bean/fingerling potato dish, and the milk-braised pork shoulder. We ordered a 5th dish, the pig's tails, because we decided we were still a bit hungry after the first four dishes. The standouts were the bone marrow, octopus, and pork shoulder. The cauliflower was WAY too salty (which is unfortunate), and the pig's tails were on the salty end, too, but were at least interesting to see (I also think the eggs on top were a bit mismatched with the tails themselves). The pork shoulder was absolutely amazing, it came sititng on top of mashed potatoes and the meat just melted in your mouth. Very hearty. The octopus was cooked well, not too tough but not slimy. The green beans and potatoes were delicious with it, and was marinated perfectly. The bone marrow was an experience - the capers/onions really helped bring out the flavor, and a little bit of sea salt made the dish great. All in all, I say service was good and our wait was minimal at 6pm on a Thursday. We chose to sit outside (it was pretty hot) when everyone wanted to sit inside with the A/C. Let's just say it was a smart idea to sit outside, because after we sat down we noticed that a long line started to form for the inside spots. The outside area filled up pretty quickly, too, so if you want to dine here comfortably, I say come early! Service was good, and dishes came out fast. A solid 4 stars, as the food taste levels weren't entirely consistent. Most of the dishes felt heavy, but I guess that's why you would seek this place out!
