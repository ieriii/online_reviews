Wow! Growing up in an Italian kitchen it makes it difficult to eat Italian food outside my kitchen or family members' kitchens. Despite this I always look for places I can go to and be catered to without having to cook it myself of help with the dishes. Mia Francesca is one of these places. I was visiting friends in Chicago this weekend and happened to see the store front on our way back from buying beer for the weekend. My sister's name is Francesca so it definitely caught my eye. My friend told me the place is awesome an went on and on about it. I then knew this was the place to eat on Saturday. Reservations were made Sat. morning. We got there and the place was packed. The smells were familiar and I started getting excited. As we waited for out table, I gazed at the menu which is nothing to rave about since it's nothing but a printout on recycled paper. This is because their menu is made daily to reflect what they have fresh. I only found a few items that you will find on all Italian menus. Everything else was unique to the ingredients they had at their disposal that were the freshest. I got the Veal along with two other friends. The other dishes we got were the Chicken Parmesan and a pasta dish with portobello mushrooms as the main ingredient. However, for starters we for the Bruschetta which was the freshest I have had period. The place was packed but the service was awesome.  They could use a little more Air Conditioning but you can't really complain about it. If you have read my previous reviews, you will see that I have a preference for simple menus. This time I need to add one small complaint. This menu is awesome and uses seasonal ingredients, but I would love for it to have at least one tried and true traditional dish on the menu.
