Oh, so good. My husband and I showed up at 8:30 on a Tuesday night ( a halfhour before closing) and were relieved to get in with no line out the door at that point. We ordered the carnitas torta and the porkbelly sopa, and both were outstanding. The seating system is a little odd; if you're eating in, they assign you a number when they can accommodate you with a spot, you order and pay, and then they bring your food to you. The only problem with this is that they completely forgot the second part of our order (churros and hot chocolate) because they took our number away when we finished the first part. It took us a few minutes for us to realize that they'd forgotten, and since they were getting ready to close we had to quickly put in the order again. We were the last ones out the door and felt a little rushed, even though it was their mistake. Nonetheless, the churros and hot chocolate are absolutely mouthwatering. I will be back the next time I'm in the area with foodies.
