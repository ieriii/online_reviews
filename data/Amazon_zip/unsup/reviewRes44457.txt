On my visit to Chicago, I decided to try out a couple cupcake places, Alliance being one of them. Walking up to the bakery, I can say that if it wasn't for the reviews on yelp, I would have walked away. The place looks like it needs a makeover and some better lighting. The cakes in the display window look like they've been sitting there since the early 90's and need desperately to be modernized. I was happy to see that they had red velvet cupcakes (my favorite), and also got one each of the carrot and mocha cupcakes. Overall, the cupcakes had good flavor but are a little on the dry side. Flavor and taste wise they reminded me a lot of Sprinkles in LA. Not a bad dessert option if you're in the area.
