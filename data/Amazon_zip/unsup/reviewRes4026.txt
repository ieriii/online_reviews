Ease up kids. For those of you bashing on Schwa's business approach to not taking reservations, just calm down. Seriously. These chefs are some of the most amazing guys in the business and I'm pretty sure the last thing they care about is your whiny attitude. You'll get in - just keep trying. I called on a Tuesday evening and the mailbox was empty. Left my name & info and also noted that "I'd take a reservation whenever they had an opening" Sure enough, they called back three days later saying they had one for the following evening. My philosophy is that being open minded and being kind in your voicemail is key. They don't want to listen to a bunch of cranky soon-to-be-customers. Market yourself, ok? Now onto the evening: absolute bliss. The whole experience is pretty surreal. A tiny home-like setting. Soft lighting. Views of the kitchen. I can't really do the food justice by trying to go into detail, but it was the best I've ever had. It was also great to have each chef come out and explain the dishes... answer questions ... or just make small talk.  My friend Amy & I brought two bottles of wine - one prosecco and one pinot noir. It worked out beautifully. And for those asking if you're supposed to bring your own glassware - they have actual wine glasses now. But, I think it's ok if you bring your fine crystal if that's what you'd like. All in all - if you have any sense of upscale dining without pretension, call and be nice. You'll get in eventually.
