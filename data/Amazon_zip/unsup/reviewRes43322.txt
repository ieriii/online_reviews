I loved the brunch at Milk & Honey. I had the special pancakes with apples and granola - they were very good. My husband had the humongous orange scented brioche french toast with almonds - he loved it. The cafe mocha may have been the best I've ever had. They are well known for their granola and we took home a bag to give it a try.
