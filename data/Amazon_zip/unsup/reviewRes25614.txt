I have found the HOLY GRAIL of Chicago brunch. This place is ridiculously amazing and a great deal! for $25, you get 7 tapas style food items and a charcutterie bar that includes delicious cheeses and salami, proscuitto and AMAZING roast suckling pig! The chef actually cuts up pieces of roast pork, adds very good olive oil, salt and herbs to it to make it even more delicious. I could have just ate that and be delighted! On top of that, you can add $8 and get unlimited drinks. You get your choice of mimosa, 3 types of sangria and a crazy build your own bloody mary bar that has giant prawns the size of my face! Also not only do they have the standard bloody mary mix, but they also have green gazpacho and tomatillo mixes, both make in-house. Also they have a bar of desserts and pastries. I didn't try them but they looked pretty good. AMAZING. Seriously words cannot describe how in love I am with the brunch right now. I don't understand why everyone and their moms are not eating there every Sunday morning. Basically for $50, you could spend the entire day drinking and eating and eating and drinking. OMG, I will be baaaaaaaack! p.s. the only thing that sucked was charging $5 for tea.
