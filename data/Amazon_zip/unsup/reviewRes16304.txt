Went to Carnivale with my boyfriend over the weekend. I've been there before and sat in the main level dining area. However, this time we got seated upstairs in one of the random rooms. That kinda pissed me off. There were a good amount of people in our room but would have been nice to sit downstairs.  I ordered the skirt steak, which I LOVE. My mouth is watering just thinking about it ; ) It is on a bed of rice/beans and comes with marinated onions. So good. My boyfriend ordered the $35 steak with fries. He liked the steak but didnt like the fries. The fries were the really small ones that look like sticks. So I ended up eating them : ) Besides the food, I had about 4 drinks. 2 lemon drop martinis (they were good, pretty strong), 2 cosmos and another one that I don't remember. They were pretty good but nothing special. Anyways, our waiter was super nice! Very pleasant and friendly. My boyfriend told him it was my bday so he got us a comp dessert. It was this caramel cake??? To be honest, I was quite tipsy so don't remember what it was but I know it was very good! And we also had the chocolate cake, which was good but nothing outstanding. The waiter was quite surprised that we ate them both = ) we are piggies. By the time we left dinner, the main room was packed with people and so was the bar up front. I want to hang out at the bar area the next time I go. It's pretty big and looks like fun. All in all, it was a great time at Carnivale. Staff are great and food is very good. The only bad thing was that the drinks didn't stand out and we weren't seated on the main floor.  Tip: You can find street parking but valet is only $5!
