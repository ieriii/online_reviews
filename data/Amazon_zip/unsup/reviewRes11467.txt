I truly LOVE this place. I'm a huge fan of breakfast in general, and the amazingly tasty dishes they serve at the Bongo Room are a real treat each and every time I go. I have a bit of a sweet-tooth, so all of their insanely delicious pancakes and french toast dishes are right up my alley, but the various versions of eggs benedict, breakfast burritos, and croissants are all very tasty as well. There can be ridiculously long lines during peak hours, but trust me, it it worth the wait. :)
