I go to the Bongo Room about once a year and every time I am disappointed. Then a year passes, I find myself hungry for brunch and find myself there, having forgotten that I don't really like it. Part of the problem may be that I am an omelette person, not a pancakes/french toast person. Most recently I had an omelette with broccoli, spinach and red pepper. It was basically just three eggs and a massive pile of vegetables. Not very good. Hash browns were red potatoes and were also just not very good. Sourdough toast was fine. They serve Intelligentsia coffe, and that's always a plus. Service at the bar was good. So the problem might be that I just am not ordering the right things. But shouldn't it be easy to make a simple omelette and hash browns tasty? Yeah, it should. Any basic diner does that.  This place doesn't.  Plus, it's pretty expensive.
