Get the badness out of the way - too NOISY. We were fortunate to sit off to the side of the restaurant, but it was still annoying to have to yell at your tablemates, when they weren't really that far away. I know it's the cool thing to be in such a place, but to me, noise does not equal cool. SO the goodies - goat, bison appetizers, and a pretty good seared tuna. Peanut. Butter. Beignets. Yes, to die for. Perhaps just a bit more powdered sugary goodness, but the creamy gooey peanut butter was an excellent complement to the fried donut. The halibut looked pretty good. It's really easy to destroy fish. These dishes were just about perfectly done.
