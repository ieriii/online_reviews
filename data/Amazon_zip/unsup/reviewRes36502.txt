I like sushi, the ex-lady liked Thai. She probably still does, I don't know. What to do. Indie cafe. The selections are amazing, the prices fantastic, and the help is always patient, helpful, and tip-worthy. When they suggest a special, try it. I've never had anything bad. Nor has anyone that I know.
