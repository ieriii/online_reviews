I may have had to wander around my favorite part of Chicago until this place opened in the morning but I must say it was worth it. A first glance at the menu is overwhelming, as there are so many incredible options.. not to mention a vegan desert menu to die for. As I was a newbie vegan at the time, I decided to go for a classic tofu scramble. It was excellently seasoned, huge, and came with a great serving of brown rice and grilled veggies on the side. Although almost completely full at this time, I couldn't leave without having SOMETHING from the dessert menu. I chose the chocolate pumpkin cheesecake.. and boy am I glad I did. As someone who has tried their fair share in cheesecakes, I can easily say this is one of the best I've ever had. It's also more of a NY style cheesecake, unlike the ones from Karyn's Cooked, which although good as well are much fluffier. Great service , great atmosphere, fantastic location in Halsted. I can wait to go back when I return to Chicago.
