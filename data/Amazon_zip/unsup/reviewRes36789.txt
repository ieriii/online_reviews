The sushi is one of the best I have had and was presented very well. You could definitely taste the crab in the crab ragoon, but the portions were small so order two of them if your party is more than two people. The Thai food was also very good. The Thai Ice Tea didn't have the aftertaste that some other Thai places have. The service was a little slow (but it was a Friday night). The table we had was too small. They take reservations, but you have to make them at least a day in advance. I would go back, but probably not on a busy night.
