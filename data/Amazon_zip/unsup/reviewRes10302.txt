Great food, but the service by our waiter and the hostess were below average for this area and type of restaurant. The bussers and other staff were great, but, let's be honest, you go out to be treated well at the door and at the table. A few examples: The waitress waited until our glasses were empty each time to ask us what we'd like for our next course. We like to order a different wine for each course, and we got the feeling that she was upset we didn't order a bottle. No one likes an empty glass! Second, when another table ordered a bottle, the waitress placed their wine chiller near out table, so we had to stare at it, and walk around it when we got up. When we asked her to move it, she acted like we were out of line. Finally, the hostess was rude when we said we were going to go across the street while we waited for our table. The bar at PS was too crowded, and people were standing 10-deep at the door. It just didn't make sense to wait with the crowd for 45 minutes. Since the food was above par, we might return for a bite at the bar or if we were only ordering one course. But we don't intend to bring guests.
