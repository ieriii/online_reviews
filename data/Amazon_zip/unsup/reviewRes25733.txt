I haven't written a yelp review in ages but Simply It has made me want to review them today after picking up a late lunch. I always walk out of this place with a smile because the owner has his special way of making you happy. You have to meet him to understand - his smile is contagious.  How can you not like this restaurant? It's byob, has EXCEPTIONAL service, cozy decor, and amazing food all on a budget. I could eat Simply It's food daily. Their smoothies are reasonably priced and delicious & my favorite is their pho. The broth is just perfect! Here are my other favorites: Beef pasta, Grilled Shrimp Pasta, Coconut and Mango Beef, and Tofu & Eggplant.  Pick up the phone to get delivery or take out or just go to the restaurant. You will not be disappointed.
