Amazing experience. I'm not one easily impressed, but loved everything about the place. Great ambiance, great service, and amazing food. First time I came in, it was rather late. Server made us feel great even though I'm sure we did not look like the average clientele.  We came in dressed very casually and she took our order and had the drinks coming at a reasonable time. Great view of the city from the outdoor patio. Then the food came and we were in culinary heaven. I ordered the Venison burger and forgot I was with friends. The Gouda Cheese just melted in your mouth. The chef put just the right amount of Jalapeno peppers, not too much too make it spicy, but enough that you can enjoy the tasted. The burger itself, melted just right in your mouth. Fries were great, but the real side to try is the mashed potatoes. My friends took a bite and they enjoyed it more than their fries. Add to the fact that they have a wide variety of imported beers outside of the usual and micro brew as well as an extensive wine list, it is definitely a place a beer or wine connoisseur will enjoy. Stopped by lunch a couple weeks later and even though I just ordered a salad, it was still a great experience. I assumed there would be a drop off due to it being lunch instead of dinner. I was wrong. I recommend this place to anybody who enjoys good food and does not mind shelling out a little money for it. Try it for lunch, I'm sure you will come back for dinner.
