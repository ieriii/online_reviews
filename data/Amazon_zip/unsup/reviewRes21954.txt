had the pepito torta, and the hubs tried the pork belly. both were really really good, but $12 good? not sure. maybe i'm just cheap! we also had the hot chocolate which was like sipping on filipino tsokolate which... wasn't that good, but that's my opinion. will have to come back to try their churros. the pastry chef at the window was so nice to the kids, but the guy managing the lines inside is crazy. the line went practically out the door - we were just taking it to go since we didn't want to wait for a table. after we ordered and paid, we went back towards the door to wait, but he kept telling us we couldn't stand here, here, or here. uh, did you want us to wait outside?! rude!
