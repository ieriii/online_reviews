Excellent Mexican food. The best I've had in Chicago. The service is excellent (all the waiters are friendly). I went there 2x in one week. The rice is great (I love Meixcan rice) and the guacamole is yummy.  On Tuesdays and Thursdays, margaritas are 1/2 off. They have a variety of frozen flavors, although the original margarita is quite good. Try the fish tacos--you won't be sorry. Everything on the menu is great, and comes in large portions. It gets busy around 7 or 8 on the weekends, but if you come in small parties, you can usually get seated. They also have an outdoor patio when it's nice outside. I love this place!!
