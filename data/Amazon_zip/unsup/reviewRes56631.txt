Sat at the bar... total bill with wine for 2, under $100. More casual than I expected (which is a good thing), food was excellent, everything from the anchovies to risotto. We got lucky and got a seat at the bar without a wait , which was also nice. Without a doubt it would have been 5 stars, but the best part about sitting at the bar is the interaction with the bartender and ours just had nothing to her. The bar back was great--wish he got our tip!
