oh ma ga, this place is crazy delicious. first things first: best bloody mary in chicago, hands down...and here's a little known secret: only 50cents more for premium liquor if you're getting drinks with brunch. I went on a saturday morning & the brunch menu is too good, it took me forever to decide what to get because everything looked fabulous. it was packed, of course, so we had to wait about 20min and ended up sitting at the counter, which was a-okay with me. the bartender, who also waited on us, couldn't have been nicer and was completely on the ball despite the fact that they were slammed and she was serving about 10 people & making drinks for the entire place. the staff is smiley & friendly, the food is hot and fresh, and the drinks are exactly what they should be. my faves: the pancakes for sure, eggs benedict (any way you get it is fantastic)& breakfast burrito. noteworthy: the potatoes that they call "hash browns" are not actually hash browns...while they are very delicious & nicely flavored, they are potatoes, closer to home fries. next up: chocolate french toast!
