First time going here and I'll be back, however wasn't blown away by the food. My husband got the artic char and it was tasty but nothing I'm going to dream about. The diablo sauce with shrimp was rich but there was no heat! I got the BBQ chicken and it was also good. The person next to us got the black n blue new yorker and that looked amazing. Unfortunately I didn't get to try it. Server was very friendly. Place was cute. Going back to try some other things.
