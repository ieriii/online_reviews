I had a wonderful birthday brunch at Big Jones today. The food was amazing and the waiter was very attentive.The service wasn't fast, so be prepared for a slow paced meal and rest assured that the meal will be worth it! Our party tried the Eggs New Orleans, Corn Cakes, and the burger and they were all fantastic. And the beignets were the best I've ever had!
