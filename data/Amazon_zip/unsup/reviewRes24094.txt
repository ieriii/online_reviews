I really really love this place!! It's so yummy!! The shrimp and rice is always great and I'm obsessed with the lamb chops and rice pudding! I am always hungry for it and am never disappointed. The atomosphere is so cool and I love hearing the waiters speak Greek. Definitely a recommendation from me!
