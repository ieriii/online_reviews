Rick Bayless, I love you. Growing up in San Diego, I have had my share of Mexican food. After eating at Frontera, I realized that Mexican food is so much more complex than I ever imagined, or tasted, depending you think about it. This was like a religious experience for me. I will never look at Mexican food the same again. I want more! I have since then moved back to San Diego, and I can't find any restaurants that come close to Frontera. Rick Bayless, this is a plea, please come to San Diego, open a restaurant. Show us Californians how its done! PLEASE!
