Had a coupon for buy one dinner, get one free (comes in those value pack thingies in the mail) so tried it out. Service here is very attentive, which I loved. The buffet was also very good; however, overall I thought the meats were a tad salty, a sentiment shared by my dining companion. It wouldn't stop me from coming back if I had another coupon...I just can't eat $50 of meat in one sitting tho.
