These gigantic Seoul and Sassy wings are simply succulent and juicy. I brought home a box for my roommates as a surprise. They thought I was picking up buffalo wings. As soon as we took our first bite, we all looked at eachother in awe. One of my other roommates had the caeser, and she was not a fan. On a good note, there was plenty of chicken on there. I was also given a complimentary side of the daikon raddish kimchee, which was much appreciated. (eventhough they usually come with the meal at real Korean restaurants) Their entire menu is filled with a variety of options, from the traditional and untraditional beebim bop, to Korean burritos and plenty of healthy alternatives. I will definitely be coming back.
