My husband and I noticed this place today, and stopped in for lunch. The decor is pretty nice, with a Southern theme that isn't overwhelming. The menu isn't huge, but it has a good variety, and there weren't too many things I didn't want to try. We were served beignettes before the meal, which were pretty tasty. We both ordered iced tea (one pomegranate and one passion fruit), and both were delicious. They bring the iced tea in a carafe for each person, then bring your flavor in a separate beaker-like thing so that you can add as much or little as you would like. Because we are like large children, we enjoyed this. My husband said, "I like it, it's like science." But seriously, it was very good. Besides the iced teas, they have an extensive hot tea menu that looked good as well. We ordered the Shrimp Burger and the Fried Green Tomato BLT. Both were really flavorful, and the green sauce that comes with the side dish was great on the side and the sandwiches. The side is a mix of fried okra, fried onions, and french fries. I didn't think I would like it because the fries looked overcooked and I've never had okra, but all of it was very good. The waitress was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. She said that they have only been open for about a week and a half. We asked to see a dinner menu and were excited to return for several things on that menu. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised. I have never really had "upscale Southern" cuisine before, though Big Jones made it work well. We will definitely be returning.
