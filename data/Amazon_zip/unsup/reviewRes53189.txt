The was so good. The service was perfect. They were attentive but not pestering. They gave us plenty of time and answered all of our questions. Perfect place to grab dinner and bring a bottle of rum for the mojito mix. The manager was really nice and checked how our dinner was. I can't wait to go back for breakfast. Really need to check it out. Not one, but two great patios!
