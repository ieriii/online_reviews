My husband and I have been here a couple of times for a date night and dinner with friends. The food is fantastic, as are the drinks and the ambiance. I am a huge truffle fan, and though the menu changes, they are constantly featuring some unique pasta with truffles. I also love the salad and vegetable selections. Since the restaurant suggests sharing items with everyone in your party, it makes it much easier to bring veggie friends for a delicious dinner. As for the drinks, many of the whiskey drinks are amazing, but I would recommend avoiding the Corn & Oil. While it was supposed to taste like "waffles with syrup" according to our server, it actually tasted like salty cough syrup. Stick with the Mezcal Old Fashioned instead!
