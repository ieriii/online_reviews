Unique much needed addition to the Chicago nightlife scene. No smoking and music low enough to hear your friends also makes this place very attractive. I had a drink from the rum list with Pisco and an egg, and the egg lended a nice foam and flavor to the concoction. Both the servers and bartenders have bartender training to understand and explain any of the drinks, and they are friendly and willing to answer any questions you have. They even made a drink for my friend who wasn't drinking alocohol that night. We also tried the curry rice crispy treats with spiced nuts and homeade herb crackers on the side. Very different and tasty. I want to go back and try the peanut butter, banana and bacon sammy on brioche. Overall I was happy for something new and different, and I plan to go back soon!
