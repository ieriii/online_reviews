Good atmosphere, good fun, Great experience: a pleasant environment. The food is great, and if you are unsure of what to order, the waiters offer great advice, and are very knowledgeable of the cuisine. The drinks are wonderful- they make the best Pina Coladas and peach balini I've ever had. The window view of Michigan ave is gorgeous, and even if you aren't as fortunate to get a window seat the surroundings of the restaurant are decadent enough to keep positive vibes. This is a great place to take your other half. You can make reservations or you can walk in. The desert menu offers a wide variety, but I never make it that far- they offer large portions.
