My recent experience at Caro Mio has me nearly speechless. My family and I were attempting to enjoy the mediocre food served at this Italian BYOB when our meal was interrupted by what I observed to be the rudest behavior by a restaurant manager ever! A small group of young (not to mention extremely attractive) men arrived for a reservation perhaps three minutes late. Upon their arrival, the manager ignored them for 10 minutes as he instructed waiters to dismantle their place settings at a table. He audaciously and smugly blurted out to them that their reservation was canceled. It appeared as if he had done so out of some power-drunk, antagonistic spite. The restaurant was half full too! The young men attempted to plead their case; however, the manager pointed at the door and told them to leave while calling them names and making fun of one young man's receding hairline! Being the apparently more mature adults, the men exited. What was even more appalling was that for about thirty minutes thereafter, I watched the manager and his staff mocking the boys after their departure. They were making crybaby faces and waddling while rubbing their tummies as if to say, I'm so hungry, boo-hoo while laughing contemptuously. My seven year old daughter began to cry and asked why those crummy old men were being so mean. Thanks Caro Mio for not only ruining my family's meal, but for teaching my innocent daughter about the assholery that is you and your crappy management staff. Congratulations.
