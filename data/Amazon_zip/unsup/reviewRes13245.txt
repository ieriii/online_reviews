maybe a review for this place at all is just redundant, but i'd like to say that this is one of my favourite date spots. the catch is to make in an early dinner and avoid the rush. some really great beers[i was happy it wasn't all hops and bitter finishes here, unlike some other breweries' selections.] and the food is way better than i expected for this kind of place. the reuben is perfect, and even my plain old bacon cheeseburger was spot-on and the kind i'd order over and over. the service has consistently been excellent, and the food has never disappointed.
