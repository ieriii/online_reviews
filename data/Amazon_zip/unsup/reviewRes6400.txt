Really enjoy eating here! I have lived in little italy for over three years and think this is the best place little italy has to offer outside the norm. I have tried a lot of things on the menu and enjoy it all. From the burger and pizzas, to the octopus and steak, to the amazing ricotta honeycomb and truffle egg toast, its all good. I dont enjoy pasta so I can't give any word on that. The wine menu was good, but they do have a corking fee which I find ridiculous. Expect to wait a while, a long while, especially on weekends. They dont take reservations, but just come prepared and have a glass of wine or two across the street at Beviamo wine bar, or have some awesome craft beers at three aces down the street.
