Piece officially serves my favorite pizza in Chicago. Be prepared to wait a long time for a table on the weekend, but it's worth it. We recently ordered a medium pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and onion, and it was enough to feed 3 people. We waited an hour and a half for a table, but the pizza came out around 15 minutes after we ordered. It was hot, well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and had just the right amount of cheese. The sauce was delicious too. Highly recommended.
