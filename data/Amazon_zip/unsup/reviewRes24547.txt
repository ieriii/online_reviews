I just want to be another voice singing the praises of Geja's. I'm back in the area for christmas break and coming here with my mom is a holiday tradition. It may be be a little overpriced, but I feel like you're paying for the ambiance and the ritual of fondue. The chocolate fondue is nice, but it's melted chocolate so what do you expect. The cheese fondue is really the highlight of the meal for me.
