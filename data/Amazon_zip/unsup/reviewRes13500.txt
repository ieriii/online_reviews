Came here on a Sunday last month and luckily we were seated right away. This place was packed and it doesn't help that it's so small and compact. It's has a laid back type of atmosphere. You can order off their regular menu or gaze around at the list they have set up on both side of the walls on blackboard. They do offer daily specials. Just make sure you come here early because once it hits 11am, it WILL get a bit overcrowded and the lines are long. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our brunch that morning. Tony started his meal off with a clam chowder soup. He thought it was pretty tasty. After that he had the crab cakes dinner. I had the canadian bacon omelette (egg whites, extra buck or two) which was smothered in their infamous sausage gravy sauce with potato cakes and whole wheat toasts on the side. I really loved my food. It had that fulfilling stick to your ribs feeling without the heaviness. My food portion was very generous and their freshly squeezed orange juice was great as well. Not too sweet and not overfilled with pulps! Tony's crab cakes dinner was awesome, however, the portion size was pretty disappointing, being that it was suppose to be dinner size?! They are better off listing the crab cakes dinner as an appetizer because there's no way you can get full off of those silver dollar sized crab cakes. Overall, food was good, the wait staff was great. They really kept their cool even when it was busy and some of the customers were acting a bit rude. The waiter was telling us to come by during the weekday before 6pm and take advantage of their special 14 bucks for the catch of the day. So I'm sure we'll be heading back here again. I know Tamia would've loved their wide variety of cereals they had to offer. I can't wait to come back and try their infamous crab cakes benedict!
