I have nothing but great things to say about the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza. I had my wedding there on October 23, 2010. I looked at more than 15 reception venues in the Chicagoland area and no place compared to the Holiday Inn 15th Floor Wolf Point Ballroom! When comparing the price per plate and the ballroom with gorgeous views to other venues-it was an easy decision to make! Barbara Martin, the event coordinator, is very experienced, professional, and will answer any questions you have leading up to the night of your event. She made my wedding planning so simple with a list of recommended vendors to use for chair covers, music, entertainment, ect. We had hor'dourves during cocktail hour-tuscan chicken, coconut shrimp, and champange cantelope soup shots-Our guests LOVED all of them! Then when they open the doors to the main room-I don't even know where to begin! The view is spectacular, our head table was decorated beautifully, the food tasted great, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure our guests were pleased! Our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery (which is included in your wedding package) came out exactly how we envisioned it, and it was the best tasting cake I have ever had. Our bridal suite had an amazing view and it was huge! Our entire night at the Holiday Inn was perfect and I would highly recommend meeting with Barbara Martin if you are planning a wedding or event in the Chicagoland area!
