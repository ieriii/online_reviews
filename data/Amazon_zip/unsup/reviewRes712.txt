Wow! There are no words to accurately describing the dining experience at Alinea. Rated the best restaurant in the country by Gourmet magazine, I'd have to second that though. It was amazing. We ordered the full tour - 27 courses that wowed, dazzled, amazed and engaged multiple senses. The timing and flow of the courses was impeccable. I was constantly satiated, but never uncomfortably full. Dishes ranged from an Italian fava bean dish served on a pillow of lavendar air that slowly deflated over the course of the dish, to a hands-free dish, to "Chinese take-out". Words cannot describe how amazing this restaurant is, what a genius Achatz is, and how completely satisfying the experience is. For my full tour, one glass of wine (they kindly provided 2 half glasses), tax and tip, I walked away $327 poorer, but still think it was worth every single penny. The wine pairing seems nice, but at an additional $150-$175, didn't seem worth it... just for wine.
