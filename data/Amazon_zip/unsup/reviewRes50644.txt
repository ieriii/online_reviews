One morning I wake up early an decide to get some breakfast in the morning. My roommate is up so we walk over to wishbone, because it's always busy. Maybe it was the day or tine that we went, because there was nothing special to the food that I had there. The server didn't pay much attention to us and we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to come to sear us; the restaurant was not busy at that time. This is one of those restaurants that I will go to if my friends want to go, but not willingly on my own
