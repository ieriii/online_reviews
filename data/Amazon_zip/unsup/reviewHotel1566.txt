In my opinion, Hotel 71 Chicago is probably one of the best places to stay in the area. Located downtown and in the heart of the city, Hotel 71 is close to everything. I especially am impressed with the high level of customer service and attention to detail. It's nice to be greeted with a sincere smile in a big city like Chicago. I hear the Hotel is opening up a fabulous new cafe, which will be terrific because the hotel is so close to the River. Equally, there are plenty of great restaurants around Hotel 71, including Mortons and Corner Bakery. Make sure to ask the hotel staff about Windella river cruises, which are a stones throw away from the location. Equally, the decor of the hotel is fabulous, with an ultra-modern lobby, full of trendy pictures and lighting. Chances are, you won't even need a cab to get around because Hotel 71 is so close to everything. Situated right on the Chicago River, and a block away from the magnificent mile, it's easy to spend a whole afternoon just people watching. I highly reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for an upscale, classy hotel with affordable pricing in the windy city.
