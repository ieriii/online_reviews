Atmosphere--good. Beer--gooood! Oysters with hard cider, blue cheese, leeks, and pear--deserves my "Award of Awesomeness!" The wait--can be bad, unless you go during an off-time. (The first time the hubs and I went there, it was on a Sunday around 4pm--about an hour wait. The second attempt was on a Saturday around 2pm--no wait because we opted for the bar).
