Authentic Szechauan style food with lots of flavors. My favorite is the String green beans with baby prawns, very spicy. I also like the spicy sole fish dish, Chufun noodle with lean pork, salt and pepper seafood delight is wonderful! Don't forget to try the spicy lamb dish and hot boiled beef or pork. This is my family's favorite restaurant. If you are brave, try the frog dish it's pretty good!!
