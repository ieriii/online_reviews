I took a friend who was visiting Chicago for the first time, from Buenos Aires. I had watched a great segment about The Purple Pig on the TV show 24/7 with Catie Keogh and Pete McMurray -- everything looked great. Key word, "looked."  We sat at the bar and I asked about the Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg app. The "waiter" said he never heard of it, didn't know anything about it. I thought this guy was joking but he was just that clueless, a very rude little man with facial hair.  After he disappeared we began ordering from a stocky woman with a big frown on her face, very unenthusiastic to be working there.  I was embarrassed to have taken my friend to such a unwelcoming place as that's not how Chicago should be represented. Not only that, but the food sounded great on the menu, but they failed in the execution.  Everything tasted like they'd poured sea salt all over it, the cheese menu is uninspired and the meats, dull. As we ate the plates began to pile up and they were never removed. I had to push them to the side myself and as I was doing so, the little man said, "Oh did you want me to remove those?" Hmmm. Did I want him to remove a bunch of dirty, empty plates? Um, yeah, Einstein!  Ridiculous.  As I was picking up my car across the street at the hotel valet I asked if he'd ever been to the Purple Pig and he said no. I said "Don't bother!" He said most people say that.  So what's with all the great reviews on Yelp? Are they paid to say this place is great? Bottom line: Over-hyped, overpriced -- skip the Pig.
