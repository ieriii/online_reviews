AMAZING. I literally had to look up "delicious" in a thesaurus for this review. Went around 8pm on a Friday night, and had to wait nearly 50 mins for a table for 5 people... but honestly, that was to be expected. We were kept entertained by the great beer selection (Matilda, anyone?) and the extensive menu. First: the guacamole looks tiny but is incredibly delectable. It isn't watered down with fresh tomatoes, and is just creamy tasty goodness with the crispy, well-seasoned chips. I had a pork belly vermicelli caldo for the main event. Rick Bayless, a man after my own heart. That hot, sweet, savory experience of a caldo, combined with the bites of duck caldo, and pepito torta that I tried, made the perfect entree experience. Lastly, the churros y chocalate... OBV a must-try. The churros are fried crispy and crunchy with sugar. And well, the hot chocolate... Heaven. You know it's real when the chocolate isn't sweet - just pure rich _chocolate_. Perfect for dipping and sipping. And all so incredibly affordable. I can't stop raving about this place and will definitely be going back just to get more off that menu. Agh!! AND they had filtered sparkling water ON TAP for you to help yourself. Seriously. Perfection.
