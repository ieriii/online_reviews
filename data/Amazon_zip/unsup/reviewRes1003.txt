Hot doug's is fine. It's good encased meats and nothing all that much more. Do I have to praise the place because many are fool enough to wait 45 minutes or longer to get in? Frank N dogs is truly better product and made in house. I don't think Doug makes his dogs...maybe I'm wrong, but most of his stuff is purchased from local purveyors...good ones, yes, but he's not growing his animals and grinding his meat. It's really good stuff, nothing more, nothing less.
