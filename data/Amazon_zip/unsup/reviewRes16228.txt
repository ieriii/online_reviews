Never had a bad experience. They have 3 Floyds on tap and the lobster ravioli is delicious. Sunday through Thursday, they have the Ribs special. You NEED to get this, Full slab of delicious ribs for $9.95 with garlic mashed potatoes as the side. SOOO good. They also give you a little extra spicey sauce on the side, for an extra sauciness deliciousness.
