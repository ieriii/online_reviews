The fries made me sad today. They were alittle limp like a poop. The dogs were still steller, mmm. I got the smoked shrimp and pork dog with goat milk butter (which my friends, is a liquid orgasm, seriously. I love goat butter.) with havarti garlic cheese. Please make the fries hard, no one likes limp fries.
