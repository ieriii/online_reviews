Seriously good mexican food. Open your top button ahead of time. The meal starts with something on a plate with beans and beef and a corn tortilla...DELICIOUS. Chips, salsa, DELICIOUS. Chile Rellenos: DELICIOUS. Everything I've had there...wait for it...DELICIOUS. This is authentic. Worried about the neighborhood? DON'T - There's always like 25 cops in there eating. If it goes down, this is where you wanna be. Protected by blues with guns and great food.
