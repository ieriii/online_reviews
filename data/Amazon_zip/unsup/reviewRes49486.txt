Got the bloomspot - three courses. WIll I go back and pay full price? Definitely.  Cheese plate was great...Scallop entree was really good. Unusual but good. Scallops on bacon cream with beet croquettes and an espresso foam. Not sure who thought to put those flavors together, but it worked...well. Dessert was great. Red velvet cake with raspberry cream cheese ice cream. All of our wines were tasty. Skip the lamb sausage and have something else for an appetizer...it was meh. But the salmon/mozzerella was great.  All in all, good experience, good service (our waiter was Chris and always hit my wine preference head on) and the food was good.  Take note - to me, the menu was fairly limited with entrees. They had skirt steak, 1/2 of a chicken, and a pork chop with three seafood dishes and one veggie dish. I think I just expected more? But, whatev. I guess when you really look at it, you should go there more for cheese and wine cause IT'S SOOOO GOOD!
