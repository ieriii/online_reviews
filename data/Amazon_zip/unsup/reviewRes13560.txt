Glenn's is no typical diner. Not in the least. This place has the best and freshest seafood in the city. I swear. I am so lucky to live very, very close to this amazing establishment. The first time I ventured over was with my mom and brother, who were in town to help me move. Amazing. We arrived in time for the before 6 fish special-I believe its 12.95 for a half pound of amazingly fresh fish, soup and salad. Sooo good and a steal. I went back on Friday night with 2 friends. This time we dined in late-with plenty of wine on hand. I had the ahi tuna-amazing and they both had the scallops. Everything was soo good. The scallops were seriously the best I have had outside of Seattle. The tuna was also really, really good. We all pretty much came close to licking our plates. Yum. We had a very nice waitress as well, even though we got a bit tipsy and were one of 2 tables left-while they were closing for the night-she never seemed annoyed in the slightest. If you have not been, you must go!
