Love The Hopleaf!!! My favorite part about this place is their outdoor space in the summertime! It's a great place to spend the evening with friends over a great glass of beer! Over the years I have always been impressed with their consistency in their food and drink selections. The food is always great, and being a huge "world beer" fan, I love all that they offer. With their new addition that they added, I can only see the Hopleaf getting bigger and better. Another wonderful thing about this place, is that the owners Mike and Louise are HUGE supporters of their neighborhood and community. You always can find them helping to host of sponsor a brunch to benefit an organization or person who is either in need or just trying to raise money for a good cause. They owners are true gems of the Andersonville neighborhood, and more business owners in this neighborhood should take note! They also are huge supporters of neighborhood public schools. Go Hopleaf! Thank you for being such a great establishment in Andersonville.
