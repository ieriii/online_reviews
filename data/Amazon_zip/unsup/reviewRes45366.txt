I would like to live here. No, seriously. Beer, comfy chairs, fireplaces, and a library. I pretty much could weather a Chicago winter here. It's really the perfect winter bar. I am a low-key pub type of person--I like to actually be able to hear my companions on a Friday night, and I much perfect kicking back in chairs than standing in stilettos. Wilde is a perfect place for that. GREAT beer list--I love that they have Delirium Tremens, Purple Haze, and Mothership. Seriously--who doesn't get a kick out of ordering the Mothership? And they get credit for having Washington wines on their wine list. I've only had appetizers here, but I love the sweet potato fries. Definitely a place to check out and ride out the Chicago winter.
