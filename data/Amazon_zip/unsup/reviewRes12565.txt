I have been to TDB many times. This past weekend was my first time back since it's renovation. Maybe it was just overly crowded because of Restaurant Week, but I felt like the server was a little absent. Usually, I'm always offered a fresh plate and the potatoes and bananas are refreshed without being asked. There seemed to be a much longer lag time between trips to our section of the restaurant. I was disappointed to see that the salad bar had been downsized. While I go for the meat, I always boasted to friends that were fans of other Brazilian Steakhouses how the options at TDB are much more plentiful.  I would return but maybe on a slower night so we get more attention from our server and the gauchos. I didn't get a chance to sample the lamb chops before I was already stuffed!
