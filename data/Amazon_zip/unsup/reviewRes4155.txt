this place was awesome. the waiters / servers got me really drunk. i think the menu comes with drinks or something. We meant to byob but we were in a rush and forgot. there was a truffle ravioli .. which i still remember tasted like HEAVEN. hahahah. all the food was delicious EXCEPT one dish that has that.... smell... i forgot what its called... but dont wear nice clothes to this place cus it made my jacket and my clothes smell for like 2 weeks after... it was some smoky dish... that didnt taste very good. other than that, great experience. hard to find parking around the area though. the area seems ghetto.... lol.
