Nice continental breakfast. Place is really clean and bed really live up to it's advertisement......COMFY!! Place is located at a very nice spot in downtown chicago, there are several attraction within 1 mile of the place, like Willis tower, state street, michigan ave, etc. The only thing that sucks, is parking.... it's 36 bucks!!! a day!
