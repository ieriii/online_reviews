l called the Lockdown false metal on here before, but my review was taken down because I was only responding to the fact that they listed Nickelback in their "show calendar". Good people of Yelp, I can assure you that as of last night I have actually been to the Lockdown. I have tasted its overpriced Jim Beam rocks. I have sampled its watered down prison ketchup. I have been served by its lackadaisical waiters who say the fuck-word in an attempt to be edgy. I have listened to its shitty sound system butcher a good Slayer set. I have been blinded by its television-to-wall ratio. Don't forget to drop the soap in the bathroom.
