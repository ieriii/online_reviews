My favorite bar in Chicago. Period. To preface, my favorite bar in the country is Milk and Honey in NYC. Thankfully, the creative minds from Milk and Honey and the Pegu Club teamed up with the geniuses behind Blackbird and Avec to bring the art of the true cocktail to Chicago--a refreshing reprieve from the monotonous fried-food mongering sports bars that over-infest the streets of our fair city. The interior has been described as "Alice in Wonderland"-ish...sure I'll go with that. The drinks are spectacular, but as the Prohibition era cocktail thing is just being rediscovered in Chicago, the drink menu does not nearly have the breadth and the bartenders are not quite as virtuosic as their counterparts in New York. Needless to say, I'll give the guys some slack, they're still in training, and they have been trained well. In a few months I'm sure the products of their cocktail shakers will be as smooth as sounds from Coltrane's sax. My favorite drinks are the Whiskey Smash and the Gold Rush (not on the menu, ask Tobey to make it for you if he's around). One major problem I have with this place is that, unlike Milk and Honey, you can't call ahead to make reservations; instead of a "secret phone number" there is no phone number at all....cute. As a warning, this isn't a pick up joint, or a slammed crazy bar, but rather a place to enjoy a great cocktail... with a side of conversation.
