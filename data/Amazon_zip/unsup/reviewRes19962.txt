White Dragon Roll is the best thing ever!!! I seriously order two of these for the table whenever I go here. They are to die for. Another one that surprisingly good are the sweet potato rolls. Trust me, they seem weird but they are yummy. It's BYOB which is really nice, but the decor is a little bit too upscale looking for me. I wear jeans and a nice shirt here everytime, and yet I feel underdressed everytime I go. Oh well. The waitstaff could be a bit faster here too. It's not a very big place, and yet I always feel like when I need something, no one is around.
