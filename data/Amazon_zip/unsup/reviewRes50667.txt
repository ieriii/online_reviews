The Darling suggested breakfast at this place last Saturday, late morning, after we've driven by it for a year and a half with all good intentions. Found a parking spot a block away and were seated immediately in the side room. Service was okay but nothing special. Server took away plates on time but did not offer to refill my iced tea. Time waiting to receive food was short and the amount of food was fine. However, the taste (eggs, pancakes, toast) was kinda blah and required lots of salt and pepper. Being that the order was not too adventurous (i.e., standard breakfast fare), I could've created something perkier for my taste buds at home.  It didn't help that the guy at the next table was borderline obnoxious. We just don't care about your sister's trip to Europe and how much it costs to move a piano and how much you're trying to impress your new best friend. MIGHT try Wishbone again, but only if in the area and starving. Too bad, it's got a great location, a cute bar, and clever kitsch and color (the "egg" ceiling lights are cool).
