BEWARE. STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. They quoted us promotion rate of $150 a night and then sent me a $700 bill. They claim they never quoted us this rate and will wouldn't change the rate. They have a poor excuse for customer service. This is the second time I've had an issue with them. Their front desk is unreliable and unorganized. They can't keep track of their own invoice numbers. Also no free wifi.
