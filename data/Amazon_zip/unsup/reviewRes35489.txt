Until this psat week, I'd always eaten in the more formal dining room at Shaw's. And that was fine. Service was good, atmosphere was lovely as I nibbled at my crab cakes. But then this week? When I sat in the more casual Oyster Bar? Even better. It's a great setting for lunch since it's less stuffy than the other room. We sat with the kitchen right behind us, which made it easy to view everyone's orders (and help determine what we wanted to eat). I don't think I've ever gone wrong ordering here, but I still wanted to get a look at all of the food coming out of the kitchen. We order mini crab cakes for an appetizer (how can you not?) and the buffalo shrimp. I could have done without the latter, mostly because I am not really a buffalo sauce person. For my entree, I had the seafood chopped salad (which is what I ALWAYS get for lunch at Shaw's). And every time, it's delicious. But the fish tacos were sort of calling my name too. One of the other people at the table ordered them and I they did look yummy. And when tempted with $1-2 mini desserts, you have to order something, right? I chose the vanilla ice cream, but the raspberry pie was also really tasty (I had a bite from someone else).
