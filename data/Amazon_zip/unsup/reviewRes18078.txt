Dining here for the first time on a blustery and wet November evening, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The calamari appetizer was well prepared but was pushed to a new level with a good dose of chopped garlic (garlic makes everything better). I had the lobster ravioli in a cream sauce, which was nicely done, except for the few strips of sun dried tomatoes. The tomatoes were out of place texturally, and I felt their intensity clashed with the subtle taste of the lobster filling. I just avoided eating them (although I do love sun dried tomatoes). For dessert, I had their lemon tartufo. This was a very light lemon gelato ball with limoncello. Very delicious, even if it was served without the meringue crumbles. I have mixed feelings about the service. Let me explain: when I arrived, a few minutes early, I was greeted immediately and when seated, asked if I would like something to drink. Good thing, because I wanted coffee, which I received promptly. My friend arrived a few minutes after me, and not seeing me sat on the other side of the (very dark) restaurant. No one greeted her initially -- she said she stood at the entrance for at least a minute -- nor was she asked if she wanted anything after sitting. The difference in the level of service was confounding. (We found each other when she called me, wondering where I was, since I'm rarely late.) It's possible that she seated herself in a section that wasn't being utilized, but even so she should have been greeted. I moved myself over to her table, and after that things went smoothly. Another little problem: I just discovered that they wrapped up my friend's leftovers instead of mine. Great, I'll get to try the stuffed gnocchi! Good thing she's a CLOSE friend of mine, otherwise, ewww. Still, overall, it was a fine experience, with good food. I'll be back to try their other dishes, for sure!
