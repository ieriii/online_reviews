In a way they're dumb, because clearly they could have learned from certain "local markets" that you could give away an item like sweet potato fries for free, and then charge $20 a pop the next time the customer needs a fix. Anyway, they are into a different sort of local market here - lots of local produce and meat, which is awesome. Also a pretty decent beer and wine list... overall it's pretty damn close to 5 stars, but maybe every so slightly off in service once in a while and every so slightly a little bit pricey. Not enough to have kept me from eating here a million times though. And yeah, sweet potato fries ftw.
