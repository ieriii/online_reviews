My husband and I went here for the first time last year...right before going to see Mary Poppins. The place is fun, festive, colorful, and the food is definately a blissful taste fusion for tastebuds! The wait staff was ALWAYS very informative about the dishes, the first time we went and everytime since. The first time we visited my husband had Remolochas and Ropa Vieja, and I had the Arrachera, a couple martinis and margharitas...The dessert was some bannas foster decandent heavenly good as all get out! We were seated in the front dining room next to the window which a perfect blend of atmosphere and expressway. Its been awhile since and we are definately do for another visit.
