Everything you read about this place is true --- long lines, good food, great place. On a busy day, you will wait a half-hour plus! I suggest you bring a game or something while you are in line. It will help make the time pass by more quickly. I played "What's in my pocket?" with my friend. Wait, that sounds dirty...it wasn't. They have veggie options -- which is nice. And their fries are DELISH, y'all. Get 'em with the cheese -- you'll thank me later. Be warned though - CASH ONLY. And no cash machine in sight. It's 2010, Doug --- time for a credit card machine.
