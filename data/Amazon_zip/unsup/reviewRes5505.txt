Have been here many times and each meal has been excellent. I would give it 6 stars if I could. It's small (intimate) and often busy, so I'm always prepared to wait with a glass of wine. The braised milk pork shoulder, beets with goat cheese, cheese list, and smears are all excellent. Great wine and beer list. Communal tables and super-friendly staff who really take the time to explain the menu or suggest a wine make for a memorable meal every time!
