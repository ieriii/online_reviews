The food is really good. My Workingman's burger was cooked perfectly, and I really wish I could have eaten the other half of it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to procure a to-go box as the only bartender working ignored me for fifteen minutes. I work at a bar across the street and try to stop in before my 5:30 shift starts for a beer and a bite (after my other full-time job downtown) every chance I get.* This afternoon, I came in and asked the bartender how long it would take since I needed to get to work soon. Got the burger and the beer and then my bartender disappeared. I tried to make get the attention of the other bartender for FIFTEEN MINUTES (I'm not exaggerating here, I looked at my watch at 5:13 and decided I needed to leave at 5:28 when I realized she wasn't going to bother with me). She proceeded to go around and around the island bar, checking in on other customers and serving new ones that just walked in, all the while ignoring my gaze. Maybe it was because the now absent bartender had taken my order and she wanted him to get the tip. Perhaps it was because I just didn't look cool enough, or attractive enough. Or I just wasn't worth the time because I looked poor and maybe I wouldn't tip. Thing is, every time I go in there, it's the same damn thing, I have to fight for attention just to get my friggin' bill, even when it's not busy (just as it wasn't this afternoon). And I'm not one of those people that always complain about service - I've worked in food service, I know what that's like. But I'm apparently not worth Revolution's time. So frankly, they're not worth my time anymore. And the beer sucks, anyway. *When I can afford a $12 burger.
