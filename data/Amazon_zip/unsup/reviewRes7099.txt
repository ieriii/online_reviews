This is one of my favorite restaurants for dinner in the city. I've been going here for years and I will continue to do so as long as I live in Chicago. This place is nice but not stuffy, urban but still cozy, roomy but still intimate. And the food is amazing. I always try to take people here when they are in town, I feel like it is a good representation of the northside neighborhoods (if that makes any sense). I've tried a lot of different things on the menu but my favorites include: * Stella salad * pumpkin/butternut squash ravioli * gnocchi with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and pesto * caprese salad * avocado appetizer * pasta stuffed with lobster and a creamy tomato sauce The servers area always so nice and you never have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table (if you have to wait at all). They have cool art on the walls (some of which are brick exposed), simple decor, and sometimes they have a jazz band play. It's a gem and has a personal feel to it.
