I know these high-end speakeasies are all the rage right now, but I have yet to decide if I am a fan. This place was definitely interesting, and the mood created by the setting was enjoyable for our crew. It seems that, unless seated at the bar, every seating arrangement puts you into severe isolation. From every seat you basically can't see anyone outside of your party, which is great if you are on an intimate date or with a group of cozy friends. The drinks, as warranted by the $12 price tag, were both stiff and delicious (and more than a few original). I was won over by the dark & stormy, made with house-made ginger syrup. The crowd favorite at our table though, was the Juliet & Romeo. The drinks took a while to arrive, but our waitress was extremely nice and very well educated on all the drinks. Not a weekly hang out, but definitely a good spot for special visits.
