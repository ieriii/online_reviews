Oh Sabatino's..... What could have been 5 stars is more like 2 1/2. Arrived on a Friday night at 7:45pm with an 8pm reservation for a party of 13. We were told that it wasnt 8pm and we needed to wait. The bar area was packed and there was nowhere to sit/stand. The majority of the group just stood in the door and passage ways. I decided to wet my whistle with a drink and TOTALLY regret doing so. It was awful. BLEH After FINALLY sitting down at 8:30pm, I was pleasantly surprised (huge exaggeration) to see that we were sitting the first table off from the kitchen with my grouchy father sitting right in the line of fire for every waiter and waitress to bump into his chair. The restaurant was packed and EXTREMELY loud. There were times when we were screaming at each other across the table because you just couldnt hear. It could have been the tight cramped quarters that we were in but it was LOUD, nonetheless. The decor is awful. I felt like I was back in the 70's... I asked the waitress to bring me a second drink and she did.... right down my back... lovely. The only reason I did give it 3 stars (which I would have loved to make 2 1/2) was the food, It was absolutely delicious. Outstanding even. The pizza bread app was great. The clams were fantastic!! I has the chicken (menuiere?) and it was unbelievable!! My mothers shrimp dejoung was good too!! The only bad things about the food were the salad (because the Italian dressing was awful) and the baked potato (because they never brought it out to me). So I guess if you are going for the food... good. Just try to sit in the corner and keep your eyes closed...
