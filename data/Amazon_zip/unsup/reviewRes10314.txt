With over 1000 reviews Piece doesn't need my two cents ... but it seems unfair to slight my favorite pizza place in Chicago. This is big pizza, big bar, big screen TV, and big tables. Waitresses in black buzz through the crowd handing out food and beer to noisy gatherings of friends. Here is why I make my way to the Damon stop on the Blue Line: 1) Sheets of Pizza: Huge rectangular aluminum pans with an expanse of pizza whose crust manages to be both light and chewy. It's pizza that tastes great and goes down easy. If you've suffered through deep dish overdose or thin crust starvation ... this is the pizza savior for your hungry soul. 2) Plain Pizza: No cheese dude. Red sauce and toppings. Man up and create something with anchovies, spinach, sauteed mushroom and goat cheese. That doesn't suit? Try the white pizza. No tomato sauce dude. 3) The Complete Experience: Noisy and happy, this is Wicker Park inside a pizza place. Add a decent selection of beers, big salad, and a slice of carrot cake to that huge sheet of tasty pizza ... and life will be good.
