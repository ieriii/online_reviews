This is a huge hotel that does a lot of convention business. However, we stayed here for pleasure and were very pleased. The rooms are decent size and clean with a modern decor. The staff is friendly and efficient and the location cannot be beat. There is a huge contemporary bar, appropriately named the Big Bar, a Pub, as well as a bistro and steakhouse on site. There is also a nice patio common area to relax at if you want to chill outdoors. The hotel is near Michigan Ave., Millennium Park, the Riverwalk and within walking distance to Navy Pier, the L, etc. I also appreciated the convenience of a very nice grocery store next door. Great property, great location!
