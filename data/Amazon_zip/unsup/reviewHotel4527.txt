Great place for the price. $219.00 a night on the executive level floors with two bathrooms and two full size beds. It also included breakfast and h'deorves in the evening.  The architecture is beautiful but the hotel is dated and doesn't seem to know its true identity. The new Spa that opened was 4$$$$ expensive for what was received. Better going to a off site nail salon or massage parlor for real spa treatments at better prices.
