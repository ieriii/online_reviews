I don't get the stellar reviews for this place. Went this weekend w/family who was in town for a visit. I know it's super touristy and crowded, so my expectations weren't overly high. But, the reservation process is a joke (nonexistent) and the service is HORRIBLE. They herd you in and out like cattle. They make their money with the incredible turnover and it shows. We had a team of people rushing around and slamming plates, menus and glasses down. After about 30 seconds, we were asked if we were ready to order our appetizers...and literally TWO MINUTES after placing our dinner order, the plates were smacked down in front of us. The minute we finished eating, the check was tossed on the table. Some people might appreciate the quickness, but I felt completely rushed and pushed out the door. Loud, crowded, impersonal. The food was good, not great.
