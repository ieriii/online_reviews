My boyfriend and I stumbled into this place after reaching Chicago close to 11 pm. We were met with incredible service , authentic sangria, and angel hair pasta to die for!! Besides the bag for your buck, the cozy atmosphere is perfect for dinner for two. Also seems like a great place to catch up with friends ( again, over the sangria carafe)
