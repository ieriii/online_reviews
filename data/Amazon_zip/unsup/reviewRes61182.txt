Gino's East has joined the ranks of other big name deep dish pizzerias. They no longer are deep dish, they are just a thick crust pizza. Including their frozen pizza. More dough and sauce. less cheese and meat. It will be a sad day when Chicago loses its deep dish title, because these pizzerias are cutting corners due to the economy. These big pizzerias will lose loyal customers.  I'm sure they will gain customers who never really had a deep dish.
