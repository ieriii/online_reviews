This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went here for the Tapas. Being first-timers at this restaurant, we decided to take our waiters suggestions. We ordered about 4 different plates, and each one that came out was better than the one before. It was also more than enough food to keep the two of us full for the rest of the night. On top of the food, the service and great and it's a very romantic and cozy atmosphere. But that's not all....the best part is that at the end of our meal our waiter presented us with a contact card that asks for our name, email, mailing address and birthday. Since then I have received one $14 gift card thanking me for our service and recently received another $15 gift card for my upcoming birthday. If that's not great customer service, I don't know what is.
