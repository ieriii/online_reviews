We went here on Monday, March 1st 2010. Their beer is decent - but not outstanding Their beer selection (guest draft / can / bottle) is good. Their food is decent - not outstanding, ESPECIALLY considering the price. The liquor prices are right on, the food prices are outrageous. This place is about hype, hype, HYPE - it's getting two stars because of the decor. P.S. when you sit at the booths on the south side of the room, you can see the top ledge of the bar - which is dusty. Seriously? P.P.S. the musical selection is awful and so is the sound.
