Horribly overpriced food with excellent service. For two people with one cheap drink each, the bill was $129.95. For that money, you get (with the seafood platter, not the most expensive item on the menu, and no a la carte):1. Three pieces of lettuce with two slices of cucumber as a salad (one salad per person)2. Cheese fondue with 4 small slices of apple, two small slices of pear, 6 grapes, and 4 cubes of bread.3. Fondue dinner with 6 scallops total, 6 shrimp, two small wads of supposedly shaved lobster, 5 mushrooms, some sliced onion, sliced green pepper, two potato cubes, and 8 dipping sauces.4. Chocolate fondue with 6 triangles of pineapple, 6 cubes of apple, 4 cubes of pound cake, and 6 quarter-sized pieces of banana. That's all you get for $129.95. Not even half an apple for two people. Very small portions with a very limited selection.The atmosphere was loud, cramped, but still romantic. The service is the best in Chicago. Very friendly people that are genuinely interested in making you happy.The food is, by far, the worst for your money in Chicago. Six shrimp, six scallops, some shaved lobster the size of an iphone, a quarter of an apple, and a couple of cubes of bread for two people at $129.95. Just horrible and insulting for a fondue place where you cook your own food on a stick.The service is, by far, the best in Chicago. It's quite a dichotomy of a restaurant, but stay away since you now know that the price for the food will ruin your night (if you're the one paying, that is).
