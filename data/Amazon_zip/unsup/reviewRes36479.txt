The food here is great, and there's something for every palate. They have great wraps and great breakfast food. Their pancakes are sinful and something I crave on a regular basis. The restaurant has some charm, and has a great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the waitstaff here is pitiful. I have been here on more than one occasion when I have waited over 20 minutes for a check after my dishes have been cleared, even after asking for it. I have watched other tables throw money on the table and leave after not getting their check. This may be what I do next time. When I come, I always make sure I can spare more than an hour for lunch because you may be in a rush and may mention that, but no one will care. Their takeout is also great.
