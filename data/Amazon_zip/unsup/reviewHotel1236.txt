the best part of staying here is close to the McCormick Convention Center, no need to wait in Taxi or Shuttle line after the show. Yet, NO 2nd Selection of RESTAURANT Is the down fall for this hotel. After eating there everyday for breakfast, you will get sick of thinking going into their ONLY RESTAURANT.
