Although its not really as good as it gets,I give it high marks for consistently good food and service. But especially the decor! It a fun place. the lava cake is really good and so is the key lime tart with the ginormous meringue cap. I have eaten here many many times and never a complaint, and i am kinda picky! Give it a try! Its very nice during the holiday season with all the lights outside on the avenue. In the same building there is an awesome European Furniture store that has great prices and terrific selection I love every store in this building....Marshall's and Linens & Things
