Food - very good, but not life changing Service - Very good Atmosphere - Dark as everyone else has already mentioned. Cramped quarters; depending on what table you get seated at. Some of the tables are very small and have very little room around them, and that room is constantly occupied by servers rushing by. There is a very distinct aroma to this place and due to the cramped quarters (ie no ventilation) you walk out of there completely saturated in this "unique" aroma so don't plan on going anywhere after dinner without changing your clothes or people will be wondering where that smell is coming from everywhere you go. Price - Overpriced period. I was first directed to this place by a groupon. Even with groupon in hand I feel that I overpayed.
