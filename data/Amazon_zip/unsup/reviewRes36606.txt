Finally ate in (instead of take away) and had the sushi here. It was pretty good, but nothing special. I had a spicy tuna roll, a Boston roll (tuna/avocado) and a mango/avocado/cucumber roll. The latter was very good, as was the Boston, but the spicy tuna had sort of a weird texture to it, that I didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping I would. 6 rolls (I had 3/BF had 3) Crab rangoon (best in the city, hands down) 2 iced teas $52.00 (including tip) - I think that's quite reasonable! Maybe next time I'll just get one roll, crab rangoon and some pad thai.
