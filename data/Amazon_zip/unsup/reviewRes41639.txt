Pho tai is no longer what I always get here! I've been on a "let me try anything else but pho" kick lately! Pho for me is now a cold-weather comfort dish!  I discovered the grilled marinated pork and grilled marinated beef sandwiches that are made on the freshest, crunchiest french bread! Veggies include cucumbers, cilantro, jalapeno, sour carrots and radishes, and green onion.  I also love the vermicelli combination which is eaten kind of cold with lots of raw veggies (I love veggies!!) and a homemade lemon fish sauce that you toss in and mix everything together. The combination plate comes with plenty of meat including marinated beef, shrimp, grilled pork patty, and an egg roll. Toss everything together and you're set to dig in! -------------------- All I ever get here is the Pho tai (with beef) and it's great every time! Occasionally if I'm truly starving, I'll order a Vietnamese sandwich to share as an appetizer... it's the one with pork! They are always busy and you might have to share a table if you want to be seated sooner. The food still comes out pretty quick and we're in and out of there.  Great food, quick service, and cheap!
