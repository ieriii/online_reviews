Meat. With a side of meat. And more meat. Pineapple. Meat. My husband and I have been here a few times. Skip the salad bar, skip the sides (except the Brazilian cheesy bread & mashed potatoes) and eat some meat. The only thing I don't like about this place is their red wine decanters. If you're a party of 4, I would advise against ordering something that has to be decanted because they are ginormous and it really takes up a lot of space on the table, and so blocks some of the view of your companions. Other than that small detail, everything here is amazing. Every time we come, every person is so friendly. In a place where the customer comes into contact with SO many staff members, you need to make sure that everyone does their job well. And Brazzaz makes that happen. Well done guys!
