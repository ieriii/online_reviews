yum! lot of good stuff here. i had the veggie burrito the steak pepito, spinach and cheese empanada, beef and potato empanada, and plantain empanada. the veggie burrito was great and grilled with a perfect layer of crisp on the outside. pay the extra dollar and add spinach! you won't regret it. just a great mishmash of ingredients. the only complaint would be that it was a little too heavy on the rice. the steak pepito was godo too. a little too salty, but the cheesiness and the soft chewy bread were fantastic. each empanada was fried to perfection and the filling hot, delicious and satisfying. the best was the spinach and cheese, though the other two were fantastic too. the guacamole was simple and not terribly flavorful, but i know some people like when guac retains its mainly avocado flavor, so that might be good anyway. the salsa verde was also great. so spicy and went well with everything. service was good and sitting outside to eat was fun. the prices were so great that we all ate too much and didn't have room for an oatmeal shake! but i will be back to try it!
