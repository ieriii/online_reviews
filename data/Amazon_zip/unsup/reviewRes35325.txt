I mean, are you kidding me with this? No better value in the city. The food was AMAZING, the portions were GIANT, and despite having a full bar, you can byob for a nominal corkage fee ($5). There were 4 of us. We shared duck 3 ways, bok choy, bbq pork and tempura scallops. We couldn't finish it. Seriously, giant duck legs just sitting on the plate untouched as we all sat there rubbing our bellies. Final bill was less than $100, including tax and tip. All of the staff were friendly and helpful -- we let our waiter order for us and he definitely did not steer us wrong. I had made a reservation and then emailed to change it twice to add more people -- each time I received a cheerful and accommodating response from Kelly, ending with a "quack quack."  On a related note -- reservations are highly recommended. This place is packed on a Friday night!
