We went Saturday night, and although crowded, were lucky enough to get seated immediately. The service was quick and attentive. The beer was excellent, I had Festivus and Camel Toe, both high gravity beers and both 4 out of 5. The pizza was very good, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. It was pie cut, which most places don't do; and you almost had to fold it to eat it (nearly - nearly NY style). We had chicken and fresh tomato on the pie, with the only negative note coming from my wife who thought the tomato's were under ripe and didn't add much tomato flavor to the pie. Finally, we enjoyed some band-led karaoke, which was interesting. Overall, a solid 4+ stars for great beer, excellent pizza and fun atmosphere.
