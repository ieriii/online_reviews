I have a long history with Tru. I've been trying to recreate one of the most memorable dining experiences and one of the best dishes for the last seven years to disappointingly medicore results. As a consequence, I cannot recommend Tru due to its inconsistency and high price. The sexy but overly theatrical wall street circa 1986 inspired decor is a bit much. There are one or two too many servers per table. This gang bang approach to service seems to only work well in Asia and I would recommend they scale it back here in Chicago. Very tasty desserts are a consistently great finish to the meal, however.
