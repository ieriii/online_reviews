A great place to go as a couple or with a large group of friends. It's a good place to hit at night for some cocktails - it's fun when a group of friends all try flights of wine. They're good for just wine, a whole meal, or appetizers/dessert and wine. The food has excellent presentation. You don't feel pressured at all to eat a whole meal at Bin 36. I especially like their desserts - very creative. I don't care for the very small size of their cheese plates. The environment is like a light, elegant warehouse. The waitstaff is hit or miss. And it's true - a bottle while eating can be 3X the price than if you walk ten steps and buy it in the store and take it home.
