If you love fine dining and great steaks, then this is the place to go!!!! The food was outstanding and our waiter did a fantastic job! He made sure that we always had what we needed and kept our wine glasses full. Make sure you order a twice baked or mashed potatoes for your side dish because they are out of this world!!!!
