Spacca is good, if I could give it 3.5 stars I would. It's just not mind blowingly good, but I'll definitely go back! The crust is probably the best I've had in town for thin-crust, however pizza is not just all about the crust. Toppings were fresh, tasty and simple. My major complaint is the degree of sloppiness that occured at the center of the pizza, the crust simply didn't hold up under the weight of all the toppings. I typically refuse to eat pizza with a knife & fork, which made Spacca's pizza an interesting pizza-folding excercise. But once you master the pizza origami, it is quite good!
