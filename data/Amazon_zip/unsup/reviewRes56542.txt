Seriously, best food I've ever put in my mouth. Every bite was incredible! Killer margaritas, fresh guacamole, home made warm tortillas, and the best MOLE I could ever imagine. Our party of 4 all raved about their dishes, and it will be an experience we'll never forget! I'll never look at Mexican food the same again!
