I just went here for the second time this year. I think the best word to describe this place is charming. It is set in an old Gold Coast townhouse and a lot of the architecture and decor is very old Chicago. It's a great place to go with a bigger group and order everything family/tapas style. The menu is pretty lengthy and it is very suited to small plates ordering.
