Stumbled upon this place on a walk with my girlfriend. Awesome surprise! Great food, quick service, good atmosphere. I had the steak but I think I'll go w/ the chicken option....served w/ black beans, white rice, and great plantains. Only downfalls were limited seating and I'm pretty sure it didn't have a bathroom. I will be back there again.....fo sho.
