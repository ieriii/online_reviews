Wow, a very cool and fun place to be. I met some friends there yesterday evening for dinner. The atmosphere is incredible - great decor. Food, service, and drinks were great. We stayed much longer than expected because the jazz trio playing in the lounge was wonderful. I'm definitely returning soon...hopefully I could catch them playing again.
