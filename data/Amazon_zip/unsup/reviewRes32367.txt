Good food. Good service. Sitting at the sushi bar is pretty much the only option most of the time since they are always booked, which can be a little awkward. The other option was the seating in the middle which was even more awkward because you are sitting on stools which can be very uncomfortable. Besides being extremely pricey and hard to get good seating this place was pretty cool.
