I don't know about Nico M.'s experience but my waitress was so rude that it made her look ugly. She really had an attitude issue. When we first got there the hostess just looked at us like we were lost or something. I thought it was just her but when we were seated out waitress had an attitude issue as well. Lol. Ok so enough about the ugly waitresses...the food here is excellent!!! I didn't know what to order!! There was so much and it all sounded amazing!!! I got a Mango blast smoothie and it was so delicious!!! I could taste all of the fresh fruit. Refreshing!!! I decided to get the veggie omelet. Excellent!! Fresh veggies, cheese, nice size. And great potatoes. A little too salty but some ketchup covered up the salty taste. OK so I'm gonna sound like a fatty but I decided to get some strawberry stuffed french toast as well. I did share it with someone. Lol. Three giant pieces of french toast covered in strawberries!!! SOOOOOO GGOOOOOD!!!!! I didn't even have to put syrup on them. They were so good. Overall I loved the food here. SO DELICIOUS!!! I may not eat in just so I won't have to deal with the waitresses but I will definitely call in and pick up some food!!! YUMMERS!!!!
