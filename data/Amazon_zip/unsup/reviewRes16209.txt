Wow... So to start you atmosphere of Carnivale was unbelievable. I really did feel like I had left downtown Chicago and had stepped into some small Latin festival halfway around the world. Then after getting seated and having our server give us great recommendations we enjoyed a unique ricotta and toast appetizer, the beef shoulder and the tuna. All of which was very good despite some of our hesitation on certain vegetable and fruit combinations. We also ordered a couple different specialty drinks all of which went down much quicker than expected! After having a great dinner we decided to lounge in their bar for a few more drinks and good discussion which was also pleasant with its festive decor. Final words... even if this place had crapy service and atmosphere I would be back because the food was fabulous! Go taste some for yourself!
