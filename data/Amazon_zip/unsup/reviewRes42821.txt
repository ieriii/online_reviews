I'm not gonna lie, what initially drew me to choose this restraunt among the many pizza places in the area is because the have ice cream for delivery! I've ordered twice now, and both times were amazing. I love the different cheeses they offer for their pizzas. The first time I got the BBQ Chicken (with smoked gouda) and the 2nd time... I forget the name, but it's Prosciutto de Parma with arugula and shaved parmesean on top. The arugula is fresh and wonderful at delivery, but I'm not sure how it will re-heat. I also tried the Pao de quejo, but to me they were very strange, they have a raw dough texture, although they are cooked. Overall, I'll keep ordering from Fogo because I want to try all the different varieties!
