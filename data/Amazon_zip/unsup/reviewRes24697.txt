I've been in to Irazu a handful of times. I ran in tonight to grab a vegetarian burrito on the way home, as it's right down the street from me. The staff is always super nice, and usually I have the same server every time I go there. He's treats you like family, and is very persuasive. Definitely check out the Costa Rican rice.
