Super delicious cake! The next b-day cake I order is definitely going to be from here. Coffee and pastries are also top notch. A little more effort could be put into the lounge area next door in terms of ambiance. I was in there one day and they were playing this awful Stained/Nicklebackish music and it felt like a cruel joke to be in a room where the people who were controlling the music weren't the ones that had to listen to it.
