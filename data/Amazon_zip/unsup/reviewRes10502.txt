After living in Chicago for over two years, we finally found an Italian restaurant that we do not hesitate to recommend to our Italian friends. We are foodies who travel to Italy often, so we have a high standard and particular expectation when it comes to Italian cuisine. It truly was a revelation to find this place... it is indeed a little dream. We will be going back frequently.
