Yeah so just a couple of pointers on how you could improve: - Don't charge me more on the bill than the item is listed for on the menu, I don't care if it's $3, that's not cool! And what's even less cool is giving a snotty attitude when it's pointed out. - Waiter Mark, don't tap me on the back and ask "any dessert" as you are walking by w/o looking at me. That's rude anyway you cut it, and very reflective of the general service we received from you this evening. - Don't list your brushette as "with the evenings special topping," and then serve me toasted bread with runny tuna-salad and beans. I expected a little more for a $11 starter, if I want tuna on toast I have cans in my pantry at home. Overall food as such was lovely, the above incident just brought what could have been a nice evening down to a half-bad experience.
