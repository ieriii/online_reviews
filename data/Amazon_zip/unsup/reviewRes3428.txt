Chicken wings AND Asian food all in one delicious spot?! The first time I walked into Crisp, I was hit with such delicious aromas, making my hungry stomach growl as I waited (not very long at all) for my bibimbap aka the Baby Buddha Bowl. I skipped home in anticipation and was not disappointed! Soooo good! I always get the brown rice, a little healthier option, which is an extra $1.50, but worth it for my psyche. The Baby Buddha Bowl is definitely a big enough meal, but they also offer two larger bowls with more veggies. I can barely finish the baby bowl and have not yet graduated to the others though. It took a couple trips to Crisp before I could order the fatty deliciousness of Crisp's chicken. The Seoul Sassy is reaaaaallllllly good! The chicken was indeed very crispy - you can't take the skin off of this chicken; you would miss the whole point of the event! And the fried mushrooms with atomic sauce are reallllllly good too! One of the fattest meals I've had in awhile, but well worth it! (Mouth is watering right now!) And to all those who say it's not terribly authentic - I've seen more Korean patrons here than I've seen at "authentic" Korean restaurants, which means it must at least be a good fake! Also the staff is super friendly and accommodating, and the food is decently priced. Crisp won't help my "healthy '09" resolutions, but will definitely be on my cheat list!
