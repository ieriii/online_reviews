The Gods created Nuevo Leon for grad-school students with "champagne taste on a beer budget." LOVE IT. First off, it's BYOB. I love Chicago & it's byob friendly restaurants. Second, the food is authentic and delicious. Third, large portions. Fourth, there is always a surprise! Who doesn't like surprises?! Everytime you go, there will be a surprise complementary appetizer. One time in the dead cold of winter, it was a warming bowl of chicken soup w/ rice. Another time, it was a gourmet tortilla "cup" of a chip, filled w/ beans, guac, tomatoes, and cheese! On the weekends there is usually a line out the door. Locals know it, love it, frequent it. Kind of out of the way, and not easy to get to via CTA but totally worth the drive. Just remember they are CASH ONLY!
