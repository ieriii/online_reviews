Holy plantain bananas batman!!! I've only ever been here for breakfast, but this is my number #1 place in the AM for SURE. My fav is the stuffed french toast. If you like to Orchard Island OJ from trader Joe's, 28's OJ is better! I love the atmosphere, crowd, and staff. I've never ever had a bad meal experience here. Also, think flavorful as opposed to the first thing folks think about when they hear the word Cuban, spicy. Ow, they also can do espresso and have great breakfast cocktails. Other bonus is that it's off of the Irving Park Brownline stop that just reopened.
