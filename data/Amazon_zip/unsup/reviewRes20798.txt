Okay, food is right on. Rick Bayless has always had a amazing sense of what true Mexican tastes like. I love the idea that a fast/casual spot can still produce great tasting food. My sister and I dined here on weeknight; around 5:00 p.m. No line, service was a bit slow, but the food made up for that. We shared chips and guac (please everyone knows Bayless makes an amazing guac..and it was amazing). We then shared the XOCO salad with a great citrusy dressing and then shared Ahodaga torta. We both loved the flavor combination of the pickled onions, chile sauce and tender pork. We ended with a churro..it was okay. Smoky, chipotle, fresh, clean with a slight bit of heat are the flavors I still remember.  I will be heading back at some point as I am dying to sample the variety of hot chocolates.
