This place is sooooo romantic! It would make an amazing date but no boy would ever take me here *le sigh* : ( I went with my girlfriend for a special occasion and it was so good! they have a guy playing pretty spanish guitar music that really sets the mood. It takes awhile to eat cuz you are cooking your food, so it is real easy to get tipsy on wine. So be careful walking home ladies. You just might be i nthe mood for luv!
