For beer lovers - this place is right on. Their beer menu is super-extensive. I drink wine and while the selection was limited, they had some good choices. They also have a very extensive burger list and I tried the peanut butter & bacon burger and it was pretty good...a tad over-cooked but the flavors were right on.  The service was very good and the atmosphere was energetic. Very kid friendly except for the fact that they don't serve dessert. Once our friend's 2 year old finished her dinner, she was ready for ice cream. I think if they could have some cookies on hand and ice cream in the freezer...just for their kids menu, that would be helpful. They also have a nice patio.
