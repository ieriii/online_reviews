I made my way to The Publican on August 10th for two reasons: 1. Awesome chef Daniel Klein was the featured guest chef documenting the experience for his The Perennial Plate series and 2.The Publican was raved about on Check Please. I truly enjoyed the selections from Daniel Klein. I never thought I would be able to say that I enjoyed eating duck heart! Despite these positive highlights, I will not return to The Publican because the service my four dining companions and I received was awful. Our waiter was a Paul Bunyan/ Noah Wiley lookalike named Andrew who was inattentive and acted as if he would rather not be bothered with us. My friend requested bread immediately after we were seated. When it did not arrive, she signaled him from across the room as he chatted away with another server. Andrew raised his index finger to her as if to imply "how dare you interrupt my conversation." To make matters worse, my dinner entree did not arrive until after everyone else in my party had completed their meals. For the price point, notable executive chef and hipster buzz, I truly expected more and was sadly disappointed. I would only return to The Publican if Daniel Klein and Mirra Fine from The Perennial Plate were there.
