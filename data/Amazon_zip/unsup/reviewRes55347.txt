I don't think there is anything on their menu I haven't tried, they have reasonable prices. It just depends on what you get, but I can't get enough of the pomegranate wings!! Man I stop in here at least two times out the week for them, I recommend you try them, plus they ain't that expensive. And this isn't food you can get anywhere, they have unique dishes, just come try it the taste speaks for it's self.
