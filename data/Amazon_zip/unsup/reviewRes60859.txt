It was one of the first warm Friday nights of spring and and a bunch of work folks were looking to grab a few drinks after a hard week. The only prerequisite was a nice outdoor seating area. Zed451 Check!. However from the minute we walked in until the we finally left a few hours later the service was poor to nonexistent, the ambiance pretentious, and response from management was cavalier. The group of 7 or 8 arrived about 530 and asked to be seated upstairs for drinks. They took our name and put it on a list. I thought, WOW they must really be busy already so we grabbed some seats in the normal bar area only to be ignored for 20 minutes until a waitress finally decided to assist us. Soon after, our buzzer went off and we were headed upstairs. I'm thinking "great" that was rather quick considering how "busy" they were upstairs...until we actually made it to the roof . There were a few people up there on the roof but there was definitely plenty of room up there for them to "seat" us immediately instead of making us wait 40 minutes. Once on the roof, the service continued to be poor. It took another 30 minutes just to track down who our server is. Then for our second round, we had to order from her twice, only for her to disappear for an hour after that. We had to go to the bar another two times to track her down and the bartenders "suggested" that we do not reorder our drinks from them b/c she HAD to be around somewhere. The night continued along the same negative experience - we finally had enough and decided to leave. On the way out, I spoke to the manager of the roof and he seemed to care less about the poor service and negative experience our group had that night. Never again Zed451, Never again. Disclaimer - we were only there for drinks on the rooftop therefore this i cannot comment on the food and service related to that.
