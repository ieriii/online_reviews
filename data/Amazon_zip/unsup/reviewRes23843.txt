Every time I've been here, the crepes and service have been absolutely fantastic. Every item I've tried -- from the build-your-own crepe to the Icosium's namesake crepe -- has been wonderful, and even the water (infused with cucumber) is perfect.  This is one of my favorite spots in my neighborhood to share with people.
