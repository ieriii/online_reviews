Went to gilt bar for christmas dinner with my boo! We were both very excited prior to the meal as we had heard many good things about the food and drinks.  First impression was I think that I may be getting old because this place is effing loud. My boo was all like "I like the lights," and I was all like, "i'm not wearing tights."  We ordered some mules and some champagne cocktails throughout the evening which were awesome if not a little pricey.  Food was excellent as well. We had the steak tartar, hamichi crudo, and guntrop chicken.  I have to give this place three stars though because the service blew. While our server was very nice she appeared very sporadically and there were moments during our dinner when i was honestly going through alcohol withdrawal from having an empty glass.  With all that being said I would go back just to eat the steak tartare and enjoy some good cocktails. merry xmas
