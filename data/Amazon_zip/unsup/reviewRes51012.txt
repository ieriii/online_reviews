Probably the best Bloody Mary I've had in Chicago (get it with the Absolut Peppar) and the food ain't half-bad either. Their home fries are really the highlight. Cooked perfectly with a little bit of garlic, and slivers of onions which grip on for dear life to each potato. Their egg dishes are pretty typical so I'd lean more towards the biscuits & gravy, or their breakfast burrito with a side of sausage. If you're there on the weekends, try and sit at the bar in back, the bartender (her name escapes me always) is a pleasure to chat with. She's finally done with being a vegetarian. Welcome back to the bacon!
