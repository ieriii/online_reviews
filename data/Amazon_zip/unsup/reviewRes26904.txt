Been here before and will be back again. In town for business and took some friends along for dinner and some blues. Yeah, there was the wait but my friends are into interesting beers and there were several on tap to try while passing time. When we were seated it was well worth the wait. Ceviche, Oaxacan steak and some sort of pork taco were the standouts among the excellent choices. Still thinking about the food a week later. Oh yeah, we're talking about two Arizonans and a Texan eating Mexican (inspired) food in Chicago. Tough crowd but we were all pleased.
