A Tale of Three Sandwiches: Three friends, three different meals. The Cubana was the winner! A griddle option, It reminded me of cemitas pueblas....great textures and flavors! The potato/cucumber soup after 3pm was a good, good flavors seemed appropriate on the snowy cold day. The suckling pig sandwich with super spicy sauce made me sweat and threw off my turd clock like a Kuma burger. I couldnt even eat dinner. I had a half of each sammy, my friend carol had the other halves.  then i ordered a to go sandwich or "a pocket sandwich" for later because i knew the food would be up to stuff, cause Rick "The Top Chef" Bayless was there!!! tasting sauces with spoons making sure his minions did his bidding properly and generally being awesome.  The last sammy was the pepito, or pepita a wood oven option.....was sort of bummed here, the cubana was sooooo tasty I wanted this little number to be equally tasty.... but it was sub tasty to the cubana, in fact i hate to say it but sort of bland. Im still going to eat ity later cause it was 12 greenbacks andmy last name is not rockerfeller. All in all it was a great experience, even though we had to sit with people from ohio, it could have been worse they could have been Texan or even worse than that from alabama or the always atrocious Utah.. I will go back at odd hours to avoid the lines, community seating and cause its close to the bus stop.....we spent money like teenage arabs though my wife and i dropped 73 bucks on a beer, two sandwiches and a soup. all in all I thought it was A-ok!!
