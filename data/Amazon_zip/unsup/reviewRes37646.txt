Tried to go here tonight but it was already packed. At 6:20pm. My wife hates smoke noise and crowds so um. . .yeah. Movin on. I don't go as often as I'd like to be honest. One afternoon last year I skipped out of work early and walked over to the Hopleaf. It wasn't too busy so I sat at the bar and enjoyed an entire bucket of beer mussels and frites. I sopped up the broth with the baguette. I quaffed a few ales with that. Ah bliss. One time I had one of their special beers in a special glass. It was served in something resembling a chem lab beaker, help upright in its own chem lab beaker wooden rack. This was a little too geeked for me but fortunately for you beer enthusiasts this is just one of many obscure belgian ales to get weird over. Classy extra: They card everyone. That feels pretty good at 43.
