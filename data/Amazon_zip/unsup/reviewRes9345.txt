This restaurant gets a great review. It was my wedding anniversary last week, called restaurant asked if I could get a table by the window in front. The person taking the reservation couldnt be nicer.....said "we're busy but we will make it happen".. and they did. Food was great, service outstanding.....the server asked how my meal was and I said it was great couldve been a little hotter....she took it off the bill. Completely unecessary and wished I had not said that, but talk about service. This place is at top of my list. Thank you.
