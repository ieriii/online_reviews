Its so nice as a vegetarian to have a classic diner. Somethings are hit and miss and the price is a little more for novelty. But the inside and patio are adorable. I don't even know what macrobiotic is but I love their macrobiiotic dish. Their meatloaf is also superb! And their cakes always look amazing but always left too full to try. My meaty BF liked it too... With all the meaty and grease of chicago food this place is quite a find!
