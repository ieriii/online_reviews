The atmosphere is great. The music they play is awesome: rare trax from earliest recordings of R&B. Perfect setting for organic/locally grown menu styled in a manner of southern cooking. Just awesome. The bar is great, and they know how to mix a drink. I've eaten here many a time and have never been disappointed. Brunch is the best. So much fun with a group, you and another or yourself. The staff is great too, service is always excellent.
