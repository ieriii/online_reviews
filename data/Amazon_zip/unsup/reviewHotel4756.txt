My pregnant wife and I (6'2") arrived late on a Fri evening and were given the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. It had one double bed (not even a queen) with peeling wall paper, a broken toilet, an old tube TV from the 90s, no minibar or fridge and what appeared to be a very dirty bedspread. On top of that, the staff at the front desk had an attitude when we asked to be moved. No dice and no fixes. Do not stay here. Despite a nice lobby, it was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had--and I travel a lot.
