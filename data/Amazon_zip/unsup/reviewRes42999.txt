I had a friend in town from LA over the Labor Day weekend and we wanted to head to a bar in the River North to meet up with some other friends. They suggested Hub 51, but I wanted to catch up with my friend over a nice cocktail and so I thought of only once place that could satisfy my craving for a quality cocktail in that area - Curio - Gilt Bar's newly opened basement lounge. I had heard great things about it and didn't have a doubt in my mind that my friends would enjoy it. After entering Gilt Bar, we followed the hand signs pointing us past the bar, down the stairs, and around the corner to a dark, curtain covered entry way. There was a sign that read "Cash Only" and conveniently pointed out the ATM machine just to the left. When we entered, we saw a low sign asking patrons to wait to be seated. There were low couches and tables lining the walls around the room and a long wooden table with benches in the middle of the very, very dim room. It took some time for our eyes to adjust but were really excited with their selection of handcrafted cocktails, craft beers, wine, burgandy and cognac. I started with the Pisco Tropical - a nice take on the classic Pisco sour - lighter, fruitier, but just as tart. We also tried the Le Bar St. Germain - a lemon enfused version of the St. Germain/Champagne cocktail and the classic French 75. I thought the cocktails were well worth the $12 price tag. The drinks were slow to come however there was only one bar...er mixologist and one waitress down in Curio, and we weren't in a hurry. This is definitely a more romantic spot for couples and very small groups. We noticed a couple in a booth getting pretty hot and heavy into their make-out session but in a space like Curio - I guess the inner beast just comes out.
