Wakamono is one of my old trusties. Although, the first couple years I went here, I could not remember the name for the life of me. I would always say, "Let's go to that yummy sushi place on Broadway that starts with a 'W' and ends with an 'ono'..." What's great about this place is that it's casual enough that you can just stop by without planning a night out, or you can make an evening of it with a group of friends or a date. There can be a wait for a table, but I think the worst I ever experienced is 15 minutes. It's also BYOB which always helps make that bill at the end of the meal a little lighter. The food itself is delicious! My favorites rolls include: snow white, dragon, peter parker, white tuna avocado, godzilla, and unagi avocado. It is all presented nicely and easy to share with others...so play nice. Totally random, but they play a great mix of hip-hop music from my high school years in the background . It makes me smile when I'm eating a bite of sushi and then all of a sudden start humming "Hypnotize" by Notorious BIG. Good times.
