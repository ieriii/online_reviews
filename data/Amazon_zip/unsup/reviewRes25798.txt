Chicago Pizza! The place looked really popular and felt cozy. They had sports going on and the beers looked tempting, but I decided to pass on drinking at noon. We got a deep dish and a thin crust just to try both...besides why choose. The thin crust was reallie thin and crispy. The cheese is not really greasy which I think points to good cheese. We got basil and pepperoni on the thin crust and there was pepperoni all over the pizza. Sweetness. Ok so the deep dish was pretty awesome. Again it's not too oily which is a win. The crust looks black, but that's just delicious parmesan goodness. When they bake the pizza they layer the pan with parmesan cheese so it makes another thin layer of crispy/chewy cheese. The toppings we used were sausage, bell peppers, and mushrooms. The sausage was really good. For those that like to eat pizza with ranch I'm told they make an awesome ranch sauce inhouse here. We also got a salad here...needed something green. But what? The salads here also come with pepperoni! Wow...so win.
