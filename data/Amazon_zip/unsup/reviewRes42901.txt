Third and fourth visits and this place is still worthy of its 5 stars. If you go here for late night drinks and dessert, you MUST get the carrot cake!!! It's a 1,000 calories of delicious goodness. The ricotta gnocchi with sage and brown butter was fantastic and the tender beef pot roast with red wine and glazed vegetables was phenomenal!!!
