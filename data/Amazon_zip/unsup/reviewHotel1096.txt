Love this hotel. We had a great view from our hotel room. We can see Lake Michigan. Staff was awesome and very accommodating. It's downtown and walking distance to everything. Nice soft bed. It was a suite but given the really nice comfy, classy way of decorating the place I say I'll come back to this place again. Pretty pricey but then again-who cares?
