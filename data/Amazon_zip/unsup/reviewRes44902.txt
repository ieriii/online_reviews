i have the mindset of pretty typical wannabe new yorker. (i) i think that manhattan is the center of the universe. (ii) i believe that people who dont live here are, to an extent, joking. (iii) i wear black inappropriately and to excess. (iv) i say things like "to the extent." (v) i believed that new york pizza had no equal. that's right. i "believed." for me, eating giordano's was nothing like the scene in "alien" where the baby alien bursts through that guys chest. it was better than that. id never had pizza like this before.  "you mean, they stuff the toppings INSIDE the pizza? nonsense!" i was incredulous. little did i know. it was legitimately some of the best pizza ive ever had. -1 star because i cant eat it whenever i want. bravo, chicago.
