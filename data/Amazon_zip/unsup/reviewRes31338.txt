It's a great restaurant, if you live the organic-food lifestyle. The organic food is pretty good. I enjoy the interior (especially the art), the vibe of the restaurant, and the location. It's definitely a different Restaurant, for Bridgeport. It's a niche restaurant, which is what I like about it. The only thing I bitched about was the prices. But hey, I was satisfied.
