I was starving one day and as I was driving by I saw this place. There were cars everywhere, people hanging out the doors. And I decided to stop, no matter how many people were waiting for food, the service was quick. The hot dog was probably the tastiest hot dog I have ever eaten, The fries were okay but the hot dog was worth a stop there any day.
