Delicious flat iron steak salad with just the right balance of dried cranberries' and browned onions' sweetness combined with saltiness from tender slices of flavorful steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare without much blood. Even though I am not a fan of Blue Cheese and forgot to tell the restaurant to hold the dressing, I enjoyed my salad greatly (after I tried to mask the light blue cheese dressing with Ranch dressing). The Shoe string fries (sans blue cheese for me of course) were lightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily.  The Hellman burger was ok (juicy and flavorful) but not as good as Islands or Red Robin burgers. It is slightly pricey but not unusual for downtown restaurants.
