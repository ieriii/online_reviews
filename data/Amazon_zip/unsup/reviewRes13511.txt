Glen's is far to clean and ungreasy to have "diner" in the name- and with a copious amount of fish on the menu and prices hovering around the $20 range for many of them I'd been putting off going for quite some time, to the unknowing eye there is nothing positive in that combination. Don't get bogged down by restaurant nomenclature- Glen's is terrific. Everything looked great, there's a changing blackboard of fresh fish and other specials and we even got seated during saturday brunch in about 5 minutes.
