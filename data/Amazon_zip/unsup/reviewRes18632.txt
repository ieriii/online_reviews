Not a bad apple in the bunch! Or should I say burger! ? (snicker) I came last night with a few friends, and had a glorious time. The burgers were delicious, and so was the beer! The beer/liquor menu is about 5-10 times the size of the food menu. Sounds good right? There was one beer on the menu (Belgian) that was $35.00! cool! It was meant to be shared with 3-4 people. its obviously huge. We came here for the burgers though! My friend ordered the 1. Elvis Last Supper- bacon and peanut butter. I ordered the 2. Big Texan. (pulled pork on top!) They were both delicious. Trust me! The burgers were the perfect size. They were border line big. They were not ungodly huge. I could have actually eaten just a tad bit more..but I left stuffed instead. Fries were yummy too. As a side note: The make their own ketchup here...and it tastes like crushed tomatoes with a kick. so so good. If you come with reasonable expectations, you will eat a stellar burger and a have a drunk ol time. You will indeed have a 5 star experience. Waitress was pleasant and helpful! And to the Packers fans- You could have stopped cheering after the first 4 touchdowns, You were playing the Cowboys and they suck!! ha ha! Its all love though. I didn't go to bad apple to start no trouble I just came down to do the the burger chomp shuffle.
