I had the unfortunate experience of coming here on a holiday weekend, which means that the normal 45 minute wait was double that. Despite this long and wretched wait... it was still worth it. Our group of 8 was able to sample all the special hot dogs, and they were all damn good. My favorite had to be the duck sausage topped with foie gras. Some in our group said that they were glad they just had a bite, cuz they weren't sure if they could finish a whole dog. I'm pretty sure I could! If you come on a weekend make sure to order the fries fried in duck fat... they're awesome!
