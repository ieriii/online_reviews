this is a great little sneaky place that has some wonderfully authentic costa rican food. it is family owned and run which just adds to the draw. the food is amazing and for the price prob one of the better deals in the city, the horchata is ridiculous too. it is byo and in the summer if you can get by the baby stroller parking lot they have a great little outdoor patio that faces west so late sunny days are perfect. go for the boiled yucca with garlic and the chicken casado with gallo pinto, pura vida!!! say hello to Henry too as he is finally back from CR to enjoy the rest of winter with us poor souls.
