Fun & delicious new age food. Or should we call it hipster food in River North?  Anyway, they do the whole freshly picked/locally-sourced thing that seems to be all the rage lately.  If you're picky about odd foods like I am, stay away from the bones, the marrows and other gamey-sounding dishes.... but there is something for everyone on their menu. And, like Owen & Engine, they make a wicked Saczerac cocktail.  Handcrafted too! Valet parking, or often times lots of street parking.Beware - dark inside and loud during busy times.
