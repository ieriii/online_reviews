i will say that if you like imported and obscure beer to the point of obsession, then yea, this place is right up your alley. each time i visit Hopleaf i try something new. you can't have more than a couple of brews though because you start to burn a hole in the pocket but those few are worth numerous, shitty millers. i came to hopleaf to see a reading by mark danielewski and that was fantastic. it was in the upper room with that itsy bitsy bar! i LOVE that itsy bitsy bar. in a place as crowded as Hopleaf can get, a little haven away from hectic can hit the spot!
