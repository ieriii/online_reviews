I have never had anything other then the Honey Jalapeo Pork Chops and I don't have any reason to try anything else because it is the best pork chops I have ever had, period. That is a lot to be said because my mother makes some killer pork chops. I really cannot express how great they are. These would be apart of my last meal!!! I have tried my friends food and it was also excellent but i just cannot get anything else them my chops.
