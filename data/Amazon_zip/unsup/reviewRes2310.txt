So good. I waited in line with my buddy yesterday. I had a rattlesnake sausage hotdog and a cherry/pork hotdog with bacon-infused chocolate for a topping. omg. so delicious. duck fat fries, too, because it was friday (saturday they have them, too). definitely waited 45 minutes for it, but it was well worth every second of it.
