I adore this place. Of all the breakfast/brunch places in the near south loop, I love this one the most. The menu has more items, and prices are a little bit more reasonable than the other places. They have specialty items and then they have your staple breakfast items which I appreciate! Some days I just want simple bacon, eggs, and toast. :) I've had their basic two eggs item (cheap and fast for days when I want breakfast and no silly frills!) and that is always good! I also have had their French Toast Combo... PERFECT French toast! Not too soggy, not too sugary, and not burnt! Oh, and you should definitely get the strawberry OJ! You won't regret it. PS. The times I have been here the wait has ranged from 10-30 mins. Plan on a wait, and there being lots of people all the time. Haha. :)
