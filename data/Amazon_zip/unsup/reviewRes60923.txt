Me and a group friends stopped in the other night to hang out. We loved this place. None of us are wine experts, but we all enjoy it....and the environment here suited us perfectly. We ordered several different flights, I particularly enjoyed the South American flight. What really struck me was the way the staff was so friendly and down-to-earth. Not too pretentious at all, and extremely helpful with making choices and explaining things...I can't stand snobby attitudes, so that is a big deal to me. The atmosphere was great, and they have a wine shop as well so we all got to take home a few bottles! Definitely an excellent choice for a great night out....
