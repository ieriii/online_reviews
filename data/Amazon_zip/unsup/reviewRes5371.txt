I have been here twice in 3 days...and may go back Thursday. Completely in love. I wasn't expecting anything fab, because I'm not into these crazy 'swine' spots that are hardcore pig. But, the menu sounded intriguing. I am SO glad I gave it a whirl. The atmosphere reminds me of a french/italian bistro, with communal tables and wine everywhere. Great wine list, which has something you rarely see...you can order a glass, 1/3 bottle, 1/2 bottle, or a bottle. Love this. Onto the food...it's small plate style, although they do have some larger plate items. I've stuck w/small plates and shared. The shaved brussel sprout salad is ridiculously good, the fried deviled egg is beyond, so are the fried proscuitto balls & fried walnut squash bites, salted beets & salami panini were yum, and we also had thew hipped cucumber/feta spread on some of the cripisiest, sweetest bread of my life. These are obviously the less 'swine' adventures you can take there...everyone around us was devouring pigs ears & bone marrow. Not for me, but they seemed thrilled about their food. Highly recommend and plan on being a staple here as I've only gotten into a quarter of the menu...
