we avoid bongo room at all costs on the weekend, but on weekdays, i love getting lunch here as a midweek treat. im drawn the enormous delicious intricate salads (you can easily share one with a friend and both leave stuffed). the cob salad is phenomenal with the crunchy bacon, avocado and hard boiled egg,, also love the smoked chicken and pear salad. sandwiches are also great, the pork with jimmica slaw or the turkey and blue cheese ruben.. yum -- you really can't go wrong. i always get the potato salad as a side, creamy with herbs, love it. i do secretly wish they were open later than 2pm during the week, but what can you do....
