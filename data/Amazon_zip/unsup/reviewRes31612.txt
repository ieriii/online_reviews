***I'm writing this review with the caveat that the last time I was here was about three years ago, so maybe they've cleaned up their act. Still. I'm not about to go back and check it out.*** It's always difficult to find interesting places to eat with my vegetarian friends, so Chicago Diner was a welcome addition to the rotation...until the last time that I was there. On that occassion I ordered the hummous platter. When it came out, I was completely starving and my friend and I were having an interesting conversation, so I wasn't picking through my food all that carefully...until I glanced at the underside of the pita bread that I had just been munching.  Dear God. It was green. And fuzzy. Every. Single. Piece. Interestingly, not one moldy side of bread was showing, and the bread was arranged very neatly. Unless there was a blind chef in the back, I'm thinking that the chef KNEW the bread was moldy and SERVED IT ANYWAY! As you might imagine, I was having difficulty not vomitting at that point. The waiter came over to check on how the food was, so I showed him the bread. The waiter shouted, "Oh my God. That's so gross." Then the best part: HE ASKS ME IF I WANT SOMETHING ELSE! No thanks. I've been served all the rotten food that I can handle. Thanks anyway. Seriously. Ewww. Do not eat here. Ever.
