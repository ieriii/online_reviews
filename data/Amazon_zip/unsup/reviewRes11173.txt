I was expecting so much more from this place since it had RAVE reviews on Zagat. It was definetely busy... so expect to wait a bit for a table. I don't know if it''s all that worth it. They have two types of breakfasts in my opinion.. really overly sweet dessert ones (there is some type of chocolate cake thing I believe) and standard omelettes, etc. I don't think it's the best (any type of dish) I have ever had. The juices weren't really that special either. I kind of wish they had their own specialty dish.. like the fruit roll at Orange.  I guess it's worth a try... if you're exploring different brunch places.
