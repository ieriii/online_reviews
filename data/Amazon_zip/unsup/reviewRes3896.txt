The wings are huge, delicious, and well-priced. I haven't had anything else there, so this review is mostly for the wings. The employees are friendly and helpful (my first time in the cashier gave me sauce on the side to try when I asked her about the spice difference). Even when it's crowded at lunch time, the wings come out in about 10 minutes.
