I love Purple Pig. I realize I'm drawn to gastropubs and small plates places. Full disclosure. Although I don't think this review is biased in any way.  There was a time when my Michigan Avenue shopping day would be detoured around dining hours because I didn't like a single restaurant in a one block radius of that street. Everything was overpriced and uninspired. I love a good steakhouse as much as any Chicagoan-- but a pound of beef is just not conducive to trying on clothes. Enter Purple Pig. Finally Michigan Avenue has a restaurant that lives up to the address.  The menu at Purple Pig is inspired, and lengthy. I've been here a few times and have barely made a dent, which just makes me more inclined to visit again and again. The wine AND beer list is quality with a ton of variety. A pound of beef may not be conducive to shopping, but we all know a slight buzz is! My favorite dishes include the braised artichokes, serrano ham and hazelnut based salad. The paninis are also really delicious and can make the restaurant approachable on a completely different price point.  I will say the bone marrow misses the mark.  I've been a few times on weekend mid afternoons post-summer, and have not had to wait. I figure once summer comes the wait will be 2 hours again and my Michigan Avenue lunches will hibernate until winter.
