I think I was expecting too much from Frontera. Don't get me wrong it was delicious, but I was not blown away. For appetizers we had the guac and some cheesy chorizo melt thing. Both were good. The cheesy chorizo could probably cause a heart attack in the right person - so bad for you, but so tasty. For dinner I ordered the chicken. It came with sweet potatoes and some sort of mole sauce. It was pretty delicious. My boyfriend got some sort of beef with habenero sauce. Also, pretty delicious. His mom got the daily special - slow roasted suckling pig. It was also pretty good. The sauce that came with it was super hot, but yummy. Drinkwise, I got a mojito - wasn't in a margarita mood. It was just like any other mojito I have had. The margarita my boyfriend's mom ordered was pretty good though. They also have a decent beer selection. I might go back, but I don't know that it amazed me enough to spend the money.
