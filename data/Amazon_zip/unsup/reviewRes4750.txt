Stopped in for lunch after arriving in Chicago. It was suggested by a friend, and I'm glad I tried it out. Food: Had a pork steak (I think?) I remember it being very good and very flavorful! The menu was very comprehensive, and there were many dishes that caught my eye. Drinks: Being that it was a summer lunch, I was feeling beer, and there was a great selection of lesser known brews from around the world. Atmosphere (weekday lunch): open and very comfortable, people were enjoying themselves. It wasn't overly busy, but there was a nice buzz. Final Thought: Good food, good drinks, good prices. A great place to grab lunch, and I can't wait to try dinner!
