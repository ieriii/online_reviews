Alliance gets two enthusiastic thumbs up in the bakery category. I don't end up here too often since it's not really in my 'hood, but when I find myself even moderately close to AB I'll swing in for one of their red velvet or vanilla cuppiecakes and at least a dozen cookies. AB carries some of the larger cupcakes you'll find amidst the ubiquitous 'cupcakeries', I find them a good value, and have never been served one in any other fashion than moist and fluffy. They are an institution in this city whether you like them or not... just ask Starfruit, Berry Chill or any of the other local businesses now that boast they carry Alliance cupcakes for your tasting pleasure.  Arguably, their cupcakes are the best thing here but I love that it's not the ONLY thing. Variety is the spice of life babe, if you'd rather some frosted cookies (yum!) or a lemon bar... perhaps a brownie or raspberry tart even, you have choices that aren't limited to nouveau trends or vegan offerings. Alliance is your more 'standard' bakery, the type of place you can find a good 'ol fashioned B&W cookie and not just a mini-dry-soy-wheat-grass-cupcake decorated to look like one.
