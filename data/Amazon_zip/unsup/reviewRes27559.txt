Barkeep @ Harry Caray's took us there. Least he could do after 4 shots of Patron Platinum. Told us you don't get deepdish here, ya friggin' tourist. This is the best thin in town. He was right. I think. Got to Harry's tavern at 1 for the game, drank til 6, cab to Pequods, eat, drink, coffee across the street, struggle to the Metra and sleep to Woodstock. Whew. Good first trip to Chicago!
