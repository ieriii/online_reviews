I had dinner there last week with a group of 6. Service was excellent. Drinks were excellent. I had the burger which was delicious. Looking back, I would have gotten something other than the fries. They were OK, but the other sides that other people got looked much better. Great experience, I just don't give out 5 stars unless I am craving to go back the next day.
