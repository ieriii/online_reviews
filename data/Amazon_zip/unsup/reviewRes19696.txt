Maybe I'm missing something? I don't understand why so many people think this place is so mind blowing. Its nothing special sushi at ridiculous prices. We had a larger party, and they told us that we couldn't do a 7:00 reservation, on a Tuesday, and that we had to do the 6:30. Why? There was no one in there until 8:30. So what was the big deal? Regardless, its just ok, and there's better sushi in this city.
