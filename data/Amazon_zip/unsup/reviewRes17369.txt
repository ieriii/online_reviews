Went to Carnivale for my annual Christmas dinner with my girlfriends. They really don't seem to want to take reservations during the 'main dining hours' on a Saturday. We had a choice of 5.30 or 9.00pm. That being said, the over all experience was great. We started out with the guacamole appetizer, it was extremely fresh and had a lovely hint of lime. Our Entrees came out promptly and presented very nicely. I had the butternut squash empanada and it was outstanding. It was also served with a side of marinated cauliflower that was outstanding as well. For beverages we had frozen white sangria that was garnished with frozen raspberries and blueberries. They were made just right, not too sweet and not too weak. The decor is really great as well. Everything is brightly colored and cheerful. They have salsa music playing in the background adding to the cheerfulness of the restaurant. I absolutely recommend this to anyone.
