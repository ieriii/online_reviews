To clarify before I begin, this review isn't a comment on their full menu, because I came here for a work holiday party (I know, I'm super lucky), so our options were limited. But, I was very pleased with the entire evening. We were in a private space (the Flamenco Room) that was just gorgeous. It had its own private bar, and two levels, but both were small enough that the room still felt intimate and appropriately crowded with about 40 people there. The guacamole sitting at the bar was the first delicious treat I encountered, followed closely by a delicious mojito with fresh mint that was wonderful and not-too-sweet. The passed appetizers were tasty too, and while I don't know their names, there was one with shredded spicy pork that I only wish I could have had more of. And then the meal itself was phenomenal, although I must admit that I like the first course (Ropa Vieja on Plantains and Arepas) the best. I chose the Seafood Paella as my entree. It was fantastic, although I must admit it lacked any of the burnt crispies that I think are the best part of a good paella. My husband chose the Churrasco (a beef tenderloin on a goat cheese puree with delicious spicy beets), and he was the winner of the night. And, the service was prompt, smooth, and friendly. No complaints at all. The place would be great for just about any size group, but watch out for the noise level in the main room if you have guests with bad hearing or sensitive ears : ) I can't wait to go back and choose anything I want from the menu . . . although I think it will be hard to choose anything past the appetizers. Quality for the Cost: Well, it was free for me, so I can't really judge. But, I'd imagine it's quite pricey, and probably about a 7 due to that. Service: 9
