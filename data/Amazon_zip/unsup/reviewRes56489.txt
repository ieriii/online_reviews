First of all, I love Rick Bayless, so obviously, the man can do no wrong. This place is *busy*! Expect to wait on line for at least half an hour if you didn't have a reservation, and you'll want to start queueing up at least twenty minutes before the place opens for the evening. Once you get inside, you can hang around by the bar area and hopefully wind up with a table over there, as we did. The service is good and the food is great. Not to be missed are the plantains with sour cream, and the guacamole. Desserts are great too.
