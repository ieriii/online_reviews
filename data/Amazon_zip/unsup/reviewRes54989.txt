My husband and I have had a couple of our best meals ever at L&E. Delicious cocktails and outstanding food that suits both my vegetarian-leaning and his meat-adoring tastes. A real value for the quality of the experience. The staff has always been very helpful and friendly. People need to forget about trying to measure it on the hipster-meter; just go there to enjoy some excellent food and drink, and you will not be disappointed.
