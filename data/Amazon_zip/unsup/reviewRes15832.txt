Thank you Chicago Yelpers! So many people recommended I go to the Violet Hour and I took your advice and went! Don't try to tell a cabby where to take you because they aren't going to take you to the exact location just the general area mainly because this place does not have a sign but rather just a yellow light out front. It's very discrete. Don't be afraid to walk in. Open the door where the yellow light is, don't be scared and walk through the two heavy curtains you won't be disappointed. The hostess and wait staff are nice and accommodating. The chairs are Alice in Wonderland like. Tall and chic. You can't talk on your cell phone but you can text. The drink menu is extensive. Broken down by your liquor of choice, there are several drinks per liquor and several off the menu drinks. At $12 a piece the bartenders take great care in creating your poison. 10 mins later a wonderfully created drink is put in front of you. It is fabulous! The taste is fabulous! The place is fabulous! It's definitely chill. Don't expect a lively party crowd. Music from Otis Redding, Iron and Wine and Johnny Cash play throughout the bar. The experience is great! Different but great. Try the green beans and rice krispy treat dessert. It's sooo good!
