Dude! Cockroaches. Really? And no coffee maker in the room? I don't care if there is a push button cappucino maker in the lobby. There's no coffee maker in the room.Other than the cockaroaches and the no coffee maker it was super, but still only worth 2 stars because of the cockroaches. I was able to get a nice clean room with 2 queen sized beds in there, real nice. The TV operated nice and simple, none of that menu stuff. But I do believe there was a large population of people living there. I know there was some sort of homeless bicyclist hanging outside for a bit.Rancho Cordova, CA probably doesn't have much to offer besides Motel 6 but maybe next time I'll take a look there. At $70 it was a pretty good deal. But I should get a credit for there being no coffee maker in the room and for my room already being rented out to a cockaroach.
