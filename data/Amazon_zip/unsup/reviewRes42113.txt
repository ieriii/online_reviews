Been back a few times and definitely enjoyed it more than our first visit. I'd rank it above Purple Pig (which has really disappointed on every visit other than our first) but below The Bristol. We got the chicken the second to last time we went and it was easily the best chicken I've ever eaten at a restaurant. The salmon we got on our last visit ... perfectly cooked, buttery, flakey, delicious. I'm getting hungry just writing this review. Bonus Tip: You can order some of the drinks from Curio while dining, including what I think is their best one, the Oaxacan Old Fashioned!
