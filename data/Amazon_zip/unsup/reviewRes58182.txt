I finally made it to Alinea! I have heard so much about Alinea but there is no way I could afford it. Surprise of all surprises: my boyfriend took me to Alinea for my birthday! It was a slice --or maybe I should say 18 courses-- of heaven! The decor was nice, but not trying too hard. Perfect. The service was wonderful but not suffocating. Perfect. The presentation of the food: AMAZING! Maybe I'm biased because I have dreamed of going here since I first read about it. The Hot Potato Cold Potato was MAGNIFICENT! The Black Truffle Explosion: TO DIE FOR! Great food, all of it. My BF said it was all right so that means he LOVED IT. If you are a world-class traveler, with fine taste you have probably already made this restaurant your Chicago headquarters but for the rest of us who have to work to pay our bills this place is worth saving up for, perfect for a special occasion. This is a prix fixe restaurant so all the courses are already set --and at a hefty price, at that BUT it is SO worth it! Don't expect heaping portions because it's about 20 courses. I know I will return one day...
