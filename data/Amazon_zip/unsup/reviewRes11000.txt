Found not one, but TWO long black hairs poking out under the cheese in my leftovers the next day. Which leads me to believe I consumed some actual hair during my actual meal at the establishment, but went undetected under the dim lighting. I won't be back and I sure as hell won't me recommending anyone to eat at hairPiece.
