YUM! If I had to review this based solely on my meal, 5 stars. Some of the best french toast I've had in a long, long time. And the creme anglaise was a great touch - not overpowering but definitely added a richness. Thick, cinnamony, rich, amazing. But, alas, one of my dining companions didn't love her Eggs Benedict (tasteless hollandaise) and another said the toast was just meh. Though some overeasy eggs, an omellete and a short stack were all reviewed as tasty. Make a reservation - our table was ready and waiting for us. And on a nice day, lovely patio.
