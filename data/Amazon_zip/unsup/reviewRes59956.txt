I've been going to Alliance for years. They serve Intelligentsia coffee and it's good. Sometimes the pastries are hit or miss - want to know what's always a hit??? The cinnamon rolls. I'm not sure what they put in them... might be crack in the icing... because once you have one you'll start thinking about ways to get another... and another. It's dangerous. Other Alliance Goodness: Free wi-fi, great place to study, outdoor seating, good service, friendly staff.
