Sushi X is the type of place that non-sushi people (aka my date) really enjoy. The rolls were BIG, especially from the MEGA menu choices. We ordered the Godzilla which was huge and good, but had a little too much cream cheese for my taste (so did many of the mennu items! lots of tempura too). We also got the spicy tuna and alaskan rolls. I actually wish they had been a little smaller and more pop-able (anyone else with me on this?). The spicy was in fact VERY spicy, so buyer beware. I liked the atmosphere just fine. I was expecting a super-dark place after reading all the yelp reviews, but they must have installed more lighting because I found the room to be well-lit and comfortable. Our server was friendly and attentive. BYOB with no corkage fee was great!
