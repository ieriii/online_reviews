Irazu! First of all, I've never been to this restaurant. I've only ordered delivery so that is all I'll be reviewing. Got it? Good. OK, unless this is the first review of Irazu you're reading (in which case, I'm flattered! Thanks!) you've probably heard about the oatmeal shake. And yes, it's as good as people are saying! If you like oatmeal. Which I do. I order it every time! So yeah, just get it, OK? There are other shakes, but I've only tried a sip of the chocolate and the oatmeal is better. Things that I like about Irazu: = Cheese empanadas. They're sort of like Hot Pockets, but with just cheese. And better. = Sandwiches. I've tried a couple different chicken sandwiches. They are yummy and a generous size. = Sweet plantains. = Oatmeal motherfreakin' shakes! = Generous portions. I always end up ordering more than I need, and the shakes themselves are pretty filling. = Black beans. = Ability to order online using GrubHub. (I hate ordering things over the phone!) = All of my orders have been correct. There's nothing worse than not getting what you ordered! Things that I don't necessarily love: = Delivery time is usually around an hour or a bit more for me, though it was maybe 35-40 minutes last time. = Chicken burrito. It was big, but pretty meh. You're better off getting a burrito from a Mexican restaurant. The good definitely outweighs the bad. So yeah, I think it's safe to say I'm a fan. Yay!
