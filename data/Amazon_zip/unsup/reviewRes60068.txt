YUM!My husband and I wanted to go someplace nice that we had never been to before for a date night. We picked Big Jones and it was the right decision for sure!Some highlights:--knowledgeable, attentive server who was informative but not overbearing--delicious onion pie appetizer!--my husband had the quail gumbo special for dinner and literally licked the plate because it was so good. i was kind of a dork and ordered the hamburger but it was DELICIOUS.--beautiful atmosphere and decorations Would definitely go back. Can't wait to try their brunch!
