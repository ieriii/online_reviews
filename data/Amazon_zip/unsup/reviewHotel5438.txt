This would have been a five star review, but we had some issues with the staff. The same housekeeper pounded on our doors HOURS before checkout time, despite our having the "do not disturb" sign hanging out there. She insisted that it already WAS checkout time (once at 9:30 am, and again at 11am - checkout is at noon). The staff downstairs were generally friendly and helpful - moreso the guys outside than the ones at the desk. The hotel itself is great. Clean, modern, toiletries are top notch, and the location is incredible. The bed was comfortable, and the in-room seating was very cool. If I went back, I'd stay here again, but I'd tape a DO NOT DISTURB sign to my door.
