HUGE! Pretty much the word to describe Lao Sze Chuan, except for the actual size of the restaurant. It's pretty cramped and tight inside.  Their menu - HUGE! I was impressed with the many seafood selections especially for this Catholic girl coming here on a Lenten Friday night with a bunch of friends.  Our table was HUGE! We thankfully had a reservation so we had the big table against the wall by the door. I seriously recommend making a reservation, there was a crazy wait to eat here, I never even knew this gem was in China town. They have one in Downer's Grove, which I have to try since it's closer to my house! So the Hot Pot, or in other words, Chinese fondue looked incredible. The people in my group who ate this, kept eating it and couldn't stop. It helps that the food is unlimited.  I ordered the sole (fish) with lobster sauce. It was pretty tasty. The food here isn't out of this world. I think it's more the experience and great conversation that people have over eating the Hot Pot. I will definitely try it when I can eat meat though!! YUM, I can't wait :)
