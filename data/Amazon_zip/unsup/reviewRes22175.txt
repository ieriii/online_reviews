Eh, dogs are pretty tasty but almost $5 for one is too much for me. I'm not a big fry eater and you can't really order just a dog with no fries...although the pickled green tomato inside was delish. In addition I have only gotten take out from here so I can't speak to the car hop service but even when they weren't that busy it took like 10min to get my order up. Don't order the lemonade...it's gross, tastes like countrytime from the powdered mix. Probably would not go again, can get dogs just as tasty with same diner ambiance in many other places.
