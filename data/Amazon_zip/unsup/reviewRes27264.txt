I have always heard about this place but somehow only about a year ago did I actually walk foot in here. BOY HAVE I BEEN MISSING SOMETHING GREAT! Everything is reasonably priced and you get you money's worth. The best deal to experiment and try when first coming in: COMBINATION $5.00 A combination platter of traditional favorites that include: 1 beef taco, 1 bean tostada, topped with cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and sour cream, 1 tamale and 1 cheese enchilada. With this you'll get an idea of what they offer and only confuse yourself on what is your favorite item at this restaurant because EVERYTHING is good!
