After commuting past this place 100,000 times I finally had a chance to eat here. Really glad that I did. 90 Miles has got a really great laid back atmosphere and a seriously awesome patio to relax on. This is a really great place to take a date as well (assuming its nice and you can sit outside). The goat cheese empanadas are out of this world and the server laughed when we ordered 4 of them for 2 people (they didnt know we were gonna split an entree yet). Also, this is place is BYOB and they gave us an ice bucket to chill our brew. Glorious. Seriously at least one goat cheese empanada is MANDATORY. So good. Our entree (Im not sure what it was called) consisted of big chunks of marinated garlic pork served with plantains and rice and beans w/ bacon. It was very good. I really want to stop back in and try a Cuban sandwich. Great place.
