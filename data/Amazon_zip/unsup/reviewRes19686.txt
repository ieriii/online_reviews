I'm a City of Chicago girl and when people ask me where they should go with out-of-towners, my first answer is always The Gage. Why? Location Location Location. Then comes Food Food Food. The Gage is a *good* memorable Chicago experience. Go with no expectations. Let it surprise you. But for me, it's not too expensive, not too snooty, not too pubby, not too much of anything. This is the kind of place where you can get an incredible burger and a fine piece of fresh fish all on the same check. Try the Smoked Haddock Brandade. Scotch Egg. Caramelized Lobster. Alaskan Halibut. The Gage Burger. Those are just a few things I can recommend, although everything I've had has been scrumpdiddlyumtious. The mixologists at The Gage also work very hard to please us, so don't underestimate the power of an odd sounding cocktail. Above all else, the service at The Gage is part of the experience. It's a very loud place - so be prepared for a pub-like sound to envelope you, but the waitstaff deals with it on a nightly basis so they know how to woo people into ordering without being overpowering. Think Flo from Al's dinner mixed with Sookie from True Blood. A nice blend of friendly confidence and compassionate kindness. I have always gone in the evenings and have seen a few kids, but it seems like they are happy to see any and all customers come through the door regardless of age. I can't wait to see what kind of place they're building next door (new restaurant called "Henri"). If it 's anything like The Gage, we are in for a treat, Chicago. Thanks.
