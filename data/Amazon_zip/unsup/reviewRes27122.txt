After hearing that there were no reservations available and that there were already people waiting at the bar, we decided to give it a shot anyway. It was a weekday around 5:45. After finding quick parking, we walked up to the counter and were seated immediately! Someone on the phone is a bad judge of wait time. Yay us! We're big Bayless fans and have had great meals at Topo, xoco, and other catered events. Frontera was definitely less stuffy than Topo and had more bang for your buck in my opinion. We started off with two appetizers. The duck flautas were tasty. They came four to an order and were the definite winner. The pork tamal was just ok. Really salty. The pork and the sauce overpowered the tamal. I would probably not order this one again. For entrees, I had the Pescado en Pipian de Almendra. Cobia in a green sauce with almonds and polenta cakes. Good, flaky. My wife went with the pork loin with butternut mash. This was the clear favorite. The red mole was ridiculous and the candied pecans put it over the top. We almost never order pork loin, but this gamble paid off. For dessert, the duo of flanes were decent. I would go with something else next time. The churros at xoco would have been perfect.
