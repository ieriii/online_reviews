The food was very normal. Nothing exciting. The Dessert - Kulfi ice cream that I ordered was terrible. When I was using a $50 gift card that I got from my sister to pay my bill of $65 they refused to accept it. Not a coupon or groupon but a gift card. My sister got this gift card in December 2009 and the excuse the manager of India house made was that the gift card expires in 1 year even when it did not say anywhere on the gift card. He also said that you can try using it in a different India house restaurant even when it clearly says on the gift card that it is valid for this location. I was a disappointing experience overall. Never going back there again.
