What I wanted from the Publican was a cozy place with a good beer list and good comfort food. What we got was an obnoxiously lit, poorly decorated, awkwardly arranged space with bad acoustics. And hair in the food.  The food was disappointing. The menu is comprised of a lot of things that should be complimentary to the beer list. We had oysters, pork rinds, and rilletes to start. The pork rinds were acidic and overly salty. The rillettes with figs were decent, save for the hair. The fries were under fried. Sweetbread schnitzel was bland and cold on arrival. Burrata was sent back twice due to the accompanying strands of long, blond hair. Gem salad had five measly pieces of non-crispy pig's ear. Sardines were underseasoned and tasted as though they had been hanging out in the walk-in for awhile. The potee with pork shank and vegetables was well cooked and tasty, though the vegetables needed some help. The beer list was decent. There were plenty of Belgian, German, American, etc. brews to choose from. The problem was that not only did it take over ten minutes to receive our orders, the food wasn't hearty enough to live up to the beer.  The service was spotty and unprofessional. Unfortunately, our party complicated matters by adding people after being seated, but we tried to be as low maintenance as possible. In response, there was no communication between waitstaff and an attitude toward us. We often had to flag them down to which they responded with an annoyed "What?" They lacked knowledge of the beer list and the menu, having no recognition of several items on the beer list. Perhaps The Publican will improve as time goes on, but we won't be there for the ride.
