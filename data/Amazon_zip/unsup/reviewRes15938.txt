The management at Carnivale is great. For example: There was a miss-communication about our leftovers, and they were thrown out instead of being packed up for us to take home. When we asked the waitress about the mix-up, she had the manager come over to us. The manager instantly expressed her regret, asked us what we had leftover,and without any argument she ordered the chef to cook us fresh food to take home. I got an entire steak entree to go. When I've seen this happen at most other places I've dined at, either the staff doesn't want to give you anything without an argument, or at most you just get a free-dessert. Excellent customer service at Carnivale builds great return business. Besides the excellent staff, the food and atmosphere of Carnivale is great. The Guacamole is creamy and some of the best I've ever had. The cocktail and wine list is excellent. The valet parking is cheap and quick. The desserts are amazing.
