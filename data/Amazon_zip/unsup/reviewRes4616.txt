My wife and I just dined here for our anniversary. It was excellent. It was our first visit and, despite reading other reviews, we weren't sure exactly what to expect. Our waiter was very friendly, but also very professional, and explained the menu so well. I've waited tables and memorized menus before myself, but never had as much knowledge and enthusiasm as our waiter did tonight. I'd love to name him to give him some props but don't think that's allowed.  All the food was excellent. The atmosphere cozy and lively. As I said, it was our first visit, but won't be our last!
