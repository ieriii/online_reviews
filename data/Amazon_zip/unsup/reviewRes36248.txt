We live in the neighborhood and have stumbled upon this place, our go-to place for delicious food and a comfortable meal. The rolls are to die for, every one of them. LOVE the Indie Signature with beef. We've tried numerous other dishes, Thai and Japanese, with high praise for all. The lighting and atmosphere is so pleasant. We recommend the bigger room for a less crowded feel, but have eaten in both rooms and enjoyed it. We highly recommend Indie Cafe!!!
