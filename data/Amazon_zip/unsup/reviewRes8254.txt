The reviews of this place made me laugh out loud... I am not a big meaty fan, but the food was incredible. My brother and I waited until my dad came into town so he could take us (noooot cheap). The salad bar was beautiful - hearts of palm, sundried tomatoes, artichokes... every fancy thing that I love but would never buy for a salad at home. And the mini yorkshire pudding things... wow. The only bad thing was that we ran into the landlord who joked that he would have to raise the rent knowing that we could afford to eat here... but doesn't that go both ways?
