Upon arrival at the Allerton the check-in person at the desk completely ignored I was there, standing in line to check-in and skipped me and took care of a guest that was standing behind me.This was very rude and very upsetting to me. Although, I was using a groupon, I am a paying customer. The room was the size of my living room, super tiny. My other complain would be the quality of the room; in the middle of the night as I was adjusting in bed and pulling the sheets to cover myself, I discovered the bed had a huge hole on the side of the mattress!!! For a so-called four star hotel to have old, worn out, torn mattresses is unacceptable! Needless to say, I will not be staying here in the future.
