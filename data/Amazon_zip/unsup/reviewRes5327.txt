The Purple Pig is a great find, still relatively unknown to the many tourists that crawl Michigan Avenue. The appetizers are wonderful - on two occasions, I went with the shaved asparagus and was not disappointed! They put together fantastic cheese plates and are more than happy to make recommendations for ideal pairings. I also recommend the deviled egg and chicken thigh kebabs. It can be quite crowded at The Purple Pig, but I've gone several times without a reservation and haven't had any issue finding seats at the bar. My recommendation is to order several plates and split them amongst the group. Overall, I happily return to The Purple Pig time and time again - the waitstaff is friendly and knowledgeable, their food and wine selection is fantastic, and their prices are reasonable.
