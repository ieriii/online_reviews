You can either dine in the oyster bar informal side or the calmer dinner house side. My group comes once a year to have a raucous time so we go for the oyster room. Fantastic, fresh shellfish. The oyster shooters with Absolut pepper and tabasco are shockingly tasty. Their crap and shrimp are not to be believed, hot or cold. Great service for an informal dining experience.
