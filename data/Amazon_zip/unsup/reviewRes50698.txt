I had high hopes for this place, especially since they try to be seasonal and I love restaurants that do that, but in the end I left a bit disappointed. Some friends and I came here for Thanksgiving this past November, and that night they were having a fixed price menu that included an appetizer, salad, entree, dessert, and a little dish at the beginning of the meal. While the service was relatively friendly and the atmosphere was nice, the food left much to be desired. My turducken was pretty dry, and the brussel sprouts that came with it were the most bitter brussel sprouts I'd ever had -- and I am a huge brussel sprouts fan and have rarely been disappointed by them in the past. The gravy that was served with the turducken also seemed like it came from a gravy packet instead of being freshly made. The red velvet cake I had at the end of the meal seemed pretty ordinary, and nothing really stood out about it. I am sure that the regular menu is great, as that is the main reason that I wanted to go to Big Jones while I was in Chicago, but I wished that some of those options were available when I came for Thanksgiving.
