4 star - Damn Good/Bringing ItDammmmn Good !!!!!!! New York Pizza has nothing on Chicago's Gino East Deep Dish Pizza. My most recent visit to Gino East I had the meaty legend deep dish. My father in law wanted to get the thin crust pizza, which was vetoed by myself and the waiter. While waiting for our pizza we we decided to have the Fried Ravioli, which was a nice touch before the pizza came out (45 mins). Service was alright except the pither of soda we ordered was sent back twice for having black paticles in it. Time to clean the soda fountain sprouts. Thats why you get the four and not the five. This place has a nice tourist ambience if you are from out of town. If your doing deep dish in Chicago - I reccommend Gino's.
