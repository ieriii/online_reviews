After reading much of the mouth watering reviews, we arrived to a crowded restaurant on a Sunday night. We secretly rejoiced over the fact that we had reservations, then finding out they have a HUGE backroom and a side room as well. But busy restaurant in March is a good thing right? We ordered Bruschetta - yummy, really fresh tomatoes mussels - fat juicy mussels in a flavorful white wine broth ossobuco - tender juicy & slightly salty gnocchi - tasted of summer with basil pesto & homemade gnocchi Linguini alle Vongole - really flavorful with great pasta & clams seafood pasta - with HUGE shrimps tiramisu - very light & fluffy bread pudding - strong rum taste in shapes of bread (not mushy) I appreciated the fact that the pastas were home made with flavorful sauces, and am quite impressed with their seafood pastas especially.
