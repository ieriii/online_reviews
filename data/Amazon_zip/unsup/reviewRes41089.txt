Who likes chicken noodle soup? If you answered yes, and have never tried Pho Ga, you need to get your arse over to Tank's in Uptown. Their Pho Ga caught me off guard. I really could taste the giner/cilantro/lime combo, man that was good.The noodles melted in my chopsticks and the chicken was delicious. The portion was huge! Actually, it was the biggest damn bowl of pho I've had yet! Service was quick and friendly, and prices were cheap. Ladies and Gentleman, you need to try Tank pho sho! (Ethnic food dish puns may get worse when I find good Indian food in Chicago). Tank Restaurant has inspired me to make pho on my own. I feel like my extensive experience with Maruchan Rahmen will enable me to construct the perfect beef pho, whose with me? ? ? http://youtube.com/watch
