A couple of former colleagues took me out for my birthday and when I read the reviews I was full of anticipation - especially since I have never eaten in a Chinatown restaurant before after spending all my life in this city.Anyway, I am the world's biggest Orange Chicken fan - from the McDonald's of Chinese Food (Panda Express) to the hole in the wall places (New Big Wong in Washington DC). So without even reading the monstrous menu I order Orange chicken, spicy. One of my friends orders General's Chicken.Then we wait. And wait. And wait.OK here comes my chicken. But the other two meals are still not here.We wait. We wait. No waitress to be had.Then comes the rest of the order.Here is the Debbie Downer. The orange chicken and the general's chicken was THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD !.  The pieces were as hard and dry as a rock. It was as if they had been re-cooked from the previous eveningBrought it to the waitress attention. Futile attempt because did not understand english.Also the complaint about the plastic chairs is valid. They should lose them.I am surprised that this place gets such rave reviews. My friends were very apologetic - they said the food is usually top notch. Maybe I went on a bad night for them. The place was crowded, so who knows ?
