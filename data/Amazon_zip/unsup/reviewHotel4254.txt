The best hotel lobby I have ever seen!! Not many hotel lobbies can compare to the Palmer House lobby. It is breathtaking. An architectural masterpiece! This is my favorite big hotel in the country mainly because of the history, lobby, excellent service, and location. The hotel has three exits/entrances that give you access to three different streets so you are steps away from public transportation, the Berghoff, Millenium Park, and basically anywhere else downtown. The rooms are hit or miss. I have stayed in rooms that were updated and modern. I have also stayed in rooms that were old and dreary-looking. I will say that all of the rooms are very clean so that is always a major plus. The only reasons this hotel doesn't get a 5-star review are because they don't offer free wifi in the room (they charge $7.50 per HOUR to get access in your room), they charge $10 per day to use the fitness center even for hotel guests, and not all of the rooms are renovated. These are all major shortcomings of the hotel but I still love the Palmer House. The Palmer House will always be my preferred place to stay in the city because of the aforementioned benefits that this hotel provides.
