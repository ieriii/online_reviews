I'm kicking myself that I had never tried this place for sushi before today. I've stopped in and picked up some tempura and some iced thai coffee and wasn't impressed with either so I just put this place out of my head as far as going there or sushi. Today when trying to figure out where to go for a light lunch my husband and I decided to give Indie Cafe another shot. The restaurant is small but cute. All dark wood and black comfy chairs, black curtains...very chic. As soon as we were seated our glasses were filled with water...took awhile to actually get our menus tho. My husband went with the lunch special so he got fried tofu and a cucumber salad and the crazy basil fried rice. I ordered a thai iced coffee, a spicy tuna roll and a cucumber salad. Thai iced coffee was actually delish. Definitely not made the same way when I ordered it the first time I went to Indie Cafe. The cucumber salad had cucumbers, carrots, red onions, pineapple, jalapenos with a light tangy vinegarette. Very referesshing. My husbands fried tofu was pretty good as well....very meaty. I was surprised when I got my roll. Not only did I get my 6 pieces of spicy tuna but I also got three pieces of nigri and a little mound of seaweed salad. It was all so fresh and flavorful. My husbands crazy basil fried rice was also very good. Our meal came out to $17 and change...not bad at all for all the food we received.
