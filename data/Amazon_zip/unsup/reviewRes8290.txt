It was my friend's birthday earlier this month and I've yet to take him out to celebrate. All he eats is Pizza Hut, so I decided to give him a nice reality check on how to enjoy quality Italian cuisine in the neighborhood. I'm turning into a North Side rat and exploring every small neighborhood near my apartment. Ravenswood is a lovely, well kept secret of a neighborhood. It's located right next to old factories-turned-lofts and the Metra track. It was a little chilly last night, but Spacca's outdoor patio was too tempting to resist. On this cool Thursday night, the place was hopping. The interior was full and guests were waiting to be seated. I really liked the inside, slick, with expose brick, but I have vowed that if I can sit outside this summer, I'm going to. As I surveyed the other dishes, I realized I was going to skip on any appetizer or salad. The personal pizzas were huge. A lot of the pizzas had different meats and cheeses, two ingredients that don't always make me jump (especially the meat...), so I went with the Marinara pizza. When I ordered the waitress quickly noted "There's no cheese on it..." and I simply replied, "Even better!" I've grown accustomed to restaurants giving me the "do you have four heads" eye when I ask for a pizza with no cheese, so it was nice to have that actually be on the menu somewhere. Pizza was delicious! The bread especially was freshly baked. The pizza had basic, chunk marinara sauce, olive oil, and basil. Wonderful! I can't say that it was vegan, but it was probably the closest thing to it! I'm sure there was butter somewhere in the mix, but I can't confirm because I didn't ask. Whoops! I complimented the pizza with just a glass of red wine. Straight forward, helped the food go down. I would totally come by again. The atmosphere was a major selling point to me. Sitting outside on an early summer evening in the neighborhood is a major seller to this location. I think my only drawback was our waitress, who was really sweet, kinda dragged. I'm not a big fan of the whole wait for you check, drop your card, wait for the server to pick it up, and wait again for them to bring it back. Not a major distraction, but definitely a reason to knock off just one star.
