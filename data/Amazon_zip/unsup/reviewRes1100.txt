Who cares if I have a wedding to go to next weekend and need to fit into a dress?  After waiting in line for what seemed like the shortest 60 minutes ever, you better believe that I will take advantage of finally being able to order.  So therefore...between the two of us, we ordered the Dog (Chicago-style), the Jack and Alec Krienen (Smoked Crayfish and Pork Sausage with Shrimp Remoulade and Caraway Havarti Cheese), the Cognac-Infused Pheasant Sausage with Chive-Dijon Goat's Butter and Duck Rillettes, the Duck Fat Fries, and of course, the famed Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Fleur de Sel. The Chicago-Style was just as expected. Chargrilled, plump, and simple. Much better than Weiner Circle's. Duh. The Celebrity sausage of the day, the Jack & Alec Krienen was indulgently delicious with its shrimp remoulade and semi melted cubes of caraway havarti cheese....what a genius combination of flavors. The cognac-infused pheasant sausage with duck rillettes...what can go wrong with that dog? Absolutely nothing. It's perfect. Duck Fat fries. Well, I wish I had ordered a side of normal fries just to compare the flavors. While they were super yummy, I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between the two I think. Still, it's the perfect complement to all of these hot dogs. My boyfriend wanted to order the Foie dog for himself. Like the entire one. For. Himself. I thought he was insane (I'm just kidding love!) for thinking that he'd be able to finish the entire thing of rich truffley heart attack in a bun goodness by himself. I stole two bites and while it was everything I had imagined it to be and more, I absolutely could not have eaten the whole thing by myself.  After finishing EVERYTHING in sight, we both felt pretty guilty for eating such a meal. I shouldn't be surprised if the zipper breaks on my dress next weekend. You know what though? Totally worth it.
