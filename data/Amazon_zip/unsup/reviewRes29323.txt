I've been here a handful of time and the service is usually pretty good. My only complaint is that the tables are hella cramped together. It's a small restaurant so sometimes getting a table can be a pain. Their gnocchi is pretty decent. Their shrimp alfredo was pretty tasty as well. I see their take out vans al of Lincoln Park so I figure that's where most of their business goes.
