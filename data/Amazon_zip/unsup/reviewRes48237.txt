Annnnnnnnnnd, back for brunch, which completes my succulent survey and results in a whopping, resounding, plump five stars for Publican. The brunch menu is splendid. Just, utterly splendid. Hot rich coffee poured righteously and quickly, Publican mimosas flowing, fried french toast with jelly and maple syrup, ham & eggs & toast, sticky cashew buns, spicy bloody marys, and a continuing list that will wake you up from even the world's WORST hangover just goes on and on, a whole side of the carefully culled menu. Waiting for you. Beckoning you to hurry in. It's brunch for godssakes, it's important. We need it. Reservations recommended. The word is out.
