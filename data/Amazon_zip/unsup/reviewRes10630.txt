Oh my god. I am in love with Piece's amazing new haven style pizzas. New York, WATCH OUT! Their white pizza and also the red pizza are so amazing. They have great, fresh ingredients and also rare and fun ones like mashed potatoes. yes, that's right mashed potatoes! There's also this amazing salad with pears, field greens and caramelized pecans that is the best salad I've ever had. Wash down your scrumptious meal with one of their home brews. There's lots to choose from. Not a big beer drinker but my boyfriend LOVES their beers. Our waiter Ryan was super friendly but not overly attentive which was the perfect balance. I totally hate when your server is always checking up or even nagging kinda. On Sundays they have this deal for a large 2 topping pizza and a growler for only $25. TOTAL STEAL. For lunch they have personal sized pizzas for like $6 which is AMAZING. I have yet the experience this since i work the 9-5 but maybe one day. A girl can dream right?
