I had a great experience at Simply It! The fact that it is BYOB automatically makes it good, and the food just kicks it up a notch. We start off with the avocado wontons (a vegetarian version of crab rangoon), lemongrass beef (which you make into your own little spring rolls, SO GOOD), shrimp rolls, and shrimp beignets. I'm not a shrimp person, but my friends adored the shrimp dishes, and we all loved the wontons and the beef. For my entree, I had mango coconut beef, which was out of this world tender and so flavorful, it's making my mouth water just thinking about it right now! My friends got the bamboo duck, which was excellent, and when one person didn't like her catfish in a clay pot entree (bland and a little fishy), she wasn't charged for it and instead got this amazing pineapple calamari dish. Desserts were okay - the fried bananas were good, but I wasn't blown away by the orange blossom cake, which was a little rubbery. All in all, a great meal, and I can't wait to go back to Simply It to try some of the other dishes!
