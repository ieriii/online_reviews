Loved Irazu! After hearing it would be a 40 minute wait, we walked to a liquor store nearby and grabbed a 6 pack which was nice- BYOB. Our waiter was super friendly. Ordered the smaller portion of guacamole and chips and it was plenty for two people. Tasty too! It actually was starting to turn brown by the end of the meal so you know it was freshly prepared! It was nice how the waiter suggested that my boyfriend get a veggie burrito and add steak in order to get more bang for his buck. Overall the food was great. I had chicken tacos. I only wish they had red salsa as well as the green kind to put on my tacos. Service was excellent and the food was yummy. Great outdoor atmosphere and worth the wait! Also, it's CHEAP!
