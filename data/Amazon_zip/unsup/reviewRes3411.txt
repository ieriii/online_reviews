Crisp why do you have to be closed on Mondays?!?!??!!??!?!?! I left on my flight back to Houston a very very verrrryyyyyy sad girl!!! Came here over the MLK weekend holiday for an all out glutton spree vacation and Crisp.... you hit the surely were on the top of my list!! I had the 5 piece wings, half sassy and bbq, and I like the bbq a tad bit better than the sassy just bc of the lil kick that is in there. I also has the baby buddha bowl with brown rice, which I think i could have done without because the wings were so big that I only finished 2!!! I left a sad sad girl then too! But Crisp sure did live up to the hype and I'm glad I came and tried it. You're in competition with Bon Chon in my book!! I'm already salivating just writing this review!!! Come to mama!
