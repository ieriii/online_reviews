The food was lovely... the service, left something to be desired the time we were there. Paul Kahan has a great space, that's really fun and encourages conversations and a friendly environment. He was there the night we ate, shucking oysters. I found that exceptionally cool. The booth seating is kind of set up like stockyard boxes. We actually sat at the corner of one of the communal tables. I think one of the issues I had was the spot we were in. Not because it was bad placement, but the people around us were a little weird. A group of 3 had the man of the group taking up significantly more than the space one person should take up, and was spilling into our area with broad gestures, making it hard to get 100% comfortable in our space. Definitely a point for their beer selection. It was impressive, and that it wasn't just a large list, but a quality list gives them extra points. Everything came out in an interesting order. The summer beans with bacon and vinaigrette came out first. They were exceptionally flavorful, and really light.  My husband and I shared a charcuterie plate. Everything was wonderfully flavorful. I loved the duck galantine especially was one of my favorites on the tray. My husband had the pork belly dish, which was well cooked, tender, unctuous, all good things, but it was uninspired seasoning. I've had much worse, but definitely I've had better. I ordered the bollito misto, and it was fantastic. However, it came over an hour after the charcuterie plate arrived, so we had already eaten pretty much a full meal, and we were stuffed. I wish things came in a different order, so we were able to fully enjoy this dish. I was looking forward mostly to the pork confit in the bollito misto, but the turkey was oddly enough the star. I'd eat this again, but with less lead up.
