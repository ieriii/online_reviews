Came to here for Sunday dinner, and will be back often. Our server Deian was really good but the food was great. We ordered four starters. She did not really recommend the saffron veal meatballs which where our favorite. Also great was the wild boar ragu with parpardell. The hand made pasta was lite and delicate. Two of us ordered pasta and two of us ordered meat dishes. The duck saltiambocca was perfection. I was also impressed with the manager who was happy to help me pick out wine. I told him I normally enjoy viogney and sv. blanc and he new just what to bring me.  The price point seemed appropriate just do not bring anyone on a small budget.
