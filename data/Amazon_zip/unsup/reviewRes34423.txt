Expired feta cheese and rotten avocados is the first thing that comes to mind when I think about this place. I have never returned a dish to the kitchen for 2 reasons: 1. I don't want to be "that guy" and 2. I don't want saliva or feces in my food. But this dish had to be returned. A Mediterranean omelet is hard to fuck up, but clearly someone forgot to check the expiration date of the feta cheese that was used in my omelet. They were also careless in checking the avocados that were used in my friend's dish because those were rotten too. Unless you like ingredients that are freshly harvested from dumpster diving, I would not suggest eating here.
