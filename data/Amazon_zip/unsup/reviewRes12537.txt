By God, I love this place. I will make many, many happy returns. High points- sauce on the quesadillas, and the most amazing take on a tamale I've ever seen. WOW! And... for the price/ quality, it can't be beat. The cuban flavors are authentic too! The best I've ever had outside of a native Cubana's kitchen. The Margaritas are not to be missed. Salty, YES!
