I love breakfast sandwiches and I love the selection of sandwiches that Bongo Room has to offer! I came here for brunch yesterday and had the veggie sandwich. It's actually offered with a croissant, but I decided to ask for it on an English muffin instead. The waitress was super sweet and told me that it wouldn't be a problem. The sandwich was filled with cheese, egg, tomatoes, spinach, cucumbers and sprouts. It was so good! It's also served with a side of roasted potatoes. I had a bite of my friend's pear and cranberry french toast. YUM! Brioche french toast with ice cream drizzled pear and cranberry compote. Very sweet and good. I love the menu here. They offer like 2-3 different types of french toasts, pancakes, omelettes, and benedicts. So whatever type of breakfast you're into, you have a wonderful selection!
