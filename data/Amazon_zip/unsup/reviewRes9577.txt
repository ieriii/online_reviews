Le Colonial's upstairs lounge is one of my favorite places in the city to have a glass of wine or a martini. Amazing decor - you feel like you're back in colonial Vietnam! (Not that I was ever there, but...) It's a great place for a "drinks" date -- sexy, hip, dimly lit, and a real "find" -- not many know about it.
