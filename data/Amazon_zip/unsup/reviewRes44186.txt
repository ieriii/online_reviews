I've been going to this place for years and was happy with unitl my last visit. Let me start by saying it used to be BYOB now they only let you bring wine, and it costs $8 for corking fee. To me that is ridiculous. The fee costs more than the bottle. Their sushi has increased in price dramatically where 2 rolls now costs about $25 and they are not even that big. We had a group of 5 and they automatically added gratuity. They do not take reservations and are crazy about seating you if even 1 of your party has not arrived yet. When I first started going 2 years ago I would have given this palce a 5 star rating hands down, but in my opinion Wakamono is starting to act like they're too cool for school. I won't be going back. There are plenty of other sushi bar's that are better, cheaper, and more accommodating.
