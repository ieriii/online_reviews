If you ever go you must try the green apple martini, its the best one they have and it tasted just like apple pie. They also have a Martini Flight where you get 4 mini signature cocktails for about $11.95 which is perfect. Their Short ribs are amazing, the portion sizes are huge so it's perfect for sharing or be prepared to take some food home. The one thing that I hate though is that the will not sit you at a table untill all of your party is there and there are no seats in the waiting area. Me and my friends had dinner there Dec 23rd, 3 out of the 5 of my party was there but they still wouldn't seat us, which was absolutely ridiculous. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes to be seated. But besides that everything was great, service was good, food was flavorful. I had the barbeque chicken and ribs with au gratin potatoes which were delicious, I was happy with my choice. The Christmas decorations were also really nice and had a nice festive look for a girls night out Christmas dinner. Everyone was happy with their choices and we will definetly be back.
