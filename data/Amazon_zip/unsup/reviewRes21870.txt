I was able to enjoy a GrubWithUs meal here last night with 5 other people. The service was sooo friendly and accomodating. The food was EXCELLENT, just too much. They loaded our table with family-style dishes that could have fed 12 people, and we were only 6! The fajitas had delicious chicken and steak with fresh, crisp vegetables. The steak dorado was a crazy good specialty dish with a sauce that was finger-lickin' good. The ceviche, guac, and salsa were a perfect start to the meal. The salsa is a bit spicy (I mean, I LOVE spicy, but it was pretty hot) and the chips were great. All in all, I was really impressed with this place. It's small but mighty. Also, the mojitos weren't bad. Not outstanding, but then again I expect a lot from a mojito. And at $4 for the night's special, I can't complain too much because the price was right. Oh yeah, the flan and fried ice cream were a great finish to the night. If only I had had more room to enjoy them!!! Oh well, I can always go back!
