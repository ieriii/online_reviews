Worth every penny of the...$12 now (?) lunch/brunch buffet, especially in downtown Chicago!!! Service is excellent, ambiance is classy, price is RIGHT, food is delicious, selection is more than you can ask for! I wouldn't come here for the regular menu though...simply because it's a little overpriced (~$16/entree) for a variety lover like myself. I'd order too much. I'm not Indian (go figure) but I LOVE my naan, chicken tikka masala, and of course, Gobhi Aloo. This place is also recommended by a few of my Indian co-workers - In general, India house is just cleaner and a tad more upscale than most indian restaurants in Devon, yet still authentic in flavors. I call India House before I come to their lunch buffet just to ask if they have that garam masala cauliflower. Every time I come here, I'm STUFFED To the brim. Selection is really large and it's great, even/especially if you're vegetarian. Of the...8 times I've been there, there was always veggie briyani, chicken tikka masala, curried mixed veggies, a paneer dish, some kind of vegetarian soup, a fish curry, and a really tasty chickpea curry. They also have a simple salad bar with garden veggies, and an entire condiment bar filled with chutney's etc. I don't make use of that enough though!! Not a huge selection of desserts, but totally ENOUGH. Fresh fruit, my absolute favorite kheer (rice with sweet milk, nuts and dried fruits) and mango kulfi, which tends to be on the icy side. Bonus points = freshly baked naan with a good crust, and brought to the table sizzling hot plate of beautiful tandoori chicken...no white meat, but that's totally fine with me. You also probably won't have much room in your belly for mango lassi (which you have to order separately) if you're a lassi fan. Just sayin'.
