On a recent trip to Chicago, we went to Brazzaz, Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil. As Brazilian churrascaria fans, we found Texas de Brazil to be the best of the Chicago bunch and one of the best we've ever been to. Each cut of meat really tasted different and demonstrated why you should be trying them all. Surprisingly, we found the sausage to be the perfect last dish, fitting perfectly with the wine recommended by our waiter. On both of our trips we found the staff very knowledgeble about wine selections (thanks Eric and Mike) and very attentive to our needs (i.e., requests for chimichurri because we didn't notice it was on the salad bar). The atmosphere was also very sophisticated and just right for a perfect adults' evening out.
