I've been here a couple of times; first as a visitor to Chicago, and now as a resident. I think the ambiance is very nice. Nothing special, but perfect lightening for either a date or a night out with friends. Each time we've visited, the host and staff have been nice and accommodating. I love the bread that they first bring out to the table! Now, on to the food! I like to order the Artichoke dip to start. It's great for sharing! Then, for the latest visit at least, I order the Ziti Vodka. I'm a sucker for anything with chicken and sundried tomatoes and this dish didn't disappoint. They have an extensive menu with pizzas as well. The only thing that surprised me were the flatscreen TVs in the bar area. Surprisingly, I've found that many nice restaurants do that in Chicago. Also, if you aren't form Chicago, this area is a nice walking area with many bars and restaurants.
