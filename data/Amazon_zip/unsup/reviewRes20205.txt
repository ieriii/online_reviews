Finally saw Rick Bayless today. The line was insane and we waited about an hour and a half for our food, but it came out just as delicious and hot as before, so no big deal. I ordered a Milanesa with churros. My friend ordered the Barcelona hot chocolate with churros and the Gunthorp chicken. The hot chocolate was SUPER rich and he couldn't finish half of it. It was delicious, but too much chocolate. And his torta looked perfect! The churros were perfect, as per usual.
