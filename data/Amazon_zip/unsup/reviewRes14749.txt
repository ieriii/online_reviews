Five stars, easily. Here's a place to impress your date. Sabatino's has that old world Italian charm that just takes you away. The last time I was there, it was Wednesday, the night of their lobster special. We ordered a wonderful bottle of sauvignon blanc from their extensive wine list. Our server was a total sweetheart and very knowledgable about the wine, which ranged from mid-priced bottles to the very expensive. I eat at a lot of Italian places, and I love that you get soup and salad with your meal here, not just one or the other. The minestrone is hearty and the house dressing is wonderful. The lobster itself was about 9 ounces and cooked to perfection. It also came with a side of mostaccioli. Presentation of everything was beautiful. Do not, I repeat do not, walk out without having dessert! Profitteroles are the perfect combination of hot and cold, smooth and crunchy -- the perfect end to a perfect meal. We were there for about two hours and our whole meal flowed effortlessly. I never felt rushed, even after we had paid and were enjoying the last of our wine. I felt that the staff was very professional and personable. Busboys were attentive, and even the management stopped by to see how we were enjoying our meals. There was a duo of violin players walking around playing individual songs for each table (slip them a few bucks if you have a request), which added to the liveliness of the room. Sabatino's is right off the expressway, so make the drive from downtown or the suburbs. I guarantee you will have a wonderful experience.
