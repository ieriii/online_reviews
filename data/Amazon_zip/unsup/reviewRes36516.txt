I stumbled on to this place because it was next to a bus stop. I had gone by a few times thinking "this place looks good . . . I wonder how the food is?" FOOD The answer to that question is simply "great". The food, especially the breakfast fare, is incredibly fresh and delicious. It all boils down to this: great ingredients make great food. The coffee is Lavazza, the juices and fruit are always the freshest and the eggs are Phil's Cage Free. (Check them out in your supermarket - yes, it really makes a difference!) You could probably go there weekly through 2010 without having the same thing twice because there are so many options. I've never once been disappointed or seen anyone in the entire restaurant send anything back. SERVICE It makes a big difference if you are there for the weekend 'brunch rush' or during the week. Also, the servers are hit and miss. Anka (not Anka Marie), in particular, is wonderful. So, go ahead and ask for her next time you go. OVERALL The food is too good to let all of the 'hassle' associated with it being a very popular place at times strop you from checking this place out.
