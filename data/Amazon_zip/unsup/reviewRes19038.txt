I found the place too loud to really enjoy the company of my friend. However, our server was wonderful and very attentive. We found the menu somewhat limiting especially for vegetarian options, however they were willing to make adjustments to please my friend. Although the food was good, it was over priced and not worth the wait. I would suggest going for brunch, if you decide to go.
