One among the many good bakeries in Chicago. I love going here for the treats as they truly are irresistible. And the cafe makes great coffee worth every penny. Also, studying there can be fun - if you can find a place to sit. Oh yeah, finding a place to sit during times that are busy - difficult, if not impossible. And you have to jump rope over the various power cords that dart the area. It's worth going to if you're all by yourself and want to kick it on off hours - heavy hours, forget it.
