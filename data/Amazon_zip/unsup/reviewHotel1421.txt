Stayed here courtesy of Hotwire and a $110/night room. I think it was worth it. The front desk and staff were polite. The hotel does seem a little outdated but it was still clean. The room itself was small with a minimal design. The bed was very comfortable. The walls were thin. The location of this hotel is good for tourists, that is if you're a tourist that likes to shop which wasn't really a priority for me. It was about 7-10 minutes from a Loop stop.
