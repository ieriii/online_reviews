I just chime in to slam the thin crust here. I don't like deep dish pizza, but apparently this is a great place for deep dish. Still, a pizza place should do both well.  Really bad pizza. A big messy layer of greasy white cheese that seemed to have had the taste sucked out of it. I was perplexed.  What kind of cheese was this supposed to be?  Nihilist cheese. I just made that up.  Cheese seems be suffering from ennui.  I really can't get beyond the nihilist cheese on the thin crust here. No passion. No spark. Defeatist cheese. Dead cheese. Big gloppy greasy cheese that hangs around a small town convenience store on Friday nights, because there is nothing else to do. Boring cheese.  The crust was decent though. And the server was really nice.   Really bad thin crust. Don't get it. If you like deep dish, Pequod's will be fine.  Menu is generally limited as well.
