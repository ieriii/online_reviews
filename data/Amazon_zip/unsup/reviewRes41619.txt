I second everything all the other 1 & 2 star reviews said - there are no good seats in the house, it was a bit of a Twilight Zone atmosphere, the one and only thing that jumped out at me in a good way was the cool faucet in the bathroom & the music. Most importantly the food just wasn't so great (although the bread pudding was pretty tasty but nothing I couldn't make at home). In addition to all of that my boyfriend & I had upset stomachs when we got home. I'm really bummed I spent so much money here. There are so many other places in the city that I would have been happy about dropping almost $200. Oh well... we won't be going back there.
