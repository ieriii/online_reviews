We go here all the time as I live super close- like above it. 1) price- I think price is pretty fair. It's reasonable and you get a good amount of food. Eggs Benedict is around $15 I think. 2) quality- as other reviews put it, the food is good. We usually get a version of eggs benedict and something sweet like waffles. 3) quantity- for the price you pay, you get a decent amount of food and this is coming from a guy that eats a lot (once ate and drank 16 lbs of food and water in a day) 4) atmosphere- cute with pictures of fried eggs all over the place 5) staff- nice Also if you go during a mad rush time be sure to listen to your name because if you leave you may get called and lose your spot.
