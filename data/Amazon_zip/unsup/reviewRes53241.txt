I typically don't prefer Cuban food but this place has given me a better perspective on it. The steak with chimichurri sauce was fantastic!! I ordered my plate with tostones (fried plantain) versus the sweet plantains and it was great (mouth getting watery). I usually don't like yucca but it was also fantastic since they give a garlic dip. The BYOB options are also great. My friend brought a barcardi bottle and they provided the mojito mix for a small fee.
