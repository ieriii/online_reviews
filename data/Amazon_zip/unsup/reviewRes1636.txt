It is the equivalent to Artichoke's Pizza in NYC: Great gourmet version of a fast-food with a long line. The dogs are great... but that line is obnoxious. I love the duck fried fries... but that line!!! The service would be good... except that line!!!!!!!!!! Artichoke's and Hot Dougs both would be better if they opened more locations.
