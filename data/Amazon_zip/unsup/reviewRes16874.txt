I was unimpressed by this uber-hip Wicker Park spot. The heavy curtains, low lighting, and seating concentrated around low candle lit tables might not be a bad place for a date, but I found it to be a rather irritating place to meet friends.  The drinks are crazy expensive; not unexpected for this kind of bar, but I was annoyed that they could not figure out how to properly serve a single malt. Come on, you're charging $18 for a dram, figure it out. After asking multiple times for some water, our server finally brought me some other drink that I didn't order and then left it on the bill.  At least the music was low enough to talk. If you're all dressed up and looking for someplace to go in Wicker Park before a dance or other event, this may be your scene. Otherwise, I would skip it.
