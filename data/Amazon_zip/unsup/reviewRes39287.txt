Overall experience with this place is just ok. Have been a couple of times a few years apart. Food was very good both times. I do remember it being better the first time though. The food gets a 4 star rating, and the service/ employees get a 2. They weren't outwardly rude, but just an overall indifference I would say. Not the worst but not the friendliest for sure. The average of the two gets to 3 stars.
