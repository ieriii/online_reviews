Dark, like a trip to Dracula's palace. I mean, you almost expect to see coffins in the corners, the creaking latch as a lid is slowly raised. Yes, that's the ambience. HOWEVER, food is magnifico. The best. Steaks, sides, wine selection. There is this decadence known as the alaskan king crab truffle gnocci - order it. Shrimp cocktail on steroids, too. Steaks are dynamite, filling, enough to take home extra. PS - leave the sunglasses in the car. Consider bringing your own stake, the wooden kind.
