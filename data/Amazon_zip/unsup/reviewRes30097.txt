I've only been here for Sunday brunch and both times it's been AMAZING. If you go here for brunch and get anything from the "West" menu, you should just go to a diner and get your omelet and bacon fix and be on with it. Definitely order of the "East" menu as they have some amazing brunch dishes that are an awesome fusion of eastern cuisine with some western influences. Highly recommend the french toast (the sauce is ridiculous!) and the crispy pork belly over a rice cake.
