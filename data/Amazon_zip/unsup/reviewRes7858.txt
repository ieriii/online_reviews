Fogo "hello yummy cheese bread" de Chao. So maybe it's because it was my first time.. but I LOVED Fogo. Sat down.. and we were given a basket of cheese bread. And I fell for the trick. I ate so much cheese bread that I would never eat my money's worth of meat.. though I was totally happy. The bread knots filled with some delicious cheese concoction. My mouth is watering thinking about them. And holy salad bar. The bar is huge and filled with fresh premade salads and veggies. I guess this cancels out all the meat.. right? Meat just kept on coming. So many choices. I stuck to the beef- it's the most bang for my buck! Garlic Steak, Prime Sirloin, Bacon Wrapped Filet- I could never choose a favorite because it was all so good. Not sure what a healthy serving of red meat is, but I surely far exceeded it. And even when I was full.. I still had time for a few cheese breads. Fogo is delicious. Service is incredibly attentative.. and tables are spread out so you can gorge yourself in privacy.  I will definitly be back.. though I am waiting until my arteries clear out after all that unhealthy goodness!
