I love the food at Gilt. I've only been a couple of times, but each time I've been with a group and able to sample a lot of the menu. Salads, pastas, burrata -- I've never had a bad dish.  Cocktails are hit and miss -- I've had some super whiskey drinks, and a paloma that tasted like Crystal Light.  It's sceney. Lots of pretty people standing around looking bored, which just isn't my thing. The waitstaff has been friendly, but I've gotten that 'vibe' from some of the bartenders. I can do without that, thanks. The restaurant is really pretty -- dark and sexy. Really dark. If you're toward the back of the restaurant, good luck reading your menu dark. Great place to be seen, impress a date or take an out of town visitor.  Similar scene to Nellcote, way better food.
