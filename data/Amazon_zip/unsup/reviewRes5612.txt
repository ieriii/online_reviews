As those that have read my other reviews would know, pork products are one of my great loves. Well, you would imagine then that I would love the Purple Pig. Well, I thoroughly liked it. My wife, some friends of mine, went on a Friday night for drinks and eats. Despite the crowd, our service was impeccable, thanks Brooke. Our orders were taken quickly and it was only moments before our food and drinks were brought to our table. The food was very tasty, I had the fried olives stuffed with chorizo as an appetizer and the porcetta with salsa verde panini. I was in Hog Heaven! As for beer, the selection is very limited but it is very good with a focus on European imports. I had the Einbecker Mai-Ur-Bock which is a spring bock. It was a very crisp beer, very flavorful but not very heavy. I would recoomed all three of these items. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, though when we got there it was storming and only the committed stayed on the patio. Inside the restaurant has a strong high end pub feel, lots of wood, big bar, and tall tables. It was very comfortable and I would imagine on other days it would seem cozy. But on a Friday night with a thunderstorm, the number of people inside it was very crowded and loud. It was very hard to hear people sitting across the table from me and so the experience was slightly lacking. One other suggestion, as any Chicagoan should know, don't drive. Of course, I was being dumb and we drove because we were running late after work. Access to it is only off the Mag Mile and so parking is non-existent unless you park in garages that charge an arm and a leg. The Purple Pig does validate but when we were there they did not have any validated cards available for the garage we were in. Other than those small things this was a very good experience and I will return.
