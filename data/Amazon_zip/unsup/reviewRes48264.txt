In short, I was not impressed. I heard great things so perhaps I was expecting too much, and the Publican didn't live up to those expectations. The beer list was extensive, so that was a plus. I liked the general atmosphere, but not in love with the communal dining. If you're with a party of four I suggest you reserve one of the booths, which looked really nice and private.  So first knocked star - they were out of the spicy pork rinds, the ones that I heard great things about and was so looking forward to trying. So I got a few oysters instead and they were fresh and delish and perfect, and my husband loved the mussels that he started off with. After that, it was odd...the suckling pig dish was surprisingly dry, and totally plain and boring. I don't mind plain if it's done well, but it wasn't. We left half the dish on the plate. The country style ribs however had the perfect amount of char and flavor and marinade - very tasty. The beet side dish was ok, nothing to write home about though.  We decided to order dessert, nothing jumped out at us, but the cherry couflis with milk chocolate sounded decent. It wasn't. The cherries had absolutely no flavor - they tasted like they were from a jar, but I know (at least I think) they weren't, so it was so odd. The whole dish was just so blah. Very disappointing. So, lesson learned - skip the dessert. And service was lacking - took forever for our waiter to come and check on us and take our orders - I felt like we were constantly waiting for him to come by for various things - clear our dirty plate as we had no room on the table, order our entrees, order another beer, etc...
