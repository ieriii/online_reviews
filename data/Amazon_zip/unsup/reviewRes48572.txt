Great date place, though the booth-things reminded us of stables. The decor is in between a beer hall and wanting to be a fancy-ish pub, but the food is delicious. We split everything, and while the scallops crudo didn't need quite so many pomegranate seeds, everything else- the sweetbreads, beets, guinea hen and kale were on point.  Beer list is really long, so if you don't have an idea of what you'd like, then ask for help. Great service, and not too pushy or in your face.
