Everything was top shelf. We started with a plate of hushpuppies and a sampler trio of kobi beef, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. Sauces were on the side - the Carolina sauce was the hottest of the 3. The other two were a toss-up for the best. One had fall off the bone baby back ribs, one had the pulled pork sandwich, and one had the kobi beef brisket. All were delicious. Cornbread and coleslaw were very good also. The poundcake club for dessert will surprise you. Not a combo you would expect but distinctively different....and very good. Oh - the wait staff - very attentive and efficient - and friendly. As an added bonus we had a tour of the kitchen and met one of the sou chef's. I will be back!
