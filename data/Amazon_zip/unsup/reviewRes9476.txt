Here's the thing with Le Colonial. It's good. In fact it's very good. It's also expensive. You can go to Tank Noodle, or you can go to Le Colonial and pay three times as much, for food that isn't three times as good--perhaps two times better. Both fine establishments; it just depends how much you're willing to drop for pretty decor and white linen service.
