I met up with my neice at Yolk on MLK day, and it was wonderfully uncrowded. I thought it was a pleasant place, and our waitress was friendly and professional. I also think that the prices would have been quite reasonable if the food had been prepared with any kind of flair. I ordered green eggs and ham (eggs scrambled with pesto and ham). I got a dense disk of overdone eggs flecked with tiny bits of green. There was no discernable pesto or basil flavor. They could have put in a couple of tsps. of spinach instead of pesto for all I knew. The accompanying fruit was sweet and tasty and the bits of ham were a nice quality--which means that they know how to shop (good fruit in January in Chicago is appreciated). However, my husband's corn beef hash was mushy--without texture or much taste. Cheap diner fare. The coffee was very good. ( I drank far too much of it to compensate for the food), and we had a very pleasant meal talking and catching up with my niece--but if we had had to wait I would have felt somewhat cheated and out of sorts. We could have whipped up a much better breakfast ourselves.
