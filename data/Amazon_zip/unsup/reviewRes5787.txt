Went there with friends from out of town. Everyone was happy with their food. We shared the baked goat cheese appetizer which inspired me to want to try making it at home. I got the fillet medallion trio and the cuts were really good - tender, juicy, flavorful. the red mashed potatoes - i was disappointed in myself for not finishing the side. created room to try the rhubarb pie, which was incredible. All in all, good food and good sense of value. Good, attentive service. I would rate this place higher but the space felt a bit like a factory (it was a busy night, crowded and loud) and we were seated in a high traffic area. I have a feeling if we were seated in a less chaotic area, I would've given it 4 stars...
