I'm probably not the best person to review sushi, as I don't eat seafood so my options are usually pretty limited. That said, happy hour (Sundays & Mondays 5-7pm) here is a great deal and even more so for a veggie roll lover like myself! I've tried to order spinach every time I go, but they're always out of it. I usually stick with the asparagus and avocado rolls, which are both really good just not as great as those spinach rolls. At $4 a round (for me), there's nothing to complain about. Beware if you order a second round, as you will be charged full price if you don't finish at least half of what you ordered.
