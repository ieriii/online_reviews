My fiance and I have been looking for a good, cheap, conveniently-located pho place since we returned from our trip to Vietnam. FOUND. Their food was delicious. We ordered some kind of egg rolls to start, which were great. And we both ordered pho for our main course. It came with a separate plate with all the fixins you might want to add to your soup. And it just hit the spot. Really tasty, and it was more than enough food to last us for 2 meals.  Also, it's BYOB! So you can come here and spend next-to-nothing for a delicious, satisfying Vietnamese meal. I'll be back!
