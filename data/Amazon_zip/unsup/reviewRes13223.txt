How does a place that seats only 40 have a menu featuring 16 fresh fish entrees daily? Well there were only 15 the day we were there but that caused no problems. I read all of the great Yelp reviews, watched the Diners, Drive Ins and Dives episode and figured it might be legit. I had the clam chowder and seafood casserole and my date had the sturgeon. Everything was prepared in exemplary fashion and served hot and flavorful to our table in a timely manner. We even had a lengthy and informative conversation with Glenn the owner. To those with a bad experience, maybe it's just not your place but I say try it again. We are glad we went out of our way to Glenn's.
