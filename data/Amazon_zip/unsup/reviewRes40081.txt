The wait is really, really long and you and your clothes smell horrible on the way out. They won't take reservations for parties less than 10 people. The wait staff pretty much ignores you and since they use fresh hot coals for the grill, ash sorta flies everywhere. The grills aren't well oiled so meat just sticks there and the coals go cold quickly. The short ribs are a complete waste...you pay $15-20 and just end up gnawing on bone with little to no meat. Do yourself a favor and drive an extra 20-30 minutes out to Arirang in Niles.
