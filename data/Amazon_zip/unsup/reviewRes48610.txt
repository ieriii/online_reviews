I have mixed feeling about this place. Yes, the food and service is top notch but there's something else going on here... It's like we the patrons are part of this joke by restauranteurs to make the experience as close to a situation that we as a society once tried to get away from. Like communal eating or basic foods such as brussel sprouts and pretzels. The booth pens, although novel, take it further by making me feel like some sort of animal. Pretty sure, in 5 years time, it will be novel to serve our food in happy meal boxes and have everything taste like it was microwaved but yet still cost more than a week of groceries.
