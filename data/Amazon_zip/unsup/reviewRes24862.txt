So, if you read my reviews, you know that I LOVE food, and am super impressed when servers are great at their jobs. Ben D. is one of THE best out there. From the minute we were seated in Ben's section, we knew it was going to be a fun meal. He is GREAT. Really, great. He's friendly, SUPER knowledgeable about everything on the menu, really easy to talk to, and is not afraid to stand firm in his suggestions. I like that in a server. Some of the best meals I've had out were guided by server suggestions, and I always leave stuffed, happy, and my wallet significantly lighter. Anyway, Ben was chatting with us about the menu while pouring our wine (and our glasses were always topped off before we even needed to reach for the bottle) which just shows how "easy" the whole meal felt. He made amazing suggestions. We had the three cheese plate with the manchango, bacon wrapped dates, fried peppers, chorizo, a flatbread, dessert...I mean, I feel like if I list everything we ate you'll judge me, so I'll stop here.  Honestly, once we were able to give Ben a sense of what we liked, he was spot on in recommending even more things for us to try. I loved that!!!! One thing that sets great servers apart from others is their ability to anticipate your need as a diner. Ben D. did that...and more. This was one of my favorite meals in the City. The meal was spectacular, the service phenomenal, and I can't wait to plan my next trip to Mercat.
