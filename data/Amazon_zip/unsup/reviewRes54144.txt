Went back again for dinner...it was great! I got the chorizo torta, roast pork torta, shortrib soup, Aztec hot chocolate, churros, and Jamaica agua fresca. It was all very good. The sandwiches were excellent, very orgasmic in flavor and texture. Soup was ok, but it was huge, so either get one or the other, its a meal in its own right. Churros were warm and went great with the Aztec; though the Aztec wasnt as spicy as I was expecting, only a very light hint of heat. Anyways, definitely heading back asap!! I thought of another commenters quote of everything Bayless touches turning to gold, very true here. Muy bien Rick!
