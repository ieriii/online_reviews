I've been here often and my experiences vary from great, pretty bad, and everything in between. My old roommate used to be a server here when I first moved to the hood 4 years ago, so that was a my first draw. I liked to come here for coffee, because it's better than average and definitely cheaper than the nearby Starfucks and Caribou. Also, free WiFi! Then I discovered their breakfast menu. HOLY AMAZING, BATMAN. I love the french toast, the omelets, the cheesy grits, the hickory smoked bacon, and the biscuits and gravy. At this time, I'd like to point out that I'm especially picky about biscuits and gravy because my family is from the south and usually makes an astounding breakfast spread, B&G always included, from scratch. The strawberry lemonade and cucumber lemonade are also very good - refreshing and crisp! The dinner menu is slim pickins but I've been somewhat satisfied with the options. The Backyard Burger though, not so much. It's pretty bland.
