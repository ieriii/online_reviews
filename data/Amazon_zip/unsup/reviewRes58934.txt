Worst dining experience EVER. Aside from the decor, there is not a single reason to even THINK about going to this place. The food was horrible - down right awful. The tuna roll (Tails of two Tunas) was the most rotten sushi I have ever been served. A sushi cart on Division would be a better option, even in June. The pork belly was pork fat, decent flavor if you could get past the mouth full of fat, which I couldn't. To top it off, our waitress couldn't be bothered with us. We had one drink that took about 15 minutes to arrive and she never came back for a second drink order. I could go on and on about how awful this is, but I think I've covered the key points - bad food and even worse service. There are far too many incredible places in the city to give this a second try. Really, really disappointing.
