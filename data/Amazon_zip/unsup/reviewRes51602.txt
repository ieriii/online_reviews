This is a review of just the burittos from Garcias. Without a doubt, it's in my top 5 burritos in the city. And I have had a lot... they are packed with great fresh-grilled steak (muy importante), ample amounts of veggies/beans, but the pico de gallo that comes on the side, is always the kicker for me. This will set you straight any time of the day, but after the bars, it might be one of the best things you've ever eaten... and one of the biggest!
