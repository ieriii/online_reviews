After reading all the raves about this place, I had high expectation. And since I will only have ONE breakfast in Chicago, I figured this would be the best place. First, the coffee. It had great aroma, and definitely had my much needed caffeine in it. I normally drink espresso or french pressed coffee, so most breakfast places' coffee is usually too weak for me. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the most raved Eggs Benedict, served with Canadian ham etc. Although the food looked very appealing....it tasted just alright. The egg was cooked perfectly, however the ham was over-cooked and a bit too sweet for the dish. I ended up chewing this nice and delicate egg mixed with tough and sweet Canadian ham. I ended up separating the components so that I can at least enjoy the eggs, and worry about the ham later. Overall, I think it's a nice hang-out place on a weekend. I felt very relaxed sitting there reading my "morning paper" off my phone. Though I wasn't too thrilled about what I had for breakfast, I think I will come back and try another dish. Afterall, all my friends who's been there seem to like it.
