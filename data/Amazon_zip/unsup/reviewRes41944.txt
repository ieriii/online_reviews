just went to ruth's chris for the first time after hearing everyone rave about it. i was a bit hesitant since it is a chain of sorts. however- i was blown away. the filet was outstanding, so tender and flavorful! also love the lobster bisque- absolutely delicious! doubt i will go to any other steak house anymore!
