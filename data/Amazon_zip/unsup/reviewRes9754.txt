My husband and I ate at Sprout last night for my birthday and it was fantastic. We did the 3 course menu that comes with little intermezzo courses.  1st course: Egg and Duck. I had the egg, which I had to send back because the egg was overcooked. But when it came back properly cooked, it was an excellent little salad course. My husband had the duck, which was good and chock full of duck prepared a couple of ways. Not awesome, but solidly good. Intermezzo: The curried soup was a little too spicy to taste the other components, in my opinion. 2nd Course: Venison and Short Rib. But Entrees were awesome. The venison was seasoned and cooked absolutely perfectly and the short ribs were really tasty as well. Intermezzo: Grilled cheese. Soooo good. That is all. 3rd course: I had the corn dessert, which was so good that I ate the whole thing even though I was stuffed at this point. My husband's dessert was not so good, in my opinion, but he like it OK. It was the foie gras, which we ordered because it sounded interesting. I thought it was kind of gross to be eating a liver mousse on cake. But points for creativity. In short, this is definitely one of my top three in Chicago so far. I will go back at some point to try some of their other offerings.
