Pros: 1) All suite hotel, great for kids, lots of space and two TV's. Kids and parents could watch different TV shows. Fridge and microwave were put to good use with all of our leftovers. 2) Ordered room service twice and food was delivered very quickly. The burger is one of the best, if not THE best burger I've ever had. We ordered the burger twice during our stay. 3) EXCELLENT location. Walking distance to Giordano's, Gino's East, Rosebud Italian Restaurant, Water Tower Place, Navy Pier, Lakeshore, Apple Store, and John Hancock, and Eggsperience. 4) Really tasty coffee provided for free in room (2 cup coffee maker) 5) Housekeeping was excellent. They left extra toiletries, towels, creamer, coffee upon request. 6) Lots of drawer space for clothing. 7) Didn't get to use fitness center, but it looked nice and clean. TVs on cardio equipment. Cons: 1) Sink and shower wouldn't drain quickly enough. 2) Required to transfer elevators at lobby level to get up to rooms. From street, you take one elevator up to 3rd floor, then transfer to second set of elevators. 3) No Disney channel. (Nickolodeon available) 4) Bed comfort could be improved.
