This place is the bomb!!!! (can you still say that?) This place is just exceptional, a great place to go for a special occasion. I took my daughter here to celebrate her HS graduation. She's a carnivore like her dad. We got street parking on Ontario with no problem on a Sunday and we just pigged out for 2 hours. The Picane is the best I think. and the sides are awesome, the mashed potatoes, and the bananas mmmmmm. Its nice to be treated like a king too , or a queen in the case of my daughter. Hope I don't have to wait until she graduates from college to return
