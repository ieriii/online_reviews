I've been staying at the Heart for over 10 years, maybe even 15...the place is great. Nope, its not a 5 star hotel, but its clean, safe and the staff is generally wonderful! Have never noticed a raucousness except the year of the Poetry Slam...and they nearly got ejected...kept declaiming in the parking lot...didn't bother me, but hey, poetry isn't everyone's cup of tea...(grin) The place is $70/night including parking...for Chicago..that's a deal...for instance all the places in Boystown are now just under $200/night when you include tax and parking...but yep, they're nice...just try getting a room on a busy weekend...anyway, please stay away from the Heart...we like it all to ourselves!
