The Bad Apple is a consistent and solid place to go for a great beer, a great burger, and a nice relaxing night. Are the burgers as "good" as Kuma's or DMK? I suppose not but they sure taste great to me. I love the options for the fries and the have poutine. POUTINE! That alone wins my heart. Going to college right by Montreal, we were constantly gobbling down this amazing combo of gravy, cheese curds, and fries. And Bad Apple makes a pretty delicious version. Service is friendly and knowledgeable but a bit disorganized when things are slow. Meaning, you're not always sure who your primary server is since you'll likely to get one person ordering your drinks, another ordering your food, and finally another person bringing your check. Here's the thing though.... you end up getting what you want so who cares! Tip well anyway and let them sort that out! Oh, the Margarita Burger is divine by the by. An absolute knockout, especially when paired with some old bay fries and a nice hoppy IPA.
