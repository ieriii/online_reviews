Seriously, this is just BIG food. It's got some flavor, but I think people who rate this place highly have gotten stuck in the American "lots of food = good food" mindset. It was nothing special. I can name at least 5 Italian restaurants in the area alone that are better than this one. Plus, the service is really slow. Not impressed.
