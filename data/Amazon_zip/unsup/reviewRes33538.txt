This is where I lost my alcohol virginity. Oh, sure there was this one time when I drank a small Kalua 10 years ago and that one time when I was 12 when I drank from bowl that was spiked and ended up sleepy for the rest of the night; however, it wasn't really any choice in either matter, so they don't really count. :) Anyway. . .it was fitting that I took this step while partaking of my favorite cuisine - and at fairly well-regarded establishment (yelp-wise). The front of the house was quite loud and noisy, thanks to the Sunday evening pre-Valentine crowd. Fortunately, I was directed towards the back (apparently there is another dining room there), where I sat at the bar, looked at the menu. It was at that moment, that I decided to order wine. I ordered the red wine - Sanguinity "Nessun Dorma". Up to that point, I thought it'll taste sweet, like grape juice. Nope. Whoa. What can I say? When you are about 36 years and drinking wine for the first time in your entire life, its hard to find a frame of reference for the experience. I will say that at first, I wasn't really liking it. Yet, as I finished the glass and ordered the excellent Pollo Arrosto alla Romana, I feel a rather pleasant feeling come over me, even a bit relaxed. I now could see why people would drink wine or alcohol in general.* I could also see how people would get into trouble. So I stopped at just 1 glass. Just one. :) As for the restaurant, I generally enjoyed the place. If I ever back in the general area (and I will in a few months), I probably going back - preferably with somebody else and most likely in the back, where it is more quiet. A solid recommend here. * I wonder. . . nah, I won't go there. :D
