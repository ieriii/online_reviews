This place truly shines. It is a wine shop, a wine bar, and a terrific small plates Italian restaurant. Service is swift but a little stressed as tables fill quickly. Wines are reasonably priced but listed uniquely with a price and a corkage fee on top of the price. Reason? This is a wine shop that sells wine and then charges an additional $6.00 to serve each bottle. At any rate, the Italian wines are wonderful. We enjoyed a sparkler, white, and red. All went beautifully with olives,beet salad, pizza, pastas, and dessert. Every food item was delicious. Place is a bit noisy but keep your eyes out for Chicago celebs among the bustle.
