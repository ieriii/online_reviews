Wonderful old hotel! We have stayed many times at this historic hotel including on both Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Over the last few years, guest rooms have been slowly renovated. Renovated rooms are now a great mix of antique/traditional/modern decor. Especially enjoy the black & white celebrity photos from the old Empire Room lining the halls of the Hilton Honors floors.  Great that pets are accepted--too bad that the are now charging $75....few years ago there was no pet fee. Also regret that Trader Vics is no longer downstairs--now that was history!
