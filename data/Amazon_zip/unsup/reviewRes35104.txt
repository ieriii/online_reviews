Ya, I know this is my 4th review of Shaw's but I gotta say, I love this place. Visited and sat in the oyster bar with my family. We had: (+)  BeauSoleil Oysters - delicate small mild oyster. for sure one of my all time fav's. Their name means: "Beautiful Sun" and they sure taste beautiful in my mouth (++) Broiled Lake Erie Walleye  Blue Crab Stuffing, Lobster Brandy Sauce - best walleye I've ever had. great recommend from the waitress. i was sitting in the oyster bar and she mentioned this becuase it's only on the main dining room menu (+)  Griddled Garlic Shrimp .- really good for shrimp, and I'm not a huge shrimp fan. ask for a side of garlic butter on the side for dipping. you can't go wrong with this. (+)  Nigiri Shrimp, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, BBQ Eel - so fresh. so good. (-) Blackened Swordfish - my brother ordered this and I gotta say, it was just ok. not a dish I would ever recommend. Yay for Shaw's. You keep me coming back for more.
