The Drake, for all you tourists and business travelers about to visit Chicago, is one of Chicago's classic hotels. The Drake Hotel sign is clearly visible on the Chicago skyline, so you can't miss it. I stayed there during a conference (thankfully paid for by my firm, since it's not cheap) and had a very pleasant stay.  While my colleagues were staying at more modern places like the W or the Marriot, I enjoyed the old-school vibe that the Drake had to offer. No, there is no WiFi connection in the rooms, but the Ethernet jack in my room worked just fine. I had a large corner room, which overlooked Michigan Ave. I could have paid a little extra and got a lake view, but decided against it (at least on this trip). The WOW factor was clearly in effect too, since many of my resident Chicago friends were clearly impressed that I was staying at the Drake.  One thing to keep in mind is that the Drake is pretty far from the Convention Center, but getting a cab there took no more than 10-15 minutes.
