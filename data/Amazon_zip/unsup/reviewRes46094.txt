I know this place is owned by the same company as the Cheesecake Factory, but it's far, far superior. My brother-in-law and went there for a much needed respite from my sister's 30 hour labor at Northwestern Hospital, and it was exactly what we needed. The drinks are original and delicious and the menu is so varied it's hard to decide what to have. I had a red sangria (yeeeum) and a pineapple basil mojito (also yum) and we started out with the duck potstickers, which were really good. For entree I had the bbq cedar plank salmon and substituted sweet potato mash for regular. Everything was really excellent. The corn succotash the salmon came with was flavorful and went really nicely with both the sweet potatoes and the salmon. Service was friendly and prompt, even though we went on a busy night during prime hours. I'd definitely go back here to try more drinks and more of their gigantic menu.
