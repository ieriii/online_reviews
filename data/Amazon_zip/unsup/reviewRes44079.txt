I was yelping my scrotum off while in Chicago to try and make sure I went to the right places to please my palate. There were many other Steakhouses way more popular than Kinzie, but seeing as my gf and myself were staying a few blocks from Kinzie and had walked by it a few times, we decied to go for it. SO HAPPY we did! For an appetizer you are a fool if you pass on the Rock Shrimp Rissoto Cake in the Lobster Sauce.. so so so so so so succulent. Oh yes please, one more time lawd. I'll be back in Chi-town asap, for this place and many others. We also had the broccoli fondue... and the bacon mac and cheese. (O_O) bless this place. Oh, wait, steak? Fuck yes. You can choose the cut of course, and the crust, and the sauce. We got carmelized onions on the dry aged Kansas cut, with a garlic crust. It was cooked to perfection.. cut like butter. I dont know how people choose their own entrees because we were stuffed like christmas pigs. Slide to the left slide to the right, power nap now ya'll.
