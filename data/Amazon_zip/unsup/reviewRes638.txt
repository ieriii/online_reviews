Alinea is grown-up entertainment for the adventurous palate. We had the 12 course tasting menu, and almost every bite was amazing and wonderful. There were a couple of dishes that kind of fell flat (dessert isn't really their forte) but even at $600 for two people, I felt I got my money's worth. Absolutely creative and delicious and amusing - you could feel the chef's playfulness in some dishes, his nostalgia in others. The service was excellent and friendly, explaining how to approach certain dishes with unusual presentation (bacon on a wire, anyone?) without talking down to us. Since our meal, we have tried to reproduce certain dishes (or at least use flavor elements in simpler dishes) because the memory of the meal is just so damn good. We don't look like your typical fine dining couple, but we were treated with respect and the whole experience is one I wish I could repeat often.
