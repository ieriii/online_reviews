My husband and i dined at graham elliot the other night and had such a great time. I must admit I was a bit wary when I read some of the recent reviews, but I was excited nonetheless because of all the press. We were seated by window at a bench table and immediately got some of that famous truffle butter popcorn, and, guys, it's worth the hype. Completely delicious, buttery, and flavorful in all the right places. We did the a tasting menu with parings so we got to try a lot of different dishes. Stand outs were the foi gras, which tasted like strawberry rhubarb pie, the lamb with the morel mushrooms, and the AMAZING chocolate dessert... oh my gosh. good thing this wasn't a buffet or I'd be going back for more. Not so hot on the skate wing with the ham sauce, but my husband liked it well enough.Service was lovely. Everyone was very knowlegable with the descriptions so we knew exactly what was going on our forks. The wine parings were delicious with the food too. So lucky to have a tour of the kitchen at the end of hte night. We met Graham elliot and got our pictures taken with him. Over all a great experience, good food, good laughs, good music. 4.5 out of 5
