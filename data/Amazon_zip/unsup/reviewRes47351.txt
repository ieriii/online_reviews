There is only one word to describe this place and that is BADASS! Trust me I don't consider myself a metal fan at all but there is something about Guns N' Roses that takes me back to my childhood. The prices are very reasonable. $3 for my Budweiser bottle, $8 for an Amazing burger and fries. Really great burgers, although they need to work on proper cooking times. My friend orders medium and it was pretty rare.... The atmosphere is great! Tons of TVs, laser lights and a smoke machine! So fun! The only thing I didn't like was that the music was WAY TOO LOUD!!!!!!!!!!! I mean crazy loud. I could not even hear the person sitting directly next to me. Yes it's a metal bar I get it, bit when I go to a bar most of the time I enjoy talking to my friends.
