I'm not much of a meat eater, but this place is really tasty! I don't eat really any red meat, and yet I still like to eat here. I particularly enjoyed the pork ribs and bacon wrapped chicken this time. Next time I might choose salad bar only (you have a choice of meat+salad bar or salad bar only) and gorge on the delights in the salad bar. The caesar salad was great, the fresh mozzarella pretty close to perfect and the potato salad...if you've never tried it you are missing out. No really. BEST POTATO SALAD EVER. In terms of choices of meat or salad bar selections..you can't beat Fogo.
