Finally a good restaurant on Michigan Avenue! The Purple Pig is foodie heaven in tourist central. The food is tasty - we really liked the pate, but unfortunately they were out of pig ears when we went, which was a bummer. The only two things that make me hesitant to go here more often are its size - it's really tiny and feels so cramped - and the high communal table we sat at, which was difficult to climb up and not comfortable at all. Go here expecting a wait, and if you can, try to grab one of the normal people tables; the high table is great for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but not petite ladies like me!
