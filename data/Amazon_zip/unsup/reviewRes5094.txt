Amazing food. Was our first stop in Chicago to eat, and weren't the least disappointed. I ate the pork shoulder, pork gravy smear and the bone marrow. All were excellent. My least favorite of the three was the bone marrow. It was very greasy and fatting. Different and good, but definitely something I wasn't use to eating.  My wife had the cauliflower with pickles, this was my favorite dish. Extremely tasty Had some Belgium wheat-barley beer, excellent.
