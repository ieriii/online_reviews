Loved it! Loved it! loved it! Everyone had a different menu item and each was as full of flavors as the next. If it was steak, it was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tender with a hint of rosemary. Salad was good. The Chops were almost sweet as the juices melted the meat on your tongue. Even the pasta was fabulous. If the menu said it was served with prosciutto and red pepper cream sauce, that's exactly what I tasted. Wild mushroom risotto was great, which can be difficult to execute without going to starch or mush. Mr Kinzie (Raphael) was fabulous, helpful, utterly attentive and funny. I go out for the desserts and I don't care who knows it. I had creme brulee because I always have creme brulee and can spot a good one instantly. Yep. The Chocolate terrine was exactly what they said and a wonderful combination of flavors. But my daughter had the PISTACHIO SEMIFREDDO! To die for. and I don't say that lightly, ever. In addition to having a wonderful meal we all said the atmosphere was perfect for our get-together. Because we had a corner booth, we were protected from the noise in the center of the room. I think we got lucky on this part but hey, I was happy! The best of all was that delicious dinner did NOT cost the week's salary. I had plenty of $$ left for a taxi home and dessert again tomorrow.
