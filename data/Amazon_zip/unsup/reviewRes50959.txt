I live around the corner. And let me say, this is a lucky thing since Wishbone is a great neighborhood place. Dinner always starts with little cornbreads and rolls. The fish and vegetables are surprisingly fresh. I'd always assumed this was a crappy chain place, but no, they do it top notch here. The Spinach sautee is deelish! I also usually get the salmon and all the sides I've tried have been lovely. It's not much in decor, but it's good for a weeknight or an easy meal. And great bang for the buck. Brunch is OUTSTANDIng! The salmon cakes are a beauteous thing which songs should be made for. The omelettes are light and fluffy and the coffee is hot and fast. Yum.
