My boyfriend and I stayed at the Hardrock Hotel in January of 2010. We went to chicago to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. Got a great rate on the room. The rockstar theme isn't my forte but I knew what I was getting into and they do it well. Overnight parking is a little pricey at $46/night but I needed to put my car somewhere, and they have valet so you can just drop your car at the door. Little did I know the REAL reason we went to chicago... While we were out at dinner/drinks at the Hancock building, my bf had talked to Jose at the front desk and when we returned to the room he had arranged champagne/candles/chocolate and strawberries for us. My boyfriend proposed in this lovely setting. Since we hadn't arranged the 'romance package' beforehand we didn't get the rose petals. Jose felt so bad about the missing rose petals that he didn't charge us at all for the rest of it! (We left him a good tip anyway...)The room was good size and very comfy. The bed was incredibly comfortable even though I was too busy planning in my head my upcoming wedding to get much sleep. Great view of Michigan Ave from the 20th floor (could even see the river!)Would stay here again in a heartbeat...
