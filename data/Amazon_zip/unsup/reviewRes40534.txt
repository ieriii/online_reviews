Great place for a quick bowl of Pho and some good appetizers. I've been going here for a couple years now, it's very good. I usually order the Pho, as it's very good and great to have on a cold Chicago day. I also like the Vietnamese pancake, or crepe, appetizer. It's a light egg crepe filled with shrimp and bean sprouts, served with thai basil, cilantro etc. on the side with a very tasty sweet and sour carrot sauce. I also like the barbecue quail that's marinated in a sweet soy, garlic, ginger and green onions. My only frustation with Tank is that they recently raised their prices, which were already a bit high for the casual ambience and the quality. I use to look at this place as having great food at a good price; now it's good food, but a bit pricy. It puts them in a different catagory for my choices when going out. I use to visit regularly, as it was a good deal. Now, it's a special stop when I have to have a bowl of their Pho.
