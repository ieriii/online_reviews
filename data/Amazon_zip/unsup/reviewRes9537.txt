It is rare for me to say that the most impressive item I ate in a night was dessert. That was the case at Sprout though, where the dishes I was priveleged to try ranged from great to just OK, but exhibited a consistent theme of exploring new tastes and combinations that I had never seen before but that proved interesting and delicious. Notables: Licorice: beautiful presentation; lacked real substance. Nice looking trio of thinly sliced pears. Didn't really contain the anise flavor promised via fennel. Venison: fantastic. Tender delicious venison perfectly medium rare with a deep red wine glaze that hinted of cherry. Short rib: unbelievable. I wish I had gotten this. Off-the-bone short rib hash almost was so flaky and tender and flavorful that I could probably eat this every day for the next month. Fingerling potatoes also extremely delicious. Lemon dessert: WOW. Lemon + goat cheese + peppercorn; how do you dream this up? I was just astonished that citrus could go with tangy and peppery so well. You really have to try it yourself. Add it all up and I was very impressed. You can even BYOB here (for a $15 corkage fee) which may not save you much if you're bringing three buck chuck but is pretty solid if you're trying to have a decent bottle with your meal.
