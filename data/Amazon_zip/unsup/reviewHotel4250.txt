I returned last weekend for the Chicago Fire game. Our rate, thanks to the entertainment book you can buy from a local school, was 50% off. For Labor Day weekend, our room rate was $143/night, which was not bad for the location of the hotel (1.5 blocks from Millennium Park). The three stars is because of the bathroom. The bathtub drain didn't work! I had to unscrew the drain and started pulled out hair and a sponge clogging the drain. GROSS. I saw a bandaid in the drain too, but I didn't bother going any further. But worst of all, the maid knew the drain was clogged. When we returned to the room, I noticed the drain was unscrewed and left in the bathtub; we had left it screwed into the bathtub. So I thought, "Oh good, the maid unclogged the drain." WRONG. If it wasn't for the location and excellent service right outside the hotel, I would give this hotel two stars. The front door guys are very helpful with directions. They also recognized after our second trip to the hotel, and they always hit the open door button for us. That's service. The checkout process took 10 minutes, since video checkout wasn't working. The "zip it" line you call that states you cannot leave a message actually transfers you to someone instead of confirming automatically you're checked out (which is the impression I received). So, keep this in mind when it's a busy weekend!
