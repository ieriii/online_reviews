Good food, good friends, good drinks and GREAT music. I love going to the shows here, i love that they just put the envelopes on the table so you can support the artists, there is no awkward cover charge and it always inspires me to throw in a little extra when I like the artist. Uncommon Ground is doing great things with their treetini while I end up calling a cab but if its saving the environment I'm ok with that. (see the website if you're confused) The food and drink list, while pretty heavy handed, is worth it. Their sommelier proved truly knowledgeable when we put him to the test. The cosmopolitan i had wasn't watered down or more cranberry juice than it was worth, it was sheer perfection. And the dinner... wow.  My family are avid duck hunters yet I have never enjoyed the taste. The duo of duck my husband ordered was exquisite. I took a chance on the pumpkin ravioli with goat cheese fondue and toasted hazelnuts. Simply typing the words makes me salivate, it was undoubtedly well worth twice what I payed.  All in all, I would eat there every day if I could afford it.
