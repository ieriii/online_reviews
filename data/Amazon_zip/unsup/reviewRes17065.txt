I needed Indian Food - within 60 minutes, delivered, to the West Loop. Honestly I had no idea where to order from. My co-worker and I found this place... they did indeed delver to the West Loop -- in 70 minutes so that's cool. We got 2 vegetarian dishes and some naan. It was pretty good. Except for the naan!! It was horrible..it was so chewy..like it was hard to bite off a piece...and it tasted, well, literally like cardboard. Also, it was super expensive...if it weren't on the company card . . . I probably would not have bothered. All in all it satisfied a need...and I'm sure I"ll do it again (on the company card)... but hopefully that naan thing was a one time deal.
