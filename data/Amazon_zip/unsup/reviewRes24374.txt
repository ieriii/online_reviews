The service is always extremely attentive... I'm not much of a fan of the savory crepes, but I love the raspberry/Belgian chocolate crepe + the green tea ice cream. Also a nice selection of teas... you choose one, and it comes out in a cute little teapot and matching cup. I love the atmosphere... it's very laid back and cozy. I always get the same server, and she is very sweet.
