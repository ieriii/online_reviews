A-M-A-Z-I-N-G and CHEAP and BYOB!!! (Cash Only) I just went on a Saturday night (FYI: it is closed Sundays) around 8pm and while we had to wait maybe 30 minutes it was totally worth it. While waiting we got to see the cooks in action and smell all the heavenly foods. In the end our bill (for two people) was just under $30 b/f tip and we ordered a lot of food. What to order: Vegetarian Burrito: A must! I got plantains added to mine which made it really sweet in a great way. Chicken Burrito: Yummy. Seriously one of the better burritos I've ever tasted. Gallo Pinto: White rice, black beans, and some veggies: good but not something I would personally order again (my fiancee thought it was really great the next day for breakfast) And then....heaven...... Chifrijo: Black beans, fried pork and veggies served with chips. Sounds simple enough but it was wonderful. I would actually consider coming here just to order this for a snack. That said I'm sure its super unhealthy. Overall: Very good, a bit crowded (b/c its great food), indoor and outdoor seating, 2-3 blocks off the Western blue line, BYOB, I think the hours were 11:30-9:30pm (M-Saturday), probably not great for very large groups (say 6+) but perfect for smaller parties under 4 (and maybe okay for big groups at off times). Anyways this was only the second time I've had costa rican food but my fiancee has spent time there and loved the here.
