Stopped in at the Purple Pig over Thanksgiving weekend. Wait time was quoted at 45 minutes but we were seated after only 20 minutes. The space is very cozy and the tables communal. The waitress was very helpful in selecting a wine. The food came out as it was ready with the cold things first. The shaved brussel sprouts were a standout. They packed a fresh and intense flavor, a bite of summer at the start of a long Chicago winter. The fried pig's ear topped with a fried egg was also a highlight. Best thing we ordered would have to be the roasted bone marrow, gooey and gluttonous and oh so flavorful.  I will definitely be returning to the Purple Pig, if you are planning on going, be adventurous, try a pig product that you've never had before! You can't go to a place called the Purple Pig and order chicken! (but you will be surprised how many people do!)
