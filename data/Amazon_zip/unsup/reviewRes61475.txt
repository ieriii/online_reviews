Well, I chose them for the Groupon Deal! The pizza was delicious! The customer service was warm & friendly! Due to an issue with the use of Groupon, I had to "wait" a little bit longer but it was a pleasant wait. The owner (?) and manager were very apologetic, but a free soda would have made the wait a little more settling! I would definitely go again!
