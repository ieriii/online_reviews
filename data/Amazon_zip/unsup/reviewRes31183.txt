I've been here a couple more times since my initial review, and my opinion only keeps getting more and more positive. I really have enjoyed the specials the last couple visits, especially the beef stroganoff. From what I can tell, any of the kinks that caused me to rate Nana lower have been ironed out with time and experience. What restaurant doesn't go through that awkward phase in the beginning? Nana's has become a treat for when my family and I feel like having a nice brunch on the weekend - great to have it right down the street from us.
