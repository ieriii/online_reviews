NOTE: within a few hours of writing this review, I received a note from the owner of Gilt Bar with an apology. Thank you. Last night my husband and I headed over to Gilt Bar for dinner. We visit Chicago every other month and enjoy dining at all the newest restaurants. We had read about Gilt Bar in Chicago magazine and the food had also been recommended to us by a patron of the Four Seasons bar the evening before. We sat down at the bar, which is where we almost always dine, and I asked the bartender if he had Grey Goose vodka, as I like to have one on the rocks prior to ordering a bottle of wine. He replied that Gilt Bar only has Death's Door Vodka. I then asked for a wine list, and he refused to give it to me, instead saying, "If you can tell me the difference between Ketel One and Grey Goose then I'll let you see the list of wines."  Well, this bartender didn't know anything about me. He didn't know that we are from Wisconsin and that I had already tried Death's Door, which has an interesting back story and obviously a wonderful salesman, because everyone is carrying it now. He assumes that we knew nothing about his craft-type cocktail business and instead chose to try to make me feel small with his know-it-all attitude. My husband and I looked at one another and stood up and left. We instead enjoyed a delicious repeat dinner at the bar at Graham Eliot, where the sweetbread hushpuppies are out of this world. We had a chance to glance at the menu and thought it looked pedestrian in our opinion, so perhaps it's a good thing the bartender was so completely rude.
