I can no longer recommend ordering any sushi here based on my last visit. I had a side order of a spicy tuna maki roll. My friend had 1 piece; I had the rest. I became extremely sick 24 hours later. Luckily it subsided by the next day for the most part, and except for needing to catch up on rehydrating myself , I was OK. I'm aware this is big claim to make against a restaurant, and I'm not making it casually. I make this assumption based on the fact that my friend and I shared everything on the table except the sushi, (she had 1 small piece), I ate nothing the next day, and I've had food poisoning before . Actually, I would eat here again.....all the soups and meats were fantastic. I suspect maybe the sushi sat out at room temp for too long.      However, if it's 3 am and you're craving some hot Korean food, this is your palace. By the way, you will stink of smoke!
