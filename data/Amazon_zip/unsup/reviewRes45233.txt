I would honestly go back to this place just for the chicken livers appetizer they had for a special last weekend-- it was THAT good-- but there are plenty of other reasons to return. The staff was very accomodating- I had forgotten my phone that day, so I had no clock, and showed up about 20 minutes early for my reservation. They sat me anyway at the table I picked out, and brought me a complimentary piece of onion tart while I waited. Martini and chocolate mousse were fine, but stay away from the boar ragu; it didn't have a lot of taste at all.
