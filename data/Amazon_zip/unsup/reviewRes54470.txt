Me and husband go here all the time. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is very friendly, and the food is great. I have yet to find a Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant that can beat this place. I have tried several different things, and have enjoyed them all.  They have a great outside eating area in the back as well. They have parking on the side of the building which helps out a lot. ENJOY!
