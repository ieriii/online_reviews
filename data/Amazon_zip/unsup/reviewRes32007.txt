I've been to Demera several times now and I consistently love it!! On my most recent visit I tried a few new things that blew me away.  1 - Vegetarian Sambussas - Holy moly were they spicy! The most excellent kind of spicy. Those puppies were so good that I almost wish I had never tried it because now I will crave them. Dang. 2 - Honey Wine - Not a fan of sweet drinks but I just had to try this and it was so worth it. Totally delicious. I must go back as soon as it warms up to try a honey wine cooler. 3 - Chicken Tibs - I love me some tibs but this is the first time I tried the chicken. It was delicious! I also always order the red lentils. They are amazing. Just need to give them their props.
