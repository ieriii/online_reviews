The atmosphere is fantastic. Low lighting and lots of candles, which is essential for any good sushi place. It's BYOB so you have to bring your own wine, but let's face it--it makes the bill that much cheaper.  BUT it's PACKED on the weekends. If you have a spur of the moment sushi craving on a Friday or Saturday night, forget going to Coast as you'll have to wait forever in their teensie lounge.  You might as well head over to Blue Fin (which has better sushi anyways if you ask me). Good food, good service, great atmosphere. A
