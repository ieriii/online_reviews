I went here for dinner and was surprised that it was like a buffet. The lamb was a bit rare, but the red tail New Zeland Deer was awesome. I love that the harvest table has so many options for you to choose from.My one complaint was the wait, we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait, 1 and a half hours later we were seated, the restaurant had at least 6 open tables.
