My boyfriend and I spent this past weekend at the Dana hotel and had the most fabulous time ever! He flew in from Ohio and I flew in from California, and this was my first time visiting chicago, so it was important that we got a little taste of everything. Terrific location first of all, within walking distance of shopping, restaurants/bars. Loved the fashionable, modern vibe the hotel had going on. Room was very clean, beds were sooo comfortable and the shower was huge! Unfortunately we did not get the opportunity to check out the spa. Drew, the bartender at the main lobby bar kept us coming back every night! He had an awesome personality, kept us entertained at the bar, hooked us up with some amazing drinks, and recommended some great places for us to go out and to eat! Rooftop bar was nice as well, very cool concept and great views, more of a relaxed setting as well. The bellman, Caesar was also of great help to us from the minute we arrived at the hotel by assisting us with our luggage to providing us with directions every time we needed to get somewhere! Overall, the service at Dana was great, and the hotel was just what we were looking for! :)
