This is the second brazilian steakhouse I've been to. That said, this is also the second best brazilian steakhouse I've been to. The service is great, and as far as comparing it to Fogo, it's right on par, good service, attentive, polite, very helpful. But, the meat, just wasn't as good. Actually, not even close, it was extremely salty, which usually means, a lower quality of meat, with a feeble attempt to mask it with salt. I couldn't eat as much as at Fogo, because all the salt, literally dried me out. If you liked Fogo, but need more salt, you'll love Brazzaz!
