These wings were delicious! Strange as it may sound though, my complaint is that there were too many of them. I got a 5 wing plate (Seoul sassy) and would have been happy to have stopped at 3. I didn't really have any take-home options since in staying in a dorm room, so I ended up eating the other two as well. That left me feeling a bit icky instead of ecstatic. I'd like a per wing price option as well, because these things are seriously huge and the sweetness of the sauce gets to be a bit much after a while (and $9 for lunch is more than I usually like to spend too).
