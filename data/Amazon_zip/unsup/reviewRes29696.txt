We were worried, because we came here on the day after Rick Bayless won Top Chef Masters. We got in line around 4:30 - only about 4 parties ahead of us. We were seated around 6, but the wait wasn't bad once inside.  Summer Margarita - with cucumber and cilantro - TO DIE FOR. Cucumber in drinks is amazing. Queso Fundido with steak and carmelized onions (2nd queso on menu) - also amazing. Served with handmade tortillas. YUM. I had the duck in black mole, which was as good as they said it was on Top Chef. They weren't kidding when they said you can taste all 27 ingredients. Each bite was a party that lasted 30 seconds in my mouth. Duck was the perfect meat, I thought. The tamales were OK, mostly serving as a carrier for the mole sauce. The braised kale was amazing. There was one piece that was crispy, and it was like nothing I've ever tasted before.  My husband had the lamb in chile sauce inside of a banana leaf - also wonderful. And the mashed potatoes had some heavenly ingredient that made them like no other mashed potatoes I've ever had.  Dessert - Empanadas with cherry-something and cream cheese, and GOAT CHEESE ICE CREAM! Like an avocado smoothie takes an avocado and makes it a dessert in the most perfect way, this ice cream does it to goat cheese. It tastes like goat cheese, but it also tastes like ice cream. I can't explain it, but I think you know that you need to eat it. The service bordered on too slow, but I appreciated not feeling rushed. The restaurant was a fun atmosphere and never felt over-crowded or loud.  Definitely get there early, and make a night out of it.
