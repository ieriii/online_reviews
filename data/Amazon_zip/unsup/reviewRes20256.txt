After realizing we had an hour or two before our dinner reservation down the street, we stopped in for what was going to be coffee and a dessert. Cochita pibil changed those plans quick. The cochinita pibil sandwich was so good. It came with a tasty habanero sauce on the side which was definitely packed some heat. Be warned! The Barcelona chocolate was very rich and thick. Your mouth feels like it's coated in chocolate for a few minutes afterwards. As far as hot chocolates go, I think I prefer the one at Hot Chocolate better. Overall, Xoco made me very happy that afternoon. I was thinking about it at my actual dinner later that evening.
