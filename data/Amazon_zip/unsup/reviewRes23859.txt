Must've walked by this place a thousand times .. always thought it was a weird hookah bar/coffee shop. In the heart of Andersonville, there's a TON of eating options, but this place is a little diamond. AMAZING savory crepes with quality ingredients. The veggies are fresh and crisp, the sun-dried tomato tapenade is not to be missed and the crepes are - of course - paper thin, slightly sweet and light. Dnner started with an AMAZING veggie puree soup that I want to bottle away for next winter. So good. We were running late for a show at the Neo-Futurists, but the services was quick and cordial. SO SO tempted to go back after the show for dessert crepe ... mmmm Nutella ;)
