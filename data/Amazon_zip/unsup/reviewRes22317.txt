This is how i figured out who would cater my wedding. Step one: What kind of food do me and my hubby-to-be want to eat? (ANSWER: Something ethnic, something fun. Most definitely NOT dried out chicken.) Step two: What would be a FUN food to have at our wedding? (Again, dried-out chicken didn't get penned onto my list.) Step three: What can we actually afford? A quick email inquiry to Irazu resulted in the most fabulous wedding meal for which we could have hoped. Henry was responsive to all of my email inquiries, forwarding a price list immediately and setting up a tasting quickly. He was very responsive to my needs for the wedding (which consisted of: Feed us all happy, bright and delicious foods) and was an absolute pleasure to deal with throughout the planning process. Fast forward to our wedding day. They arrived on time. Servers were SO pleasant and sweet. And the food? Bright, colorful, flavorful (he got the memo on the "no dried out")...everyone was full and happy. We enjoyed beef, chicken and veggie entrees, served with a FABULOUS cabbage salad, black beans, yellow rice and sweet plantains. It was wonderful. Thanks to Irazu and your fantastic staff for making our wedding day so unique and special. I highly recommend them for your catering needs!
