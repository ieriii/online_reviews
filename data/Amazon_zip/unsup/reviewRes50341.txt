Went to Big Jones for the first time yesterday with a group of 10 other ladies...we do a monthly dining club called Girls In the Hood, with a different chick picking a resto in her neighborhood to try. This time around it was Andersonville and Big Jones.  I'm the kind of person who doesn't usually study a menu before I try a new place, it drives me crazy! Its like looking at someones photos over another persons shoulders, I don't get the full picture of whats REALLY going on. I like to be immersed in the AHM-biance of a joint, smell the smells, peep other diners plates, hear the specials, and then really sink into the menu and figure out what I want that day. Normally this does well by me...when brunching in a fairly hectic environment with a gaggle of chickens...not so much. This is the reason I ended up ordering shrimp and grits. And feeling completely MEH about it. It was essentially some scramps on a bed of chewed up oatmeal. Not a ton of flavor, nothing with and RAZZLE DAZZLE. snoozy. That being said, there were a few AMAZING highlights to the experience, which include our ever-so-patient and helpful waitress Debra, the goat cheese and pepper biscuits (I mean REALLY, could you just die?), and the fried green tomatoes with really cute presentation. And the mimosas weren't hurtin' anyone either. All-in-all a cute place and an enjoyable experience but nothing I'd necessarily hike my a$$ back up to the A-ville for.
