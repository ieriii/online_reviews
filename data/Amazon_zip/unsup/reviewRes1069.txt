THE BEST HOT DOGS I'VE EVER TRIED!   HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S, HOT DOUG'S!!!!!! This place is awesome!    Where in the world can you get all the gourmet hot dogs you can ask for? When I walked in after waiting outside for 15-20 mins and saw their menu, I was just BLOWN away. Spicy thai chicken hot dog? Stop it, Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage? Really? Not really into livers but when I took a bite and the succulent duck sausage combined with foie gras was a perfect combination you can ask for. I nearly passed out! And Doug was super duper uber nice to pick up our check and thanked us for serving in the military. Serves gourmet dogs that are never seen anywhere and supports the military? I LOVE YOU DOUG!    And let me tell you, all the shows I saw on food network doesn't do any justice, you have to go and try it out. Sometimes at night, I pray that I will move to the recruiting station across from lane tech prep because Hot Doug's only few blocks away.....  But seriously, very good stuff. I would love to go there daily if I had the time!
