I went here on a Friday night with 3 friends, and everyone was quite pleased. The restaurant itself has a nice patio in the back (seats about 12) and from what I saw the restaurant appeared to accommodate around 75 people or more. The service was a bit aloof (very quick to be waited on at first, but had to wait a solid 10 minutes to place our order when we were ready), but the food is very good, and it was under $50 for the 4 adults (no alcohol). The portions were just about right for everyone (not too many leftovers, unfortunately).
