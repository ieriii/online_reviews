This is a favorite lunch spot of mine. If you've never been, it's time to get off your fat ass and check this place out. I consider the food to be a Middle Eastern hybrid - it's definitely a tad different (much less garlic) from the stuff you get around Detroit, which I consider to be more authentic. Anyway, the food rocks and its pretty cheap. $5 gets you a lentil soup and a falafel sandwich. The shawarma sandwiches are tasty but the lamb can be a little dry sometimes - I usually go with chicken and get it made spicy (which basically means they put some Thai red hot sauce on it). Even my weak tongue can handle the heat. And be sure to get Jerusalem salad on top of whatever you get instead of tabbouleh (yuck!). Haven't tried the fish yet. The restaurant itself (seating/decorations/atmosphere) is nothing to write home about; could easily be described as cozy and/or not a dump.
