I went to Nana for my best friend's graduation brunch, and it was a fantastic experience. The service was great. The attention to detail was fantastic. We enjoyed the bilingual abilities of the waitress. The owner was extremely pleasant and made the experience a very family oriented one. We truly enjoyed the beautiful ambience, combined with great tasting food. I wish I had a place like this where I live, and I have certainlyed recommended to other friends who are from the Chicago-land area.
