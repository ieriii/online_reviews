This place had great food. The service was so-so, and that's me being generous. Our waitress was having a really off day- and that's me being generous. Here's how it went down. Strike 1- the guacamole was great, but t was taken off our table mid- bite. No really they took away our food while we were still eating it. I was left holding the bag so to speak. Strike 2- The water glasses were filled in a weird way. Out of 4 of us at the table. One person got water, the others were left parched. NO WATER FOR YOU!! Strike 3- Dessert. The best part of life. Three dessert menus were thrown on the table (there were 4 of us), The dessert was pretty good though. The cheesecake flan. If the service were better- it would have gotten 4 stars.
