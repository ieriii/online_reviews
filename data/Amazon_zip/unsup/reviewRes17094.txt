I make it a point to visit this place every time I am in Chicago. Its simply superb food. The lunch buffet spread is huge and most of the food is excellent! No complaints! It is pricey...i guess Chicago is generally going to be expensive compared to many other places. I suggest try the lunch buffet first, then move on to trying dinner. The place can be somewhat difficult to locate if you are from out-of-town.
