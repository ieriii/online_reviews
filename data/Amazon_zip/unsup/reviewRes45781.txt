Really, really enjoyed this place. Much bigger than what I was expecting...very spatious and comfortable. Great atmosphere, love the decor. Food was pretty good too...had the Irish salad or something and it was pretty good. Had a group of 15, accomodated us very well and the bill was not bad at all. And our waitress did a great job without getting overwhelmed.  And the bathrooms are great too...lots of stalls.  Really like this place and think it will do well.
