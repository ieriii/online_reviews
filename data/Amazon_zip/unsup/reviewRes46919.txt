It is great to see a green restaurant in Chicago. They have a solar hot water heater with panels on the roof that was installed by Solar Service. They will have a green roof where they grow some herbs for the restaurant. They use a lot of locally grown and organic foods. The food is really good and the prices are reasonable. Their salads are especially good, but there isn't a large selection of vegetarian entrees.  They have a small parking lot and rocking music in the evenings.
