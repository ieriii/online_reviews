I was looking forward to coming to Las Tables all day because of the rave reviews it was getting on Yelp. I was sorely disappointed. I'm going to chalk it up to them having a bad night. I called to make a reservation at 630 on a Wednesday night and was told that they would be busy but they would try to fit our table for two in. We got there and the place was a ghost town. The service was horrible, we waited forever for our waiter to take our order and to fill our empty glasses. We ordered the Picada Colombiana since it seemed like a taste of everything this restaurant had to offer. Big mistake. The food came out and everything from the plantain to the chorizo was cold and bone dry. We try to never send food back but this was inedible. The second try was much warmer but the food was bland and I needed to drown everything in the 'salsa/ sauce' that came with it (and even that was oily and sub par). We'll try this place one more time but it's only worth it because we have a groupon. The only saving grace was the marinated skirt steak, I'll get only that next time but even that is nothing that would tempt me to come back and pay full price. I'd rather have my boyfriend grill me up one of his steaks at home.
