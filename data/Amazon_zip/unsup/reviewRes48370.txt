I'm sure the beer is fine here (provided they have them all, which they did not) but don't expect a meal worth its cost. I ate there a few weeks ago and I still taste the awful oysters I got every time I burp. The pork rinds are better at a gas station, the cured meat platter is an insult, and the din in this place is like a grade school cafeteria. I had to lean in to hear my friends every time they complained about the food. I flew in all the way from Miami for this?
