Disappointing experience. I was excited to try Publican--especially after all the great press. We didn't have a reservation, but were prepared to wait the hour the hostess told us it would take--happy to enjoy a couple appetizers and a beer. Nearly two hours later and several waiter screw-ups (apparently the restaurant was 'backed-up' -- on a Friday night? Really?) Seating seemed haphazard, with large swaths of the restaurant open. As a former restaurant worker I understand that reservations need to be honored but there were obviously cancellations -- there was torrential rainstorm that evening. Frustrating! Our orders were a plate of so-so oysters and the over-hyped pork rinds. Nothing memorable. The menu did look awesome, and the room is fantastic, but after my experience I doubt I'd go back...especially with all the other great restaurants options in Chicago. One last note (the capper). As we were leaving, our hipsterish waiter tried to make amends by tell us that "we should come back on Tuesday, it's probably more your 'scene'." Good to know, and we'll remember to stick to Red Lobster on weekends with my fellow stiffs!
