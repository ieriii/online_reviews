AMAZING! Went this morning with my family and had great service and delicious food. Stumbled upon the diner but accident and will be returning anytime I'm downtown. The menu is full of fresh new vegetarian and vegan options. Everyone had something different for breakfast this morning and we all LOVED our meals. The staff was fun, friendly and hip. Our beverages were constantly refreshed and we left completely satisfied. Whether you're a vegetation or not... this place is a must try in Chicago!
