Ah, Sunda. Talk about setting a vibe. As you walk in you feel as if you have entered a cool, hip Asian oasis. The layout and decorating are really outstanding. I had heard so much about Sunda since it opened, so I was really excited to finally have the experience first hand. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to try a little bit of everything, here's the breakdown. Started off with the Bang Bang Salad, lots of veggies and green tea noodles. I really enjoyed the flavors, it was very fresh! Next we had the rainbow roll and it was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Here's where it gets really good, for our entrees we had the honey ginger braised beef short ribs and the adobo braised pork belly. The short ribs were perfectly cooked and they were paired with this amazingly flavorful creamed baby bok choy. The absolute stand out was the pork belly. They gave us two HUGE pieces of perfect pork belly from Holland. The pieces themselves are of very high quality, but then add the effect of the braise...and you have some absolutely divine pig. The caramelized edges of the cuts were to die for! We ended the meal with a sampling of mochi paired with berry, chocolate and caramel sauce. The best part, the serving size on the beef and pork belly was so large we had extra to take home with us. Both were just as good the next day! Sunda did not disappoint, I will definitely be back!
