Ooo de lalala - what's not to love about this place? And what can I say that makes you want to read MY review, when there are 273 of them before me proclaiming the glory that is Irazu? You know about the oatmeal shake. In it's cinnamony goodness. You know that it's BYOB. You know it's very vegetarian friendly - they even have a whole section of the menu dedicated to veggie dishes. And there are even veggie options hiding among the other sections. You know that they've got meat options as well. Although I can't vouch for them since I'm on a meat sabbatical and I couldn't understand what my friends were saying when I asked if their dishes were good. Because they were groaning in ecstasy. Really, who understands that? You know about the cheap sandwiches and tacos - You could fill your tummy for under 5 bucks if you so desire. And, finally, you know about that oatmeal shake. Nom, nom, nom... So good I had to mention it twice. I do want to go back for the yucca - it came highly recommended. By the owner of the other-oatmeal-shake-place-that-I-shall-not-name (yes, I admitted to them I cheated on them with Irazu). Wait, maybe I did tell you something new. Did you know about the yucca?
