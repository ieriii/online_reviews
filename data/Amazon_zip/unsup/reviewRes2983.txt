Tru is exceptional. The moment you walk in to this very understated restaurant, the hostess greets you, and you feel immediately at ease. The service was impeccable, if not too attentive. The precisely choreographed plate/wine/siverware placement by a pair of servers is a little over the top, but not unappreciated. My fellow diner and I both had the four-course tasting menu with wine pairing. Although it was a year ago since we were there, I still remember the feel of the rich, velvety beef consomme on my tongue. We had a wonderful conversation with the sommelier about food, wine, and life; and they sent us home with a copy of our menu and some financiers for the road. GREAT restaurant. Worth every penny.
