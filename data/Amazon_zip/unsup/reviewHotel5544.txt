USE PROMO CODE ATT! It will save you around $30/night here. The first time I came to Chicago before I ended up relocating, I stayed here. My boyfriend worked across the street in a high rise as security and he suggested I stay here, so I did. I paid $159 after using my ATT corporate code which saved me about $30 a night. The stay was great. They don't just let anyone roll up in here and go to your room. They have to check with the front desk which will call your room and ask if it's okay for whoever it is to come up. They offer free breakfast from 6am-9am on the weekdays and 7-9 or 10 on the weekends. They serve juice, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, bagels, toast, cereal, sausage, bacon, muffins, and eggs (just and FYI - On the weekends they don't have bacon or eggs). The front desk let me pay for my stay in cash. They also offer conference rooms, vending machines, a swimming pool, internet access with a printer, and an exercise room. I stayed an additional two times after the first visit and my ATT code always worked. The staff was always friendly and they always accomodated me in any way they could or I needed. I would suggest this place to anyone. A great location for the price. **EDIT** There is also a mini fridge, a flat screen tv in the room with cable channels, and a microwave. They do offer room service as well from a local restaurant and the food is great from there as well.
