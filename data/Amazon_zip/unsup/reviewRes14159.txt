This place had one of the best Cuban sammies I have ever had. Lots of toppings, and smashed and toasted just right. I also had a chorizo empanada, which was pretty good. Not fantastic, but I think this was only because the chorizo wasn't what I was expecting - but the outside of the empanada was perfect. I just wish it had come with some sort of sauce. I certainly would try one of the other ones in the future. Also, make sure you try Iron Beer when you go - famous Cuban soda that is delish.
