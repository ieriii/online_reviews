Aimlessly strolling, S and I spotted this cute little joint and decided to give it a try. Walking in was a little cramped but cozy. I really liked the decor that gives it a "homey" vibe as well as the music. Our waitress was extremely polite and helpful guiding us through the menu. She told us her favorite dishes and recommended we try their burgers since they are, "delicious". S ordered the "Patty Melt" with cottage fries and a Ginger-Ale. I ordered "The Works Burger" with cottage fries and a cherry Coke! [Mmm! A burger and coke is my comfort food.] I'm not going to lie; my burger was really really good! Juicy, cheesy and BIG! The cottage fries-Which are thinly sliced potato slices fried, are NOM-TASTIC! S said her patty was "scrumptious" and she also loved the cottage fries. Brownie points to our waitress for being so kind, brownie points for a homey place to eat lunch and brownie points to those cottage fries I liked so much! RJ Grunts is a fun homey place for lunch guys! =]
