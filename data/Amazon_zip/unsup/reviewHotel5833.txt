Wife and I stay here when we visit. Went up on my 50th birthday for 4 days. Had a corner room reserved and they comped us a suite. It was like having a apartment in the gold coast. Service was fantastic, had maid service 2X day, turned down bed with chocolates. Didn't hear any noise from construction, concierge was very helpful and called us by our names after first day, made our reservations and gave us coupons for restaurants. I like staying at these small boutique hotels because you get the personal touch. Only complaint was they no longer have free coffee in the lobby in the morning. Best kept secret in chicago, will be staying there again.
