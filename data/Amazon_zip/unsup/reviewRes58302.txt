Great Chicago 'Za. The key here is to ask for the pizza well done meaning the cheese is baked until carmelized around the edges. This is deep dish, but not stuffed pizza. Pep/Mushroom combo is solid. Currently the location in the city is under reconstruction, but they will deliver from the burbs if you call the regular number. Worth the wait on delivery and a must visit once they re-open at the intersection of clyb/webster.
