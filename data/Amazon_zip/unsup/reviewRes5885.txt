On a recent trip to Chicago, my foodie friend recommended we grab brunch at DaVanti Enoteca, one of her favorite neighborhood digs. Since I am never one to turn down her always amazing suggestions, my husband and I met her here a few Saturdays ago for a truly amazing brunch experience. With some fresh squeezed grapefruit juice by our sides and warm sunshine pouring onto us as we lounged on the upstairs deck, we dug into our breakfast goodies. To start with, we had the ricotta and honeycomb Tuscan toast. Perhaps one of the greatest combinations ever invented for breakfast. And I'm not talking honey - I mean real, just-taken-out-of-the-hive chunk o' honeycomb. Incredible. I just ordered a side of patates - crisp potato bits served with caramelized onions and sprinkled with cheese and sassy seasonings. At only $4, it was a steal, especially considering I couldn't even finish half of the more than generous portion. My husband had poached eggs served with pork belly, avocado, potato hash, and Hollandaise sauce. You know, just a normal breakfast dish. My friend Courtney ordered the frittata blanca with veggies and arugula salad. Let's just say for her high brow tastes, it did not disappoint. While DaVanti is more known for excellent dinners, Chicagoans NEED to run, not walk, here for brunch. Absolutely amazing.
