WOW! What a difference compared to their Morton Grove location. Everything I previously mentioned were the opposite at this location. The same 20+ banchans came out, the meat (kalbi) was good. They even had glasses of water for the three of us before any of the food came out. We ordered the kalbi and grilled them. My father ordered the fish stew and couldn't eat due to the fish not being fresh. They took it back and weren't charged for it. The staff was more friendly compared to the other location. The drawbacks are the following: 1) that you should park your car down the street because the parking lot is horrible (SMALL). Not ideal for big and expensive cars. I parked the Ford Explorer down the street. 2) need to replace those LOUD fans. Couldn't have a normal conversation due to the fans being extremely loud.
