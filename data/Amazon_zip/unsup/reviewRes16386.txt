Well, the ambiance of this venue is remarkable and the service is top-notch. The vibrant colors & dim lighting is well worth the visit. The food, on the other hand, is fancy yet doesn't punch you in the mouth. I had the Atn (tuna) which was sitting in a tomato reduction/sauce. The flavors didn't work so well in my opinion. Visually beautiful, yet didn't bring out the tuna. I also had the pork Arepa, which was untraditionally served with guacamole. It was unique yet a bit bland. I appreciated the fusion of different styles of cuisine yet one would hope it tastes better than the traditional dish itself.
