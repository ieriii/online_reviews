Simple and faaaaaaaantastic. They move fast and deliver great product. I love the simplicity behind it all. Not only the food, but how everything is made. A guy just had a giant bowl mixed wiht onions and cilantro and was cranking out the finishing touches on the tacos. The steak is full of flavor and incredibly juicy. La Pasadita on the outside can look like many other Mexican joints, but they surpass the vast majority and put themselves as close to the top as one can get. They're open late too!
