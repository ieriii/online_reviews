Go there to buy speciality foods. Especially if you like to cook. The Cafe should be better, given the quality of the ingredients available at the store. The poor quality of the table service, however, makes it a spot to skip.  Buy the food. Bring it home. Cook it yourself. Unless, of course, you like waiting 45 minutes for a bowl of soup and a sandwich and paying 14 dollars for it.
