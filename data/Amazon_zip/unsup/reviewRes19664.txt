Coast has really fresh sushi and they are amazing at their plating. Downfall is that reservations are difficult to make, it's a tad loud, and parking is sometimes difficult. But, if you want to get sushi that's fresh and artistic plating this is the place. Also, as most other sushi places, they have their own speciality rolls, which I have never been disappointed by.
