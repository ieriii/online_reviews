I went there since one of my friend who is from St. Louis said this is a must-go spot in Chicago. So my friend and I went there last night and had a wonderful night. -Brussels Spouts:juicy, big portion, it's a good start to have a feast . -The leg of goat: I am not a big fan of goat, but they put a special sauce on it and roasted pretty well, I strongly recommended -The pork belly: Originally, I was craving "suckling pig" on menu from their website, but I didn't see it on the menu when I went to the restaurant last night so I ordered the pork belly instead, it was still amazing!! crispy skin, tasted like my hometown-style cuisine,everyone at our table loved them. -Cauliflower gratin: fantasy!!  good dish for vegetarian!!! Overall: the food,the ambience, and the service were terrific!! it's pity that it's a little bit expensive for students. Anyway, everyone should give it a try!!
