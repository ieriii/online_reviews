I hate to admit it but I am one of those people who does not order steak at steakhouses. Kinzie Chop House has the best salads and they have this amazing pasta dish that I love. It's bow tie pasta with chicken and sun dried tomatoes and it's delicious. The Kinzie Chop Salad is also great and I usually have trouble deciding which to get. However, the people I am with usually do order the steaks and they say that they are fabulous so I'll take their word for it!
