I've been coming in every single day for the past week for lunch, that's just how much I love this place!Their lunch combo meal of the sandwich and what you get with it is unbeatable. The first two days I just had the beef sandwich, and in the days following that I'd thought that I should change it up a bit. Tofu, chicken, fish they've got all kinds of sandwiches here for lunch.Also by having such a filling lunch here, I've noticed that I tend to eat less for the rest of the day. It makes me feel healthy :) I'm coming back for more sandwiches and probably won't ever get sick of it for lunch. 5 stars for awesome food, value and service!r
