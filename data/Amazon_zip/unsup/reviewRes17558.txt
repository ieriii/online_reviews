This place, when it first opened, was my favorite bar. The teeming masses were uneasy about the cocktails, so it was almost empty, and I could go there with friends and talk shop with the bartenders (I remember one night, about a week before Thanksgiving, where the 'tenders just started testing new drinks on a buddy and me). Then the critics found out about it, and now you can't avoid a line on any night. The service, already anemic on the best of days, became downright lethargic; I went there with my dad and SAT AT THE BAR, and it still took them HALF AN HOUR to GIVE US THE MENU. I hate that the doorman automatically makes you wait for a table even if there's one available, I hate that there's always a line, and I hate the waitresses start giving you dirty looks if you start stockpiling drinks because everything's taking too damn long. It still gets three stars because the drinks are indeed really good.
