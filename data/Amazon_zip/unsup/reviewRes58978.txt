The way I describe this place is great ideas, good scene but poor execution.The decor, atmosphere and staff all receive top grades in my book. Many of the appetizers are inventive and delicious (although there are none that I thought I really would need to try again).After asking the waiter if there was any must have items on the menu he suggested the Pork Belly. While the first bite was good, this thing was way to salty boarding on uneatable. Equally disappointing were my girlfriends sushi rolls. While they have inventive names and some interesting ideas, none of the flavors blended well.All and all, the experience was good, just not a place I would go back to.
