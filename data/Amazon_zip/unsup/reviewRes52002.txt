Thought I might try this deep dish thing, ya know give it a try A fair shake, so I found a place close to my hotel. Decent yelp word (but mixed) so I make the trek. The place is covered in graffiti, gives it an authentic feel but wait, the bathroom is spotless. Makes me think it is all a big fake, so I wait an hour for this $23 pizza and omigod this crap is more fake than the graffiti on the walls. The crust is hard dry and crumbly and filling is barely warm, and tastes like soup, this whole place smells like soup. I am sorry Chicago but if this is a representative of your Deep dish pizza, you can leave it in the Midwest. I met a nice local woman in the elevator Me: You are having fun up there (there is a party upstairs) Local girl: O yeah company party Me: Did you enjoy the Pizza (trying to hide my disdain) Her: O yeahh great as always! Well I am glad someone is enjoying all this, I Feel gross, I wish I had eaten a nice bowl of pho.  yuuk
