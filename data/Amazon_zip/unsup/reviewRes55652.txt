Howdy, first time yelper here!Me and the hubby saw this place on tv and with no reservations (make em') we waited well over an hour to sit at the bar tuesday night and enjoy some all you can eat crab legs.Yes, the crab legs were outstanding. However, we unfortunatelly had to listen to one of the waitresses brag? To her coworkers, repeatedly, and with in ear shot of ourselves and a bar full of happy eaters, about confronting some customers that tipped her only 10% of the bill. Here's a tip, keep your lip zipped.Even if the standard tip should be 15%There are bunches of people who can't afford to leave more than a 10%, you should be ashamed of yourself. The food and service was great but we wont be back.
