I've developed a love-hate relationship with this place. I know it's supposed to be good since it's R. Bayless' creation and all...and I know they give you free silverware (pick-up only)... but it really is a hit or miss here. Sometimes the cilantro is way too overpowering. Sometimes the caldos taste like the dead sea. Ok maybe that was a little too harsh...mm, no that sound about right. The last time we got take out here (ha), both of our dishes ended up being completely inedible bc it was way too salty.  And I eat pretty much any soup that I pay 15 dollars for. The churros are always yummy though.
