I had my wedding reception here in July 2010. It turned out to be an absolutely fabulous venue. The bar and seating area are a great cocktail hour location and the ballroom was perfect for a seated dinner for our 120 people.Annie Parker works hard to make sure your day goes off without a hitch. Extremely affordable and the food and drink were great!Would recommend to anyone looking to get married in Oak Park (where there are just not that many event spaces).
