I have never actually eaten here, but I live nearby so I order delivery fairly often. I have never had a bad roll or bad piece of sushi from this place. Wakamono offers a great deal of innovative rolls that I haven't seen at the handful of other sushi restaurants I have been to. Two of my favs are the emerald roll and the kani chung roll. I would also agree that their sushi is very reasonably priced. Maybe one day I'll get down there to check it out!
