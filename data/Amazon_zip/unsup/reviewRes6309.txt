Davanti is as good as it gets and will definitely be my new go-to place to take out of towners and give as a suggestion when friends quiz me on where to dine. Our dinner for three started out at the bar with wine, appetizers, and $5 martinis. Patrick (manager? GM? owner?) gave us some fabulous suggestions for starters and was incredibly accommodating. He seated us promptly, carried over our drinks/appetizers from the bar to the table, and even brought us little samples of their house infused martini (current selection is cantaloupe - TDF). We later learned that Davanti is associated with Mia Franceca and Francesca's and that he helps to the run the sister restaurants. I consider all of those places super lucky to have Patrick, he is truly an asset to the industry. Among our small plates was the ricotta and honeycomb spread, chicken liver pate, cheese selection/prosciutto, olives, and pizza. My favorite was the ricotta/honey spread which is served in a mason jar with chewy toasted bread (we ordered extra bread per Patrick's suggestion, you definitely need more than three slices). It was such a unique flavor combo and was very light and sweet (but not as sweet as a dessert). The olives were served warm which is a new thing for me but I have to say I liked it. The next best thing we had was the Pizza del Terre with leeks and mushrooms - very earth and packed with flavor. The decor and ambiance of this place is incredible. It's a new twist on rustic Italian - festive, comfortable, warm, and yet it's perfect for a date night or a girls' night out. I can't say enough good things about our night here and I'm looking forward to my next return as soon as possible. Hopefully they'll have a new house infused martini for me to try (pineapple?! please?!). My only suggestion would be to hire a valet parking service. We had a hard time finding parking even at 8:30 on a Wednesday night and valet would have been great for the cold weather.
