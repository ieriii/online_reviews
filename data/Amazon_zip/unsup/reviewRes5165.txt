Come early, Come often. That's what their slogan should say. The lady and I showed up at 6 on a Friday and it was already an hour and a half wait. There is literally no standing around room, so you might as well give them your cell and go to the wine bar (Eno) across the street in the Intercontinental Hotel. Hot damn, this place is good. Think mediterranean tapas and small plates. They also have a great selection of cured meats and cheeses. The lady and I had the sopressata, jamon, and one other type of meat. No cheese, we had that at Eno while waiting :). The other appetizer we had was the brussel sprouts, but was more like a dry cole slaw with cheese and a little olive oil. Surprisingly good. After the appetizer we had the braised pork shoulder, and it should be called Braised "babe the pig" shoulder because only Babe could produce a shoulder this tender. Wow, I'm lame. Seriously though, it literally falls apart with a slight breeze. To go along with that, we also had the mussels. Very solid, not much more to say. I heard this place had a great beer list, but was a little underwhelmed. They had some rare Belgians, but other than that... eh I can't wait to go back and get all the weird stuff on the menu that the lady didn't want to try on the first trip. Braised piggy tail!... bring it.
