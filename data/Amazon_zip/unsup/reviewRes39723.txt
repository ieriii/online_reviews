Been here on several occasions. Good place to grab some eats. Be prepared to smell on your way out. Don't wear your best cause you will stink. The BBQ is good. Spicy tofu stew is good. Alot of banchan. Hate the little parking lot esp. its full. Such a pain to leave. Oh, just found out that they are no longer 24 hrs.
