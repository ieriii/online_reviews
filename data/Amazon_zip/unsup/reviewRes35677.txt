We made reservations for NYE last year, and our reservation was pretty early in the evening (7pm). We were seated at the booth near the entrance which was very disappointing. We also kept getting hit by the cold winter draft every time the door opened. I didn't understand why we were seated there and not in the main dining room. I felt like we were casted out since we couldn't get the prime time reservations. On the other hand our food was great. It was an awesome deal, two lobster dinners with pre-selected salad and desserts for $60!! The lobsters were great! We will probably be back eventually to try and have a more entertaining experience there.
