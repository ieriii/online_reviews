We were walking through the neighborhood this summer when this restaurant caught my eye. While we only went in for a smoothie, the restaurant owner greeted us warmly and offered us water too. What a sweet little old man! The next time we returned, we didn't have reservations but the wait was not long. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. I am a big fan of BYOB restaurants that provide a warm and cozy atmosphere and this place certainly attracts a cool and casual, yet sophisticated crowd. Since then I've taken out-of-town guests there, and have used their delivery service as well. This is the perfect place for a warm get-together and a true neighborhood gem.
