This place is amazing. The service was excellent and the food was fantastic. I had the wine pairings with the tasting menu. The sommelier did a truly fantastic job with the pairings. We had the duck, octopus and beef for course 1. The octopus was ok the others were great. Lamb, steak and rabbit for course 2. The lamb and steak were amazing. Stone, chocolate and berries for dessert. Stone and chocolate were great. This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago thus far and I will definitely go back.
