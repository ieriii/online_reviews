I can't remember what I got (the names that is), but it was delicious. This was my first Ethiopian food experience and I wasn't disappointed. I had a sampler appetizer and it was very good, the sauce was amazing. I also tried an Ethiopian beer and to my surprise it was good. For an entree I had a tilapia dish and it was super spicy! I had to drink water, and for me, that's a rare occurrence. It's a great place to go for any event and the music and atmosphere match the food, which is always a plus. If you're hesitant to try Ethiopian food you should give this place a try. You might just get more than you could ever expect.
