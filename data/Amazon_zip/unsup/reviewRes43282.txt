The food deserves four stars, but this place is outta control. It seems to have become a favorite of parents who think discipline stifles their kid's self-esteem. I don't mind stepping around a stroller or two, but come on. It is never the right time to listen to someone else's kid scream its lungs out, but especially not on a Sunday morning before I've ingested any coffee. I know this isn't technically Milk and Honey's fault, but the clientele they tend to attract is worth noting. There's also no structure to the ordering process. They seem to have twenty people behind the counter, but no hostess directing people where to wait. The counter service seems to throw some people for a loop, especially when they get busy and there's just a mass of people standing in the middle of the dining room waiting to order. If you think of this place as a coffee shop with delicious food and coffee, you're not likely to be disappointed. Relaxing brunch, though, it ain't.
