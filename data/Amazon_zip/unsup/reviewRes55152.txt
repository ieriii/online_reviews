This is a suggestion for the hostess. Last night two of us arrived about 8 pm. We initially were hoping to sit in the bar, just for a drink. Then we decided: it's summer in Chicago, so let's sit outside. Only 3 of the many outdoor tables were occupied by total of 5 people. The temperature was upwards of 90 degreesand the sun was till bearing down, so it was unlikely there would be a crush of sudden outdoor dinner business. Yet, despite all the empty tables, the hostess needlessly, in my opinion, declined our request to have a drink at an outside table. I'm therefore left with a bad taste in my mouth for Q. Obviously, we went to a more customer-friendly, nearby establishment.
