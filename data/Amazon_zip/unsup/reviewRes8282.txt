If ever you have desired the sensation "it's raining meat", this is the place for you. The second you flip over your meat coin, a literal swarm of men holding sticks crammed with meat appear at your side, ready to rid themselves of their offerings. In terms of the offerings (meat) and the service (they wouldn't leave us alone) i bequeath 5 stars. Hint: cut each serving in half and share with whoever you came with, so you get to try everything.
