I have been eating at Irazu for years. It was my post-work dinner spot when I was a bike messenger for a reason, and that was that they give you a lot of yummy food, for not so much money. I still appreciate that. I seldom ventured away from the veggie burrito (it has mushrooms in it!) until recently when I decided to try the yucca(root veggie) with garlic and I have not been able to walk down Milwaukee Ave with out drooling since. Other Costa Rican treats are just as satisfying. I'm partial to the veggie sandwich these days as the bread is a meal in itself. They have a huge menu that omnivores and veggies can both enjoy. It's a great place to try if you are seriously bored of trying new things.
