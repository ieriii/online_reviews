Holy crap, get the fries with Old Bay on them. You won't regret it. One of the Top Ten fries I've ever tasted. Just do it. Third time's a charm I think. The service was good, the drinks were great, and the food was yummy, although one burger was slightly undercooked. The music wasn't loud either, and they actually played normal songs! OMG, my world is turning upside down with this place. And even though they had a Bulls game on and the Bears had won that same day, no one was being loud, obnoxious, or rude...which is strange for a bar in this neighborhood, but I loved it. All I know is that I couldn't stop talking about those fries when we left. Yeah, it's still 4 stars, but I can't give 5 away so easily. I just really wanted to rave about the fries. ::drool::
