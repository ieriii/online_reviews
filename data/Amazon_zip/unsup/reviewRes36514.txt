Usually, trips into the city is taken via the Metra and Union Station is my gateway into the Chicago from the burbs. I've been on Yelp for a few months and decided to turn to this site to find a good place to eat breakfast when meeting friends in the morning. Mili Cafe and Juice Bar had so many great reviews, plus is a few blocks west of Union Station, making it an easy walk. So one Saturday morning last summer, I was meeting a friend and was hungry too. I made a beeline for Meli. My timing must have been just right, because I was seated right away. 15 minutes later, there was a small crowd in the restaurant and out the door. The food was tasty and affordable. The portions were a bit much as emptying the plate took some effort. My server was most attentive to me and I wish I could remember her name in order to mention her here. I might be making it into the city this weekend for the holiday goings on and will definitely make the same beeline from the station to Meli. I just hope that my timing will be right and be there before the crowd arrives. When friends come into the city, I'll take them here for breakfast too.
