Well Rick has been on TV a lot... And so on our trip to Chicago (from Texas), we thought we'd give Mr. Bayless a try. I was really gunning for the mole, which I can say was great. But the rest of the meal was just so-so. I'm mean the flavors were OK, but nothing that changed my perspective of the cuisine, or for that matter it was not all that different from the (better) Mexican restaurants back home. I thought the drinks were good, but a little on the small side for the price. Bottom line: I'm totally glad we went there, but it was not enough to get us to come back (especially with so many other restaurants in Chicago to try).
