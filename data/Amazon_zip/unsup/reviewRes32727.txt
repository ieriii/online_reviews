There is some seriously off-the-hook shit happening in this place. Their baked goods as a whole have gotten so much better, they've got buttermilk biscuits now along with a few other new menu items that are defreakinlicious, and they've split their shakes into 2 available sizes for those of us who are wimps and can't finish a full-sized one in our old age. Chikn nuggets are craaaaazy good. Raw pumpkin chocolate cheesecake is basically the equivalent to dessert crack. Dessert specials are regularly a-dor-a-ble (hello, Halloween striped chocolate cake?) and yummy. And that new Monte Cristo sandwich is one of my new reasons for breathing. French toast sourdough bread and faux ham with melted vegan cheese and a mustardy dipping sauce? Fuck me, I don't even have words for that. So looking forward to Thanksgiving here! I'm praying to baby jesus that they bump the nachos back up to their original size, because I'm saving my 5th star especially for that.
