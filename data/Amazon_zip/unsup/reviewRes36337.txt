Some close friends and I were planning on doing brunch/lunch yesterday (Saturday) earlier in the week. We decided on Yolk at first because I guess it's more known and practical? We've been there before, and we personally don't think it's any special. So a day before, one of my friends suggested Meli, and I always see it every morning on my way to work. We went in around noon, and it was crazy packed from college students to couples with their hyper children. We waited a little bit and looked at the menu briefly. My 2 friends and I decided to order 3 things so everyone could share. I ordered the Symphony Crepe, the other 2 girls ordered a Caprese Wrap and the Veggie Skillet. Everything was delicious! The restaurants used organic foods, and I could taste the difference. The crepes were also not too sweet, which is how I like it. The avocodo wrap tasted very fresh and yummy! The veggie skillet were a tad too salty, but overall very good and filling. The prices are a little high for a breakfast and lunch joint, but they use all organic foods. The place is small, but cozy and bright with all the natural lgiht coming in. The only problem we had was the service. I think because it was so busy, there was a lack of customer service. Everything seem to be done in a hury. Everytime my friends asked for a coffee refill, the server asked my friends to hold the cup for her right in front of me. It kept splashing on me. Overall, it's one of the better breakfast and brunch places I've been to. I would def go again.
