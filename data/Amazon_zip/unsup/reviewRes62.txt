The best restaurant in the United States. I've eaten at almost every Michelin 3-star (and a number of the 1 and 2 stars) and there is simply no comparison. The food, the presentation, the service is all beyond belief. So good. Be prepared for a full night experience and don't make plans later...you are likely only to get a reservation at odd times (5 PM and 9:30 PM were the only choices available to me and I called right when the reservation window opened) and the experience lasted over 3 hours. Also, be prepared that the only thing available is the tasting menu, which was fine by me, but if you like to make choices, go elsewhere. The one negative, in my mind, is the absence of a bar. Only wine is available with dinner. We passed on the wine tasting, which was very pricey for some pretty modest wine selections an ordered an Australian Cab instead, which was still overpriced (hey, it's a Michelin 3-star restaurant, you expect those 200% mark-ups), but a little more reasonable. If you are in Chicago and don't mind dropping $350 a person after taxes and tip, I highly recommend.
