Had a really hard time with the stars for this one. There was so much that was working for Pequod's and so much against that I do think it all neutraled out to a 3. Just FYI: ordered in cheesy garlic bread and a pan cheese pizza (ie: deep dish). Works for: Love the sauce Wow, that cheesy, golden crust thing is AMAZING. And I don't like crust. Against: Cheesy garlic bread had a weird taste, sort of green peppery. Did not enjoy. There was so much dough and so little cheese in the actual pizza part. I am a cheese girl. I like the cheese to dough ratio to near 50% if not favor the cheese. The was like...20% cheese, 80% dough. The dough was tasty...but STILL.
