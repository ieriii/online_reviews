Zed451 looks cool from the outside and the rooftop is all the rave but the food is just mediocre at best. The harvest table is more creative than other all-you-can-eat places (like Fogo and Brazzaz) but the taste is not better. Every item I felt that I could have made them at home and made them better. The meat was not exceptional by any means. The insteresting part is tha the chef who is responsible for that dish is the one who brings out your meat to your table, thereby explaining the dish and how it was prepared. I thought that was a nice touch. I felt bad though when it wasn't that tasty. The portions are rather small in regards to the meat. I kept on having to ask for more. I also felt that with a more extensive harvest table, the restaurant was trying to deter you from eating more meat. I would probably come here again for drinks but not to eat.
