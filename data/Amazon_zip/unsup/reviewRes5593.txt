Really good food and a good time. I was surprised. The place was packed on St. Patrick's but we were lucky enough to be seated pretty quickly. Ordered 2-3 dishes per person, each costing $5-12, and everything was honestly amazing. Liver pate was my personal favorite, along with the beets + goat cheese. They've got some good beers on tap, and I don't know anything about wine but judging from the book they give you they've got a lot of them. Service was great, and we ended up staying until closing time. Can't wait to go back.
