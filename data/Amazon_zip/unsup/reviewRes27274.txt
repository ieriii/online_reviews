My new practice for reviewing places that have been "sufficiently" reviewed, which is a totally subjective measure, will now be to produce a meta-review, comprised of appropriate/funny/interesting portions of other yelpers' reviews, ellipsis delimited. Here we go: I like the spirit of this place...No more suit coats...interesting music...a soundtrack to dine by that ranges from Radiohead to The Polyphonic Spree [ed note: I really liked the music selection, which was almost exactly composed of things that would show up on my preferred Pandora channel at work]...overall...ambiance was great.  the cheez-it risotto...isn't...the prettiest dish...but...it's fantastic. Short ribs stroganoff was unreal...as in...not real. Wish...the noodles...were done differently. The white truffle gnocchi was really...fried egg...fantastic...and creative. The drink menu...provided...something to sip on...and...tickled...me. The best thing...popcorn. In lieu of...bread...GE serves...air-popped popcorn. To die for.  Overall...way too dangerous[ly]...considering...in my neighborhood. [Ed note: This didn't work out too well, as my ability to string together relevant pieces of reviews is more "moron-sourced Zagat" than "witty beyond reproach". I don't know if I'll try this again.]
