I had the opportunity to try this place out with some friends recently. Upon arrival, we were told that there was a 2 hour and 45 minute wait. We ended up waiting about 50 minutes to get a table which wasn't all to bad considering the wait time that we were quoted. I had high hopes for this place after seeing all the good press it was receiving. I would rate the entire experience a 6 out of a 10. The pizza was a little dissapointing.. it was kind of bland. The best dish that we tried was the giant spinach Ravioli it was so good I could of eaten 5 more orders by myself. The pork belly with the apple mostarda was killer also. Overall, I would go back here again but I still prefer their sister restaurant the Purple Pig over this one.
