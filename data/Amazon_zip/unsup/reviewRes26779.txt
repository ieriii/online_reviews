My roommate has been telling me for months now that Pequod's is the best pizza in Chicago. The man should forever make my pizza eating decisions, as Pequod's was able to beat Gino's East as my favorite pizza in Chicago. The crust is what really sells me. It is crisp on the bottom with a bit of doughy satisfaction just above that. Then the sauce hits you with its full arsenal of flavor and tag teams your tounge with the other toppings that are generously arranged on top. For the cherry on top: that crispy, crunchy, not-burnt-but-also-a-little-burnt edge of the crust that gives this pizza a unique personality unlike anything else in Chicago. There are a lot of seats in this place but they all seemed to get full before we left on a Friday night, and I say if you have to wait on one of the benches conveniently located just outside the door the pizza you will soon enjoy will be worth your wait. The only complaint I have is that their beer list is a little short. However this is redeemed by being filled by microbrews (aside from the token Lite anyway) and pitchers are a welcomed option. Quality over quantity is an acceptable ideal for a beer list, so pour yourself a tasty pint of Dortmunder and get ready to try your new favorite Chicago pizza.
