My dad and I tried it on Saturday night. We called ahead on our walk and they had a table waiting for us when we arrived. It was a very busy place and extremely loud. It is BYOB but to be healthy we just opted for the complementary tea. It was delicious and very different. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls to start. They were pretty good but had a thicker rice paper than we are used to so it was on the verge of gummy. My dad had the tamarind shrimp soup and I had the five spice duck salad. The soup way very good although a little spicy. It was enough for us to share. The salad was adequate. It was my first attempt at duck so that impacts my love of it. Duck is too fatty/game-y for my taste. With tip it was $29 for the two of us. Not bad at all for a Saturday night in Lincoln Park. The service was decent. We waited probably ten minutes before anyone acknowledged that we might want to eat something but that was okay since we were first timers and needed to look over the menu. I would go back again. I want to try their vegetarian spring rolls. They look interesting. It's a gluten-free friendly restaurant. Most of the dishes are gluten free which is a nice change of pace.
