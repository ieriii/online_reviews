http://en.wikipedia.org/Coming from NYC, I have been fortunate enough to experience a large variety of Bi Bim Bop. Not all fare is to everyone's liking which makes Crisp such an awesome spot to eat at. Their menu offers an offbeat approach to not only Korean food but also a hint of good old American eats. My favorite KFC(Korean fried chicken) is the Seoul Sassy glazed whole bird. My wife and I always get a buddha bowl to accompany the yummy chicken. The mild flavors of the cold marinated vegatables mixes perfectly with the steamy hot rice. Make sure you mix in the buddha sauce before you dig in(makes it ohh soo scrumptious). Non-KFC eaters should try out the Seoul Sensation burrito which has the Bulgogi beef and Allison's Atomic sauce on the side. The sweet beef with the fresh veggies and the spicy cream sauce makes for a stupendous lunch. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes to try new food venues.
