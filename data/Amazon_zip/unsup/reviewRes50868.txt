Big Jones could be compared to the Paula Dean of Chicago's restaurant scene, that is if you scratch all the butter. So notable that they: -Remain Eco-friendly with sustainability, especially with their seafood selection, and are a Certified Green restaurant (2 stars on the scale: bamboo floors, Organic/locally-grown and locally-raised ingredients, website powered by renewable energy, and more!). -Are present at the Green City Market in Lincoln Park on Saturdays providing cooking recipe demonstrations. They also buy many of their ingredients, vegetables, and fruits, plus the flowers for table decor there. -Possess one of the best fan clubs with fabulous benefits (birthday/anniversary vouchers, invitation-only wine tastings, etc). Also, they are active electronically on their blog, Facebook, Twitter, etc. Note: If you join their Dining Club, the anniversary voucher good for "Two complimentary entrees with cocktails for your big day" is too good to be true and really is "Buy two entrees, get two cocktails on the house." -Host many events that promote and benefit many not-for-profit organizations (such as the Gulf Recovery through a shrimp dinner) -A dish for everyone's diet and taste buds (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, low-cal; They make exceptions!). -Part of Open Table to easily make a reservation. -I finally made it on a Tuesday for Fried Chicken Night which is HUGE and delicious! Three large pieces of chicken are served with corn muffins, mashed potatoes, 'voodoo' greens and a buscuit. BJ recently made the Top Ten Friend Chicken list by Bon Appetit! critics. Congrats! For these reasons and more, Big Jones is in my top three "Go To" restaurants when friends/family visit, I'm asking for a Yelper dining recommendation or I'm not sure what I have a taste for...
