My husband loves this place and comes a lot for lunch with his co workers so I decided to take some out of towners here to try out "chicago dogs". The hot dog was delicious, but one thing I didn't like is that you can't only order a hot dog or only french fries, you have to order the whole box (hot dog and french fries together) which i am not a fan of. I feel like this place is not a place that you can dine at. There are tables for you if you do decide to dine in, but this place is more of a drive through, take and eat else where type of place. I can't imagine eating outside, and with how busy it is, there is never a place to sit anyways. You can eat in your car, but I'm not a fan of eating in my car either. The place was good, but this is not a place I'd come back to often. Probably only when husband begs to have a hot dog.
