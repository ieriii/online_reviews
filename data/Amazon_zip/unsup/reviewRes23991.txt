Every time we want to have authentic Greek food in the city, the Greek Islands is our #1 choice along Halsted. Family style food at a great price, with plenty of parking within a block or two. There was not too much of a wait time depending on the time of day, but it is a huge restaurant with a lot of tables. This place is ideal for birthdays, large get-togethers, or just a simple meal. You can order individually or order family style, which has plenty of food either way. The atmosphere is festive and the wait staff is always super nice to everyone, always accomodating to everyone, and service up special favors.
