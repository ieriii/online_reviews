Falling out of love . . . quickly. It used to be that if anyone badmouthed Nuevo Leon I'd take it as a personal insult. I was definitely a convert. Now . . .   there's much better out there. I took some friends there who were looking for some keepin'-it-real, spicy food but we ended up getting mostly bland dishes and a guacamole that tasted like it came straight out of a can (the texture even looked like green tomato paste). I'm latino and ordered grilled/blackened jalapeos to raise the stakes but even those were mild (my asian and white accomplices even thought so). The chicken mole was ok (granted that really good mole will always be hard to find), and the carne asada was a bit above average good. The only good dish was the quesadillas Raul which were above average. I would've given 3 stars but the following pushed it down: Nuevo Leon has never been extraordinarily clean but the food was always excellent so you didn't care. Once the food suffers, all other flaws are highly noticeable. They don't have "agua de jamaica", don't have "tortas," and you're forced to order tacos in multiples of 3. When we wanted a receipt to expense the dinner, they refused to give one to my friend. I had to walk over and complain in spanish so they'd shut up and give us something we're entitled to. Nuevo Leon, la estrellita que ya no brilla. Disappointed.
