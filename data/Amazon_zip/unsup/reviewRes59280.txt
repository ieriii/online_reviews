This is one of the WORST restaurants I have ever been been suffered to endure.I've been twice. Once I went there and ate with friends. The sushi was of poor quality. So much so that I didn't want to eat it.The second time I ordered a delivery of the Seafood Madness. Not only was it disgusting, but it totally smelled (bad) fishy and the squid/octopus was like smelly rubber.Awful.
