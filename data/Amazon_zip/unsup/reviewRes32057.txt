Even if you are not a wine drinker or don't typically like sweet wines, try the honey wine! I would go back to this restaurant just for the homemade honey wine. It's delicious! Also needed a sip in between bites of the vegetarian sambussa...that stuff is SPICY! First experience with ethiopian food so we tried the vegetarian messob sampler for two ($34...appetizer, meal & dessert for 2 people!). Great way to sample lots of new things. Some of our favs were the ye-shimbra assa and ye-dnichena carrot alicha. We had the sambussa turnovers for dessert and they were kind of dry. Heard the hibist & ethiopian fruit medley is good, but they were out. FYI....YOU DON'T EAT WITH FORKS. The food is served on a large platter on a spongy thin bread (similar to sopa or naan) and you use the bread to pick up the different foods. A little messy but really tasty! Make a reservation for dinner. This place is busy!
