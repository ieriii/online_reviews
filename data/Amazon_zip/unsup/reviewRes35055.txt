I ate here on Saturday with a coworker. We showed up at 7 pm with no reservation but were able to grab a seat at the bar and have dinner right there, bonus! The bartender was great - very cordial and attentive. He even provided a few taste samples when my friend was trying to decide on a single malt.  Alaskan crab app was delicious, but unlike Joe's down the street, it was not cracked and prepared. I know that is the norm, but also why I rarely order Alaskan Crab legs as they tend to get a little bet up in the process. Dinner was good. Between us we had the MahiMahi with Asian veggies and a steak and shrimp combo. All very fresh, well cooked and tasty.  The key lime pie was fine and the coffee was terrible - colored water.  Aside from the service and the atmosphere, which were both above average, everything else was average.  J
