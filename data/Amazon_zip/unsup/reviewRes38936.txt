Since the boka experience, longman and eagle was my second stint of michelin awarded restaurant. I thought the ambience was great. We ordered, since we had to wait for an hour or so before being seated, a non-alcoholic bloody mary, which was so so at best (I don't drink alcholol, so I am missing all the fun part). Their food was great. My chicken waffle was surely one of a kind. The chicken was cooked perfectly, soft, crispy but not soggy and had a unique taste. My wife's fennel salad? was also good. The lentil and the raisin had a perfect match. This is a definitely 4-4.5 star restaurant which huge potential to have 5 in my next visit. We will see.
