I found Hot Dougs when I was a vegetarian and his shop was located on Roscoe. Sounds like a crazy way to find a hot dog shop but I only found it because his shop was the only one that had vegetarian hot dogs served "Chicago style" something I missed dearly while avoiding animal meat. My heart was broken into pieces when his original shop burned down but was then put back together again when he reopened on California. What I love about Doug is this ... he seems to remember me. I feel like he must come across 9 million people a day (OK. maybe I exaggerated 8 million people a day) but when I come up to the register he's always super friendly and like hey, the vegetarian hot dog girl...and I don't mind being called that because you Doug are awesome. Sure there's a wait, I usually call my order in ahead of time and pick it up to go to avoid the line. The fries are delish and this is the only place in Chicago that I can find Tahitian Treat....(it's a Cali thing ;) )
