It is busy but good and the beer selection is just awesome! I had the 'Mussels for One' and was little dissapointed due to the lack of seasoning. The frites were good and the selection of beer out of this wold. It is VERY packed and I just got lucky to walk in right as the person at the end of the bar got up because within an hour I had people breathing down my neck and yelling orders in my ear as I was trying to eat. I am all good with the crazy busy Chicago bars, but it was a bit too much that night have people constant hitting me from behind. I would have stayed longer, but just ate and ran. If I was there just to drink good beers with friends, it would have been a 5-star review. I will go back again very soon and update my review accordingly because I know there is more to this place then my one night.
