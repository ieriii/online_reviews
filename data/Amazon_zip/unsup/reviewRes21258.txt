This place is solid. 3.5 - almost 4stars What you'll get is super friendly fast service, flavorful dishes, and lip-smacking margaritas. Yes, the margaritas are expensive, but tasty.  Looks small on the outside, but has additional back dining room and small outdoor patio. Overall, a worthwhile splurge for mexican food, (splurge meaning a tad pricey) :) We went on Cinco de Mayo (I know, I know) at 5:15pm and got one of the last tables for 2 outside. It just so happens to be our anniversary of our first date, and tradition for us... Appetizer: queso fondido (sp?) - melted cheese, chorizo and peppers - highly recommended. For dinner we split the chile verde which was flavorful and super tender. Washed down with margaritas!  Between us we tried the gold, house and pineapple margaritas. All were fantastic. GO HERE! :)
