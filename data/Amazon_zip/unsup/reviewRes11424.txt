Let me just say that the best judge, in my opinion, of a breakfast/brunch place is the eggs benedict... The Bongo Rooms Eggs Benedict with spinach, roasted red pepper, and feta were amazing! One down side was that the eggs were a little over cooked, I like the yolk to run a little bit into the hollandaise sauce. My friend and I also shared a blueberry and lemon ricotta pancake. Soooooo delicious! So as far as breakfast joints go I'd definitely recommend this place!
