My husband and I visited The Publican on a recent visit to Chicago based on the Eater 38 and a recommendation of a coworker. It was awesome - by far my favorite restaurant of the trip with a fun atmosphere and great food. We were just there for happy hour (and I wish we had stayed for dinner and cancelled our dinner plans, because The Publican was so much better), but we tried a few beers and a few dishes. One thing that is great about The Publican is the beer menu - they have a really interesting selection of draught and bottled beers and the servers (and bartenders) are all very knowledgable about their offerings. We tried 3 different beers - a milk stout and two pale ales. One of the pale ales was so tasty (the Three Flyods Zombie Dust) that I had to order a second, rather than trying another beer. Oops. Then we tried the little gem salad (which comes with crispy pigs ears and radishes) and the charcuterie plate. Both were absolutely outstanding. The head cheese on the charcuterie plate was among the best that I have ever tasted and being an adventurous diner living in NYC, I run into head cheese a good bit. They also served a deliciously porky sausage. We also asked for bread and butter to eat with our charcuterie and you should do the same because their goat butter and peasant bread are yummy. So if you like pork you should totally get the charcuterie. The same goes for the salad - the crispy pigs ears were the perfect crispy, salty element. They weren't overwhelmingly porky so don't worry about that. They were perfectly balanced by the light and tangy buttermilk dressing and the crunchy, peppery radishes. I loved this place and I can't wait to return to Chicago so I can check out more of the menu!
