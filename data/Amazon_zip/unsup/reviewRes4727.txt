I must say, my friend and I expected to be turned away or at least told to wait for 30 min to an hour, but miraculously we were shown to a table immediately (on a Friday night!). The waitress was bubbly and happy and tattooed - a rare combo, plus very knowledgable about wine. She suggested a nice red for under $40 and we enjoyed her choice tremendously. We also got the Charcuterie plate, mussels, olives, and the skate. All were amazing, except the skate, which tasted like a cheap fried fish. Overall, I loved the place, even though it was loud and packed (My and my neighbor's elbows were almost touching). I'll definitely be back!
