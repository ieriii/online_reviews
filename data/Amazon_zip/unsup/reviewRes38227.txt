What can I say that hasn't already been said? Incredible beer selection, really knowledgeable waiters/waitresses/bartenders, and great food. The CB&J is crave-able and the duck rueben is also really good. Just make sure you ask them for their fries instead of the chips that come with those. The skinny little fries they make are worth eating. And they come with a delicious garlic aioli dipping sauce. Yes, It gets crazy busy and really loud on the weekends and some weeknights, so if that's not your thing avoid it at those times. But if you're willing to wait for a table for a bit you will not be disappointed.
