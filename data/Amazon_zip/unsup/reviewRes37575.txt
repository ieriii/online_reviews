helpful and attentive staff sort of makes up for everything being way overpriced. it's not the sort of place to buy staples. though, their aged beef is tops and the folks at the cheese counter know their stuff. like the deli/sandwich shop as well. nice place to check out while catching a flick at the amc river east. oh, and their oil staion is tops. c'mon... you know you want to over indulge in samples of olive oil. go ahead, take another dip of the truffle oil. no one's looking.
