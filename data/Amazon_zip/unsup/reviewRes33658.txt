I can't seem to get my falaFILL of Sultan's Market! A long time ago, a friend of mine introduced me to the shawarma. Marinated chicken, hummus and cucumbers and a slightly spicy, kinda sour sauce served in a pita pocket. I did not like the shawarma. Fast forward a couple of years later and I'm finally ready to confront the shawarma for the second time (I'll try anything twice, lol). For some reason, Sultan's Market's shawarma sandwich was so much better than the one I had tried years before. The flavors were bold yet balanced ... a completely different experience from my first time. I also love the salad bar. There are these spectacular rolled grape leaves, seasoned baby-squid, mushrooms in balsamic vinaigrette among other things. The meat pies and spinach pies are also really, really good! The only thing that irks me about Sultan's is their cash-only policy (there's an ATM there, but show me someone who enjoys transaction fees). Aside from that, Yay! I'm a fan.
