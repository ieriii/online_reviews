Fortunately for me, Gino's opened a new pizzeria right off Michigan Ave and Superior right before I rolled into town, which made eating here very convenient. Gino's is a Chicago institution and is famous for its deep dish pizza. It's a well deserved reputation. The pizza is phenominal! And now really convenient. Just keep in mind that it takes 40 minutes to bake so get there a little bit before you start getting hungry.
