I've been twice. The food is good, but I feel like a little over-hyped and over-priced.  On my first trip, xoco was crazy busy and a friend and I grabbed tortas to go. I got the milanese torta - good, but not great.  I took my brother on my second trip as he really wanted to hit up a Rick Bayless establishment.We managed to go at an off time, and didn't have to wait very long for our food. My brother found what appeared to be a used toothpick in his food. My brother shrugged it off, even though I wanted to report it to our server. Again, I felt the food was good - but maybe not worth what we paid. On a high note - we each got beers, and our server made sure to get us two extra cold ones on a hot Chicago day.  I will definitely be returning, though not sure if I will wait when there's a huge line.
