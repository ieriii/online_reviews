Their chicken fettuccine Alfredo has left a taste in my mouth that I can't remove. Even when I look at other Italian menus, I avoid ordering other variations of this dish, simply because I know it will only ruin the flavor that my last Pasta Bowl visit left.  Frankly, it's best Italian dish this 24-year-old tongue has ever wrestled. Service staff is always friendly, and the adjacent bar , "The Other Side", creates a fun atmosphere. Overall, one of my favorite places to eat. Ever.
