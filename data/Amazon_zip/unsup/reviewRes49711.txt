I had pretty high expectations for Las Tablas, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to them. First off, Giovanna B. was dead on when she said the place smelled like paint. Five months after her review, I swear I smelled paint when I walked in. There was only one other table there when we were, for an earlyish Saturday dinner. Still surprising to see so few other customers, though. The service, though friendly, was rather inattentive. The food, however, was the main disappointment for me. The grilled meats all seemed to be rubbed with the same spices and tossed on the same grill. Normally, that wouldn't be much of a problem, but the spices they used didn't seem to mesh well with either the steak or the chicken. There was also a weirdness to the char flavor; I've had plenty of meat prepared in the same way but in these the char seemed to be fighting the flavor of the meat, rather than complementing it. The flank steak was incredibly tough (even for flank steak). The sides, at least, were good. Unfortunately, I can't make a meal out of one plantain, some yuca, and a potato. I hope I just came on an off night, but I'm not sure if/when I'll be coming back.
