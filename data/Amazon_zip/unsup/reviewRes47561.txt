My boyfriend wanted to go to a Brazilian steakhouse for his birthday and after talking to a friend of ours we settled on ZED451 over Fogo and Brazazz. Honestly we chose not to go to Brazazz simply because of their 18 or so cuts only 6 were available at dinner and we wanted more variety.  The ambiance was lovely and not too loud like most restaurants. The drinks were good, but I would suggest staying away from the Fallen Pear martini. It tastes like Thanksgiving in a glass and not in a good way. My dirty martini and the sangria were fantastic though so it wasn't a total loss. Our table was in the middle of the salad bar next to the fire, which was quite nice. We had easy access to all the deliciousness (the cream of mushroom soup was surprisingly stellar) and we had chefs at our table very consinstently bringing a different cut of meat/chicken/fish. The server was great, she was always checking on us making sure we were doing well and whether we needed more bevs. Basically we had an almost perfect night out thanks to ZED451 and I would definitely go back for more.
