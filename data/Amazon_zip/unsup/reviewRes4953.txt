An entire restaurant devoted to my favorite animal to entirely eat? Lessgo!! So my friends came here for a going-away dinner (well it's only for a couple weeks, but a good reason to hang out anyway) on a weeknight. I guess they don't take resos unless you have a party of 8, but you can come by an hour ahead of time to put your name on the list and come back later. Pro. Everyone on Yelp has their list of must-haves...here were ours: Eggplant with goat cheese - so nice we had it twice. Savory eggplant with the creamy and sweet goat cheese was a great combo, and was surprising because half of us hated eggplant, and the other half hated goat cheese Bone marrow spread - so nice we had it twice, also. Salty, fatty goodness on some plain bread as a vehicle. Iris dessert - I think this replaced the "ridiculous" from Sunda as my favorite dessert in Chicago. The iris' advantages: chocolate, pastry-like hot crispiness, and chocolate Pig ears - as any Filipino will tell you, chicharon (aka pork rinds) are the snack of the gods. These are like those, but in crispy stick form. I'll be back pigs. Stay delicious.
