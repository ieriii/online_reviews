One of my favorite new Mexican places in Chicago!!! I'm a true Tex-Mexican and have been trying to find a "place like home" for a while. As soon as we walked in we knew it would be good - that amazing aroma of grilled meat, fresh tortillas, beans and salsa....delicious!! It is a casual sit-down, the service is great, and their menu could get anyone drooling in seconds! My favorite things so far has been their tostadas (amazing beans!), chips and salsas (they bring out 3 different kinds PLUS a bowl of jalapenos!) and their barbacoa....was so excited they actually had barbacoa! Made for a delicious brunch - and there were enough leftovers for the next day. The one thing I have not liked is their enchiladas that come with the combo plate - they were actually SWEET. It tasted like they used sugar on accident instead of salt! I'll still give them 5 stars though because their other dishes were excellent and I'll keep going back to try more, especially with such great prices. It does get crowded during rush hour, but the wait isn't too bad (10-15 minutes) as they move tables pretty fast. Don't forget to bring cash!
