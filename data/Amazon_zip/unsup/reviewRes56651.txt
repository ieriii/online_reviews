We went here for dinner, got here early at 5:30 on a Saturday and there were already larger parties having to wait, but my wife and I were able to get seated immediately. The food was fantastic. The dishes are small and you can order as you go. We started with ricotta/honey spread with bread that was incredible. We thought that the special for the evening, ox-tail dates and polenta was amazing. The ravioli was good, but it was one gigantic ravioli and did not blow us away like the other dishes. The cheese and meat tray was good, but we could have done with out it. I say stick to the specials and pick one of their amazing spreads with bread. The price was so incredible, the only thing that made our bill higher was the bottle of wine (with a cork fee).
