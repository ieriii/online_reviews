I've been to Geja's before, but recently went back because of (you guessed it) a http://restaurant.com coupon (do you see a trend here). I'm allergic to shellfish so that took out a lot of menu options for me. But we got the steak and chicken along with the delicious starters and dessert. We had the cheese fondue with fruit and bread to start, then our main course with lots of yummy veggies and dipping sauce and then chocolate fondue for dessert. We even got to roast marshmallows.  Two things-- first, the place is REALLY dim. Cooking chicken in dim light= bad. I did not cook a piece all the way through and got sick. Granted it was my own fault since I cooked it, but at least make the lighting high enough that I can tell if my chicken is raw inside! Also, while the server was amazing, polite, informative and helpful, I got a bad taste in my mouth from the hostess who made us feel bad and somewhat unwelcome for not having made a reservation. We were there so early in the evening and it was a spontaneous decision and we had no problem waiting. It was just the way she approached the situation that kind of irked me. Won't keep me from going back but just a minor detail worth discussing. It is pricey and it always makes me wonder why cooking your own food is so expensive!
