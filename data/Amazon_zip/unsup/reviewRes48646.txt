I L-O-V-E-D The Publican -- while this may not be an entirely unique sentiment, I want to note that prior to yesterday, I had no intention of ever going there. I had heard it was 'pork heavy' and since I don't eat pork, I thought I would steer clear. A friend was in town and dying to try; since that trumps the pork card, we went for the Sunday dinner. It was less crowded than I expected; a nice surprise though I don't think that I would've minded if it had been full of people...the space is great. It seems like they thought of every detail - right down to the space saving ledge under the chairs (where else to put purses, umbrellas, etc when dining communal style). They started us with a squid salad -- one of the most delicious salads I've ever eaten. I think that they could have just given me two more of those and I would have been happy for the night. The vinaigrette was the perfect compliment to the squid, fingerling potatoes, and greens. Our second course was a sardine pizza... definitely interesting; I felt adventurous trying since I associate sardines with the killer family in The Burbs. The flavors all went really well together but after a 1 1/2 pizzas, I was sardined out. Our last course was a bass fillet - hands down one of the tastiest pieces of fish I have eaten! My only regret is that we went on Sunday; I felt like I should be conservative and went with only two beers (so many fantastic choices!!). If you decide to try, go hungry; I was still full in the morning.
