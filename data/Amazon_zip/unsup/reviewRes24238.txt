5 stars for the oatmeal chocolate shake, pork dip (Chifrijo) to start - i still dream about this, garlic yuca, and pork sandwiches (Pepito is the best). delicious, delicious, extremely filling and very reasonable to boot. if i lived nearby i would go every day. looks very unassuming on the outside. during peak hours expect a wait. but it's well worth it!
