Irazu totally and completely deserves the praise it's gotten from other reviewers. Since I'd been spending the week at my cousin Melissa F's house (which is why all of my recent reviews mention the common foodie experiences), we were doing a culinary world tour and Irazu was a place we knew we'd want to stop from the beginning. She'd spent part of last summer in Panama, and since there's seemingly no Panamanian restaurant in the city, this was the closest we could get. We approached the restaurant at 8:30 on a Tuesday and were dismayed to see patrons waiting all over the place in front of the restaurant. Fearing a ridiculous wait, we went to put our names into the line as soon as possible and found that it was just the line for patio tables. Seeing as it was still 90 degrees and humid, we selected an inside table and were seated immediately. Our waitress came promptly and quickly took our drink orders and got us the guacamole (again with the guac, I know...it's not costa rican but it was good) we asked for in a minute or two. We decided on getting some empanadas and then we both settled on some steaks (she got cubed tri-tip and I got a skirt steak. The empanadas arrived hot and fresh and although I was not a huge fan of the plantain one (just don't like plantains I guess), the chicken and beef and potato ones were delicious. The steaks came soon after we finished the empanadas and they were great. I ordered mine with the special Costa Rican rice and I was not disappointed. The steak was brilliantly seasoned, the rice and beans (and whatever else was in there) were really nice and zesty and i gave my cousin my plantains, which she said were really good as fried plantains go. I highly recommend this place and I'm going to come back soon.
