I am totally not down with Piece charging me full price for ingredients only specified on half of the pizza. Half orders mean half price. Seriously, I'm not fucking around here. Attention staff: Spend less time fraternizing by the server kiosks and more time inquiring with your customers about their needs. Better service equals better gratuity.
