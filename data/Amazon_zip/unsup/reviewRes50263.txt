Went there with 2 friends tonite. Heard about them through http://restaurant.com where they were promoting, so bought a $35 voucher for $15 to check it out. Good service, great burgers and wings. So looking good. But it stops there, evening ruined becos of a very very stupid supervisor with a ridiculous attitude problem. At check out time, the nice server said the voucher is no good with promotions.We wanted some clarity and asked to speak with their supervisor. A very thick (headed) Scott Wiener came to our table looking for a fight. Babbled on and on about the domestics were $1, asked my friend to not interrupt him and . Our points are: 1. Our food was full priced. No promo. 2. Idiot was too slow to understand the concept of http://restaurant.com and promoting there for limited time only. 3. If the shitface had explained nicely their policy, I wouldn't be writing this review now. We will never go back there for as long as Wiener works there, and we will tell all our friends in Chicago the same thing.
