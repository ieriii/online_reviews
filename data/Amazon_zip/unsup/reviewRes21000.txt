One word......Amazing!!!!  oh and they are BYOB with 2 liquor stores less than a block away. I have been to this place about ten times and it gets better each time. I have not had one thing that I have not liked there yet. Also the service is always good. one guy almost knows to much about sushi, i had to cut him off and just say that ill have one of those.
