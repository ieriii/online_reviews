My parents and I both loved the atmosphere and food during their recent visit. The restaurant is set up with several rooms, so it seems intimate for such a large place. I highly recommend the filet medallions. It's like getting three mini steaks each with a different crust/sauce of your choice. It definitely helped that we also had an excellent waitress. I would come back here with my parents or friends for a special night out.
