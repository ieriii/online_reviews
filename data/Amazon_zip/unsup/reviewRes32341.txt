A new favorite! Chicago Diner is meat-free, with the option of making many of the dishes vegan as well. But flavor and variety are not compromised at all! I went there this morning for brunch, and sat outside on their great back patio. I ordered toast, tofu scramble, and potatoes, and it was all fabulous! Very flavorful, healthy, and inexpensive. Really friendly, prompt staff. I will definitely go back as soon as possible!
