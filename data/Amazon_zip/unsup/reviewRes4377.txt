Remember that old commercial where it says blah blah and leave your visa and american express b/c American Express is the onlyone accepted, and you thought, "What the fuck place only takes AMEX?" Just thought I mention it. You can smell the history upon your first step inside, it used to be speakeasy (with underground tunnels), and was once frequented by Mr. Capone and his cronies abound here. (on their website, details an incident of someone's tongue being cut off here, 'i hate when that happens').   But it's a jazz club, and that's foremost of why people come far and wide to visit. I saw a Hammond B-3 band, i think they play most Tuesday nights spreading out three sets nightly, they were great.   With such a cool and upscale atmosphere, you would thing the patrons stuffy or snotty, it's not, at least on my night, a welcome mix of all sorts. They even have Pabst on tap. Although my whiskey sodas were a bit overpriced at $5.50, but after a couple who cares? Bonus points for asking this chick for a smoke, and having drugs spill out of her Parliaments, radness!
