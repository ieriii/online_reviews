and yes the yelpers are right, they have the best crab rangoon here. been here few times and im still not sick and tired of their food. I love this place, small but trendy,classy and very cozy. servers are awesome except that one night that waiter keeps on asking us if we need something else as they are already closing. oh well. i still love them tho. I wont say it's the best thai restaurant but it's one of my favorite!
