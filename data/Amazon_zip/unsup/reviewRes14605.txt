I stumbled upon this place for lunch one afternoon when taking my dog to the vet and I must say, I was impressed. The ambiance is very casual with a festive decor and the option to eat indoors or out. When I informed the waitress taking my order it was my first time there, she eagerly inquired if the order was for me and provided her recommendation of the cuban garden salad with avocado. The service was great and the dog friendly patio lunch was just what I needed at the time. The chicken garden salad came with tomatoes/onions, added avocado, was very well seasoned and left no disappointment.....very tasty. I must say, I will definitely be back!
