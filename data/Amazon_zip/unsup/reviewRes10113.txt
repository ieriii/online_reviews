Restaurant Week Lunch menu was delicious! I went with a friend of mine and we loved all of our choices. I'm so full - the portions were huge and very filling. Perfect choices for a chilly Chicago afternoon.... The roasted pear and goat cheese arugula salad was delicious with great sweet, salty and lip smacking puckery flavors. My veggie "soup" was soaked in crusty chunks of bread and served to the consistency of stuffing - it was pan fried then drizzled with olive oil. Entrees were spinach gnocchis with a mushroom sauce was so SOOOOO good. And the wild boar sausage was delicious, served with pan fried rapini (one of my fav veggies) and white beans. Dessert - oh my! got sorbet and gelato trios which came out to 6 heaping scoops of yumminess. Tart and sweet at the same time!  I can't wait to go back and try their regular menu. A restaurant like this with gourmet food and atmosphere that serves AWESOME wines at $6 a glass is a keeper! Our server, Joey was awesome - very attentive and helpful as we had to rush out to an appointment. Beautiful ambiance with an open kitchen for those curious to peer into. Recommended for a cozy, romantic dinner!
