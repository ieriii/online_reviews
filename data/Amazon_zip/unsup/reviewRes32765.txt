This is my girlfriend's favorite restaurant in Chicago. We were lucky that there wasn't a wait on a Saturday evening because there was a street festival happening. I ordered the wrong thing here. I got a veggie cheese steak. When I passed a table on the way to be seated I saw one and thought it looked like the sandwiches at Govinda's in Philly. It was pretty bad. The seitan was unseasoned and gross. It had a gross texture and the dairy cheese and peppers just didn't help anything. The bread tasted pretty stale and it just wasn't too good. Margit ordered the reuben and she was spot on. It was a decent reuben and a terrific veggie reuben. They really do a great job here mimicking that sandwich. We also ordered a chocolate peanut butter shake and that was pretty delicious too! The one great thing was the music... what other restaurant is gonna play The Stranglers? Answer: nobody.
