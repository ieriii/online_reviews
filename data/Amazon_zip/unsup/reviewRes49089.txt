arrived for our 9:30 reservation on time, table not quite ready, luclkily they had a high top table available for us to wait. no seats at the table which was interesting. beer list extensive so the cocktail waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable in steering us in the right direction. hostess came over and apologized for wait, and informed us that we had some snacks coming on the house including fries and pickles/beats and green beans, nice touch! sat just before 10 at communal table which was alright due to the fact that our neighbors were very friendly. dinner was very good, they recommend sharing, so we tried oysters and mussels which were fantastic, beet salad with burrata cheese , salad with sunchokes and gouda, pork belly, and ham sampler. all very good, ham sampler a bit disappointing though. interesting tid bit, on beer menu you can buy the kithchen a six pack of point beer for $10, which we did! however they would not sell us a point beer?  definitely a memorable dinner!!! Second review after a recent trip...I will give this place a 5 star! Great experience!  Helps a bit when you know someone on the inside, because we recieved preferential treatment, the three of us absolutely enjoyed everything we ate/ drank and atmosphere. Love this place!!!!!!
