I've been to Fifty/50 many times but just recently have discovered their wings. OMG. They are HUGE and this is a bold statement, but I must say I think they are the best wings I've ever had. Ever. Their burgers are also really great. You really can't go wrong - it's bar food done right.  I actually like the atmosphere in here - it's a good sports bar and I've always had fun when I went. Yes their tool population is higher than in most neighborhood spots but it's a nice change for the area, and I haven't found that it detracted from my experience at all.
