Happy Birthday to me! That was the occasion for stopping at this Little Italy treasure. Even if you are up against a long wait for a table, you can belly up to the bar for a glass of vino (GREAT selection), or you can meander across the street to NAME OF BAR for a cocktail. Best part about that, is Davanti will call you when your table is ready, so no nerves about missing your opportunity. If you order wine by the bottle, try the Bramasole la Bracesca (Syrah Cortona) which was suggested to us by our server. We like a big, bold red and this was right up our alley. When it comes to the entrees, they do it small plates style, allowing for you to try a little of a lot. ... ... and sadly, your check will end up being a lot. BUT it's worth every penny, people. It's worth going for a cheese flight and I highly recommend the swordfish and the octopus. I was totally creeped out about the idea of octopus, but it ended up being my favorite part of the meal.
