We got one of the coupons in the mailer ($12 off $40) I give this place 3.5 stars based on my first visit - will bump it to 4 if/when I have another good experience here. We had the calamari for apps, which was really good - you know it's good calamari when you are satisfied eating without the dipping sauce and it's not greasy. (Oh, bread was also hot and good). I ordered the 2004 Bootleg Chianti (rated DOCG) for about $8/glass, and it was really good. For entrees, I had the lobster ravioli and my husband had the meat lasagna. The lobster ravioli was just OK, although the sauce was delicious - lobster could've been more fresh. The meat lasagna was good, but not great, however, it serves well (better) as day-after leftovers. We passed on dessert and opted for gelato and Cafe Gelateria near there. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and we'll def. be back.
