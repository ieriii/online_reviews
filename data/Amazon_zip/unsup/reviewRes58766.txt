Now I suppose this review could be biased. It's been several months since I actually ate here. And when I was there, I was on a date with a guy who gives me massive rose colored glasses. But still. I get so annoyed at people who go to a place like Graham Elliot and then complain about the food to cost ratio. We had the 10 course tasting with pairings...yes, the courses are small. But the tastes are amazing and you don't leave hungry. If you want big portions, there are some lovely steakhouses in Chicago. The pairings were very unusual - at least to me. There was one snafu with the dessert pairing, but the waiter and mixologist were so sweet and apologetic and quick to bring us an additional dessert and cocktail that it was almost a *positive* part of the experience. I don't think Graham Elliot takes itself too seriously at all. All our waitstaff was friendly and casual, but on the ball. My favorite part of the evening was when the busboy noticed that my date was coming across the table to sit next to me on the banquet between courses. He wordlessly, and with a cute twinkle in his eye flipped the table sideways so we could enjoy the rest of our meal without the back and forth.Also, I recommend asking them to take the crack laced popcorn off the table after a few handfuls or you won't have room for the delectableness to come.
