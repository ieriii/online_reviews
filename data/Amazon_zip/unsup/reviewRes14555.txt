I live in the neighborhood and this is one of our favorite haunts! The only reasons I didn't give the 5th star is because A. Its really too loud even when its not very crowded and B. There's no patio. But, the food is great!! Its more upscale than most bars which can be a nice change once in awhile. The regular menu is small but has awesome flavor! All of the sandwiches are amazing! And, they always have a dinner entree special that is outstanding! My favorite so far has been grilled baby octopus on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes with the black ink as a garnish. I died and went to heaven that night!! Their flatbread pizzas are also really good! I like most of their beers except they stopped making my favorite (Working Woman Brown). They also have a nice selection of guest beers. The interior is cute but too small. Its ALWAYS busy (I recently had to wait over 30 minutes for a table at 9:30 on a Wednesday night!! And it was still packed when we left at 11:45! I guess no one works in my neighborhood!!)
