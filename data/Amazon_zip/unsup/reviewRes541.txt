Probably the best dining experience I've ever encountered, with the emphasis on 'experience'. Our visit was on 7/2/11 and we received an 18 course menu that was unlike anything I've ever had before. The meal was interactive and left you constantly waiting for the next one to come out, all the time saying "I can't wait to see what's next!" The only "tip" I would pass on is definitely get The wine pairing ($160) but unless you are a serious wine enthusiast it's probably not worth upgrading to the reserved wine pairing ($250) as we did. I didn't find many of the reserved wines to be that worth it. Also I've read a lot of negative reviews of the wait staff. I couldn't disagree more. We probably had 7-8 different servers/runners wait on us, and all were fun and made the experience even greater. The highlight being waited on by Chef Achatz himself for the final course. Would I go back to Alines? Yes... In a heartbeat.... So, I better get saving so I can afford it again!
