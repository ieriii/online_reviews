Cheese, wine, and swine. Minus the swine for me! This place is fab! After walking by here twice and loving the gate and the sign we went in. Holy smokes we were not let down!! What a great place!! The service was spectacular! The beets with goat cheese is to die for delish!! I cannot say enough great things about the purple pig. It will be a stop for me everytime I am in the Chicago area!! Keep up the great work!!
