I LOVE this place! They have the best service on the planet. I feel like I am at home eating and drinking with my friends . . . only difference is I don't have to clean or cook!  I have celiac so I can't have gluten and they have many gluten free options! The Guajirito is a sandwich with bread made from smooshed plantains - totally gluten free! Their maracuya shakes are fantastic too. OH and it is BYOB! Does it get any better than this?!
