Like you need MY review to confirm what is common knowledge. Frontera Grill is top notch. We started, as nearly every other table in the place, with the most incredible guacamole. It stands up to the hype. Then because I was feeling totally adventurous, I tried the Tuesday night special, which was goat. I've never eaten goat before and I can't say it was on my "to eat" list, but I was satisfied with my risky choice. It was rich in flavor and prepared so that it had the texture of a perfectly fork tender beef roast. I probably should have stopped 5 to 10 bites before I did because I left no room in my tummy for dessert. But I could not put my fork down. Really, it was that good. I eagerly look forward to our next visit to Frontera Grill.
