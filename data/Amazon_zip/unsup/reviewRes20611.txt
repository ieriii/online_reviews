I have always wanted to try Coast since I drive by it every day! We went there for my friend's birthday and it was a great place to just hang out and enjoy decent sushi. It is BYOB so it really did help on the bill since we had such a large group. The atmosphere was dark and trendy, but it didn't seem as big as I thought it would be. I am not even sure what rolls I had since we ordered so many different things. They were decent... not the best I had but definitely good. I would definitely go back there with a smaller group so I can really try specific rolls.
