This is a great little dainty place. Just bar stool dining but the best. Thing to go for is the cuban sandwiches. Food is good. They have daily specials plasters on a chalk board. Coffee is thing to get here. While standing here for my take out, the place was full only after 6 mins waiting. I would recommend the specials. I just wish they didnt close so early.
