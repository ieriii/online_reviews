I came here a couple weeks ago with a some friends and I was immediately surprised at the line given it was early on in the day. My friend said we were going for hot dogs so I assumed I'd get a chicago style hot dog..not here. As I waited in line some guy said something like I just don't know how people can come here and get a regular dog. I was surprised because that's what I was planning on doing, until I looked at the menu and realized what he meant. I've never seen anything like the options Hot Dougs has. HD has the most outlandish ingredients one could possibly fathom, but it works. I didn't go too crazy and got a spinach and mozzarella chicken sausage with sun dried tomatoes and smoked provolone cheese. Hot Dougs has a specialty all their own and I'm glad I tried it. Note: if you want a regular dog, don't come here, but if you want to try something unique yet delicious...come once and come again!!
