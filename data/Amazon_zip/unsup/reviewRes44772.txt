Not sure if i came on an off day, but i was not impressed. I have eaten deep dish style pizza outside of Chicago and loved it, and this is my first time having it in Chicago. When it came out, it was not hot at all, maybe warm. And the crust....it was very damp, and doughy on the bottom. Taste like uncooked dough. I could barely finish the first slice. Sorry Chicago, bad first impression.
