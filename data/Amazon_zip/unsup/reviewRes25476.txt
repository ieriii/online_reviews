They promised me a table for my group two weeks ago for this coming weekend. I called today to confirm and they said they only do priority seating......aka, first come, first serve. YOU DO NOT ACCEPT RESERVATIONS, STOP ADVERTISING THAT YOU DO. They have good pizza, I've been twice as I live in Old Town, however, they treat you like they don't need your business. Ummmm, do you know there are 2 - 3 other places that serve the exact same pizza, just as good as yours, maybe better, and they will be happy to hear I'm never coming back to you. I'm not mad and I'm not going to say untrue things, but I will never visit your venue again. I also will never refer anyone to your venue again either. There are too many great pizza places in Chicago for a customer to be treated the way I was just now on the phone.
