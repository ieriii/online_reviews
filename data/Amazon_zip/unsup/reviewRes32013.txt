so i went to Sunda for the first time for a friends 30th b-day celebration. The vibe of the restaurant was cool-a bit more upscale and bougie than some of the other sushi places ive been to. (but im sure its because it was downtown) I must say though that the vibe is really all they had going for themselves. J and I have been to much better sushi places in chicago (and Oak Park for that matter) where we've eaten some of the best sushi ever! But maybe since its New Asian food overall and not necessarily a solely sushi restaurant that that's why their sushi isn't amazing or even close to amazing. i paid almost $40 bucks for two rolls... yes only two rolls! I ordered the Dragon roll-which wasn't bad & the Baked Seafood Dynamite that sounded great on paper but wasn't rolled very well and was a bit mushy. There drinks are a bit over priced as well, at least compared to other restaurants i've been to where i've paid no more than $9 a glass for the wine they're charging $15 for. I wouldn't go back for the sushi but I may go back to experience the other things on their menu.
