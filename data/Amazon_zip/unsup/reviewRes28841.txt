My FAVORITE Thai place! Mee Krob is awesome! Pad Thai awesome. Crab Fried Rice awesome. Everything here is very good. Staff is nice and there are three rooms of tables that make seating not an issue at this popular place. I travel out of my way to go here when I can. It is good stuff. You should definitely try it if you are up this way...
