Went here for my birthday dinner. I was in the mood for some good meat. It was okay. It wasn't very flavorful and the meat wasn't the greatest quality, but its a great experience for dinner. They bring all the sides out to try (like 20) and its a big experiment if you've never had them before (which I hadn't).
