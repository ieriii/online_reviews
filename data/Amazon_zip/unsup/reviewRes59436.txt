Had personal stuffed pizzas due to time constraints and loved them. The 1 topping pizzas came pre-made and took 15 mins compared to the larger size which take 45 mins. Had limited time and were in/out in 45 mins. Great pizza, great atmosphere, quick...wonderful lunch experience. Discovered through Yelp app and didn't disappoint.
