I am a big fan of their Pizza and Beer.  With so many choices of both, I had a tough time to decide on what to get!  I love their microbrew (Worry'n Ale is my favorite).  I ordered their White sauce pizza with olive oil and then their Spinach as a topping.  Big fan of both, so had a good meal there.  I have to warn you though, its no little ceasars.  Expect to pay a little more than usual.  Best bet for the people with low cash, go during their lunch hours. You get a small, pizza for 1 for about $5.95.  And please, try their Microbrew.  Get away from the tried and true stuff you find at stores and expand your horizons. Depending on whether you are a fan of crowds or not, you should check out this place on certain times.  During the weekday, its best for the loners who despise people. But if you are similar to me and you don't mind a few people around, check it out at nighttime.
