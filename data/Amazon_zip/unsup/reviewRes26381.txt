Another great dinner at Mercat. Took two business colleagues and appreciated the pacing of the meal which kept us happy with new tastes but never rushed. The Lobster a la Planxa and the Pork Belly remain astonishingly good - as were all our other choices. What I love about Mercat is the freshness and clarity of the flavors - just stunning. Going back again for a lunch during Restaurant Week - yum!
