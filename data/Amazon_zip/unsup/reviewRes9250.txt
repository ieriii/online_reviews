I'll take great food over great decor any day. Le Colonial has one, and it's not great food. The food that our table of three enjoyed was fine, and the environment was above par, but the food quality and quantity is easily beaten hands down at many establishments on Argyle or in that general area. Personally, I'll take spring rolls that are rolled fresh, not the ones that were rolled hours before being served to me. (The wrapper gets super tough when you leave it sitting around, silly chefs at Le Colonial!)
