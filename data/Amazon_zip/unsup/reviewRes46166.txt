This place has an encyclopedic menu of American diner favorites (sandwiches, salads, breakfast food, dessert), beautiful fantasy-land digs, reliable quick service and reasonable prices. There is a circular room to the side overlooking Michigan Ave that you have to specially request to be seated at. Lines and waits can be long for brunch especially after 11 so get there early if you don't like waiting in line.
