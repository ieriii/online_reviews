Great location in downtown Chicago's Loop. Right across the street from Trump Tower and on the river, this Hotel has great views. The rooms are clean, well decorated and spacious. Big bathroom, but not much counter space. Comfortable beds. The staff is very nice and helpful. the bar in the hotel is called Hoyt's. the bartenders are awesome and the wait staff is very nice. No breakfast offered at the hotel, but there are good places to eat very close to the hotel. We found a really good rate on http://getaroom.com. I would highly recommend this hotel whether you're staying for a couple days or a whole week.
