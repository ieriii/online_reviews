I headed here for a quick dinner with my husband before our plans for the rest of the evening. Yum is the only word that comes to mind. We split a torta and a meal-in-a-bowl caldo. The torta was really good, though it had too much red onion for my taste, but the meal-in-a-bowl was simply amazing. The flavors blended together perfectly. The staff is very nice and friendly. When the person at the register found out we were sharing a bowl, they kindly offered to split it into two bowls to make sharing easier. I didn't get to try the churro, but I hear it's very tasty and I'll have to try it next time. It wasn't crowded when I was there, but then again, I was there about 5:45 on a Friday night. It was starting to fill up as we headed out.
