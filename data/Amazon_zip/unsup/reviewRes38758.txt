Hopleaf is Sheffield's-esque in terms of having a really expansive beer menu. They're descriptions/explanations aren't quite as good as the ones at Sheffield's but that might have to do with their selection being so much bigger. The biggest negative to Hopleaf is that it takes a ridiculous amount of time to get a table for ordering food, usually well over an hour. Plus, this is not the place to go if you just want a cheap burger. While they do have excellent shoe string fries and garlic aioli, the menu boasts entrees more along the lines of Belgian mussels, frog legs, and rabbit stew than cheeseburgers and slaw. I've had all of the above, and while the Belgian mussels were okay (I've had waaaaaaaay better mussels), the frog legs were greasy and tiny (what do you expect, right?), and the rabbit stew was just way too salty. Go for the beer, but I recommend having dinner elsewhere first. Maybe grab some fries and aioli if you get the munchies.
