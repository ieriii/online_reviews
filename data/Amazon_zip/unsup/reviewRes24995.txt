I LOVE this place. The love fest started during Greek fest (coincidentally... maybe fests breed fests?) when a friend ordered loukamades from their stand. We shared and I wanted to eat them all. Doughnut like pastries with all of that honey and nuts, yum. We came back in January for lunch with some work friends and it was equally as great. We tried some sandwiches and they are very generous with their portions and well as with the sides, holy potato salad. I came back again with a different group of work friends and got an artopita (spinach and feta) with a side caesar salad. Oh man that spanikopita was yummy. So flaky and feta cheesey. Yum. Yum. Unfortunately I discovered that day that the loukamades aren't made until after 2pm during the week. Bummer. But I did get some during this Greek fest a couple weeks ago so craving cured. I will be back again and again, I promise.
