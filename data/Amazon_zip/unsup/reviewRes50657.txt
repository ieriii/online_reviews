Let me tell you about my latest dish! Reezy Peasy, a spicy vegetarian dish from the 1700s. The voodoo greens have a kick to them and the rice ball has a nice crunchy outside and is perfectly gooey on the inside and the red pea pure really gives the dish that antique touch. Unique and irresistible to those of us who like to try unique dishes. This is not always on the menu. Pair with the death of St. Germaine
