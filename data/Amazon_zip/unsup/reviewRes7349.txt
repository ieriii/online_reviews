This has been my favorite Italian restaurant since I moved to the city. I first came here with one of my roommate's family and I fell in love. I highly recommend the meat lasagna, the lobster ravioli or the baby back ribs. But honestly, everything on the menu is delicious (and I've had everything on the menu). The dessert is where that fifth star comes in. I LOVE their Tiramisu. I usually make tiramisu for my friends' birthdays and such, and this place makes one of my favorites. Their coconut sorbet in a coconut shell is also very good. When you're done dining, you'll fill out a form ( I recommend filing it out) and you'll get postcards in the mail with various discounts at Sapori. One note is I recommend making a reservation and leaving about a 15-minute buffer on either side of the reservation. Turn around there is very hit or miss and sometimes your reservation gets pushed around. My absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago.
