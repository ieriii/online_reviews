What happened to you, Hopleaf???? The reviews came pouring in, The neighborhood yuppies started spreading the word, Then came droves and hordes to your door.  Business is booming, bustlin' and balloonin' Better than ever, nonstop frenetic kinetic Packed to the brim like an overfilled garbage sack Not a seat to be found, not even in the back Hour and a half wait for food and the clock Keeps ticking and ticking and ticking If I were God, I would deliver one massive bitchslap Sweep out the crowd like Noah's flood and get all biblical. Alas, what happened to you, Hopleaf?
