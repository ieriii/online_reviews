We used a Groupon to try this restaurant after it was recommended by a friend. Not impressed. They sat us near a door on a cool evening, and everytime a person when in or out of the door we were hit with a blast of cold air. It was crowded so we couldn't move to another table. It took a long time for us to get our food. My hubbie's chops were overcooked and tough. My pork dish had little flavor. The best thing we ate was the bread and butter spread, flavored with something good, and the chocolate cake. We will not be going here again!
