I went to Carnivale with my husband this past weekend. I was really looking forward to a cool ambience but I'd probably only give the ambience 3 stars because we sat in the back room, upstairs. I was a bit disappointed with our table because we weren't in the main room, but it was probably a bit quieter in there anyways.  We had the crab ceviche as an appetizer, and we both had the Guatemalan(?) chicken dish. It was delicious! I was really happy with the food and our waiter was great.  Very friendly.  If I went again, I'd probably go later at night and try and sit in the main room. The bar looked pretty cool, too.  I'd probably recommend this place as a good place for groups, but it's hard to carry on a low-key conversation on a date since it's so noisy. There were several large groups seated in our area and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves.
