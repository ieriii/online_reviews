Worst experience ever. The bar was half empty yet we still waited for 30 minutes with a rude doorman. After being seated we waited another 25 minutes for a waitress to come and help us. She was was also rude and uninformative. 20 minutes and several complaints later she informed us that each drink takes 15 minutes to make. We left the establishment prior to recieving our drinks 1 hour after we arrived at a place that was NOT busy.I highly recommend you NOT go to this place unless you are looking for a night of bad service, rude pretentious people (without the class to back it up), and mediocre decor. TWO THUMBS DOWN.
