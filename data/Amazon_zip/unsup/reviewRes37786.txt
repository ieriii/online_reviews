The Hopleaf is a really great bar if you're into beer - their selection is outstanding and the food is tasty as well. The pommes frites are a must-have. If you're eating dinner, some of our favorites are the mussels, the stilton mac-n-cheese, and the sausage platter. We've introduced family members to the Hopleaf and now have cousins stopping in whenever they come to Chicago. The only unpleasant aspects to our visits are that it is sometimes hard to find a table/space to hang out and the fact that they sometimes try to move people out the door on the early side. Also, try not to get the lady bartender (owner?). My husband has had a few less-than-cordial run-ins with her. When asking for recommendations about a porter, the correct response is not to give a scowl and say we have a bunch. However, for as much as he complains about these run-ins, it has yet to even temper his enthusiasm for returning!
