Absolutely the best Pho in the Chicago land! The broth is perfect!! Not too much sweetness, not greasy at all, so tasty! The vegetables for topping are always fresh at this restaurant. The service is good too. My only complaint is finding parking space in the area. For this I don't blame the restaurant at all.
