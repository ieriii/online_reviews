I just wasn't blown away by Frontera Grill. Aside from the two hour and ten minute wait on a Tuesday, the kitchen was pretty inflexible about making things without meat in them. That being the case, there is surprisingly little for vegetarians to eat here. We got some cheese quesadillas that were really empanadas and mushroom fajita things that were good but by no means worth the hassle. And the beans and rice that came with were not that flavorful. I really liked the chips and salsa, but...yeah. It's chips and salsa. The low point was the posole, which tasted like old wet socks. I think this is an acquired taste and wish the server would have said something to that effect so we could have at least thought about skipping it. Dropping $80 on a meal that wasn't great is not my idea of a good birthday dinner. Probs not coming back.
