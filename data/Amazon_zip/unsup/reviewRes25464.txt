Im giving it five stars not because they are perfect, but because they allow for a perfect experience: 1.) enough great items on the menu 2.) their frappe coffees &greek coffee superb 2.) best lokumades in town 3.) decent pizzas 4.) i like the layout of the cafe and the european feel, people watching 5.) nice bakery products 6.) i'd prefer the gift shop wasnt there, it seems to kinda be a jack of all trades kind of a place, so I usually stick to the front half of the cafe hehee and try to avoid looking at the back 7.) good looking fast and capable european staff hehehe usally kind 8.) ---pitas not spectacular for me here 9.) stick with lamb if you like meat; just like in the rest of greektown, chicken and steak and fish dishes suffer 10.) i like their rosemary oven potatoes Good times.
