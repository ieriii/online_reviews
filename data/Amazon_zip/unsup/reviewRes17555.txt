I've been coming here for several years now, and I am yet to find a place in Chicago that truly competes with Violet Hour. It is probably still one of the best cocktail lounges in the country as well, despite some of the highly publicized new kids on the block. If you are looking for a place to spend a few intimate hours with a small group of friends in a relaxed but sophisticated setting while sipping original, well-crafted cocktails, this is still your best place in the city. While you can get equally good drinks now at places like Sable, nowhere competes in terms of atmosphere and steady creativity. Over the years, I've been very impressed by their ability to keep creating interesting new drinks which complement a now growing number of Violet Hour classics. To name just a few of the classics: the Juliet & Romeo, the Lady Gray, the Miraflores, the Dogwood Manhattan, and the Negroni Tredici. Recently, I was very impressed by a tall whiskey drink, Arrows of Outrageous Fortune. Violet Hour also consistently makes the best classic cocktails in the city. My favorite is their rendition of the Martinez. My only knock on the place is that I've noticed a consistent difference in drink quality and staff knowledgeability between weeknights and weekends. It seems the place went through period during which a bunch of newbies were cutting their teeth on weeknights. I haven't been back on a weeknight in a while, so I don't know if that situation has improved. But the weekend staff is still top notch. Bottom line, unless you are more interested in "scenes" or novelty for novelty's sake, Violet Hour is still the best.
