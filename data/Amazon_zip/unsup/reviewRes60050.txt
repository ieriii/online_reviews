I went to Las Tablas with a large group and it was a great atmosphere. The waiter was attentive and the plantains were AMAZING!! I had read top notch reviews regarding the steak so I decided to give it a go. Unfortunately, I was not blown away. To be fair, I'm not much of a steak person, but it seemed a bit dry and flavorless. Overall great experience though and I tried my friend's stuffed chicken which was really good.
