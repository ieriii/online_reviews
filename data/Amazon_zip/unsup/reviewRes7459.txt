so maybe this should be more than 3.5 stars, but I felt like my visit was full of pros and cons: 1a. PRO: Made a reservation at 715 for a table at 730. sweet! 1b. CON: Hostess seemed confused as to where to seat us when we walked in. 2a. PRO: The free pork powder chips were awesome. 2b. CON: They also tried to give us pickle chips. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like pickles and I don't like green things. 3a. PRO: 3 words: Kobe.beef.ribs. 3b. CON: Not as much meat as I thought it would be....lots of bone. 4a. PRO: Accidentally gave us 2 orders of mac&cheese. 4b. CON: I didn't like it....tasted funny, but can't figure out what it is that I didn't like. But, it did have breadcrumbs! 5a. PRO: Had wine from one of my favorite wineries. 5b. CON: It was a little warm. I know that most places don't keep red wine on the cooler side, but I seemed like it had been stored under light and warmed that even room temp. Overall, a good experience. Wait staff was nice. Like the atmosphere and the decor. Felt like having dinner at someone's vacation house! Wouldn't be opposed to going again.
