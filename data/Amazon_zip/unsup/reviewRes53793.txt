I last went here a few years ago, I've known and watched a lot of music here and musicians and teachers I know personally perform here.I'm never going back.And I sincerely believe you are naive if you like this place. Sorry, I don't mean to insult those that enjoy the Green Mill, but this is NOT a jazz club anymore, its pure idiocy.DO NOT TELL ME TO BE SILENT IN A BAR! I come to a fucking BAR to have a drink, speak normally to the people I am with, and listen to music. IF YOU WANT SILENCE THEN MAKE IT A CONCERT HALL AND NOT A FUCKING BAR. I used to be able to speak at this place, even during the Vandermark-type avant-garde music - then some scenster dumbfucks must've taken the place over or something.Idiots. Pure idiocy. Music isn't meant to be listened to in silence, ESPECIALLY in a place like the fucking Green Mill! I've had sublime, serene listening experiences in silence - that is NOT what is going on here!!! Never in the entire history of jazz was music listened to in silence - and in fact back in the day in Europe, classical music concert halls weren't exactly silent either! If the audience is to be silent it will happen NATURALLY and appropriately due to the sublimity of the music. Not the crazy nazi way these jokers at the Green Mill do.  Its too expensive, too stupid, filled with people who don't know any better and run by stupid fucks that need to get a clue.  Yet another place that gets by on reputation. The music is high caliber, as always - just buy their music instead of going to hear them at this place.
