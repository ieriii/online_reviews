Had planned on going to The Art of Pizza but through someone's recommendation and our proximity, ended up here. It's a huge place, but gets packed on weekend nights. Fortunately they let you order while waiting. We found the pizza to be really good but I was slightly disappointed because their speciality was stuffed pizza, not deep dish. That being said, the crust is divine with shortening being cut into it (GF pointed this out). It's rich, flakey, and savory.
