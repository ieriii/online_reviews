My boyfriend and I were excited to try this, but while the food was very good and the beer selection was great, the service was beyond terrible. Like I said the burgers and fries were really good, but the bad customer service experience ruined our evening and we will not be returning to the Bad Apple. We sat at a table in the bar around 6p - it was pretty empty at that time, but started to fill in around 7:00p. Our waitress was absent most of the evening and never brought requested items (napkins, glasses, etc.), but that may be due to the place being understaffed. Around 7:00, the hostess scolded my boyfriend and I for taking a "big" table (there were several other same-sized tables in the bar occupied by only two people) and told us we would need to share our table because other people were waiting. At that point we were almost finished and if they had found our waitress to give us our check, we would have left in about seven minutes. We said that it would be fine to seat another couple with us, but took it as our cue to get out. While we waited for our check for the next 30 minutes (not exaggerating), we watched repeatedly as the hostess pointed at our table and new customers shook their heads no to sharing. These waiting customers waited at most 7-10 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad on a Friday night in Chicago. We had enjoyed ourselves up until the hostess reprimanded us and pretty much told us to hurry up and leave. This was especially annoying given that we really did want to leave at that point, but couldn't find our waitress to pay the check for another 30 minutes. Bad Apple indeed!
