It's pretty clear to me this place is suffering from the "stress of success."  The Peking Duck is great, and it should be because that's what everyone comes for. The remainder of the food they serve is average at best. One item we ordered in particular was flat out bad, the pan fried baby squid, tough, chewy, old.  The prices are reasonable.  It gets two stars because "Meh. I've experienced better." In particular the service is inattentive and downright surly if you dare ask any questions, and there are excuses or rules for any request you might have (their favorite mantra seems to be "we can't do that.") Restaurants are about hospitality, and Sun Wah doesn't seem to be in the hospitality business. They seem to be in the cafeteria business. Honestly I'm not sure what all was said because it was between two of my Chinese friends and our waiter, but at one point both their jaws dropped open and when the waiter left they were incredulous at how rude he was. I personally was praying when he spit in the food, he skipped mine! Bottom line: Duck great, all other food I've had is average, disinterested "service", reasonable prices. You can do better in Chicago, you can do worse.
