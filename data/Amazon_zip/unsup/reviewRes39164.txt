I've several bad experiences here. Wife complained about the food smelled funny and asked them if they can make us a new batch. They simply said the next one will smell the same so just share the other dish (my dish) and go. Finished our (my) food, paid and left. I don't know why we have to feel like we're intruding when we're spending our own money. I am officially boycotting this place for the second time.
