I ate here for the first time last night and each of the three meals my group ordered were delicious. Bill said it was the best Rueben he has ever had and that is saying a lot. Mary loved the Chicago Firehouse wrap, I liked it too! The avocado tostado was good, but needed more flavor. Liz, our server, was very knowledgable and attentive to our needs. She made great recommendations for the beer, try "The Poet" oatmeal stout, and the deserts, chocolate cake and pumpkin cheesecake.
