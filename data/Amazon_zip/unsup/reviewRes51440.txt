This place has to have been renovated since the last time I came here. From what I can remember (I'm pretty sure I have never been here sober before this last visit), the place used to be more like a wider hallway with seating on the sides. This visit, it was much larger and nicer looking! They even had a bar & a couple TVs. People working were friendly. They didn't drag and seemed to always know when to come by. They always had my glass of water full which makes me happy. Yeah, it doesn't take much to stay on my good side. I'm a big fan of Mexican food, specifically burritos. They had plenty of filling choices including steak, chicken, pork, ground beef, beef & pork, mexican sausage and a few vegetarian options. I had to try the carne asada (steak)! Let me say, it surpassed all expectations! The burrito was one of the biggest I've ever seen...and eaten. I did have to pay extra for the sour cream that is a must on all my burritos, but the steak was nice & juicy. It was sooo good!!! Oh and the salsa you get at every Mexican restaurant was pretty good too. Wasn't too spicy & had a nice little kick to it. Survey says...GO TO GARCIA'S. Doesn't matter if you're sober or drunk, but if you ask me, it taste better when you have all your senses in tact. Enjoy!
