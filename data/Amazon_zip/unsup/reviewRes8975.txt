My number one place to order take out from! It is a great place in the Albany park area! The portions are large, you will have rice for days, which I love! I know there is a dining area, yet I havent dined there yet. The delivery service is always fast! They quote 45mins and we always get our food in 30mins! IF you love hummus, Noon O Kabab will be your place. My guess is they make it there, cause it taste fresh.  It is located next to the Brown Line, so hop on the train and give Noon O Kabab a try!!!!
