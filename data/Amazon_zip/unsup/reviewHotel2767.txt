the james is now the hotel that i compare all others to when i'm booking my vacation. as someone who likes to go to chain hotels for their reliability, i was a bit apprehensive about my visit to the james. but let me stop there because from the moment i walked into the lobby, the james was an oasis. from the pictures, you can see that it's a very modern hotel, but it was the little touches that made my stay the 5 stars that i gave this establishment. i was sold the moment i walked into my room and there was soothing music playing in the background and seconds later found the keihl's products in the bathroom with a sliding door! (i might even consider this for my future small condo!) the hotel is also within walking distance to the pier, mag mile shopping, sears tower, john hancock building, dunkin donuts, trader joe's and pretty much everywhere else in the city, if you don't mind doing a bit of walking (greek town, little italy, etc.) i would definitely return here the next time i'm in chicago or find the next place that can compete with the james.
