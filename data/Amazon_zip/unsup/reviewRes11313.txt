Came here with my best buddy on my last day in Chicago two weeks ago. For a Monday afternoon, it was a lively place (world cup soccer, beer, and pizza can be quite a combination). As a California dude, when I think Chicago I think thick crust (and Zacharry's Pizza Chicago Style in Oakland). But Piece... well... makes Piece/Peace with the idea that Chicagolandia can be thin crust pizza land as well. First the pizza... I didn't realize a place in chicago serving up thin crust pizza could reign in chicago. Here their pizza takes the thin crust pizza crown. Their white pizza (sausage, sauteed mushrooms, and olives) was absolutely heavenly--the perfect saltiness and garlic-y-ness. Sauteed mushrooms on the pizza is brilliant. And to quench the thirst....the accompanying beers were outstanding (with names like the fornicator, full frontal pale ale, or disfunctionale...who could resist the intrigue?). I had the worryin' ale which I found to hit the spot perfectly on a typical muggy summer day. This place sings in Wicker Park! Would definitely come back next time I'm in town! Piece Out!
