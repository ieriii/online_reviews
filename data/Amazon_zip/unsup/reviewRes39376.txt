One of the best meals I've ever had in Chicago. I had a whiskey cocktail for my drink, which was superb. For the appetizer, I got the compressed melon and fig salad, and for my entree, I got the chicken. The salad was solid, and the chicken was the best cooked chicken I've ever had. It was just great. The atmosphere was vibrant, and the waiter was ultra friendly. No complaints. The only downside was the wait. We waited about an hour, but it was oh so worth it.
