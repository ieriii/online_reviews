So your a lakeview east resident and are in the mood for asian food or more perticularly ......sushi. your choices are endless around here, there seem to be asain restaurants everywhere. Wakamono is one that stands out in my mind. Every dinner I've had there as been great. I also like the setup of the place as well. Overall a must try if you live in the area.... order the calamari you won't regret it
