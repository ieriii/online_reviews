As another reviewer suggested I got the cochinita pibil torta, WOW!! It was extremely spicy with the habanero sauce so use sparingly. I got the cilantro cream sauce on the side..I highly recommend it because the creaminess cuts the spice of the habanero sauce. It really was delicious. Very good portions. The cucumber water is so refreshing!! I will definitely be back!
