I saw this place on Check Please! and always had to try it out. I have only eaten here for breakfast BUT its fantastic! The breakfast burrito is to die for and it is so BIG! For breakfast it wasn't priced so badly and the portions are pretty big. I love the inside decor with all the wonderful artwork on the walls and the live music they have playing every once in a while. Their bloody mary's are also so delicious. We love this place so much we would order take out for breakfast for those really hung over days BUT we were dying for a breakfast burrito. For breakfast we never had to wait very long for a seat and the staff is super friendly. The first time we went in we asked to see the menu before we sat the host said oh you will love it come sit down. It was a great experience and we keep going back for more!
