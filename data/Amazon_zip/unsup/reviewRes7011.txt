Recently had a wonderful dinner at Sapori Trattoria per a friend's recommendation and just had to share. Great, romantic little spot with more room upstairs than you might initially realize. Even though it was packed (which I always think is a good indicator of a great restaurant), the host quickly got us seated - even before our scheduled dinner reservation. Lots of great options, and the server knew the menu and wine list well. Servings are generous, and the food is wonderful and high-quality. We shared appetizers and both had pasta dishes, which equaled plenty of leftovers! Great for a date night or even a group of people, we'll definitely be coming here again.
