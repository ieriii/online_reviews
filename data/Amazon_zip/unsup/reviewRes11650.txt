I always enjoyed everything I had here. You'll be waiting a long time to get a table, and you can expect to be passive-aggressively urged to leave pretty quickly after you're through eating, but while you're there the service is, to put it best, efficient, and the food is outstanding. It's a bit pricy, especially for breakfast food, but I can't say I've ever been disappointed in the least.
