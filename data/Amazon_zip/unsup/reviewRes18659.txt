What a charming place! We brought a bottle of "The Prisoner" along and sat at a table for 2 against the wall in front. Very quaint and romantic. The servers were friendly and attentive. I ordered the gnocchi special and it was delicious! As was the bruschetta appetizer. My husband had spaghetti with the meat sauce and both of us were impressed with the quantity and the quality of our entrees. We would definitely go back there again! (And having street parking over on Ravenswood was a huge plus, too.)
