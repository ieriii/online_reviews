This hotel has a good location close to the lakefront, Navy Pier, and Michigan Avenue; all are less than a 10 minute walk. away. There is a large supermarket right across the street, so for an extended stay you can get drinks or snacks to keep in your room. Extensive and high quality breakfast buffet included in the room price. Internet access is costly ($15/day); it should be included. The only complaints I can muster are (1) accessing the street requires using two elevators and a short walk; the guest elevators reach a "sky lobby" at 4th floor level and then you then have to go to another elevator to get to the street and (2) it's not near public transit; taxi fare from Midway is about $30 and from O'Hare about $45, or you could take the trains to Union Station and then a taxi for about $10.
