we came both for dinner and lunch during restaurant week salad - ok new york strip - tender juicy with butter!!! WOW!!! burger - bad, dry and tasteless ice cream - ok salad - ok harvest salad - salty due to the crispy sticks on the bottom ribeye - YUM!!! tender and buttery! cheesecake - dry and dense bread pudding - ok the saving grace of the restaurant is definitely the steak. Best in chicago!
