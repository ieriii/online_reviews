This place is awful. By far the worst place I visited in Chicago. Our dessert took forever to arrive, tasted terrible, and cost a lot of money. Our waitress was overwhelmed and left the table for ages at a time and the exterior of the restaurant was overrun by homeless beggars. I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out cash. Just a terrible terrible terrible experience.
