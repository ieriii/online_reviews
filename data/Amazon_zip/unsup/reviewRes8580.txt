The pizza is good - kind of soupy like real Italian pizza - interesting combinations but I really didn't care for the beverage options. A little too Italian for my liking. I know it's customary in Europe to serve one small drink but for a restaurant here in the states... small changes should be made. The staff was friendly but not super helpful to someone in our party who was a first timer to this type of cuisine.
