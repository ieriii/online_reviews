Went just once on a saturday night. Was busy but 2 of us were seated in 15 minutes. Owner (?) came by with some samples of truffle pizza, and the hostess offered wine while we waited. Mussels appetizers: Mussels were ridiculously huge. They were pretty good, served in butter/oil instead of the usually broth. I thought they were not as good as elsewhere however. Pizzas - we split an arugula/prosciutto and sausage/mushroom. They were good, as people said these are not cooked to a crisp crust as is common in Chicago. That said I didn't find them undercooked or unpleasant. If you have a really specific idea about how all pizza should be everywhere all the time, don't come here because you'll just be bothered. Overall while I appreciate their very simple approach, I found myself wanting a little more. Some extra spices - something more. But, I think the chef's goal here is simplicity. Atmosphere is nice, simple. Not a cozy feeling in your own little nook, but a generally lit open floor plan. Lots of conversation but the noise level was fine. The wine list seemed nice, and appropriate. Service and hygiene were excellent all around, I didn't experience the issues others mentioned. Basically I'll be trying it again to see if it's grown on me a little more, and I'm giving it 4 stars because I think they did well at achieving what they are trying to do - although I'm not 100% sure it's the way I want to go.
