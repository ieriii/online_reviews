I was so excited to finally check this place out, but unfortunately I left disappointed. I had been craving Mexican food for weeks, so you have to understand the sense of urgency when I sat down to order. It is BYOB, so we started drinking and munching on chips and salsa which were not great. I ordered Chicken Fajitas and was not impressed at all. The food lacked the authentic flavor I had been craving, it just didn't do the trick. Anyhow, there was a birthday in our section and they turn off all the lights and sing happy birthday, I thought that was so funny, so we decided to say it was our friends birthday just so we could sit in the dark and sing happy birthday....What has become of my Saturday nights!! The dessert we got was good, some sort of cheese cake thingy. To make a long story short, I walked out still craving Mexican food and went to Uncle Julio's the next day to fill that craving. I am still on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant in Chicago.....
