I was pretty scared by a lot of the reviews on here and I almost did not want to go here because of them...however, my friend invited me to go with some co-workers and I figured she being Chinese, it couldn't go that bad. My dinner experience was totally fine.  I would not call the service great, but it was not terrible either. The service was just completely random. We had at least 6 different people take care of different parts of our meal. It probably helps that our friend spoke chinese, but to be perfectly honest, they listened to her sometimes, and other times chose to ignore her. So as far as a bias towards non-chinese...I don't think it's like other parts of Chinatown.  My group went with the full-fledged hot-pot experience. I had never had hot pot before but I really love szechuan cuisine and the spices that go along with it. I did not come out a big fan of hotpot. We got the spicy hot pot and the spiciness was not bad. The spices however were really quite overwhelming. After eating for a bit, my mouth was just tired of being assaulted every time I put something in my mouth. As far as what goes into the hot pot, a lot of the stuff is really just not that good. The beef was good, as was the shrimp, fish, vegetables, rice cakes, etc. Call me american, but I just don't think things like sea cucumber, fish balls, SPAM, blood cake and pig intestine are that good in a boiled soup.  If you went authentic hot pot, I think Lao Sze Chuan is a great place to get it. Just know what you are getting into and you'll be fine.
