At Avenue Hotel -Weddings and Relaxation both available! We attended a friend's wedding in Chicago at Avenue Hotel in Chicago and decided to stay the weekend for a little holiday. I was excited to have a weekend away with my husband and our closest friends.The wedding at Avenue Hotel was simply beautiful. It seemed like everything went flawlessly. The food was quite good and I must say the service level of the staff was excellent. Everyone who works there seems happy and it reflects on how they treat guests. I am in the service business so I always notice these things and am usually quite critical. But nothing to criticize about my Chicago stay at Avenue Hotel - my husband was shocked!We made plans ahead to fill in our time with other activities. My husband and I felt like kids again being able to explore a bit of Chicago and have a new adventure to share. We loved the Navy Pier and riding the Ferris wheel and I loved all the shopping that was within walking distance of the hotel. After a busy day, we wanted to enjoy a couple's massage, which we had never done before and we were thrilled to discover they would come directly to our room. How awesome was that! The Avenue Hotel is great and not only perfect for a wedding in Chicago but also for a relaxing weekend. The hotel has the Sky Bar which is outstanding and on the 40th floor with amazing views of the city. The rooms are comfortable yet contemporary, with a great vibe. We truly enjoyed our stay and will recommend the Avenue Hotel for our Chicago vacationing friends.
