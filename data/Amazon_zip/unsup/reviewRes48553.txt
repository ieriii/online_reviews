We came in for after-work drinks and appetizers on Friday. AWESOME. We were told we didn't need any reservations as long as we were on our merry way by 6:30--since it was 4:30, that gave us plenty of time.  We all drank from their extensive beer menu, and most of it was delicious. Even the beers that weren't exactly my cup of tea, someone at the table enjoyed.  We had some pretzels (YUMM-O), frites, the charcuterie, and the mussels. Mussels were hands down my favorite. Served in a dutch oven white wine sauce, hmmm.... My only beef with the mussels is that they might have provided some more bread so that we could sop up even more of that delicious sauce.  I'll probably try to come back for dinner sometime.
