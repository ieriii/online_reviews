Two words: Bone Marrow. two more: Pig's ear awesome. fantastic. tasty.  Agree with a reviewer who said "tapas style". disagree strongly with "hip" as a designation. or it would be sad if it were. the pig is, "a noble animal" as Anthony B says. May it always be so. Crowded and no N/A bier, but c'est la vie.  enjoy
