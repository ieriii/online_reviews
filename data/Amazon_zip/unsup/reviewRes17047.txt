My husband and I went for the lunch buffet and were pleasantly surprised that the naan and tandoori chicken came with the meal. I guess we should have known since very table had it. We had a Groupon--which made our meal $5.86 after tax...you can't beat that! The spread was impressive, my favorite was the butter chicken and the lamb. The vegetable dishes were spicy and flavorful. However, I think the dessert section was lacking. Normally, I am not big on dessert but being 5 months pregnant, the baby wants what the baby wants. So for this, one less star. Overall, we had a great experience, the food was good and plentiful, way better than any buffet normally is. Service was spot on, our water glasses were never empty and plates were cleaned off promptly. Skip the street parking and just valet it, it was $8 for the valet for lunch and all the lots nearby were $14 and up. I wish we would have known that before we drove around for 20 minutes looking for a metered spot.
