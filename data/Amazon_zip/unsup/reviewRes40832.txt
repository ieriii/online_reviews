Writing a review for Bonsoiree is quite daunting because the food is just so unique and full of creativity. I could barely keep track what occurred in my mouth between courses as the tidal wave of flavors and textures nearly short circuited my brain. So therefore: The food at Bonsoiree is quite good. We've been there twice for an extremely playful Underground dinner as well as their thoughtful Valentine's day aphrodisiac menu (Yes, it got me laid). The crab/scallop motoyaki and "pub crawl trio" haunt my taste buds' collective dreams. If I had to pick a weakness it's that the desserts couldn't stand up to the previous courses' amazement. But that may due to my personal preference to savory over sweet. And I am in love with their silverware. THEIR KNIVES STAND UP! The only reason I am subtracting a star is because the chefs kept hitting on my girlfriend when I used the restroom. Both occasions.
