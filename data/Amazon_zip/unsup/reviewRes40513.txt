Oh the giant burrito from La Pasadita. Come to mama! When they describe it as giant these people mean it, for God's sake. For me it is a perfect combination of unhealthy serving of meat, lettuce, tomato and tasty dough. Highlight it with freshly fried chips and cilantro topped guac and you get instant food shock from massive blood flow into your digestive system. Whenever I finish my burrito (and yes I can finish mine at one seat) I feel like my tummy turned into cylinder shape. Sounds cartoonish but try it and you'll see.
