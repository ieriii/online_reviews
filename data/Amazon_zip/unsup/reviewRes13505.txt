One of the best seafood meals I've had in Chicago! (And really fresh, excellent seafood can be hard to come by here in the middle of the country.) They serve SIXTEEN different kinds of fresh fish. Plus gourmet diner food. Plus a killer looking brunch complete with a cereal bar for the kiddies, featuring an entire wall of sugary goodness for them to choose from.  The highlights: - Clam chowder - big bowl, tasty and filling - Pan fried catfish with cornbread/shrimp stuffing and spicy hollandaise - Jambalaya - spicy broth, andouille sausage, shrimp.. how can you go wrong? - Great beer and wine selection. - Friendly, "cool/hip" servers. The lowlights: - They were out of ribs. Not exactly a lowlight. That just means the ribs are probably killer. Put this on your list!
