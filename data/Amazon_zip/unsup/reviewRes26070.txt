This pizza is fabulous. I love the thin crust and staff. They are super friendly and are always helpful and observant.  I'm not quite ecstatic for the deep dish pizza but you have to try the thin for sure. I like that they have a room upstairs when it gets packed on the weekends. These is extra points on my end.
