Always happy to eat in the Logan Square area, nice and close to home. Had Sunday brunch and there was definitely a 30+ wait, so we ate at the bar. I am a Mac and Cheese addict, so seeing the pasta with cheese and braised pork cheek with breadcrumbs was a great fix. It was delicious, highly recommended. However, all of the other brunch options looked amazing as well, the bf had fried chicken with waffles and sweet potato/pork belly hash. Again, awesome. My Bloody Mary was nice and spicy the way I like them on a Sunday morning. I am curious about their dinner and may return to try it, but this is defnitely a place to go for a weekend brunch. Ample parking and right next to Logan Square blue line. Extensive beer list as well, albeit overpriced so i'd skip the place for brews. However, if you are a whisky lover I think you will be blown away (seemed to be hundred+ options).
