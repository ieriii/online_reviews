FANTASTIC!!! My boyfriend and I were unable to have dinner on Valentines Day so we made reservations for Monday the 16th instead. When we arrived the staff brought us to our table and explained that although they had already taken down the valentines decorations, they kept the balloons and decor on our table for us. It was a great service surprise! They also sat us in a quiet section of the restaurant away from the other diners so we could have some privacy! This aspect alone would have made our dinner great, but the food was exceptional! We shared a combination platter that had just about everything from on the menu on it. It truly was like having a mini buffet on our table! The steak was fantastic and fried plantains out of this world! We were so full from all the food that we couldn't even think about dessert. Next time I will have to hold back some so I can try it! We do not have ONE SINGLE negative thing that I can say about the food or service. It was top notch and we will 100% go again soon!
