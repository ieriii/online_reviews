I know lots of people that love Publican and that's fine I guess, but it is not for me. Call me crazy, but I am not a fan of eating extremely expensive food in an environment inspired by a slaughterhouse. The seating options are as follows - you can either eat at the bar, with people you don't know at a long table built for vikings, or in what is basically an enclosed pig pen. I just know someone is having a good laugh at the idea that people will pay a lot of money to sit in a pen and get treated like an animal and that idea haunted me through out my meal. Not only is eating in a pen fairly claustrophobic, but it gave the restaurant a Patrick Batemen-esque vibe that I cannot forgive. I will say that the food was okay, but not enough to make up for the unpleasant seating, or really even good enough to justify the cost. We ordered two things I had heard people rave about (the pork belly and pork rinds) and thought both were pretty average. My group of four split three desserts and I can honestly say that I disliked ALL of them. The trifle tasted like it had croutons in it, I kid you not. And there is something offensive about selling a perfectly ordinary waffle with butter and jam for $7! My favorite dish was actually the brussels sprouts, served on a bed of cheese, which was very tasty. If I could somehow magically eat those again without entering the restaurant, I would. I know someone somewhere is reading this review, a tear in their eye, cursing me as a vegan, but that is not the case. I love bacon; I just don't like Publican. If you are a fan though, I have a book suggestion for you - be sure to check out "The Restraint of Beasts" by Magnus Mills from your local library.
