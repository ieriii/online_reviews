This was our favorite restaurant that we dined at during restarant week. Fabulous food, great service and an overall excellent experience. To begin they bring you some of their delicious homemade bread/butter pickles which were addictive and some homemade potato chips that were seasoned with what dry rub rib seasoning that gave it a great sweet and spicy flavor. Our appetizers were excellent (cheddar bacon hushpuppies and BBQ wings). I had the Kobe brisket which was tender and divine accompanied by a huge slab of cheddar poblano cornbread. My fiance' had a half slab of baby back ribs which fell off the bone. For dessert Carrot Cake and Key lime pie.. we walked out stuffed... Definitely a spot we will go to again.
