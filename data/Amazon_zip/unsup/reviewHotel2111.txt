Service is excellent! Prices are pretty darn great. Location can't be better! Facing Michigan avenue, it's a bit noisy. But, it's the city, so what are ya gunna do! I did a "stay"cation so got a room. I'd recommend upgrading to a suite. (bigger, better view, upgrades = turndown service + fancy and abundant toiletries) Parking is free on Sundays (e.g. 12:01am Saturday "night") along Wacker and Michigan (south of the river) so get urself a room with your loved one, and chill in the city! (stay away from the $57 valet!! at least they have in-and-out privledges) Very cool touch screen thing in the room. Soft music was playing when I entered (scared me a little). And it gives you info about the hotel (not those dirty little books to tell you where ice is), as well as access to coupons, information about shows, call the concierge, weather, etc. Internet was $18/day-- wuh!! But free in the (busy) Starbucks in the lobby. It's also a very big and busy hotel, so we were always sharing the elevators and seeing people in the halls. Although we didn't hear anyone through our walls, luckily. The rooms were a big old-- but they weren't dirty. So, don't go expecting the Ritz Carlton room quality, but imho you do get Ritz Carlton level of service.
