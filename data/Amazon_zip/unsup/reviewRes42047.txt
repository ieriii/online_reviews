...yes they are artists... We ordered a large deep dish stuffed pizza from home w/ two toppings. We wondered why it cost $30 bux but then when it fed 5 hungry young adults 2x over, we asked no more questions. (that's the equivalent of $3 per meal, high quality food w/ delivery for the price of fast food). The pizza was hearty and delicious, definitely one of the best in Chicago. Can't wait to go in and check out their vibe.
