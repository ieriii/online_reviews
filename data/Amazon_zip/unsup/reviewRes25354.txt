We just got off the O'hare International airport and the first thing came into mind was "Deep Dish Pizza". Oh yeah, it's our first time in Chicago and my husband and I were craving for what Chicago is known for.  Thanks to Yelp and all the Yelp followers for helping me find this gem of a restaurant.  It was lunch time and the restaurant just opened up. Before you know it, within less than an hour, it was packed - I kid you not.  They have a wicked lunch special. Thank goodness for that lunch special cause my husband and I would not be able to finish up two pies (husband is a vegetarian and I love my meat). I barely finished my small personal pie.  The pie was so tasty, with the red sauce and the sausage tasted just like the sausage I would get on my pie in NYC. The crust was nice and crunchy, which added a nice texture to the pie. Yes, it does take time for the pie to come out, it's deep dish what do you expect. They have to thoroughly cook the dough properly. They serve alcohol, but I really was more famished than thirsty. And this restaurant did the right thing, by making their authentic Chicago deep dish pie. Oh by the way, Lou Malnati's is too generic, especially that I saw that it's all over Chicago. I am a huge supporter of the small stores that make a huge impression on their food and attitude because that's what you need to survive in the food industry.  Give this place a shot, you will not regret it. My husband and I surely don't. We know pizza, we are from NYC----land of Italian restuarant...need I say more.
