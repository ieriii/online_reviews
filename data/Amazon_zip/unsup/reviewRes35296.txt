Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiianno!  Half-priced oysters of my dreams, if only there were half-priced wines to match you! I'm lucky Shaw's is downtown and not TOO convenient, otherwise I could be turned into a Wianno wino, bellied up to the bar from 4-6, Monday to Friday, sucking down half-priced oysters from sundry specifically scented geographies, and trying to make one drink last the whole two hours. According to my tastes, I should really be rich. I love Shaw's. I recommend eating your full meal elsewhere, for Chicago simply has too many other things to offer, but if you are ANYWHERE in the neighborhood for the half-priced oyster deal, you simply must drop by.  The staff is always knowledgeable and charming (sit at the oyster bar to guarantee this is the case) and the oysters are always satisfying on a million marvelously mystifying levels. Humans have been eating these bad-boys since 500,000 BC for a reason, and it's not because they LOOK delicious. It's because humans were really hungry, but that's beside the point. Despite my aforementioned inconveniently expensive taste, I don't like to spend $15 on a glass of wine. Ever. If you want to be economical, you have no choice but to order a martini. Or spring for the bottle of champagne, and pretend there's no tomorrow. That's fun, too. I must admit that I prefer the underground camaraderie of the Half Shell, but they only offer one type of oyster, and it never compares to those at Shaw's. I relish the variety, the depth of knowledge and detail, and the minuet at Shaw's!  So Shaw's has got me, from 4-6 on weekdays, esPECially when I can recruit a partner in crime (hint.)
