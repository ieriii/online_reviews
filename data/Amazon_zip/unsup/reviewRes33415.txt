Sultan's Market is ok, but honestly, after living in the Middle East I don't think that you should ever pay more than a buck for a falafel sandwich. Really falafel is cheaper than dirt to make. I lived on that for breakfast, lunch and dinner when I was exceptionally poor. But it's America, what do I know? They'll take my cheap falafel sandwich, wrapped tightly in fresh 5ubz 3arabi, grilled and delicious, and give me "pocket pita" with a big weird smear of hummus, stuffed with all kinds of vegetables, fatter than I can fit in my mouth. Ya Allah! Meh. I also see reviewers lauding the hummus. Hummus also takes nothing to make, and is actually hard to make badly unless you really have no clue what you're doing. Also what's it with America and making Middle Eastern food have to seem all healthy-like? Grill that s*&%, use plenty of grease. Please. That's what makes authentic shawarma sandwiches on the side of the road taste so good. Go up to Albany Park and check out Al-Khaymeh or some of the other treats in the Lebanese neighborhood. If you need fast food I guess Sultan's Market ain't bad.
