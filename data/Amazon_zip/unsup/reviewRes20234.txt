I'm glad I was able to finally try some of Rick Bayless' food, but have to say I don't think I'll be waiting in that line anytime soon. The staff were all very nice, especially the woman who continually would chat with those in line. I ordered their special of the day which was a goat torta. I really enjoyed it and thought it was a good sandwich, but not weep into my hands good (unlike Hot Doug's). I will say, the soft serve and churros were excellent though. If I can skip the line and just walk up and order some ice cream and churros to go, I'll be coming to XOCO more and more.
