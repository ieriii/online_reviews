I used to live a few doors down from Pasta Bowl, and it is truly the only thing I miss about living in that disgusting apartment above Mickey's (random aside: don't ever eat the food at Mickey's, just trust me on this one). I was first introduced to Pasta Bowl by another friend who lives in the area. While I thought it was good, I didn't fall in love with the place. It wasn't until the second time, which was the day after we moved in, that I realized how amazing this place is. The farfalle pollo is so good I can't even put it into words. I prefer to get it without the shredded cheese on top--enough is enough, ya know? I've also had the gnocchi w/rosemary gorgonzola. Well done, but I always go back to the farfalle. Pasta Bowl is not a restaurant that I go to for the service. Anyone who goes to a restaurant like this and complains about the service is just expecting too much; you get what you pay for. And I'm happy just to get delicious, insanely cheap food. If you don't like the service, get carry out--no wait, and in my experience the portions are even a little bit bigger (as if they need to be)!
