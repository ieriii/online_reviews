Nanananananana Awesooooooooooome! I know it's pricey, me and my buddies go once a month and just go all out, bloody marys, mimosas, big breakfasts and dessert, yeah it's $50 a piece, but it's all organic and ALL SOO GOOD. Seriously, in a world of greasy fried egg and bacon places (which is a good thing), its cool to see a place that does it different, (Poached eggs, poblano, homemade chorizo). Want more? I hate tomatoes more than anything in this world. But they convinced me on Fried Green Tomatoes. Wooooo they were good! I wanted dessert one day, they said strawberry pie was the special. I rarely eat pie, i'm a chocolate person...but went with the pie, it would make my grandmother cry if i went on about how good this strawberry pie is, so i'll stop...seriously best i had yet. Honestly, if you have the money and feel like treating yourself, your body, and overall health and well being. Eat here, i've never had a more satisfying breakfast in a long time.
