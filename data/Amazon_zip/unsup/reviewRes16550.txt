The food was absolutely delish! My friend had Chicken Tikka Masala which according to the menu is "a dish of international acclaim". I tried the sauce and it was very creamy, a bit spicy and had a tint of nuts or sesame flavor in it. I had Baingan Bharta, a dish of smashed eggplants marinated in a rich blend of spices and roasted to perfection - almost a paste form but I could still taste the texture of the eggplants and the juice/sauces the egglants gave rise to. We also ordered garlic naan which was freshly made and soooo good. With the help of the sauces from the two entrees, we had no problem finishing up all the rice and the naan (a regular on the house naan and our garlic naan). There are many varieties of rice but we went with plain thinking that the entrees would have overpowered any special spices/ingredients in flavored rice anyways. One thing I didn't like was the waiter service. Throughout the night we didn't have one particular assigned waiter which was fine. In contrast with the romantic and classy restaurant ambience, waiters seemed to be in a rush all the time and often times literally bumped into each other. Our "main waiter" (who took our orders) was not loud and passionate enough and did not take the time to answer our questions. But it was ok coz the food totally made up for it. This place is a bit pricey compared to other Indian restaurants but the variety of menu items, the richness and complexity of flavors are very impressive.
