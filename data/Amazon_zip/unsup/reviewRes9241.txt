Well, I hated that they smuggled in some artichoke leaves in my salad without using all artichoke hearts. Not sure if I was suppose to eat the meat then spit out the leaves at this business lunch, or just to skip it... Appetizers are decent, but nothing much worth noting. I understand they're trying to go for a French/Vietnamese fusion style, but I don't really see the fusion factor here. The pho here is still pho, but 1/4 the size you'd find at an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, and costs just as much. Spring rolls taste the same as a hole-in-a wall place, too. I guess the selling point of this restaurant is the decor - it is beautiful! But that doesn't justify their charging so much for the food.
