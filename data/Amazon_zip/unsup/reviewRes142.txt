Had the extreme pleasure of a second visit to Alinea this weekend for my Mom's birthday with special guest, Caroline A. Impeccably impressive as always to say the least. If you haven't had the opportunity to get to Alinea yet, try as you must to do so! The culinary tour is undeniably mind blowing, but their newest concept which brings the wonderment of the kitchen at Alinea right to you with the 'Chocolate' dessert finale is truly unbelievable. Plated right on your table by Grant himself, or his insanely talented Exec Chef, Matt, it is an experience of the highest caliber in sensory mind-meld. They have also made a few minor tweaks since my last visit which should be noted. First up, they are no longer offering 2 menu size selections ("taste" and "tour"), they have gone to an exclusive 20 course full tour only format. They also have upped their game, if that's even possible, and now do bring a special individualized course to the table acknowledging special events and such. Way to improve the unimprovable! I can't say enough good things.
