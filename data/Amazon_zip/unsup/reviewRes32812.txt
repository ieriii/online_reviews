This was my second time at Sunda and seeing as it was still semi-new the first, I figured I would give them one more shot. However, the second time around was much worse. The food was poor to say the least and my table of six sent back sushi that was not fresh as well as barely nibbled on each plate that was brought out. Our wine glasses were left empty many times and our waiter was no where in sight to refill throughout dinner. (we had to have a server locate our wine so we could pour ourselves.) It took over 30 minutes to get our initial round of drinks and when it was time to pay the bill, our waiter had disappeared and we eventually had to ask a manager for the check. The restaurant was extremely loud - since the sound bounces off the walls at Sunda, the least they could do is skip the loud music. Even at a round table, it was extremely hard to hear and had to repeat conversations over and over. And the topper was when they misplaced a credit card of ours and come to find today, had double charged one of our guests. This place is not worth a visit.
