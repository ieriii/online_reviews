Disappointment. I can't say I was satisfied with my meal, when I can get 3x the serving size and an overall better dish for $7 at the Noon Hour Grill, as opposed to the $12 I paid for an arrogant reinterpretation of bi bim bap. I didn't even get a full egg on my dish, as some of the egg white was cut (the straight line gave it away), and while I'm not making a big stink about the egg, it's symbolic of everything else that lacked in this dish. They ran out of their house-made bacon... really the only reason I came there in the first place, and even though the server was nice enough to give us a complimentary plate of their "regular bacon," it just added insult to injury, as I purchase and cook better bacon at home. My friend's quiche was annoyingly small - and I felt sad I dragged him over here on a Sunday morning for a small wedge of quiche with a bit of side salad (or over-hyped garnish as I see it). The service was pretty good, and so was the coffee. Maybe my experience would have been more positive had they not run out of the only thing I came there for - but honestly, it's not even worth going back to try. After $42 for brunch for two, I'll happily stick to tried and true diners that churn out a belly filling breakfast that might be short on interior design and arrogant interpretations of brunch/breakfast fare, but nourishing to the Sunday morning soul, and gentle on the pocketbook.
