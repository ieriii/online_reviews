Although I've had a great time here in the past, the last few visits have been way over the top on the pretentious-o-meter. I get it. Violet Hour is supposed to be this uber hip, exclusive "speakeasy". But you know what hostess? You are still a hostess, so stop acting like you are better than me. Oh, and waitress? You could scale it back a notch too. Yes, that orange oil essence really adds a nice touch to my drink. But you know what does not add a nice touch? The butane from the Bic lighter you used to light the orange peel. Get over yourself Violet Hour.
