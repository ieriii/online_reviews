Was here with friends last week as a going away party before I move, and it was the perfect choice! Most of what there is to say about the drinks has been said already, so I won't go into too much detail. Suffice to say they are immaculate, but can take a while to get be served. Again, plan on $15/drink with tip/tax. Getting into the club was quite fortunate on our part- we were a group of 6 (the max they can comfortably sit at one table - don't plan on bigger groups without a loooong wait) and as soon as I and the last 2 members of our party showed up, we were let in with no wait past MANY patrons in line still. There was grumbling, but I'll take it. The decor is dark, cell phones are banned (but not really, just try to keep it to an absolute minimum) and the music is eclectic. It's definitely an experience to check out, and I'm glad I did.
