After hearing nothing but wonderful things about this restaurant for years, I finally took my boyfriend there for his birthday. I was sorely disappointed. He and I felt the disdain of the hostess and our waiter the whole time we were there. For no reason. I guess we looked like we wouldn't tip well? Well, I did, even though the service was impersonal, unfriendly, and the waiter burned me with the fricken boiling oil and then pretended like it didn't happen so he wouldn't be liable! The food was tasteless and expensive. There's no parking anywhere so you have to do valet. When I handed the valet guy my keys he left my car EXACTLY where I had stopped it, took my money, and then gave me my keys back right then because "my car is right there anyway." I have had fondue at the chain The Melting Pot and I would say it is one trillion times better than this place!
