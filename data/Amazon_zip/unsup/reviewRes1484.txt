After dropping some friends off at the airport and realizing I had the rest of the day to kill, I decided to give Hot Doug's a try. Having visitors during the week was my excuse to try all the places I'd read about on Yelp/heard good things about elsewhere that sounded as though they'd be madhouses on the weekends. Hot Doug's was great. I was there around 2 on a Wednesday and there was a line but it moved quickly. Once I ordered, I was really surprised by how quickly my order was ready - it was probably like 5 minutes. I was ready to wait longer. Also, Doug was super nice. It's obvious that he's doing what he loves. Anyone else behind that register would be bored/annoyed by 2 p.m., but he was cheery and kind. I'm sure not much else needs to be said about this place. I love the creative daily specials, which I'm sure will keep me from ever ordering a regular hot dog here. Sometimes (usually when I'm hungry), I just visit the website to see what they're doing on a given day, it's that interesting to me. I tried two of the specials and felt like an adventurous sausage connoisseur, which is obviously something I've always aspired to. The sausages were totally delicious, btw. The only sour note - and it was no fault of Hot Doug's - was the dude in line behind me. He was with his girlfriend, who got maybe 2 words out the entire time. In the 15 minutes (possibly less) for which he stood behind me, he managed to insult his girlfriend's religion to her face, call the city a "hellhole" and berate her for living here while extolling the virtues of the suburb he lives in, and go over each and every bicycle available that sucks. Bad attitude doesn't even capture it. It's maybe the one time in my life I've actually been tempted to pull the old, "If you don't like this city GET THE (expletive) OUT!" Standing in front of a self-important gasbag like that was not fun, but it was worth it for the sausage.
