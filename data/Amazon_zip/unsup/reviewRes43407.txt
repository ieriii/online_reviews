Nice chique cafe. They have many unique breakfast items with fresh sandwiches and pastries. I ordered a chicken sandwich with a lemon bar, plus a ginger ale. The sourdough bread was lightly toasted with fresh riped tomatoes and tender chicken and some aioli sauce. Very well done. The lemon bar was homemade and also well done. And even though they don't "make" the bottled soda, it was a great choice to have on a summer afternoon. Milk would have been a bad choice. haha The place had a good open feel with lots of their items on chalk boards and their baked goods laid out in front by the cash register. Nice place, good outside seating when the weather permits.  My friend is in love with their pickles, she weird.
