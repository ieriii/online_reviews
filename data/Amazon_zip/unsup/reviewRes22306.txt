Still the only Chinatown restaurant that earns five stars in my book, and I would've given Lao Sze Chuan five stars before its half attempt at renovating. The wait at LSC has gotten a lot better from before they opened up the upstairs seating area. The totally boss bouncer with the vocal cords of Michael Clarke Duncan from The Green Mile still makes getting seated a lovely experience. The only two dishes I can't recommend enough to people is the Yu Shiang Eggplant and the Dry Chili Chicken. I am already assuming that everyone reading this can take their share of spicy, oily foods - as that defines Hunan/Szechuan cuisine. Also, just like how you don't go to Outback Steakhouse expecting to find spectacular Chicken & Waffles - don't be disappointed if you don't find your favorite go-to Chinese dish in here. There are, however, an abundance of authentic dishes that pertain to the Southeast Chinese provinces.
