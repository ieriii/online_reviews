I don't really have a whole lot to say about Yolk.  The vibe is trendy-snobby. Servers are impersonal and seem to only care about getting your tip and getting you out the door. Food was great and the menu had a lot of tasty-sounding dishes. I ordered the strawberry walnut chicken salad and was very pleased. The hubs got the pumpkin swirl french toast, which to my surprise was also very good. Really, though, I highly recommend the strawberry orange juice! That stuff is liquid heaven. Everything else was a confident "meh." I might go back, I might not.
