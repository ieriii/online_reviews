I am not a vegan/vegetarian by nature. My sister is and last summer we went to Chicago Diner. We sat outside. Their outdoors seating is invigorating, lights and flowers all around, really comforting. We liked it so much I took a friend back recently. We sat inside as it was busy, but still very comfy inside. Booths/tables big enough to eat comfortably with all the food. We did select the vegan optoins.  Our waiter was so nice and outgoing! Great service! He even explained how wine is vegan, as we thought it was a joke, never knew any animal product was used for wines/beers. We were educated by our waiter while eating great food! Red pepper hummus, Meat Nachos (meat was seitan and delicious), Enchiladas with rice and beans was very good! Chocolate vegan shake my daughter enjoyed. We split a huge dessert Cookies & Cream vegan cake with a side of vegan icecream, yummy! Definitely recommend giving this place a chance. I will be going back!
