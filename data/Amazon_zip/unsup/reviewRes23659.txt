Best Greek Restaurant in Chicago, the sceanery of the place makes you feel like your in greece and all the waiters have that thick Greek Acient which makes it all more authentic. Great Food doesnt matter what you get , its all very good. Service is very good, they make you feel important like your one of the family and the best part is hearing the waiters scream OPA and the big flame arises from the plate. Recommend to any one
