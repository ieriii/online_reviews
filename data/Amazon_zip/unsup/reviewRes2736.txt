The first thing wrong with Tru is that it is VERY expensive. Over $680 for two people! This should be a dinner to remember for ever and a few days later I can hardly remember what I was served. Everything was a disappointment. My partner and I opted for the 10 course tasting and boy were we disappointed! Please see my bullet points below about our disappointment. 1. Fake Caviar (Seriously) 2. Salty Soup, yet no flavor. 3. Tiny portions. (Is this why it's called a tasting?I had ten courses and opted for a burrito after I left only 45 minutes later.) 4. Terrible wine (may have been vinegar perhaps?) 5. Tru is all about the presentation, not the food. If they spent less time trying to get it so perfect on the plate, it may have come out at least warm.  Snobby waitstaff. (they do realize they work at a restaurant?) 6. Left feeling like I totally wasted my money. 7. And most importantly.... I don't remember one good thing about the place. Only the bad. I may have had an experience that was worse however, I never paid so much for it. How is this place in business? I gave the W concierge a piece of my mind for recommending this place. I assume they get some sort of kick back.
