Nice selection of cupcakes that appears to have been expanded with a few "filled" cupcakes in addition to standards. I've had two: red velvet with cream cheese frosting and some chocolate number with a white filling. I actually ordered the salted caramel cupcake and was given the filled chocolate/chocolate by mistake. But it was quite good so I can't complain. Both cupcakes had a nice cakey texture that was perfectly moist, not too heavy, yet substantial enough not to crumble apart. I like their cream cheese frosting because it has all the right flavor without being overly sweet. I don't normally eat red velvet because I don't want all that red food coloring, but it was the only cake in the case with cream cheese frosting. Approx. three and a half bucks per cupcake, with the filled ones costing a bit more. The rest of the pastries looked quite appealing- some appropriately priced European style pastries, danishes, and standard fare of cookies and brownies/bars. P.S. They serve Intelligentsia coffee
