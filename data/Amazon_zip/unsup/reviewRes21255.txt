I finally had a chance to meet some of the Elite Yelpists today and I have to say it was an awesome experience. However, the shrimp and fish taco wasn't good at all. It was bland, hardly any taste to them. Although beans and rice was probably the best part of my dinner, i was pretty disappointed. and i was told by Nishan that it was pretty bland when he tried it, but i gave it a go thinking they had a bad day in the kitchen... I was wrong.  And as for the noise.. it was too loud at times and i could barely hear anyone talking. Drinks were ok. not too strong, not too weak. but the overall experience was good. Might try it again if im in the area. but 2 tacos for 11 dollars? come on now.
