I'm not sure whee to begin, but lets start with the drinks... I'm not a Whiskey guy, but their menu made me want to be. The sheer size and variety was inspiring, and I probably would tried a flight or two it weren't for the fear of getting blackout drunk before 6PM with a long night ahead of me. Now surely you would think with a great selection of whiskey and craft cocktails, the beer menu would be lacking...NOPE. Not only did the draft list include the Midwest all-star craft breweries (Bells, Three Floyds, Half-Acre, Goose Island), but their bottle list was long, international, and varied. I did get a chuckle out of their description of Old Style which called it "light in color and body, medium in aroma and bitterness, full flavored with a delicate aftertaste." LOL - I'm going to assume this was a joke? On to the food... We had four entrees at our table - half chicken, pork belly, scallops, and beef. First impression was that the serving sizes were generous, something I didn't expect at a Michelin star restaurant. My second impression was "OMG EVERYTHING IS AMAZING". I'm not joking - everyone at our table kept saying that to the point where you would think we had been eating dog food for the past year. Everything was on point - beautiful presentation, amazing sides (e.g. lobster tator tots, pickled ramp bulbs, and creamed edamame), bold tastes, and creative flavors all around. Now for the service / ambiance: The place is very hipster/chic with a laid back feel. I expected something a little more upscale but actually preferred the casual vibe, since it let us loosen up a bit. The service had a bit of that pretentious attitude that contradicted the rest of the experience, but it was still friendly and punctual so I can't complain too much there. In conclusion: go here.
