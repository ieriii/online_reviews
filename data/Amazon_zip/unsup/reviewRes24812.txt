Outstanding. Went on a Wednesday night, not too crowded, great waitress, made great recommendations. We had: 1. Charcuterie platter 2. Queso platter 3. Bacon-wrapped Dates Stuffed with Almonds (Datiles con Almendras) 4. Lamb wrapped in bacon stuffed with a roasted cherry tomato, served on a skewer (Lamb brochette) 5. Serrano ham croquettes 6. Colorado rack of lamb 7. Rabbit sausage 8. Spicy Potatoes with Spicy Paprika Aioli (Patatas Bravas) 9. Warm Brussels Sprouts Salad with Bacon (Coles de Bruselas) 10. Spanish Octopus, Confit Potato, Smoked Paprika (Pulpo con Patatas) 11. Wild Mushrooms, Confit Potato, Shallot & Parsely (Setas al Horno) 12. Porcini & Catalan Sausage, Roasted Garlic and Manchego Flatbread (Cepes y Butifarra) 13. Beef Shortrib, Horseradish, Parmesan & Bacon Flatbread (Costillas de Ternera) Every menu item we had was outstanding. Excellently prepared, well balanced, bold but not overwhelming flavors. The least interesting items were the rabbit sausage and the patatas bravas. The rack of lamb was excellently prepared, delicious, but nothing special. For items that are unique to Mercat, get the croquettes, spanish octopus (good, but small portion for the price), beef shortrib flatbread (the horseradish kick is quite nice). Mercat a la Planxa made the list for my top 3 eating experiences in Chicago last night.
