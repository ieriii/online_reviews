I went to Zed451 on a Thursday night several weeks ago. It was probably the first, super hot summer night in Chicago so EVERYONE was out in search of roof top action. The line to get to the roof at Zed was a little ridiculous. A bouncer was only allowing small groups in at a time, assumingly to stay within capacity guidelines. I only visited for cocktails, not dinner. The crowd was totally mixed... young professionals, the "older but still trying to look younger" folks, hipsters, you name it... they were there that night. The drinks are pretty darn yummy but way over priced. Unfortunately, you're paying for the phenomenal views and beautiful ambiance. That's okay with me occasionally as long as I have a great time. Zed451 delivered on the great time so I left happy. I'd go back in a hot minute.
