I went to Meli for the first time today with my parents and it was fantastic. We didn't wait at all (9:30am on a Wednesday morning). My mom and I shared the asparagus, ham and mozzerella fritatta (amazing!) and my dad had the corned beef hash. It was all excellent. The portions are HUGE (definitely enough to share if you're not a big eater). The orange juice was fresh squeezed. I will definitely be back!
