Love, love this place. Wines are excellent, good labels and extraordinarily inexpensive for the neighborhood. Well thought out flights if you like those- and not just of the wine.The cheeses are excellent too- if you aspire to gourmand status, you could do worse than to train at this place. The Chef, John Caputo is excellent, hospitable and always in the Tribune for one or another of his restaurants, knows his stuff. Great place to just meet people, everyone friendly, especially around the circular bar...oh by the way: swear their burger is better than Kuma's!
