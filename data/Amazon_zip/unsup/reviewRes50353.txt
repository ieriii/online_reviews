the menu seems to have A.D.D.... or maybe i do...i honestly had to read it 5-6 times to make sure i understood the breakfast and lunch offerings. my 9-top (plus 2 kiddies) were well accommodated, albeit a little cramped, upstairs for sunday brunch. we almost needed to read the menu out loud to each other to fully grasp the plethora of items: mix and match crepes/sliders (your choice), breakfast lasagna. ribs served by the rib, sweet potato-bacon hash browns...whoa. i applaud the variety and creativity for sure! the food was *good* too - wow's heard around the table - the vegi skillet - broccoli at its best! lobster slider and turkey burger slider - tasty! pretzel rolls with sandwiches! nicely seasoned steak (and eggs)! boo's heard around the table - salty biscuits and gravy soggy bland chilaquiles "eh" coffee over-nuked sticky bun (more like a over-nuked wannabe cinnabon) my first visit being a chill evening of shared apps and a few beers, i think this would be a superb place for football sunday apps and beers. the rest of the menu is just okay. very attentive, friendly service both visits.
