Was well aware of the 30-40 minute wait despite having reservations, and it was Friday night, so no biggy.Had a very cool and crisp caipirinha during the wait.Ceviche Mixto for app.. very nice and flavorfulChuleta for me, Churrasco for my manChuleta - wood-grilled pork chop with peppers, caramelized onion broth and bacon-plantain FUFU!! Pork was very tender, and though I never eat pork less than well-done, I decided to go with the Chef's recommended medium rare, and it was perfect. Beautiful combination with the peppers. And the FUFU!! I could have had a bucket of the fufu alone. Loved the sweetness and texture, but I think I just like saying FUFU!Had a bite of the Churrasco (wood grilled beef tenderloin), which was very good and tasty, and I'm one that usually stays away from beef.Excellent service from our waitress. Fun and colorful dining area, and not as loud as I feared. Pricey, yes, but well worth it.
