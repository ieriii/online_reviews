Sunda is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in River North... wait I should say in all of Chicago. I've heard they might start serving brunch on weekends and that sounds like awesomeness to hungover weekends. I think some people give Sunda heat, because they think of it solely as a sushi place.... that's a mistake. The food here is so much more than just sushi. The other night I had the Kobe Beef Sirlion and it wasn't even close to something you'd imagine ordering at a sushi restaurant. I should mention it was absolutely delicious and was paired with whipped potatoes that were great. We also got the Garlic Noodles with Crab and I can say it's hands down my favorite thing at Sunda. No Sunda isn't your 100% authentic Asian restaurant and no it isn't just a sushi restaurant... it's the entire continent rolled into one beautiful restaurant.
