I really enjoyed my Mayan Palace experience. Thanks to Yelp I gave this place a try. Otherwise I probably never would have. I am so picky about Mexican food so I always get really excited when I find a place that is above average. We had reservations and were seated on the back patio which really isn't outdoors, and kind of reminds me of one of those party tents you can put up in your backyard. The service was great. It didn't seem as overly friendly and attentive as everyone mentions on here but they were definitely above average. No complaints there. I loved the chips (couldn't stop eating them!) and salsa and the guacamole appetizer was tasty and the portion size was very good. For the life of me I can't remember what I ordered for my entree but I know it was vegetarian and I know it was good. The best part however were the margaritas. I normally go for the standard lime with salt on the rocks but this time I decided to go for the frozen Jamaican flower margarita simply because I was curious. SO.GLAD.I.DID. I don't even know how to describe it but it was the perfect blend of sweet and tart and tequila. The waiter said it was similar to pomegranate and I can see the comparison. I'd go back just for those alone.
