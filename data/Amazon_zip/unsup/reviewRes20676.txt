I only knew a little bit about Rick Bayless, but could not have been more delighted seeing him win Top Chef masters. With someone that is so passionate about the food they cook, you know it will be an absolute pleasure to eat. The first time that I tried going to Xoco there was a line out the door and around block. It was raining so we ended up somewhere else. A very sad day. BUT, I finally made it back and am so glad that I did. I got the Shrimp and Bacalao sandwich thing (sorry don't remember the name). It was the special for the day and oh man was it good. The seafood with capers and a spicy mixed tomato and onion concoction was amazing. The carnitas and pepito were also amazing. So glad that I was able to try more than one thing. And the guacamole!!! What could be better than that?! Sorry I have been watching Mexico:One Plate at a Time way too much. Overall, great food, great experience, great prices (its pricy but super filling), great chef!!!
