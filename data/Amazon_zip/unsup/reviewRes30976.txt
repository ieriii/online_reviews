I have found my brunch haven. Now, I have been known to exaggerate in my day (especially when I find something I fall head over heels for) but I can say whole heartedly that brunch at Nana's was one of the best I have ever had. Hidden south of UIC, Nana is a warm and inviting nook for an amazing brunch. We tried the seasonal appetizer which was mini apple bacon tarts, which were fabulous. Then came a skillet from the seasonal menu as well ( so sad that I cannot remember the name). It was filled with biscuit squares instead of potatoes and a side of warm gravy which was the best I have ever had. All paired with their poblano Bloody Mary's and you have one fantastic brunch. All exaggeration aside, I cannot wait to bring everyone to Nana's!
