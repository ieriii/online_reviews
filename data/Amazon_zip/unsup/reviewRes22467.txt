"Chicago style please....yes, everything on it....with fries. Oh, and one of those cute stuffed superdawgs too." 2 minutes later my tray arrives and on it is what I consider the quintessential Chicago style dawg. Poppyseed bun, steamed red dog, onions, fluorescent green relish, tomato, celery salt, mustard, a pickle and of course hot peppers...yum! All this goodness is surrounded by crispy crinkle fries, the old fashioned kind that are flash fried and really bad for you. If what you are craving is a Chi-town dog, Super Dawg will not disappoint, and their little dawg people and drive in atmosphere are so much fun!
