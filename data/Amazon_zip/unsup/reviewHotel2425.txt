This is a great hotel to stay in. The beds are soft and warm, and usually the views are great (if you're lucky enough to get a lake side room!). The check in was lighting fast, and that's amazing, considering I only come here once a year for the Cub Convention (think Great America lines!). Room service, and maid service are super quick, attentive and courteous. Only complaint is that it's SUPER dry and hot in the rooms, and I received a smoking room, even though I asked for a non-smoking room. :-(
