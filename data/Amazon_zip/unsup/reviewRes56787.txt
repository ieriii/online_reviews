I discovered this place by complete happenstance on the second or third day that it had opened. My sister and I were in the area and looking for a place to have lunch.We were warmly greeted by the owner, Jon and ordered our food - the taste of everything is just like in Italy. The oven roasted zucchini, the Buffalo mozzarella, the olive oil and garlic and the pizzas, well it does not get any more authentic than that. JUST LIKE ITALIA!! Every bite took me back to Europe and the bustling atmposhere in the evening adds to th experience (the wait can be long at times but well worth it in my opinion!)
