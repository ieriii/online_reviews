The ultimate for all things hot dogs and encased meats. If you want the best hot dogs Chicago (or any place for that matter) has to offer, look no further. I ordered the Paul Kelly, The Elvis, and Duck Fat fries. All were delicious and worth the wait. I wanted to try the specials, but they were a bit pricey - my friends tried it and thought it was worth every penny though. Service was really friendly and the place was really crowded, so find a seat quickly after you order. Come early, bring cash, and enjoy!
