I am shocked this place doesn't have a 5 star review on Yelp. As a Greek-American I can validate that this is the most authentic Greek food you're going to find in America! I took both of my Grandmothers here when they came to Chicago and they were both shedding a tear for how close it tasted to the cuisine of Greek generations past. The braised lamb brings back childhood memories of how it was prepared by old Greek ladies in my church. Fall-off-the-bone amazingly good. OMGz. Also, try their fresh seafood. The grilled octopus is fantastic! Even my friends who said they would never eat something with tentacles, switch over to octopus eaters when they try it! The staff is completely unpretentious as is the atmosphere -- and true to Greek culture this place is full of laughter and loud talkers! Opa!
