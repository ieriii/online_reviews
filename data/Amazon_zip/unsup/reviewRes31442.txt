Sunda is new, and at this time, just opened up to serve lunch. This is the place to see and be seen. Dress up when you go. Be prepared for mom's dressing way too young for their age. I was very impressed with the restaurant. The decor is gorgeous! Sunda was very busy when I went (A Friday) and thankfully my date made reservations. The only time he could get was 10:30pm, but we went around 8:30 in hopes that a table would open up. We didn't get a table, but got something like a communal table, where you sit with some other people. I got: -edamame (Standard) -"No You Didn't...The Ultimate Handroll" (Eat like a burrito. Hard to share) -Rock Shrimp Tempura (DELICIOUS! Nice sweet honey and walnut flavors) -Baby bok choy, shitake, soy (Nice side) -Peared Sake (LOVED the cinnamon-lined rim. By the way, if you do order it...GO SLOWLY it'll knock you out!) -Indo Corn Fritters (Sent to us free from the kitchen) I would liken this place to Japonais. Our waitress was very helpful with our dinner as far as suggestions and service. While we were eating our edamame, one of the waitstaff came by with warm towels for us to "wash" our hands. Nice! Very attentive. The only thing I didn't like was our chairs. We were seated in barstools, with feet on the floor, so my napkin kept falling off of my lap. Ooh, also didn't like the loudness. Maybe it was just the crowd, or maybe it was that AND the music, but I hated having to scream at my date.
