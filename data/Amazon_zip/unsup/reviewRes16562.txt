Think: Nacional 27 on acid. Okay, to be fair, this place was actually a pleasant surprise. The whole restaurant s a bit flamboyant for my taste; ginormous space, vibrant colors everywhere... even the bathrooms were huge (and apparently the gentleman's room was adorned with pictures of naked ladies... why no naked men pics in the ladies' room??? I call sexism!) I don't know, the vibe was too much for me. I enjoy festive but this place made me dizzy (and I'd probably get lost trying to navigate it by myself... especially if I'd had a couple of margaritas!) Anyways, back to the part that was pleasantly surprising... the food was in all honesty pretty good! After our nondescript drinks (margarita and mojito, both meh/small/weak), we tried the ceviche sampler (hiramasa, scallop, tuna). The tuna was a clear winner for me. The scallop one was good but SPICY! What I really enjoyed was my entree, which was the rib-eye. I know it doesn't sound super exciting, but it was yum! Perfectly cooked and marinated/seasoned. The dining companion had the pork shoulder, and he said it was on the dry side. Not sure I would go back, but after driving by numerous times and being distracted by the rainbow-colored neon signs, my curiosity has finally been satisfied!
