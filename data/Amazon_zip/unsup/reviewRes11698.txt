for anyone else who dislikes chicago style "pizza" -- this is the place to go. east coasters, particularly new englanders (like me!) will enjoy the perfected new haven style pizza that piece has to offer. my girlfriend and i ordered a small red pizza with sausage and sauted mushrooms. the sausage was tender and the pieces were a good size, not little tiny crumbles like at some places. the mushrooms complimented the pizza well and the crust and cheese were excellent. we've already decided what we want next time -- ricotta, sausage and basil. oh god. it's so good. honestly. also, piece is an award winning brewery. i recommend the slightly dark and sweetish worryin' ale, and also their more IPA-ish brew, delusionale. again, for someone from new england (one of the top spots in the country for microbrews), this was a little piece of home that was to die for. if you're gonna get pizza in chicago, but don't want a lump of dough that's hardly been cooked through and threatens to take over your table with its enormous mass, GO TO PIECE! they've truly mastered both excellent new haven style pizza, and handcrafted microbews.
