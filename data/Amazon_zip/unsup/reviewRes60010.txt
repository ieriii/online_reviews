Who knew there could be such an authentic taste of Columbia on Chicago's North Lincoln Avenue? Las Tablas offers an array of tasty entrees highlighted by the signature dish "Matrimonio," which celebrates the marital bliss of tender steak and seasoned chicken. Several seafood options can also be found on the menu. Many feature South American style shrimp. Each entree is easily sufficient for one person with tasty Columbian favorites yuca and plantains alongside. But for a group of four, sharing three of the main courses should leave everyone satisfied. The tables outside the restaurant make for an enjoyable evening during the summer, yet they aren't necessarily large enough to hold everyone's small plates along with the entrees. Service appears to be acceptable. Although in our group there was a forgotten salad which finally arrived after the entrees. Also when it was time to pay, the waiter suspiciously disappeared. But overall Las Tablas is certainly a nice find in South Lakeview. It's BYOB and the meal is reasonably priced. Ole!
