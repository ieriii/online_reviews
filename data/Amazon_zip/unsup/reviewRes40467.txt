I had been here once a few years ago but nothing about the experience stuck out in my mind, so when I moved to Noble Square recently, I intended on going back. Last night the opportunity presented itself as it was the only place in the area open at 3am. Or at least it looked open. Upon walking in, there was chaos at the counter...people everywhere with no sense of a line or anything. When we finally got to order, I was told that they were no longer serving anything but tacos and burritos. How they could stop serving quesadillas is beyond me (no tortillas with cheese after midnight?). So I settled for a veggie burrito, which came out pretty quickly. Then I sat down at one of the open tables and was literally yelled at by one of the waitresses: "TO GO ONLY!" After a brief period of disbelief, I just asked if I could stay seated until my friend's tacos came out and we'd happily leave.  So I waited and waited, they cleaned the table with what looked like urine from an Ice Mountain bottle, and my friend's tacos never came, but before we could ask about it at the counter, a large and douchey man came out from the back and said "You have to sit outside." I glanced over and saw that the lights were off and the outside seating was clearly closed. "I'm waiting for my friend's tacos," I replied. The man then proceeded to (one again, literally) yell at me "LEAVE! I WAS ASKING, AND NOW I'M TELLING. GET OUT!" I decided I didn't want to deal with this tool anymore so I refrained from pointing out that about 20 other customers were still happily sitting and eating or that the place was still open, my friend was waiting for his tacos, and he had no right to make me leave, but such was the case. So now I have to start a petition or something to get another Polish Triangle business to stay open late, because La Pasadita might as well not exist in my mind after that horrible experience.
