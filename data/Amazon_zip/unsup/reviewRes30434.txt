My date was a vegetarian, this place was his idea. It was our first and last date, but I wouldgo back here with another vegetarian date and or friend. I tried the BBQ beef. More out of curiousity than anything. How could they do BBQ beef? The sauce was tasty and though the "beef" was not at all "beef" I thought it was pretty tasty too. The diner feel is cute.  I regret that I did not use the bathroom here. sorry.
