I've been to Wilde thrice and it gets keeps better and better!  First Visit Highlights: - "Woah that stained glass ceiling is kinda cool. Definitely don't see that everyday" - "Nice, not only one, but TWO fireplaces! Melt the snow off my boot, dammit!" - "Mmmm beerrr" Second Visit Highlights: - "Damn, that stained glass ceiling makes me want to be a baller, shot caller" - "I'm hungover.. or still drunk. Gimme a greasy Dublin Chicken sammich and pile on the sweet potato fries too, baby!" - "Mmmm beerrr... and football. Okay now I'm feeling better" Third Visit Highlights: - "Woah, the bathrooms DO have cool faucets!" - "Meatloaf or Chicken Pot Pie? Can't decide which classic 'murrcan comfort food I shall fill up my belly with" - "Mmmm beerrr" Last Impressions? The prices are slightly expensive but I can't help but visit at least once a month. Cool place to meet a friend for lunch or drinks.
