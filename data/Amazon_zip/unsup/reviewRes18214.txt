Caro Mio was recommended to me by pretty much everyone I knew who lived in the Ravenswood area. I moved just down the street from it a few months ago, and finally went to check it out when my parents were in town this weekend. Yes, it is a little on the pricey side, but it's nothing crazy. Plus, when you take into account the fact that you're not paying for drinks it pretty much equals out. There is no corking fee, which is a nice touch. We arrived around 6:15, and it was filling up by 6:30. It's a small place, but I never felt overly crowded - even when a party of 8 was seated right behind me. It wasn't too loud, and the tables weren't sitting on top of each other which is usually the case when you go to a small restaurant and have less than 4 people. The food was really good. We had bruschetta for an appetizer; it was simple but really fresh with great flavors. My dad and I both had the gnocchi that was on special - spinach stuffed gnocchi with a creamy tomato sauce. My dad opted to substitute marinara, but the sauce wasn't overly creamy or heavy for me. My mom got the chicken tortolloni, which she said was really good as I couldn't taste it. Service was good. He was knowledgeable about the menu and specials, and didn't make us feel rushed even though there was a line by the time we were leaving. I wanted to try the tiramisu to compare it to the larger, more chain-ier Italian restaurant that I work at but I was too full to. The portions are generous - so if you're worried about price it should be able to last you two meals!
