The hubs got laid off two months ago. Shit, right? So eating out becomes lavish. We had two picky eaters with us: one by design and one because he can't help it. Lactose be gone! So Mexican isn't the obvious choice, but what I love about Nuevo is there's something for everyone. . . even under the umbrella of "Cheese and Sour Cream Nation." It can be done, and our experience was done well. Like Ms. Aurore's review from eons ago, I loved the little nibble served gratis before the main event. Ours was a beef mini-enchilada, with a really savory broth and potatoes. That and chips might be a done deal but naturally we ordered guac. A healthy dose of smoothy green fun can set a girl back a 10-spot at some venues. Here? A dinner plate mounded with my most favorite Mexican concoction. Yes. For $6. The price is surely the highlight. Like Colleen, I love a taqueria. My flautas were yum (but to Tina's point, grumble grumble goes the tumble) and we devoured tamales. The line was out the door by the time we left, and the bass got turned up (way up) just in time for us to depart. It's BYO (we brought those ADORABLE little Cuervo margs in a bottle) and cash only. The bathrooms are nothing short of disgusting, so try not to look down or around, or hold it until you get back to the ranch. Plenty to love, and plenty to scratch your head at, all for a completely reasonable price. Four of us ate for $34. Bam and bueno.
