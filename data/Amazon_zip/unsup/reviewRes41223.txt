My only meal here was last December. I can't make any specific claims about different food items, since I have a terrible memory, but I have no qualms saying it was one of the top 5 meals of my life. Everything I put in my mouth was an ecstatic food experience. The service was understated but helpful. I'd have no qualms sending anyone here for a wonderful upscale dinner experience.  And it's BYOB - $5 corkage.
