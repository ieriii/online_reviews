I absolutely love this place. I'm a huge fan of the coconut mango beef (served in a real live coconut!), but I'd have to say, I've never had a bad dish here (lemongrass beef app and curry chicken entree also rock). What's more, the place is cozy and adorable AND byob (no corkage)! My friends and I often come here on a night out with several bottles of our good friend Charles Shaw in tow, and use it as our pregame before heading out to the bars on Lincoln (I know what you're thinking...how recession-chic). I'd recommend a reservation on the weekends, since it's smaller and tends to get a bit crowded. But the service is great, and they are super accommodating when it comes to getting you seated. Last time I was there, they even took a table from the front room and created a place for us to sit in the dining area. Thanks, Simply It...I'll be back soon!
