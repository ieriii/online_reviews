I've been to Brazilian Steakhouses before. Good if you're a wrestler, foodie, or college student. Not a bad concept if done correctly. First off, my experience came during Chicago Restaurant Week, a busy time for these establishments, but the most important time to wow customers and beckon them back for another go around outside of the week. Upon entrance, we were greeted and had a good long wait. I worked food service for years and this is expected. Unfortunately I watch the front of the house staff busing tables and serving customers. Too bad it took them an average of 15 to 20 minutes to turn over a table, valuable time that could be new diners settling in, etc. Disorganized. Sad. As for the food, the salad bar is always the mark of whats to come. If you can offer a presentable salad bar, the food will be good. The spread was good, variety that ranged from seared tuna to cheese and cracker platter type offerings. Overall I have to say this salad bar was uninteresting and not very alluring. Much of the food was dry, old, not well kept. Worrisome if you're from the health dept. The cold foods weren't cold enough. The carbs brought to the table were lackluster also adding to my dissatisfaction of this restaurant. The meat was mediocre, of course much of the cheap cuts circulated the restaurant over and over again, chicken wrapped in bacon, steak. If you're trying to wow customers, bringing their lower cuts around and around won't cut it. Much of the food had an inedible char leaving the insides dry. The only saving grace of this place was the special restaurant week price. Otherwise I wouldn't pay for the service and food I received.
