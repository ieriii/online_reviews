Fabulosity. Italian food is one of my favs and this place definitely satisfied the palate.  Happened to go here after a horrible waiting experience from another restaurant (*cough* tango sur!!) through a recommendation of a good friend of mine.  My friend called and even though it was very late in the evening they were very accomodating and the staff was friendly. The food was delicious! I had the gnocci with shrimp drizzled with a tomato cream sauce. Yummmm! My boyfriend ordered the same but with italian sausage. Said he forced himself not to eat the whole plate so he can take home left overs. The fried calamari was crispy and fresh ....great flavor too. Another great aspect about this spot is that it's BYOB! If you bring white wine they place iced buckets on your table. No cork fees. The last 5th star for making what could have been a disaster into an awesome one. They also played fun music per our request since it was past closing time...and they never once rushed us out. They closed at 10....we left just past 11:30!
