Cozy restaurant for great margaritas and in your face polite "can-we-help-you service" The service: At one point I was wondering if they were joking, it was nutty how polite and able the staff was. Every person that comes into contact with you, introduces them self and asks if they can help. You almost want to tell them to freak off, but, they are being genuinely helpful. It can be a bit too much for some. Decent food for the value. Many of their combo plates were priced around $10 -$15, with just enough food to fill your appetite. Food was tasty but too bland for my taste and there's not much to say about their appetizers.  If in the area, I'd be back for a margarita or fried ice cream. The restaurant is tiny, with alto of people traffic. Reservations are needed, though if you are headed there after 8pm it shouldn't be a problem. However the later your schedule, the harder it is to find parking.
