so so so so good. this place is so cheap, but it tastes wayyy better than most pricey places. its got a great painted facade and im all about judging books by their covers. i didnt come the entire time i lived in pilsen, because i am a moron and because my roommate told me their guac tasted like a cooked diaper (he's graphic and not accurate), but now that i live far away (and make descisions for myself), i make the trip. their salsa that they bring out as an app is one of the best i've had...perfect combination of heat and flavor. their horchata is a buck a glass, so almost as good as free refills. my favorite entree is the tacos de sabinas. usually a taco platter is a one time deal, but they are huge and i usually take one or two of the three tacos home...depending on how many bowls of salsa i have already consumed :/ ... for 8 bucks i think? im all about it. they ARE cash only, just like everything else in pilsen, so be aware.
