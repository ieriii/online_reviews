The Pulbican represents everything I could ever want in a restaurant. The lighting is perfect, the space is beautiful and the food is beyond reproach. I am proponent of meals being a communal experience and love the European seating at lengthy picnic tables. Unfortunately my fiancee and I were seated at a corner of our table and so we did not have the opportunity to share our treats or have others share with us. Maybe next time. The standard oysters were delicious paired with Goose Island's new Saison "Sophie" but the charcuterie plate was what made my night. The head cheese was good, nothing to write home about, but the handmade sausages were stunning with the house mustards. Also on the charcuterie plate were two pieces of "pork pie." A bite of this miracle food reduced me to tears. Literally. I was covering my face and I think my fiancee thought I was laughing until I looked up and was wiping tears away. Our entree and desserts were equally outrageous--Crispy pork shoulder with chorizo (wonderful--not over the top) and clams was really elegant despite what one might expect from such a dish. Our dessert of a waffle with Poached Rhubarb will forever be in my mind due to the airy, crispy texture of the waffle. It was a plain waffle that is maybe the only waffle I will ever remember having eaten. This was washed down with Three Floyd's Rabbid Rabbit--a Saffron infused ale. I cannot say enough about what may now be not only my favorite Paul Kahan restaurant, but one of my favorite restaurants overall...
