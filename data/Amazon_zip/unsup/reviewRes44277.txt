Let's see - a group of friends and I came here for my g/f's bday dinner and I'd have to say that it was awesome! The food gets 5 stars (Connie Chung rolls all the way!) - but I rated 4 stars because 1)the wait was kind of ridiculous and the host made a comment stating how lucky we were that we even got a table where we did. 2) the waitresses give attitude when asking for things - but if you give attitude back it kinda evens it out (transfer of energy). 3) The space is pretty small so you'll definitely bump into people/tables and if you sit by the door during winter you WILL get all the cold draft that comes in. Having said all that... good food, everything affordably priced and awesome green tea martini/ ginger martini... yum!!!!!! I'll be going back. *Tip - don't go super starving because finding parking takes at least half hour to find. Scary.
