I'll be the minority on this, but this place is terrible. The Korean Burger had absolutely no flavor and not even that special tartar-y sauce could help. All it did was set my mouth on fire. Perhaps this is their less then satisfying dish and I shouldve ordered something else (the wings according to another Yelper). It is uncertain if I'll give this place another try, if I get a sample of those wings and my tastebuds say YES! I will. But one thing is for sure I'll never touch their french fries.
