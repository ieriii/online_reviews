Went to Hopleaf this past Friday night. It was the weekend, and so of course, it was a wait. Even though it was our first time, we were prepared for waiting and so it wasn't a big deal. Our friends managed to get a couple of seats by the bar and order up a few of their very tasty beer selections. We put an order in with the bartender who then forgot about us for about 10 minutes--but then he remembered he had forgotten us and comped us our two beers. Nice--we really appreciated that, especially since the place was slammed. We were seated for dinner upstairs on the catwalk area of the restaurant. It was a nice corner spot with a view. The waitress was attentive even though she was very busy. She recommended a pumpkin beer to our friend who was pondering it and let her know she'd take it back if she wasn't a fan--also, very nice. We appreciated the friendly service. Our food was good, though nothing to write home about. We had the mussels for two in the Belgian ale. The mussels were solid, even if the broth was a bit oversalted. With the frites and garlic mayo, it was plenty of food for us both for $21. Nevertheless, it was a smallish pot of mussels, I thought, for $21. And the frites were well-flavored, but pretty soggy. I'm used to the overload of mussels and crisp frites we used to get at our favorite Belgian spots in DC, where we used to live. Our friends had the appetizer charcuterie plate (seemed good) and the rabbit legs, which supposedly were delicious. I'd get something other than the mussels if we returned for food. Regardless, we'll definitely be back at this neighborhood spot for their incredible beer list.
