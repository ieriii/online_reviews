Second time around for me and my out of town guests, the food is amazing, presentation so imaginative. Chef Shin actually brought out a couple of the courses, describing for us what culinary delights our taste buds were about to experience. Really loved the food and the BYOB aspect BUT the wait staff disappointed this time around. Had to ask to uncork second bottle of wine; had to refill our own glasses with wine and water....and when you are figuring out tip on a tab over $300 dollars it's hard to justify even 15%....otherwise would give this place five stars.....
