Since I moved to Chicago about a year ago, I've been looking for a good, regular pizza. I've found lots of stuffed, thin, and even New York style, but nothing that satisfied my craving for a regular pizza. Today, I crave no longer. After a trip to the Post Office, I found myself famished and in the neighborhood. I remembered reading about this place, and decided to stop in (it beat out Boston Market and a Chinese buffet). I went in to get my slices, and found out that they didn't have any cheese or pepperoni stuffed slices, so I got regular pepperoni instead. Each bite was like heaven in pizza form. Flaky, buttery crust. Hot, melty cheese. Plenty of pepperoni. This pizza will haunt my dreams. You owe it to your tastebuds to get this. Stop reading. Go! Naough!
