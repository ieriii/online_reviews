I was so so so disappointed in this place. I have been hearing great things about it for so long. So my boy friend and I went there one day... we walked in and grabbed a table. There was like one other couple who was also in there. We all just sat there while the staff walked around and gossiped. No one would even look in our direction. Finally a snotty bartender told us "no food until the back room opens at 5" That was in 15 min. And then she proceeds to snipe that there was no table service in the front. WTF Ever. All of us left. Now, I am not an unreasonable person. But really a little nice-ness goes a long way. The fact they let us sit there forever and basically ignored us is what got to us. I found it to be pretentious and rude and I wouldn't go back. Not when there are like a MILLION other pubs in this city with good service and good food! The only reason I gave it one star is because I had to.
