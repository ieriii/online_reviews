This place takes me back to Vietnam. Cheap Eats. Just come here for the pho. Being an expert at pho now: (I've eaten them for breakfast, everyday for the past 17 years). The broth is cooked very well, juices and flavors definitely come out of those bones and fat. I know that Southern Vietnamese people add sugar to the broth, (which is not the way I like it), but they added just a hint of it to accentuation the salty flavor of the bones, just the way I like it. The sweetness of the bones comes right through but not overpowering, complementing the star anise and cinnamon. Herbs and noodles were good, not excellent. The herbs are not as authentic as it could've been (not coz they're American crops, just, they could've opted for better selection of rau thom). The meat I opted for were lean, but VERY tender, it broke down in my mouth right away. Very nicely cut meat. I normally like to add hoisin sauce as well as lots of lime juice and garlic/vinegar. However, this place's broth is SO well cooked, adding anything into it would spoil the natural bone-y taste (OHH!! Don't forget to add sriracha sauce though! Those are good!) The only reason why I am not giving this place five stars is this: the noodles. Coming from Vietnam, these noodles are no where near perfection. They claimed they were fresh, but they just taste like the dried spaghetti noodles you get from the shelf in the supermarket. Where's the chewiness?? Where's the slight sour-y flavor of the noodles?? Where's the fermentation of the noodles gone?? They were even shaped like spaghetti noodles if anything (nothing like rice noodles at all). They were all clumped together like a big rugby ball and you had to separate the strands in the soup yourself. Very disappointed in the noodles - which is THE key ingredient in any pho. Will I take my parents here when they're coming to visit from Vietnam? No. Chicagoans just don't know how to cook pho.
