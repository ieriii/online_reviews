Delicious! It's been said before, many times and by more credible sources than I (perhaps), but I'll say it again.... one of the best deep dish pizza spots in the city! One of the best aspects is their *pizza by the slice* feature. It's great! You can just come in off the street, order up a slice or two of deep dish goodness, and Bam! You've got your delicious pizza, not too hot nor too cold. No waiting for an hour (like at Gino's or Giordano's's). They had soccer & Olympics on TV! Good choices. A comfy lil place with a parking lot! (Though the lot fills up quickly.) Seems a little out of place in its Lakeview preppy 'hood as it is a very comfortable Chicago classic pizza place. Worth a trip over, though!! Yum! :P
