I'd give Sapori 2.5 stars if I could. The atmosphere is fine, depending on your mood. We had a reservation but had to wait 10 minutes just to get up to the host. Then we had to wait another 5 to be seated. I don't mind a bit of a wait, but there was absolutely no place to stand! When we were finally seated, it was in a tiny room off to the side. This could have been intimate and charming, but there was no music playing in our room. I felt like everyone was just listening to each other - kind of awkward. We went here once before, and I recall liking the pumpkin ravioli. Maybe that is the only star on their menu? I ordered some kind of seafood and spaghetti here on Friday night. The seafood was lacking in quality and quantity. But worse yet, the marinara tasted like it came right from a jar of Ragu. It was completely blah and did not taste fresh or homemade. Also, for a cheap bottle of wine, and 2 pasta entrees, our bill came out to $100 (no apps or dessert). This place is known for sending tons of coupons in the mail, none of which I had with me during our visit. I would appreciate it much more if they could just properly price the menu to begin with. I'll throw down $30 on a pasta dish at Prosecco, but not Sapori. In the future, we'll stick with Mia Francesca's, Rose Angelis or Socca for fresh Italian dishes. I'd say Sapori Trattoria, while somewhat charming, serves food which is more on par with Pasta Bowl.
