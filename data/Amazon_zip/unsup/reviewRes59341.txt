This place have some really good thai food. :3 ITs not really that filling as Bens Noodles, but they both are good places to eat. Last time I been there was last year on April 23,2008 and I had there Yakisoba and it was good. It taste alot better than the Yakisoba you get at Wallgreens in those packages.I would receonmend this places because if its good food. ^__^
