I used to love this place. Now it sersiously sucks. I was in the neighborhood with a friend and suggested we go there for lunch. The food was so-so. The service was TERRIBLE. The woman behind the counter at lunch was hostile. At first I thought she was pretending to be that rude, but it was for real. After I got my food and waited another 10 minutes for my friend's, we realized they forgot it. We had to ask for it and they acted like they were doing us a favor by checking on it. All in all, I was embarrassed I had suggested it, and we left irritated and unsatisfied.
