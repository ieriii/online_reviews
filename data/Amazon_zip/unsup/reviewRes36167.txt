The duck, roast pork, and soy chicken were delicious. Very crispy skin on the pork and flavorful duck meat. However the other dishes we got (Dou Miu - Pea Sprouts, Beef Tripe) were not as good. They were way to salty!! Otherwise, the whole experience in the restaurant was great!! Will go again for the duck and pork and also to try the Beijing Duck.
