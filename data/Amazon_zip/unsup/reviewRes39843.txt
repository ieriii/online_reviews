I went on a Saturday night around.......2am! Yeah that's right, 2am. haha. After hitting up Karaoke with some friends we had a huge craving for Korean food. And this place stays open until 5am. To me, a Chicagoan, that's amazing. Only cheap fast food restaurants usually stay open that late. Now, if you're looking for a family oriented restaurant with really really really attentive wait staff then this place isn't for you. (well at least not past 8pm it isn't, honestly never been before 12am lol. Then again why would a family be out past 10pm??? Get your kids to bed!) Anyway, you order then they unload a shitload of side-dishes on your table. I'm serious, it must be close to 15 side-dishes. You can choose to cook at the table or have them cook it for you. To be able to cook at the table you must order two entrees of meat. Now warning, if you ago around the time I went there will most likely be loud drunk people. It's totally fine to scream "shut-up!". Totally okay. So the food was great. Just don't burn your meat. I seen the table next to me almost burn the place down. lol. And the wait staff didn't even come over to help.
