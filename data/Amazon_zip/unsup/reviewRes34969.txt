I used to go to the Sushi X on Diversey all the time for their happy hour special (half off on rolls). There were times that my friend and I would walk out of there feeling drunk without having consumed a drop of alcohol...thats how insanely delicious their rolls are. So for my birthday, all I wanted was a Crab Rangoon roll. My bf and I booked a hotel room at the Renaissance downtown, checked in, packed a bottle of Kung Fu Girl Riesling (its BYOB!) and took a quick cab ride to this location. Its smaller than the one on Diversey...wasn't too packed on a Saturday night, which was awesome for us. We got the Five-O, Spider, and Crab Rangoon rolls. The Crab Rangoon roll was just as delicious as I remembered it....my bf said it was the best sushi roll he had ever had, even *gasp* better than Crab Rangoon itself! I can't wait to go back. Haven't found anything like it in the suburbs!
