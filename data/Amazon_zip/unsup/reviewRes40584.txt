Finally decided to suck it up and wait for a table at what is now the most popular restaurant in Logan Square. Went at 6:15 on a Wednesday night and shockingly there was only a 10 minute wait. We started with the meatballs, and olives for appetizer and both were very good. The meatball and polenta was very savory and tasty. I decided to try something from the bar and chose and a smooth and sweet bourbon over the hot and spicy. Good call on my part because if this was smooth I would hate to see what spicy tastes like. For dinner I had the cod which was light and cooked perfectly. The fiance had the pork belly which was out of this world good. there was not a morsel of scrap on either plate by the time we finished. We even decided to each get a dessert I had the chocolate tart (awesome) and the poached pear which was also good to the last drop. Overall there is a reason this place has such long waits it is called great food, service, and ambiance. I may actually rent a room upstairs when they open if it gets me preferential treatment in the dining room. We will be back again.
