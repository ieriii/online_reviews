I have been to multiple Wildfires all many times and have never had a bad experience. The Lettuce Entertain You restaurants should be the example for all chain restaurants to follow. Wildfire has great steaks at very reasonable prices. One of my favorite dishes to get here is the Filet Medallion Trio. You get three medallions and can choose your signature crusts: Horseradish, Blue Cheese (My Favorite), Parmesan, Mushroom, Double Baked Potato, and Bearnaise. Their sides are very good too. Some that I would recommend are the Redskin Mashed Potatoes, Balsamic Roasted Vegetables, and the Macaroni & Cheese. You can't beat Wildfire for the price!
