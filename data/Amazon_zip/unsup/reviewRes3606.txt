I was on the mission to buying an engraver to engrave my knives and tools for pastry school. Lucky me, Ace hardware was a couple blocks from Crisp! I heard great things so I had to stop in and get some chicken. I ordered 5 wings with 2 different sauces (BBQ and Seoul Sassy). I favored the BBQ and thought the Seoul Sassy was a little bland. I ate the BBQ first and it was exploding with flavor and may have been the reason why the Sassy was bland. Also, 5 wings was PLENTY. The wings were HUGE!
