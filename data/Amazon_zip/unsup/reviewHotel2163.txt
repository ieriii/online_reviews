This review is just for the lobby bar--never stayed here. A great place to catch a drink after shopping or before going to the movies. Leather sofas and armchairs, no tv overload (1 flatscreen), and a quiet, "men's club" vibe.  I can also attest to the greatness that is Intercontinental's Kir Royale. (the Kir is good too) But can't wait until this place is non-smoking--the guy next to us was instrusive with his smoking, not to mention his rosary.
