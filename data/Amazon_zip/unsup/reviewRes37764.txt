Fox and Obel Catering is the best in Chicago. Jennifer set me up with a great party for 80 guests. Chris, Mike and Neah the servers busted their butts for 5 hours straight, smiling the whole time they kept guests glasses full and served hot appetizers. The food meets Fox and Obel standards and the price was no more than any average catering company. Check out their website for menus, I am glad I did and look forward to working with them again.
