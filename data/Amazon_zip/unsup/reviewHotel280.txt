*Updated* I was moved to a new renovated room, but I have to remove the second star because the TV does not get NBC at all and I really want to watch the Olympics. Ridiculous. I hosted my wedding party here during the big weekend, and I thought it was fine then, but my subsequent stay has dashed those initial impressions. My list: Pro - The Internet actually works decently, although still not terribly fast - Location is great, just off the north end of Michigan Avenue, in a quiet area Con - You MUST ask for a renovated room or else it will be horrible - My bed was U-shaped - TV was grainy and about 18 years old - Build-in kitchen was not very functional, and the refridge was very loud - Headboard moved all over the place at the slightest touch - Sheets were thin - Bottom sheet was not fitted and moved all over the place - Pillows were thin - One of the lamps initially did not have a bulb
