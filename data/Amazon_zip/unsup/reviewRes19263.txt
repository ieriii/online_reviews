With 650 reviews and counting I'll let my photo do most of the talking. During my visit to Chicago, I really wanted to dine at a Rick Bayless restaurant. Fortunately there were several to choose from just a couple blocks from my hotel. But I didn't make reservations for the the high end choices in advance and couldn't handle the 1-1/2 hour wait at Frontera Grill. Xoco to the rescue. The dessert was my favorite in Chicago. Simple, yet perfect. Churros and house-made soft serve ice cream for dipping. $5 We also had the Shrimp and Bacalao Torta, Caldos Carnitas, guacamole and chips and aqua fresca. Completely filling and satisfying meal for two for $40. The cafeteria seating and ordering system is a bit odd, but it works. Having your choice of flat or mineral water is a nice touch. At every turn, it was clear a master was at work. An absolutely amazing experience at the most casual spot in the Bayless empire. This will be my first stop on my next trip to Chicago.
