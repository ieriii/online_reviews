I had to write to let people know how wonderful Spacca Napoli and its owner John is! I can call myself a foodie bk I love to eat good food and I know how rare it is to experience a restaurant with a soul... John and his wife have poured their hearts and soul into Spacca Napoli and the result is exceptional food and a warm welcoming atmosphere. i recently installed a pizza oven and was having a party on a sat evening but had a ? about the dough. I had visited Spacca Napoli in the past and was very impressed with the pizzas so I decided to give them a call and ask some advice. The response from John was surprising and refreshing. He asked how soon I could be there and when I arrived we sat down, he offered me some wonderful soup and began a tutorial including history and hands on tips for making the most sublime pizza.My kids and husband were in the car and soon they were invited into the restaurant and offered some pizza we had just made! John's love for his craft is so evident it is contagious; not only are his staff smitten with wood fired pizza but I was anxious to get back to my house and start cooking everything from pizza to bread to breakfast in my oven. After my hands on lesson we were only a few hours away from my guests arriving so he provided me with his coveted dough, perfectly risen and ready for show time!Thanks John... Your ONE IN A MILLION!!!Dianne and family
