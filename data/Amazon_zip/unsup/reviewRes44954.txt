We ordered the stuffed cheese pizza and I liked it! I am quite the NY-style pizza connoisseur and am quite the amateur with regards to Chicago style. I was glad to be taken to this place by my Chicagoan friends and tasted the stuffed cheese pizza. I would like to try it with toppings next time since I think I might prefer my Chicago-style pizza with toppings (or stuffing?).
