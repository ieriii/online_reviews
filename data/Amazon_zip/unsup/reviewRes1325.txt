Why aren't there more places like Doug's??? So, so, so good. Every time I go, I get something that... 1. I have never had before. 2. I have never even though of having, and 3. I love so much that I get sentimental about it before I am halfway done. The last time I was there I had the wild boar sausage with goat cheese, sauterne, and fois gras- uptight nancy-pants aldermen be damned! They also have a great regular hot dog for the less adventurous, but why bother. Viva la duck fat!!
