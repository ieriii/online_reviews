YUMM!! Irazu's is delicious! Everything I've had from there is so delicious I crap in my pants! I would highly recommend anything with the steak with a oatmeal shake. I also like Irazu because it's BYOB and there's a wine shop right across the street who are more than happy to help you pick out a wine. The only downfall is the long wait.
