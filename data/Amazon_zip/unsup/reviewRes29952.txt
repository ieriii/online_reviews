We went to 3rd Coast Cafe this past weekend and the experience was great. This wasnt the first time we have visited the quaint, cozy neighborhood restaurant and once again the food and the service was very good. I enjoyed an italian sausage basil omlette and it was amazing. The crumbled italian sausage couple with the fresh mozzarella really hit the spot. My wife enjoyed the steel cut oatmeal and pancakes which is the only thing she eats for breakfast. The hearty bowl of oatmeal and the fresh plump pancakes was fresh and arrived quickly. 3rd Coast is a family friendly, kid friendly environment.  Will definitely visit 3rd Coast again for breakfast but also interested in their dinner menu.
