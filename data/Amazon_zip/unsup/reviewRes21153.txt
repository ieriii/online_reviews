Superdawg is SO MUCH FUN. The only thing that could make this place cuter is if the carhops wore rollerskates! I am a huge fan of 50s Americana and anything vintage, and you will be able to get me really excited about places and things I normally only would see in movies. This place is just simply adorable in its vintage glory. Put on your poofiest petticoat, drive on down, ignore the surrounding Shell gas station and ginormous billboard above the parkinglot and imagine you are back in the old days. The burger was quite alright, but this place is really all about the dawgz. They are amazing! Crisp, juicy, slightly garlicky and plain perfection served with neon relish, onions and picalilly and hot peppers, on a poppyseed bun. The pickle and pickled tomato were refreshing and craveworthy! Fries were pretty alright, not the best by far but still yummy. I like how everything is served in cardboard containers, eventhough your food gets super smushed. It kindof adds to the charm. The shakes are advertised as extra thick, but ours came out kindof runny? This was a bit of a fail, but his vanilla shake and my chocolate malt were still tasty. Not in my top ten of favorite milkshakes, but not completely terrible either. I would pass on the cheeseburger and shakes, but get a couple of dawgz straight up. Good stuff!
