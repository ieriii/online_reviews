The other hyped Chicago eatery that just doesn't measure up. A problem that I've had with Chicago deep dish is the fact that there is always a tremendous amount of food, but the quality just isn't there. My weapon of choice was sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese (a standard for every new pizzaria I try). It wasn't bad, but once again there was a lot of stuff and nothing stood out. The sausage was missing and tasted cheap, the pepperoni lifeless and when it comes to the cheese my friend said it the best when I told him there was extra cheese; "oh extra cheese? I didn't even think there was any on there!" This was not because it was lacking(IMO I considered it only enough for a normal order), but because it had no flavor. The crust is a more crumbly recipe, rather than the more traditional doey. I didn't mind the texture, but it was too thick in comparison to everything else and lacked personality. The sauce, as with the theme with everything else. was plain and boring. This was actually probably the pizza I enjoyed the least in Chicago, despite supposedly being the best. I literally DREADED finishing the pizza I bought. Never before have I looked at a pizza and thought "I never want to touch this again:. If I ever try Pequods again, I'll try some fresh ingredients. But I doubt anything will change.
