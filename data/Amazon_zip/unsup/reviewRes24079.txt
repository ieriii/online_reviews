Another one of those restaurants I have been to a MILLION TIMES. Especially, being Greek and all, this place is the best dinner you can get in Greek Town. I will just tell tell you my father will not eat anywhere else! Ha ha you would think that is a joke but it isn't!.....The Skordalia is to die for, and make sure to order the fried zucchinis with it. I reccommend everything on the Menu! I guarantee the Bus Boys will not let your water glass get less than 1/2 way full, really great service! Enjoy!
