I don't understand why, of all the Korean restaurants in Chicago, this is the one that seems to attract the non-Korean crowd. We ordered the codfish with vegetables stew, which was really good and spicy with lots of semi-soft tofu. I will say that I would definitely order this dish again. The jap chae--my favorite Korean dish--was just weird, though, with lots of black pepper (does black pepper even exist in authentic Korean cuisine?) and some kind of broth to stretch the oil (I understand being health conscious, but don't mess with my jap chae!). We didn't order sushi, but the sushi menu looked uninspired. It should also be noted that they have what might possibly be the worst parking lot in the city.
