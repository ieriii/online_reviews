This place represents all that is glorious and beautiful in the world. Yes, that's right, grilled meat and panchan. If you could throw in some mango juice, then we'd have it all. But we can't have it all in life, though we can get close by coming here.  There are some moments when I come here and think, I just want sundubu or the goat stew(really really good, by the way, but it gives you some serious gas, so if you eat this, be forewarned that people will avoid you), but then I see the coals and the aroma of grilled animal...and I can't resist...even when I burn my hands or my friends and I start sweating from the heat...I never for one moment doubt that ordering two meat dishes was the right thing to do. For specifics ,the wang kalbi is my favorite, though I can say the bulgogi is okay except that is a bit difficult to cook on the coals. There is an octopus dish which is good as well. The panchan is also plentiful and glorious. Be careful though lest you succumb to Pachan Fullness Disorder, a disease that afflicts many a diner at Korean restaurants wherein one stuffs oneself with panchan and then is too full to eat the main course. It is very sad situation indeed. Sad but delicious, but mostly sad.  Overall, this place is pretty solid for grilled meat and pickled awesomeness. It gave me and my lab partner hope while we suffered through nine weeks of summer Organic Chemistry(it is that pleasing). I hear it is supposedly open until 5a.m., but I am unsure of whether that is actually true(don't doubt that I won't one day try to find out).
