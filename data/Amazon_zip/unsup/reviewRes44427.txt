Wow! This place deserves 10 stars!! My partner surprised me one night last week and took me here for dinner. We sat outside. I was just blown away by the service and the food. Our server was so friendly and we were well taken care of. The food was amazing! Started off with two of the vegetarian sushi rolls. One was filled with sweet potatoes, the other one was a salad filled roll. Both were incredible. Then on to the salad and miso soup! Outstanding there too! For our main course we had teriyaki tofu, that was also very good. You have got to try the plum wine, that just topped off the meal! Definitely one of my favorite places now to go.
