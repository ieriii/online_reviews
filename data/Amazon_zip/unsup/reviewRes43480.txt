They know how to do coffee, and they know how to do food - however, there is a distinct difference between their two locations and the customer service that is offered. On Division St. you might enjoy breakfast or lunch (if you can stand the crowd & the wait), but don't count on friendliness or smiles. Apparently they're too 'cool' for that. I would suggest just getting it to go, or better yet, take the scenic route over to the Damen Ave. location (right across from the Blue Line stop) - for the best of everything. There, they smile, and greet you, and treat you with the respect you should be treated with - as a paying customer! Perhaps they haven't had time to train the service industry employees at the Division St. spot - we can only hope they get on that, sooner than later!!! and folks, if you don't like your job - Q U I T - just stop taking it out on the paying customers!
