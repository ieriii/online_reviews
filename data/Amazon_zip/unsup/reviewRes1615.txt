So this is how it went down: DOUG: So do you want fries with that? ME: Oh no that's cool--I'm gonna' have some of his. (Points to boyfriend at pop machine) DOUG: Well if he doesn't share let me know caus' I'll drop him like a 6th grader in French class! (end scene) Thanks for looking out for me, Doug! Your cheese fries are immortalized in all their splendor on my best friends face book graffiti wall. BTW all of your food/dogs are kick ass and you also have browns pop, which is totally awesome. Yeah I said pop. If I ever thought about moving away from chicago, your joint would be on the "reasons to stay" side of my comparision list...right above "cheese fries sharing boyfriend". Thanks again, and I'll be back soon!
