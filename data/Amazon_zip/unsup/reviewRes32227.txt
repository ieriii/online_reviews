Went by myself as I was in Chicago for work. Got the reco from the Westin concierge. Sunda was amazing! Living in the Northwest, I thought we had the sushi market on lockdown. Sunda definitely opened my eyes. The nigiri was fantastic, but the Kobe Beef Tartare was the show-stopper. Laid over crispy rice with a tiny thai chile. Out of this world good. The service was decent, not in-your-face, which was the best part. Highly recommended.
