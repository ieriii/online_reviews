I mean, come on, of course this is going to get a 5 star rating. This place is unbelievable. I can not fault the service, food, or atmosphere - only my own lack of adventure when it came to a couple of plates...I just don't like lamb! Thankfully there were many many more dishes that more than satisfied my appetite and curiosity! I took my boyfriend for his birthday and we were amazed by the attention to detail each server provided. They were so precise with every movement we were initially a little on edge...did we belong here? My boyfriend made a comment about the white sauce on the plate only to realize it wasn't a sauce...it was the plate. The shiny, white, glistening plate that was clearly so perfect he mistook it for a sauce. I replied to the waiter that my bf wasn't used to seeing plates so clean and that immediately broke the ice...they liked us - they really liked us! The service was impeccable - down to a piece of bread which had somehow fallen from my plate to the table but was so unworthy of a hand to pick it up they came back with utensils to scoop it up and take it away! The first dish, by far one of my favorites, was the "hot potato cold potato" which has been spoken of in many other reviews. One single sip of soup with a tiny potato speared at the head of a pin along with a single piece of chive, butter, and cheese. So tiny but so delicious...a great start to a beautiful meal. This dish was in Chicago magazine (if I remember correctly) and became the reason I had to come! We are so grateful that Grant has recovered and survived his bout with cancer therefor giving us a chance to sit amazed and in awe of his talent over a 3 hour meal which we will NEVER forget. When we finally walked out onto the street I felt like I had been on vacation. It was a surreal experience with a lasting impression that I had become a tiny part of Willy Wonkas fantasy land.
