Some people don't get the hype, but I do. Their breakfasts are great. Although my ham and egg sandwich was a little salty, it was HUGE. I don't know if it was really worth the wait, but at least I left extremely full. Definitely better than Orange, but I don't know if this is THE best brunch spot in Chicago. Maybe it's because the restaurant is weirdly dark and unlit and because there is such an insane wait.
