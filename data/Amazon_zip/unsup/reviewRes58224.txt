Don't waste your time or money. After leaving messages for a reservation for 3 weeks without getting a return call, they called and said they had a spot that evening. We went but couldn't stand the hip hop music that was blasting so loudly that the entire dining room vibrated. Who wants to spend $110 on dinner and not be able to hear each other talk? When we asked if they could turn it down, we were told, This is the music we play here and it will be on all night. If a restaurant doesn't care about giving the diner a great experience all the way around, why go there????? There's much better dining experiences in Chicago.
