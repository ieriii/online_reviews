I appreciate that this was the cheapest standard hotel option (i.e., no hostels, b&b's, inns, etc.) to be found in town at $143 a night, and I absolutely appreciated that our 2 double-bed room had TWO bathrooms, but I found so many cheap annoyances.  First, why couldn't we have proper queen beds, which has become the standard in most American hotels? These were definitely doubles, and can be a bit cramped for two. Also, how much is in-room internet?? The room includes a computer with some pre-loaded tourist information, but why not offer up internet if you have it installed? Finally - greatest pet peeve -- $2 to check a bag with the concierge?? That is incredibly unjust and makes this "Hilton" feel so cheap! Other than those complaints, I had a good night's sleep right across the street from the Art Institute.
