This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. As an ex-South Looper, I started to get used to less-than-stellar service. After visiting my boyfriend's sister in Lincoln Park, we were told to go to Mayan Palace for great Mexican food and even better margaritas! And was she right! The food is absolutely delicious, and the service is superb. I have never gotten better service from any other restaurant in the city. They were also very accommodating when we called for reservations the day of New Years Eve with a group of 10. I've even taken my parents (who hate visiting the city and trying new things), and they absolutely rave about it! Now that we live in Lincoln Park, Mayan Palace is just down the street (which is a good and bad thing!)And did I mention their 1/2-off margaritas on Tuesdays and Thursdays? I'm not a big drinker, but I LOVE their margaritas!
