I love this place. Their wings are hands down the best wings I have ever had. They smoke them first and then fry them. And there is this amazing blue cheese potato salad that comes on the side. Yum! After the wings, my husband and I usually split a burger (which are also amazing). The people who run this place are total beer-crazies and foodies (like us). I say go here when you have $60 bucks to spend on a date. Nice ambiance too.
