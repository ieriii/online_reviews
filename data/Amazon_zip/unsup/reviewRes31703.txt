The only bad things I can say about Nana is that it can get really busy and it's fairly pricey. If you don't want to wait too long, try to get there fairly early or late (for breakfast or lunch). I've had to wait outside a couple times (when the weather was nice). You have to expect the prices to be a little pricey with it all being organic, so don't let that put you off. The food is outstanding and the staff is very good. I would definitely recommend whatever their special pancake is at the time.
