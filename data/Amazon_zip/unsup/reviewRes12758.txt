I love Texas de Brazil!!! I went to one in Dallas and fell in love with it there. I was overjoyed to see one while vacationing in Chicago. The food is amazing. Sooo much meat and so much great salad at the salad bar. And the lobster bisque: to die for!!! Plus, the atmosphere is great. Very romantic. I should also mention that the service was fantastic. The waitstaff would always pull my chair back every time I sat down. It's a great experience, I would recommend it to anyone. :)
