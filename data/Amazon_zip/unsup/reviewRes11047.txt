My first experience with Piece was on a Wicker park/ Bucktown food tour and we were able to sample a white pizza and their most popular beer, and it was so good we made plans to go back a few weeks later for dinner. The white pizza is the best I've had! We has sausage with goat cheese tomatoe and basil. AMAZING! They also have very good brews!
