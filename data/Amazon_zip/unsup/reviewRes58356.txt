This place is a gem! Disguised as a casual deli, the food is some of the most innovative and delicious in town, and the service is extremely personal. I've sampled each meal they offer - breakfast, dinner, and I've been to two of the underground dinners now. For breakfast, everything is tasty, but whatever you get, make sure you order a cup of coffee or a latte to go with it - you'll never drink Starbucks again!For the regular dinners, you won't go wrong with any of the entrees, but be sure not to pass up the Martini Special appetizer - usually a special risotto that's to die for.And, by all means, make a special evening out of the the underground restaurant experience! Relaxed and intimate, it's a unique and perfect way to spend an evening with friends or a date!
