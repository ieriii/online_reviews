One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Lakeview. It's all about the sushi - there's no thumping music or pop-art decor or obnoxious clubgoers to detract from the experience. The atmosphere is authentic and respectful, yet still manages to be fun. The waitstaff is attentive and polite. The price is about average, but it my opinion it's worth it! Favorites are the Oedipus and the Spicy Trio rolls. And if you can stand a little heat, try the jalapeno miso soup!
