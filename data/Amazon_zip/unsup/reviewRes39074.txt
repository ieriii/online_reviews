I'm going to have to agree with some of the reviews below that the service really does suck! Our server was pretty rude and she didn't seem to understand what we said in English OR Korean. She totally misunderstood us and didn't even try to give us good service. We did have a lot of side dishes but she just shoved them on the table. Once our food arrived we really didn't have any room on the table! The soon doo boo soup, seafood pancakes and marinated kalbi were good.. But I've definitely had better Korean BBQ experiences. The ventilation was terrible! It's a given you're going to smell after Korean BBQ but this place was pretty bad because the fans didn't work properly. Next time I'm in Chicago I'll go elsewhere for Korean BBQ!
