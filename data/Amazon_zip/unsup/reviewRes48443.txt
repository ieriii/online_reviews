Honestly - if you are going for a couple light apps and beer, this place MIGHT just do it for you. The bread and trio of hams were delish as an appetizer and the salad, "Little Gem Salad" was delightful as well. Several tables in view had ordered the oysters which looked FABULOUS. I wish I could say the same for the uninspired, tired entrees. The Potee could have just as well been prepared in a novice kitchen - the flavors were nothing fascinating except for the wonderful drizzle of garlic creme dancing around the pork loin. Overall, the whole dish was too salty overpowering most of the other flavors and tastes. The second entree that was ordered was the hen - the meat was dry and the broccoli was too salty - SAD!!!  I really, really wanted to LOVE this place as I took my husband here for his birthday (doesn't it seem like a carnivore beer drinkers dream?!!)...but, alas, we left disappointed by the food - quality of the entrees did not match the pricepoint!!!  Decor is minimilastic and in line with the whole European Ale-house feel. It's SUPER loud in the restaurant and therefore not ideal if you are looking for a romantic meal. Service was a highlight - the server was very knowledgeable about the menu and beers, however, this is probably not enough to make me "repeat" the experience.
