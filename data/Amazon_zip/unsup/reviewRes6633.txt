I've never been a big bbq fan and I recently realized I just don't really love bbq sauce.. But Chicago Q helped me look past this by establishing that bbq doesn't just mean the sauce. It means amazingly cured/smoked red meat products. And that my friends is something I can get behind. I've been here twice for dinner & brunch, and both times I found my meal to be very good, prices extremely reasonable and portions fit for a king. I challenge the average person to walk out of here without a doggie bag.  Only 4 stars because both times I've been there I wish I had ordered better, or maybe it's just that I know food tastes better off other peoples plates.
