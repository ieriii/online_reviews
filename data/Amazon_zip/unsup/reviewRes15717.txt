I've been here twice. The first time it was dinner with friends. I had the carne arrachera and it was fine. I think what threw me off was how overrated and overpriced it was. I felt the portions were kind of meh. Drinks were fine and so were the appetizers. The second time I went was for lunch. This is what cemented my first impressions. The coconut mojito was good but I ordered three pork tacos and they were served on a long oval plate. They took about 2/3 of the plate and looked careless. The presentation was mediocre. The actual pork is supposedly slow cooked but it tasted really greasy. Also, the chips served were drenched in oil. Even Chipotle's chips aren't as oily. I asked the waitress if she would recommend the Chicken Milanesa sandwich or the Pork Tacos. She said the Pork Tacos but couldn't tell me why. She said she had just started there though she sounded like she'd been there for 10 years because she sounded so defeated: at lunch! With one table. I like the decor, space and music. However I can think of three places where the food is similarly priced but you get much better nuevo Latino fusion, superb drinks, great ambiance and outstanding service in a 7 mile radius from the Loop.
