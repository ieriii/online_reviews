My boyfriend says four, but I say three stars. We went there for Restaurant Week with two friends, and let us say that the steak was phenomenal. Perfectly cooked, juicy, hot, we could have no complaints there (well, I asked for it without parsley, and it was kind of coated in parsley). The Steak House Salad was great too. But honestly, the creamed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes were sub-par at best. The only way I could think of describing their flavor (and it's odd that they both had it) was that they tasted the way the Elephant House at the Cincinnati Zoo smells. So... gross. I tried two bites of my creamed spinach and a bite of the garlic mashed potatoes, and let me tell you what, that was more than enough. I hate to take away two stars for side dishes, but any restaurant that serves TWO dishes that are more or less nasty doesn't deserver more than three stars. The dessert was fine, the fruit was luscious and the cream was perfectly sweet (we skipped the chocolate mouse due to Lent.) Our friends said it was excellent, and had our servings! Overall, I wouldn't go back. I may be wrong here, but I feel like you can get good steak a lot of places, but those side dishes were unpalatable.
