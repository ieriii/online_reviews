I CANNOT wait to visit this hidden gem again!!!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was due to the wine list. I'm such a Cali red lover that I didn't want to spread my wings as much. The white Bordeauxs were wonderful though!! You have to try the roasted beet with goat cheese and pistachio appetizer!! The best thing of our meal was the goat cheese with eggplant Smear! AMAZING!!!! The Sepia with fried rosemary was delicious as well! If you love fried small bites, try the fried deviled egg!! It actually sold out before we left!  Can't wait to return!!:)
