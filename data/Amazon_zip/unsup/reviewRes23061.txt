In these trying times it is refreshing to find a place that gives you great value for your hard earned dollar. Irazu is a wonderful Costa Rican Restaurant in Bucktown. The interior is small but well decorated. The staff could not be nicer and the service was wonderful.  I ordered the Costa Rican steak which was mouth watering. The portions were huge and even though I had no idea what half the food on my plate was called, I enjoyed every bite. One of the things I love about Spanish food are the sauces and spices. Every morsel of food on my plate was spiced to the hilt with wonderful Costa Rican flavors. If you have never tried Costa Rican food, I highly suggest that you give Irazu a try. I can just about Guarantee that you will enjoy the experience.
