I really struggled rating Alinea. I feel like I have to give it a high score because, well, it's Alinea. But in reality, it most definitely was not my favorite dining experience I have ever had, and for what you pay, I expected to be blown away -which I was not.... With that being said, it still was a wonderful meal - the service is unbeatable. They do their very best to make you understand what you are eating and drinking - and the servers are not stuffy at all which was unexpected. They space out the reservations, so the people next to you are never at the same course which keeps things from feeling like a factory. There is absolutely no music or noise to block out other conversations or the server speaking to other tables, so that was the one bad thing about the overall mood and element of surprise. Overall, there were some really good courses and some not so good courses. I was very displeased starting the whole experience with 3 small shots of alcohol because I specifically didn't eat much that day in preparation for our big meal, and drinking on an empty stomach almost made me throw up! I have no idea why they wouldn't have the alcohol a few courses in... Everything was prepared beautifully and was made with purpose, but I was not blown away by a single course - which I expected that I would.  When my husband and I left, we both thought the experience was cool, however I don't know if it was worth the money. After the food and wine pairing, I could have paid for 4 or 5 meals at a restaurant that I have given 5's (Roy's or Sunda..). I would not go again, nor would I urge any friends to go either. If you do go, however, definitely do the wine pairing. They tell you it is about 1/3 the cost of dinner (NOT TRUE) but they really do pair nicely with the meal.
