We live down the block and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this location. I'm happy to report that it didn't disappoint. Great food, great price and great owners. The backyard patio is sweet - more tables and more secluded. BYOB. Bring a big group and feel like you're relaxing in the Caribbean!
