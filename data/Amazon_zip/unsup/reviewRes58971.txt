What a great spot for a Friday night! This place is so hip, but also very loud. If you are looking for an intimate conversation, don't go. If you want some great food and great people watching, this is the spot. We had a great waitress, and all the food was exceptional. We loved the free starter crab salad that was delivered as soon as we sat down. We then proceeded to order all small plates - a couple at a time. The menu was extensive so we asked our waitress for advice. She told us all her favorites, and none of them were disappointing! We have found in Asian restaurants that appetizers are always more flavorful than entrees, so we just kept on ordering until our tummies said, STOP! We will definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago.
