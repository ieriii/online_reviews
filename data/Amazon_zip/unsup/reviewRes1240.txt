Gah I think this is meat heaven. We have friends in town who alerted us to the call ahead option, yeah that rocked. I made the pilgrammage on our last trip into the city. I came in search of duck fat fries and holy mother of &%@$# were they happy. I could not stop eating them until they were gone. I had a super garlicy pork sausage with spicy mustard, garlic cloves and horseradish cheddar and a buffalo sausage with serendipity cheese that were possibly the best sausages I have ever eaten, so full of flavor and spice. I am drooling at the memory here. I of course could not eat it all but man was it as good later too, I figured I might as well get both as I could not decide and live 5 hours away. My husband stuck boring and traditional with cheese fries and a couple of cheesed up brats but they were very tasty as well. He was very happy and actually looked a bit appalled at my choices to be frank. Yep I will be back. I think it's almost sweeter to live so far away so you can really appreciate them when you are here.
