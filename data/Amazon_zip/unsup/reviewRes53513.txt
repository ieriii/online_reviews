An amazing dining experience. We went to celebrate a milestone in a friend's career. We had the seasonal collection. My friend's wife is vegan. She called in advance and the kitchen made all of her food vegan. Service was excellent. At one point, my friend's wife was cold. One of our attendants noticed and came over with a selection of shawls that matched her dress. Also loved the chair for my purse.
