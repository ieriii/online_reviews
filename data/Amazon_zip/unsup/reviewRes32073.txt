The boy and I ate outside one sunny summer time and since this is the first time I ate Vegan it was out of this world delicious. As a smoker I don't taste things well, but the flavors and spices and sauces over tofu is amazing here. Everything grilled or cooked and served hot with unique flavor and new menu names to learn.  Not only healthy and heartily filling the presentation of our entrees were very nice. I ate my dish and the bf's dish!
