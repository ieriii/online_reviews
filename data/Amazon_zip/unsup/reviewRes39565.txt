Many a late nights have been here rehydrating my body from a night of grave alcohol consumption. There aren't too many Korean restaurant choices after midnight in Chicago but San Soo Gap San has been a stable late night stop with above average quality food. I find myself always striking up a conversation with new comers to Korean dining walking them through some of the selections. Always a large selection of panchan and the stews hit the spot if you are not in the mode for bbq. Like most other Korean restaurants don't expect to be waited on like it's Spago, sometimes you have to take matters into your own hand and get the attention of the various ahjuma's (the Korean ladies who run the joint like a 1920's Ford assembly line) to get a refill on some panchan. Actually I'm kinda getting hungry thinking about the dol sot bi bim bap right now...anyone down for a late night run? Good eats, reasonable prices, and it's open 24 hours (I only need a good half hour to sober up after a good hearty meal).
