For my B-day my wife got us tix to the weekly taping of the comedy radio show "Wait wait don't tell me" from NPR which is taped at the Chase Bank auditorium in their loop HQ on Dearborn St after which we tried out Piccolo Sogno. It was about 9:30 when we finally got there but their kitchen is open til around 10:30 so they were ok with our being later than we thought and seated us right away. Our waiter was very accommodating and fit in with the urban chic vibe. Piccolo Sogno is in the old Thyme space at Milwaukee & Halsted and has their own parking which had I known beforehand would have used. Their space has a huge backyard eating area which is fantastic although it was a cold night so no-go on that. The food was both varied and really good. We started with squash blossoms (fried edible flowers) and an appetizer portion of their gnocchi which is not on the menu but you can get an appetizer size portion of any of their pasta's or risottos which was good because we wanted to try it but didn't want it as a main course. For main courses my wife had the rabbit with orange sauce which was phenomenal and I had the braised short rib which was rich and delicious. My shortrib was like a Flintstones cartoon where the bone was spinning in the bowl as I finished it. We skipped dessert because it was late and we were tired but those looked appealing too. All in all we loved Piccolo Sogno. The interior is cool, the service was attentive and the food was fantastic.
