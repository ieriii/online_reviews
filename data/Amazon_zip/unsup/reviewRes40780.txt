Really Yelp? 4.5 stars? I think the folks who didn't give this 5 stars must eat every meal at Alinea or something. Unless you hate good things, creative things, friendly things, or you have $0, this is clearly a 5-star restaurant.  Now, the very cultured among us would probably look down on me for this, but this was the best meal I've ever had. I've never been to Alinea or L20 or even Charlie Trotters, but I have been to Takashi and Topolobampo and Girl & the Goat and Longman & Eagle in the past year, and Bonsoiree topped them all.  First of all, how awesome are recommended BYO Wine Pairings? That just makes my day.  The ambience is perfect: classy and modern, but small, quaint and comfortable. Our server was really high, and just terrific.  All that's fine and good, but when you're paying $85 for a meal each person, it's all about the food. Anyone can look at the menu here: http://www.bonsoireechic. Everything was amazing. Let me just share the highlights. The motoyaki in a sea scallop shell is literally the best thing I've ever tasted. Few things even come close. The second best dish was a gemaicha (green tea/brown rice) pork tenderloin/crispy pork belly.  Everything was beautifully presented, whimsically creative and flavorful. One of the more fun courses was a reverse cheese and crackers, featuring the best cheese straws ever and a gelatin that tasted just like a saltine cracker.  This isn't a cheap meal, and I certainly can't do it often, but skip a regular dinner or two out and experience this at least once. It's well worth the price of admission.
