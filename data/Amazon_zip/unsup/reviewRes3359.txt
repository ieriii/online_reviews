First thing that stood out about Crisp was the service. I've been in the restaurant to eat and have gotten food delivered and both ways the service has been great. I'm not sure if the guy I remember is a manger, owner, or whatever but he was just the right amount of talkative, polite, and super friendly. Even the guy that delivered my food one night told me how much he appreciated my business and hoped to see me again before the holiday but if not to be sure I had a merry Christmas.  Service aside, the food is also good. I can see this quickly becoming a place I would regularly order from. I've tried the Seoul Sensation, the Bad Boy Buddha Bowl, and a variety of appetizers. The only thing I'm still undecided about is the mashed potatoes. Unique approach but a little too sweet for me although give them a whirl if you want something different. Overall 3 stars but plus one because of the great service.
