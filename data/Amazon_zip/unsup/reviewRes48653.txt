Got this recommendation from a friend and fellow Yelper and it did not disappoint.  Initially we'd requested seating for 6 which precluded us from getting our own penalty box - bummer because when we arrived we only had four.  If you're claustrophobic avoid the penalty box otherwise it's a cool concept. The beer list was something to behold - not huge but expansive.  Started off with some Kusshi, Deep Bay and Raspberry Point oysters. Decent but a little saltier/sea-tasting than I care for. The pork rinds were a hit across the board. Outstanding flavor, cracklin' fresh with a little grease to hold the seasoning, delish. After a Dark Horse Amber and making my way through a Lagunitas Cappucino Stout we moved into our dinner fixings. This worked beautifully because each plate was delivered, devoured and we moved on. Very efficient.  We kept an order of beets and pickles during each plate. The pickles are actually a plate of pickled veggies, cauliflower, roma tomaotes, cherry peppers - great flavor, a hint of vinegar and spice.  The tuna "speck" was outstanding, great flavor, moved into the venison heart which had a spicy flavor, very dense and firm but a wonderful taste to it. The sweetbreads came next. Rich. Very rich. Highly recommended. Next up, the country ribs - great smoke texture, very good - if not slightly over-grilled but good enough to order a second round of 'um. We finished it all off with the halibut, and the hazelnut breadcrumb salsa was a beautiful complement to this firm, mild fish (fish for people who don't like fish). A good experience. The bathrooms were interesting. Be sure to lock the door or you might get an unexpected double-up experience or the people washing their hands in the community sink will get an eyeful.
