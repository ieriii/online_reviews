Seriously!? What about this place is not to like? Really!! It's BYOB for one. And its right by two liquor spots, and right by the train as you head out for a good night. Atmosphere is intimate. Staff is nice, informed. And the dishes are rockin. These guys are doin there thing. Edgewater has some really great asian spots. But if you're looking for awesome Asian on the north side as a whole to take your lovey, I honestly can't think of any place better. You might want to call ahead on the weekends, cause it does get bumpin.
