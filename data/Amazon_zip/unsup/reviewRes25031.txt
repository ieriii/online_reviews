Geja's Cafe is an excellent fondue restaurant with a romantic ambiance and superior service. My wife and I enjoyed a post Valentine's day dinner at Geja's using a Groupon that I had purchased.  While the restaurant was still packed the day after V-day, there were no set seatings, so we could enjoy the experience without feeling rushed. We split a bottle of the Geja's house chardonnay to start, and it was perfect! For our meal we went with the Prince Geja's Combination, and it was delicious! We started with a Geja's salad, which was simple yet tasty. Next we savored an excellent cheese fondue appetizer which came accompanied by various breads and fruit.  Our main dish came on a large plate and included aged beef tenderloin, delicate lobster tail, jumbo shrimp, plump Atlantic sea scallops, tender boneless chicken breast, a mountain of assorted fresh vegetables, and eight dipping sauces. Now this may not look like a ton of food to some, but I left stuffed (and I can eat!). Each item on the plate was high-quality and tasted wonderful after its hot oil bubble bath. For dessert, the flaming chocolate dessert fondue and coffee sealed the deal on a great evening. The atmosphere is truly romantic. The restaurant is located in a garden unit, which oddly enough adds to the exclusivity and romance of the restaurant. Our service was excellent! Our server was very helpful and attentive. The gentleman from Mexico City who set our table between courses, did so with Zorro like movements and swagger.  Overall, Geja's was a great experience!
