I live near Greektown and love taking guests out there. Of all the Greek restaurants in Greektown, this is probably my favorite. It's true that they are all good, but this one is just a notch above the others. It smells a little better, has a bit nicer atmosphere, and a larger menu. It also feels like an instant party inside. Don't go here if you are looking for someplace quiet to enjoy a deep and serious conversation. You'll most likely be interrupted by tipsy customers entranced by flaming cheese yelling "opaa!"  I recommend the fried zucchini with skordalia, the saganaki (of course), and the braised lamb. My friend also loved the Mousaka.
