This review is for their catering only. I called a week in advance to order two dozen mini-sandwiches for my friend's baby shower, and was told to call back the next morning because the catering person was not in. When I called again, the catering woman took my order, and I confirmed all the details with her, including the day and time of pick-up ("no problem!"). On the morning of the shower, my friend arrived to pick up the order and their response was "What order?" GASP.....!!! WTH!! They were very apologetic and made the sandwiches on the spot, and even gave us a discount. However, if we had a bigger or more complicated order, or hadn't arrived early, their thoughtlessness and lack of professionalism would have ruined our event. The sandwiches were fine, but trust them with your event AT YOUR OWN RISK.
