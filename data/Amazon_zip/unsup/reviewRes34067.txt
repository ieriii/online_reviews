Absolutely wonderful. Great service, tasty food, cozy environment and I love that they change their menu every two weeks. I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner. We ordered a bottle of wine and split everything we ordered including, the Bruschette w/ prosciutto and mozzarella, which was an insane explosion of flavors. The Insalta alla Francesca was delicious with unique veggies and a light vinaigrette. Pasta dish and tiramisu for dessert. Delish! I'd recommend splitting the pasta dishes, because they are huge. We're big eaters and splitting an app, salad, pasta and dessert was plenty for both of us. Total bill with a cheaper bottle of wine was $67 plus tip. I think this is totally worth it for a pleasant dining experience.
