I eat here too much. I wonder some days how long I could live off just empanadas, croquettes and mamey shakes. I usually get a steak the size of my head or layered between plantain "bread" so they don't notice I'm weird. My only issue is at night when they are busy my take out empanadas have been ridiculously over cooked.
