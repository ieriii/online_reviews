The bellhops and doorman are super helpful, the place is immaculately clean, smooth, and inviting. It's a green hotel so I like that social consciousness as well. Lets start with the front desk service. It needs some serious help in the 'service' department. Dismissive comments and rolling your eyes doesn't help me when I ask you simple questions like 'Can you direct me to the nearest train stop?' 'Can you tell me how to get to Ukranian Village?" I apologize, I am not a native of Chicago and yes - I'm a noob. Thankfully I have an iphone and with an extra 5 minutes of research, yeah I can figure it out I guess - but thoughtI'd leverage the 'service'.  After I learned that lesson.. all was well.. on to the room. The room is super clean, nice, and the bed is amazing. I mean really comfortable. The blinds are bad ass.. no light is getting through them. It can be turned into a cave at 2pm with no light getting in. Drawbacks - sound. I can hear people coughing in their rooms, brushing their teeth, running the shower, slamming their doors. The room I had was at the end of the hall way - Yet I could still hear the 'elevator ding' (located in the middle of the hall).  Thankfully I can overcome secondary sounds.. others may not. Overall I'd stay here again - I liked it. If you have the extra cash, check out the spa - its an AVEDA spa on the 2nd floor.
