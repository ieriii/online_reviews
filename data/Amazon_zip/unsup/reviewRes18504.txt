I went here tonight after hoping to get into the Wild Goose for some 10 cent wings. When people say it gets crowded, they are not joking. Needless to say, I was jonesing for some wings. Since it is freezing out, we just crossed the street to the Bad Apple. I was very happy we did! It was very good food, great beer list, and fun decor. Our waiter was extremely nice and made some perfect beer recommendations. We had the goat cheese fondue (I wasn't the biggest fan of this), chickpea salad (liked this a lot), and the hubs had the rosemary chicken (he said his was above average). We were in the back room watching the Vikings/Bears game, but I saw a lot of board games on a shelf that made me think it would be a lot of fun to bring back some friends and play a few of those. They didn't have any specials, so I don't know how financially sound of an idea that would be. If you have friends that like different beers that taste better than a Miller Lite, I would recommend bringing them here. If you have friends that would rather drink Miller Lite over anything stronger, I might recommend another bar. We will be back - their menu looked interesting and the setup is pretty cool!
