I had really delicious pork chops here for a friend's b-day. That was about a year ago now, and I have heard a lot of people talking about Mia Francesca. Many of their comments are negative: too loud, crowded, bad atmosphere, expensive. Now, it has been a while for me, but I don't remember having any of these issues. We made a reservation for a Friday night, were seated right away, all enjoyed our food, and I didn't notice excessive noise at all. And they brought a special individual portion of our dessert with a candle in it for the b-day girl. So in short, I can't support the negative things I've been hearing, but you might want a reservation on a busy night.
