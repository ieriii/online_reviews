Lunched on breakfast (it's served all day here): "Healthy choice" French toast, on special today--multigrain bread dipped in vanilla custard, topped with pecans, blackberries and strawberries. Toast was moist, yet not too eggy, brightened by fruit and grounded by nuts. All flavors happily agreed in a perfectly sized portion that hit the spot. Melli's interior is lively, yet sophisticated. Service was adequate. I almost regret not pairing my meal with a cappuccino, but I definitely look forward to caffeinating my next visit.
