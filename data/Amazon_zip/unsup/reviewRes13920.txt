I came in blind and walked out a believer. Before moving to the City I had not experienced Cuban cuisine. I have to say this was not the first choice for lunch but have you seen Kuma's Corner or Hot Doug's on Saturday? Yeah I know you have - I'd rather not be squeezed into a corner close enough to eat off the person's plate next to me or stand in a three-block line for a dog (but I have heard duck fat fries are ridiculous). Anyway... Lunch at this small restaurant (orders taken at the counter) was nothing short of a surprise. I was thinking it was going to be something I didn't like with fried plantains on the side. I was completely wrong. I ordered the Cubano (Cuban ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard) which is essentially, in my eyes, an American club minus the bacon. It was a wonderful twist on my staple sandwich. My weekend warrior ordered the Ropa Vieja (Shredded beef in creole sauce) which was tender and juicy. An order of crispy fries and a chorizo Empanada to share was the perfect compliment to our sandwiches. Now I have to say I only tried a lunch sandwich so maybe I didn't get the full taste of Cuban fare but it's something to put on my to-do list. I think a dinner plate will fill that order. Minus 1 star for the dining area which is cramped BUT the food certainly makes up for it. I would be a bit turned off if we had to take our food to go and most likely eat in the car. All in all: two sandwiches, fries, an empanada and two drinks for just over 20 bucks is a price I can deal with. Worth every penny!
