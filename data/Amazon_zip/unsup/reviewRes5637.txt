Been here lots of times the last few months. Still love it! Get the steak. Get the proscuitto bread balls. Get wine by the bottle. I wish they took reservations! I usually have to wait to get a table, very crowded. At least they were kind enough to send a server around the place to see if anyone who was waiting needed a drink!
