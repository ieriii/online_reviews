Superdawg is a fast food and cultural victory. It's covered in nostalgia, character and grease.  I get the Double Whoompie Burger on dark bread. I don't live in the area and I miss their burgers that I never order anything else.  I don't think I can recommend it for tourists b/c fast food joints are a pretty obscure fetish, but if you're a Chicagoan, you have to take a ride out there. Superdawg is a truly unique and excellent fast food place.  I'm not a big fan of eating in the car, so I find a seat at their counter.
