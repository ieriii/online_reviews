I figure I should review Zed451 while the Brazilian meat is still warm in my tummy. Zed's is a cool looking joint, lots of natural wood and an ultra modern feel. They have large fires places all around to keep you warm in toasty; if you close your eyes you may feel like you are in Brazil... just for a second. Then you snap back to the reality of the icy tundra that currently surrounds you. About 15 of my coworkers went to Zed451 for some fine meats and drinks. Let me tell you, this place does not disappoint. They have a large round salad bar in the center of the restaurant with plenty of goodies to snack on. I enjoyed the sweet potatoes and the ravioli.  After you enjoy the salad bar some protein right to your table! The waiters come around and feed you all sorts of meats. You get to use tongs to take the meat right off their spit. I enjoyed most of the dishes, but my favorites were the salmon and the swordfish ...mmmmm I had a banana split for desert... pretty good.  If money is no object, this is a place to visit.
