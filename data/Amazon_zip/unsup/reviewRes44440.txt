Why would you go to Starbucks when this is right across the street? I have to say though - I'm pretty sure you have to be hungover to work here. Which obviously isn't a problem with me. 4 stars...  Oh wait, I'm obsessed with the cakes in the window. I have no idea how they make them with such detail - especially hungover like that.
