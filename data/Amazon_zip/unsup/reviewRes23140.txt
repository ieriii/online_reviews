I'm not the biggest superdawg fan because it hasn't blown my mind. But that's no reason why not to visit. It's more of an experience than a great meal. I'm sure that I'll visit again I'm sure. i just feel it's more of a 3 star establishment. Maybe if I go back, the next time it'll be higher stars but from my experiences it's just alright. They've got a lot more ice cream selection than most other fast food or hot dog places would. Including shakes AND malts. They have a butt ton of entrees including shrimp, cod, steak, chicken strips, sausage (on a bun) and good ol' burgers and grilled cheese. Besides your onion rings, fries and all of that they also have battered and fried veggies (one of my faves) and tamales (reminds me of old Bumpkins. All this fatty American food and then...tamales.) Whats cute about this place is that its' old, but still in great shape, nostalgic for a lot of people, and there's nothing else that I know of people think of in Chicago when they look at dressed up hot dogs than Superdawg. It's worth a visit, but a tad overpriced because of the hype.
