We call this place Sultan's Mother because i misread the sign once and it stuck. It's like the really good bar food that happens to be middle eastern in nature: not the best, but good enough when yer hungry and empty-pocketed. I think the problem is lack of competition. Yes, they are good, but not great. here my short list of issues: Tahini. It's crap. Foodervice tahini. Cucumber sauce ( forgot how to spell szetsiki sauce ro whatever). Chunky, usually with half-spent undrained watery raw cucumber chunks. Rooster sauce. Now, i love it as much as anyone. Pho sure. But it doesn't BELONG HERE. and it just bugs me that no one in wicker park seems to notice how cheap these guys are being cause they don;t know any better. Overall, i think that 70 percent of the menu at least comes packaged or canned or bottled, and the result is bleh meh bleh. Unless, of course, you've never had real crap lebanese or even been to Europe and dined from a gyro cart. It gets two stars for being tasty, and another for the handy shoppe items it sells. But it's a bitter three stars.
