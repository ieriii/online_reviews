I sit here, the morning after Wildfire, full, stuffed with food. I look at my family, they too are stuffed with food. No one wants me to cook them breakfast, as each groans about being stuffed with food. A lot of good eggs are going to go to waste. In search of a moderately priced downtown "nice" restaurant for ribs, Wildfire was picked and experienced. Walking over, walking up to it's giant sign, clubbers and tourists smoking outside, I frantically tried to find another place on my phone. It was too late, my party was being seated, the experience was to begin. And here, all seemed to relax and my fears of being in a fancy franchise changed. Orders of drinks, ribs and sides were placed and although some predictability remained, those ribs were really good. The sides were fresh and the sauce was plentiful. The St. Louis ribs had an enjoyable blend of herbs that made it stand out more than the normal BBQ, and to try both, get the Ribs & Ribs for a half slab of both. One side per dinner, along with cole slaw and apple sauce, all you need. Dessert was ice cream covering a plate of a cookie. Yes, the food was good, but as some have said, it's filling but with predictable flavors. The smells are good, they pull you in and the food is ready to go. At this point, it's all subjective in opinion... To me, a fancy franchise like these are smoke and mirrors. You get what you hope for, but surrounded in a decor of kitch-filled deco. It's nice, it's fun, but you've seen it before in this large space filled with eaters. The waiters and bus boys run around getting people in, getting them out, so they can get off as well. Although satisfied with the food overall experience, I know better can be found for the same price elsewhere...a thought that couldn't slip from me.  Good food, but my goal now is to find richer flavors from ribs in a one of a kind place.
