I went to Carnivale the other night for a cocktail reception. The food we had was great and the drinks, wow! I've never had a mojito before but I can tell you that the raspberry one was to die for. The decor was awesome. So funky and colorful, you had to smile while you were there.  I can't wait to go back to try their actual menu, but I really can't wait to go back so I can have their raspberry mojitos. - Dec. '06 Well I went back to Carnivale to try their food. The decor was still great and the waitstaff was quite friendly, but I'm not in love with their food. The empanadas, now those were fantastic. I got the braised short ribs, it was okay. Other people at the table got some vegetarian dish, they seemed to like it well enough. Another set of people got some pork shoulder that was apparently great, so I suppose it was just my dinner that wasn't great. The other thing I didn't know, was how expensive it was. I suppose that's because I didn't have to pay for anything when I was there for a work function, but I'm not quite sure I'd go back because it was so expensive and I didn't love the food. Is it worth trying once, sure as long as you're prepared to spend some money. - May '07
