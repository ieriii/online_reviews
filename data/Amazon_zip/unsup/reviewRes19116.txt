"I expect to have Rick Bayless make my food!", my boyfriend sarcastically remarks while we stand in the long line, after the hostess informed us that it would be at least a half hour wait for a seat. Just then, who appears but Mr. Bayless himself, sampling some sauces behind the counter, with the hustle and bustle of all the workers. Aside from the wait, the entire experience was great! We were greeted immediately by the hostess, with a smile and while we waited, we had access to both tap and soda water, with straws and freshly cut limes (something I greatly appreciate). The lady who took our order was especially warm and polite and we were immediately taken to our counter. We shared the special of the day (pork belly torta), which was amazingly tender and juicy and ended our meal with the churros with the chocolate dipping sauce. Definitely a place I would recommend!
