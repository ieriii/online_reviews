I had been meaning to try Mayan Palace for sometime now and finally went a couple of weeks ago. My friend and I went in the early afternoon when they weren't as crowded. I usually ride by and just see the place packed at night time. There were 3 other customers besides ourselves which already had their food so we knew our order would be quick, especially since we both ordered the Vegetarian Enchiladas which were awesome! Before that came we simply had the chips with salsa and their really good guacamole with horchata. All was really great and I loved the service and the cool Mayan Calenders and decor. Yea, I'll definitely go back.
