It's a bad thing that this place is so close to my house because I have a secret addiction to their cupcakes!!! They're just so moist and yummy and come in wonderful flavors. Anytime I have guests over I pick up dozen or so of these cupcakes in various flavors and they always turn out to be a hit. Also not to mention, whenever I have out of town guests visiting I always make sure to take them to Alliance so they can see all the pretty cakes in the window.. my favorite being the hamburger cake! Now if I could only convince one of my friends to get me a cake from Alliance for my birthday......
