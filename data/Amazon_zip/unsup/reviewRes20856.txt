What a great irish pub and restaurant. The drinks are fantastic with a lot of choices on the beer menu. Billy the owner is one of those great owners who walks around and really talks to people to see what is working and what is not. He is also a great joke teller, so be sure to ask him to share one of his favorites with you. I love lamb and they had some great lamb dishes. I go there every time I can when heading to downtown Chicago on business. The decor is great too. Not the touristy type place normally on the busy Michigan ave restaurant list. Try it!
