The pizza is okay but I've had better at some of the other pizza joints in Chicago. My family and I got extremely excited to see Toasted Ravioli on the menu...however, they were filled with cheese-- not beef! (Which would have been nice to know before we ordered them) Our server was not friendly at all.... he didn't seem interested in us at all and we constantly had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. Basically any other pizza place in Chicago is better than Gino's East or maybe just this particular location.
