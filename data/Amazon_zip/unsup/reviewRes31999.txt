Came here with a Groupon, which turned out to be a very good deal! I've had Ethiopian a few times before, but this was definitely the best I've had so far! The sambosa's rival any Indian samosa I've ever had, and the Honey wine was unique and not too sweet. The main dishes were all very well seasoned and properly cooked. Despite other reviews, our service was very quick, although the restaurant was basically empty at 5pm on a Saturday.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially those hesitant to try African cuisine. The only warning I would give, (and the reason for 1 less star) would be the possible after effects on one's stomach.
