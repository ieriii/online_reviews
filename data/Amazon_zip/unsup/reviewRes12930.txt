I have now been to this restaurant for breakfast twice and I was extremely happy both times. I love the outdoor patio and the artistic flair and ambiance inside the restaurant. if its been a tough week and you want something stronger than coffee on a Sunday morning, it appears that their bar is well-equipped and busy. I settled for coffee and had the Eggs Ala Cubana, which I thought was heavenly. It's just eggs, made to order, along with rice, plantains and black beans - very tasty!.  Their coffee is good too and I am extremely picky. I also had the hazelnut gelato for dessert - absolutely one of the best gelatos I have ever had.
