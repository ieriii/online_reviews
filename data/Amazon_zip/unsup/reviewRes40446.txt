This place makes me wish I lived in Chicago (well, almost.) It def makes me want to visit more. Knowing this place exists, I will never wrap up a trip to Chicago without a visit to Longman and Eagle. Looking forward to the next time I can sit in the amazing bar room, eat amazing food and drink amazing drinks. Ohh Longman... how I long for you...
