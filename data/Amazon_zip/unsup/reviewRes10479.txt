I know we're in Chicago but thin crust pizza rocks my freakin' socks off. It's nothing I would order for carry out but it's a great place to meet up for beer and pretty decent thin crust. No, it's not award winning pizza but the atmosphere when you're with the right group is what makes this place 4 star worthy. The staff is friendly and there are lots of tables. I dropped in once during the karaoke nights but it was a bit much for me I wasn't expecting to see such die hard fans.. and so many. I do like that they have a live band though. If I ever get drunk enough, maybe I'll do it. One thing that I really wasn't a fan of is how packed the place can get. I need a little space... especially when eating. I'll be back, it's easy to plan a group outing, they have a decent list of specialty beers, and the pizza ain't too bad either.
