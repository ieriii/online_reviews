Woohoo I love Brunch places...but my one problem with them: the wait. Seriously, open up more brunch places, they're obviously popular! A friend and I went at about 11:25 on a Saturday. We waited until about 12:10. Kind of annoying. However we were smart and stopped at Starbuck's for a drink for our walk and to sip on while we waited. Once we were seated we sat at the counter. Our waiter was extremely pleasant but our food order took FOREVER. I know it's busy but people who sat down next to us AFTER us got their food a good 15-20 minutes before us. We both ordered Frittatas w/ the Yolk pancakes. I got the Tuscan Frittata and it was delicious. Too much goat cheese, but great flavor. My banana yolk pancakes were to die for. Best part of the meal. Since our food took so long our waiter graciously gave us a free nutelle crepe w/ strawberries. It was a perfect ending to a fun brunch. Yolk is worth a visit. Just be patient and go with an appetite :)
