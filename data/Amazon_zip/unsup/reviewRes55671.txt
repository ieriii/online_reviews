Went there yesterday with my beau. I ordered the shrimp po' boy and the beau ordered prime rib sandwich. We both split the tomato/red pepper bisque...AMAZING!!! I couldn't finish my food and the beau was too hungover to eat his....I enjoyed mine and he enjoyed his later. We've also been there for breakfast. It can get pretty busy, but the wait is never really long. The servers were fast moving and friendly. Our server yesterday kept forgetting the hot chocolate we ordered...it was actually kind of funny, since we saw another server throw the first one away, then our server made another, but she forgot again...not holding that against her though. I am a server too, and sometimes you just forget.great place for breakfast!!
