I love Calo. Why? - Their kitchen is open until midnight during the week. - It is pretty close to Evanston. A short drive at least... and at 11pm, I don't even need their free lot with all the empty space on the street. - Medium thin crust pizza with mushrooms and garlic cut into squares. I am always stealing all the edge pieces and working out my arms with the shakers. I love this pizza. - Stuffed gnocchi to go with that pizza? Sure! - Lots to choose from on the menu. Last night I didn't feel like my usual pizza/pasta combo and had the minestrone (so good!) and the insalata de pesce has plenty of delicious marinated seafood. Their specials menu is always fun to look at. - Friendly servers and even friendlier bussers. - Nice wide booths. - Did I mention that they're open late? As in, my other options include White Castle/Burger King/McDonalds.... and I'm eating gorgonzola stuffed gnocchi and drinking grapefruit juice with some soda bubbles at Calo?! Dangerous for my wallet but amazing nonetheless.
