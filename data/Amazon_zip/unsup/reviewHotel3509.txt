I have to start off by saying this hotel made me want to extend my stay in Chicago. The room rate was pretty comparable to other hotels in the area. They also have special web rates if you book directly with them. Parking is $51 a day with in and out privileges. The bellmen were great and helpful. The gentlemen at the front desk were extremely polite and helpful. He even asked if we wanted an upgrade to a 2 bed room which my cousin and i turned down at first not knowing how small Chicago rooms were. The 1 bed room was pretty and all but my cousin and i needed a little more space considering that we were going to go shopping. We called front desk to see if it would be a hassle to change rooms and it wasn't a problem. The 2 bed room was much roomier. I would recommend the 1 bed for a couple. The cocktails were excellent and the lounge/ restaurant. Also , the location is in perfect walking distance from everything (landmarks, shops, eateries).
