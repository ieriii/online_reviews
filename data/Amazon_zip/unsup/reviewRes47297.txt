Burgers here are fantastic. They're not nearly as big as Kuma's but this place is more about quality than quantity. The flavors are amazing. They have incredible sauces but some of the burgers are so good without adding any sauce. They stand so well on their own. Everyone working there was really cool, too. Definitely need to try this place out.
