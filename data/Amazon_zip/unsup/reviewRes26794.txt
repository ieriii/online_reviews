Went yesterday when the restaurant was packed with a mix of locals and a few Northsiders for Sunday dinner. The line moved quickly and we were able to be seated in the back room. The menu includes all the traditional favorites, authentic breakfast items, soups and lots of pork and steak main dishes at cheap prices. I wish I would have ordered something different than the mole but then again, it wasn't bad. Just not the best and spicy enough (I know mole isn't spicy per say, so I mean smokey and full of various spice flavors besides chocolate. Loved every minute of the warm atmosphere and the food was quality. Warning, this place is a diet buster where not even the fajitas are healthy. No complaints here. Hits: - Pre-appetizers of pork and beans, corn tortillas and pickled vegetables that they serve in addition to chips and salsa. - Nachos: Individual chips stacked high with cheese and guac. Add some salsa verde and jalapeno and it's like having a plate of perfect gringo nachos. - Barbacoa pork: Tender and well seasoned shredded pork that wasn't too fatty like they often serve elsewhere. Misses: - Pollo con mole: Too sweet and not spicy enough mole sauce for my taste. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender however. Bottom line: Great introduction to authentic Mexican food in Pilsen. The staff is approachable and easy to please. I can't wait to come back and try something new like the tacos de machacado (shredded beef scrambled with eggs) and pork chop options.
