Went here for an early dinner with my mother over the weekend on a Sunday. We came at off hours were they were no longer serving their buffet style brunch, and the place was empty. At first my mom seemed aprehensive because if a place is empty it can't be too good. I forced her to stay and she doesn't regret it. We started with the empanada sampler. Nothing too special there, but it cam out warm and our waiter Carlos was one of the friendliest people, and was willing to take the time to explain everything to my mother. We both had the steak for dinner with sangria to drink. I had my steak medium and loved it. Prepaired perfectly and good till the last bite, which i had to eat the next day due to how big it was. Not sure how my mom had hers, but she said she loved the steak and took the leftovers for my dad.  Finished with some columbian coffee which was fresh and savory as well. My mom already wants to go back and take more people to share this place.
