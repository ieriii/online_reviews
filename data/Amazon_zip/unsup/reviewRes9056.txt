The food, atmosphere and wait staff were fantastic. The front of house, however, was just terrible. We showed up on-time for our Sunday night reservation and we were told we would need to wait at the bar upstairs but not to worry - the current table is on dessert. THIRTY minutes later, someone finally came to get us and without any sort of explanation or apology, we were seated. I would have hoped for a check-in at some point, maybe a complimentary cocktail while we waited, or at the very least, an apology.
