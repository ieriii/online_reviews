Meat!! Thats all I can say. The best meat that you will ever taste! I had my first experience here in Chicago at Fogo de Chao and I absolutely love it. It was a great experience. I never knew there were so many types of meat. The Filet Mignon was my favorite. The restaurant is very pricy, so come with a huge appetite. The mashed potatoes were also very delicious that they give you, but the main focus is definitely the meat.
