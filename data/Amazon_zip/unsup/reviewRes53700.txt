I went to Hot Doug's for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing! I didn't even get one of the exotic dogs, I got a regular steamed hot dog with mustard, relish, and onions. It was delicious! I also had the cheese fries, YUM! I tried the Duck fat fries too, which were also tasty.It is so cool that they have different kinds of sausages every day. Even though there is a giant line every day, it is totally worth it!
