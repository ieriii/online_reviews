Love, love, love this place! It's right next door to my vet's office so when we bring the puppy there we stop at 90 Miles Cafe. The food is so good, especially the guava and cream cheese pastry! Not to mention the food is inexpensive. Get the papas fritas too!The owner is such a nice guy, everyone seems to be having a great time, and you can't help but shake it to the music while you're waiting for your food! I will definitely be making the trip
