Recipe for the perfect Bears Game Sunday: Step 1-- My brother and I park the car at a parking garage on 11th St .and State St. because it is only $12 for the whole day and we know the car is safe and won't get jacked. Step 2-- We walk Michigan Ave and Yolk for brunch. I order a delicious omelet, my brother orders a hearty steak and egg breakfast. We load up on a ton of caffeine and yummy OJ. Service is a little slow, but the ambiance in the restaurant is great for people-watching and getting pumped for a football game. Step 3-- Walk across Grant Park to Soldier Field and get rowdy cheering on the Bears. In a perfect world, the quarterback (take your pick of three) has a decent game and doesn't throw an interception and the defense is completely healthy. Going to Yolk for brunch is our new tradition before a Bears game. If you don't have a parking pass to tailgate, heading to Yolk is the next best thing-- the food is great and I haven't had bad service there. Plus, you don't have a 2 hour wait like some of the brunch places in the city. I'll be at Yolk on Sunday before the Bears take on the Packers, so you might see me there!
