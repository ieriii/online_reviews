i don't think i ever stopped sipping the oatmeal shake. and being vegan it's a bit more difficult to find something so good that you miss. i consider myself lucky to jump off the el stop that i get off at and make the five minute walk there and sip the oatmeal shake (nonstop) on my 20 minute walk home. so good.
