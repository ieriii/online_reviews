I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. As a bar it sucks. The music is typical and awful. You look at the decor and expect a chill, on-the-quieter-side lounge type place and what you get a noisy, annoying sports/clubby type bar with the post-college, on-the-prowl types, not my scene, yuck! For a place named after such a cool writer/social figure it leaves much to be desired in the way of a bar.  But the food is a different story entirely! The flavors are great! The portions are huge! The preparation is lovely and thoughful! The whiskey coated corned beef was excellent and the whiskey touch was unexpected and delightful. The curried chips (fries) were great, really good flavor and authentic. The chicken curry dish was great! I was shocked to get such a well done, authentically Irish curry at this place. And the fish and chips have a great batter on them, nice and thick, and are thankfully served with malt vinegar. Again, all of this was a surprise! Kudos to them for having a real Irish cider in the oversized bottles. Service was also great. I would give them 5 stars if not for the terrible bar. Hopefully they will come to their senses and make it what it should be!
