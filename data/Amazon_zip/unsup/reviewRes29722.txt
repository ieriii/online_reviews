Man I love this place! The staff is extremely helpful, which is great because my friend had just started to work his way into a vegan diet. Any questions you have, they will answer. I am not vegan or vegetarian, but I think I am at heart. This place makes me second guess my decisions for eating meat. The burgers are phenomenal and have a great variety. The side dishes are wonderful and my favorite is the veggies. They are sauteed in a pesto sauce. Prices are right for what you are getting on your plate. They also have a great bottled beer selection! Those are expensive, but they're microbrews mostly, so what do you expect? If you're trying out the vegan/veggie thing, I would come here first. If you're not and you're curious as to what this stuff is in place of meat, I would come here. Enjoy!
