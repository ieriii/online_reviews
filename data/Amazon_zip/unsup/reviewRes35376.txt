Asian BBQ FTW. Love this place. I travel to Argyle just to get roast pork and roast duck. I can get $10 worth of meat and it'll last me 1 week! Can't beat that deal. This place is always busy, so the meat never sits around. The skin on the roast pork is so crispy. The duck is succulent. I eat it by itself and sometimes, I use the leftovers and sautee it with Chinese broccoli. We've eaten in the restaurant as well and the service was good. They're so quick that we didn't have to wait for a table for a long time.
