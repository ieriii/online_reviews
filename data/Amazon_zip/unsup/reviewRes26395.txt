I really dont enjoy Chinese food since the flavor is really based on grease and soy sauce. Thai food isnt that bad but its just becoming boring so we decided to try Vietnamese but really didnt want to go way up north for it. So we ended up with Simply It. As we entered we tried to look for a menu posted at the door but couldnt find any and with some hesitation tried to go inside when a girl behind us said ITS GOOD. ITS REALLY GOOD! So we just walked in and immediately got seated. The place is not so big, nice clean simple, i like it. Tables were filled. We had our fresh coconut (it couldnt be fresher than that) they actually served the fruit itself. For appetizer we had the chicken wrapped avocado and mango salsa. For entree I had the coconut and mango beef and bf had grilled salmon noodle (if u want healthy dish this is it). Everything was yummy. good portions and flavorful Will definitely be back when I crave for some asian food.
