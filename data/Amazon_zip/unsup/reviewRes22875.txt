Came here for my birthday on a gorgeous Chicago day. The patio is great, tables,chairs,and a Dj, thats all I need I thought I was at a backyard house party :) I should of went authentic but I didn't,so I played it safe don't know why. So my lovely dinner started out with of course chips and salsa,guacamole and some weird rice beans and chopped up pork stuff. So sorry for not knowing the names of what I was eatting, Ha !Ha! I order the empanada's, one spinach and cheese,the other zucchini, last but not least cheese and a side order of there black beans and rice. The empanada's were good, the zucchini and spinach were great, cheese a bit bland. Rice and beans off the Hezzzzy ! Last but not least a lovely cool glass of white wine.Oh yah and the gorgeous company I was eatting with.What more could I have ask for that day.Thank you Irazu for making my b-day awesome and thank you company for being awesome.Sorry for making it a b-day review :(
