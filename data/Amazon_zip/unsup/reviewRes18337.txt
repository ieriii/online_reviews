We'd seen this place featured on CBS Sunday Morning a while back, an article dedicated to XOCO's hot chocolates. My wife made me promise that we'd visit on our next trip to Chicago. I'm glad we did! XOCO is not the high end, trendy spot you'd expect (having seen it on a national TV show, and with Rick Bayliss's name attached to it) - it was much more like a comfy little hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant that happens to have extraordinary hot chocolates. This was ideal for us, as we were on our way to the Cub's home opener, and weren't dressed for anything upscale. As it turned out, the huevos rancheros were outstanding! (Mind you, I learned how to eat huevos rancheros in New Mexico, home of the really authentic stuff.) For our chocolate fix, we each got the Almendrado (hot chocolate with almond milk). I'll admit I was surprised at how complex the flavors were! The next time we're in Chicago, I'll put this place high on my list for either lunch or dinner - I'd love to try some of their bigger meals.
