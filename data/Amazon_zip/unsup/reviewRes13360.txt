Wow, this place is tasty. I went here with my girlfriend after hearing about it on the Food Network. I have lived less than 3 blocks away from this place and have never visited it before today! We got there around 3 and were huuuungry. We ordered their Alaskan King Crab Dip for an appetizer and it was unbelievable. It was $10 and was well worth the price. It was filled with lumps of crab and there was a ton o' dip. We even had some left over! For linner, I had their early bird dinner special, where I got salad, soup, a 1/2 pound of fresh fish, vegetable, and their a-ma-zing potato pancake all for $13.95! I chose the tilapia for my fish and it was coated in Apple Jack Cereal! I was surprised at first, but it was absolutely delicious and made for the perfect touch of sweet/crunchy. It also happened to be perfectly cooked. My lady friend got the Po Boy made with fresh perch. God, it was good, too. I say yay to Glenn's!! Tasty tasty fun time.
