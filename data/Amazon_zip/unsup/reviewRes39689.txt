I've never had Korean BBQ before, so I was excited to have a chance to try it with some fellow Yelpers . . . I had no idea what all the little dishes that accompanied the meat were, but was happy to try a few with a little guidance from others around the table. The food was incredible! And there was something fun about cooking the meat yourself, which has a nice marinade -- flavorful but not overpowering.  I think I ended up eating waaay more meat than anything else because it was so tasty!!  The staff is not overly attentive, but they do respond promptly when you have a request -- me for a fork and more napkins, for example. (I do wish they had more napkins at the table.)  More waitstaff would help this place do even better (then again, maybe I don't want it to be even more popular -- then it would be impossible to get a table!). The best part? The price. With tip, only $17/person, and there were even a couple of entrees on the table in addition to the BBQ. Amazing. One major drawback -- you can't linger. The place is packed, even for an early dinner of 6pm on a Saturday (which is typically really early in Chicago on weekends). They will ask you to move it along if you sit too long after paying your bill, which doesn't bother me -- If I were waiting for a table I'd want the staff to encourage people to mosey on!! I definitely will go back to this place (athough I might bring my own supply of napkins, just so I have plenty!)
