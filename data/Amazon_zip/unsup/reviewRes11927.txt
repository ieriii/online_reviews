I love Bongo Room. I hate the wait on the weekends so I typically go at odd times or during the week. I love the breakfast burrito and greek benedict. Honestly great savory choices. People often only talk about the dessert-like super sweet stuff, but there are plenty of great choices no matter what type of breakfast food you like. Portions are big, so come hungry.
