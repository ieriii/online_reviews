My fiancee and I celebrated the night we were engaged with a stay at the Dana. The front desk guy kindly upgraded us to a corner king room with a city facing view. It was GORGEOUS! If I could wake up there every single morning for the rest of my life with that view--I'd die a happy lady! Back story, we're hotel snobs. Even in our home city, we've stayed in nearly all of the higher end hotels for "stay-cations." While the Dana has a great location and very nice rooms, it's only drawback is that it's starting to show a little bit of wear and tear around the edges. Little scuffs and nicks are easy to clean up by maintenance staff, but really go a long way to keeping the hotel looking "nice and new." I love the fact that they have little bags of goodies on the nightstand for mini bar treats. Most hotels offer the same stiff and boring goodies, pretzels...mix nuts...cookies...BLAH! Forget that! The Dana has gummy bears, chocolate covered dried fruit, chocolate covered cookies, toffee squares...you name it! YUM! The shower was also one of my favorite features, it's glass wall faces the bed. So, you can get a place to sleep and a show! HAH! Bed was super comfy and I love the decor. Dana...we might just see you again!
