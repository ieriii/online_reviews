I wish I could have more to write about this place, but unfortunately it was merely alright. The crepes were good and the service was OK, but it wasn't anything that made me want to come back. I had the Chicago Crepe and another person in our group had one of the sweet crepes (which was very tasty as a desert, but a little too sweet for a meal).
