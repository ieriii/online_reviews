note I am reviewing the dinner. I've been to the buffalo grove location for lunch buffet several times and have had no problems. However there is no buffet for dinner so you have to order off the menu. We split the samosas and butter chicken (chicken in creamy butter sauce). The samosas were OK because it is hard to screw up fried food. The butter chicken was a bit of a stunner, it was 15 bucks and pretty small. Also the entrees do not come with rice or additional naan (they give you 1 basket to start, I guess they charge for other baskets, as we found out at the end of the meal). If you add it up, 1 dish and rice is about 25 bucks after tax/tip. That's pretty pricey and I cannot endorse that, especially when I've had great Indian meals at other restaurants for less. In conclusion I assume the lunch buffet is good but for dinner, I suspect I can probably do better.
