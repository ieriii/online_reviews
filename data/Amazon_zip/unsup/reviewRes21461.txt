What a nice little place that I've overlooked for so many years. Mexican is my favorite cuisine, so I've promised myself I'll try a new place every time I crave it. Mayan Palace was clean, not too cramped, had cute decor, friendly service, stiff drinks and great food. Our waiter was the sweetest thing and always made sure we had everything we needed. He was sure to make suggestions when we couldn't make up our minds. LOVED their Sangria, it was stiff and flavorful. My friend tried their Mojito and said something was missing (she's the Mojito snob though). I wanted to try a Margarita next because they claim to be "World's Best" so I wanted to try the Jamaica Flower and they were all out, so the waiter suggested the Tamarind and that was very sweet...but awesome. I tried the combination platter #1 with one Taco, one Tostada and one cheese Enchilada. Loved everything, but I wasn't a fan for the sauce on the Enchilada. My friend tried the combination platter #2 which had one Taco, one Tamale, and one Chile Relleno, The Chile Relleno had a kick to it and the Tamale was awesome...love Tamales. Overall, I'm so glad I stopped by because I'll be back.
