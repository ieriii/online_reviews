the deep dish pizza is phenomenal. i dont think i will ever order it from any other place again. it was sooooooooooo good. i cant even describe. the sauce was tasty and tomatoey, the cheese was oozing and gooey and salty. the crust while a bit soggy was doughy and just thick enough to balance out the other flavors. YUM!!! unfortunately, our server seemed like he was on crack. it was busy. so i'll blame it on the fact of the holiday weekend and non-stop customers. but he damn near sat my wine down on my arm he was moving so fast. i didnt even see his face. im like "wow. speedy gonzalez. come up for air". i see many of the other reviews agree. maybe its hard for them to keep good staff. oh well... the pizza was good enough for me not to care- which is rare for me. so i will be back.
