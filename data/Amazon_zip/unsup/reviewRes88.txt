Maybe four and a half would be more appropriate. I can say that even with the hype and price tag, Alinea did not let me down. We were fortunate enough to get placed on the wait list on a Tuesday and received a call back for dinner that Thursday night at 10:00. Based on my eavesdropping, there were a few tables in from out of town that had much more difficulty getting a reservation. The evening started a little oddly as the person that seated us was a bit pushy in trying to get us to do the wine tasting and kind of steered my wife into ordering one of their cocktails. Since we both had early mornings the next day, we opted against the pairing. At that point, I just asked for a beer and got the stink eye. They honestly made it seem like they had one beer left somewhere and that they would kindly dust it off for me. Thank you for my $12 dusty beer! Luckily, things picked up after that. The dishes have all been pretty documented. I will say that the seafood plate, the potato soup, and the truffle explosion were very memorable. Some others were just ok. There were two that I could take or leave. All in all, I'm glad we came. As the night wore on, I think the servers loosened up and made it feel less formal and more fun. We definitely had a great time. I thikn if you're considering trying it out, just go. It's an experience.
