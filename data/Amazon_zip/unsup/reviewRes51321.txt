I've been eating here for about 10 years. Probably only because they're the best in the AREA that serves liquor. I'm not a huge fan of their salsa... kinda mushy and vommity looking =( Definitely, not the best mexican I've ever had, but in Lincoln Square theres not too many options to choose from. The food is so-so but they make killer Margaritas... which keeps me coming back :) OH yes... and their Caldo De Pollo is SOOOO delicious.. I WILL VOUCH for that. Its HUGE & only costs like 6-7 bucks. Awesome on these cold Autumn evenings
