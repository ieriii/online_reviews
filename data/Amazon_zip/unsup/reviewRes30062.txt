It would be easy enough, if not understandable, to mistake 3rd Coast Cafe for a strictly formal Gold Coast posh spot. The atmosphere, not to mention location at the swank intersection of Dearborn and Goethe, are certainly enough to suggest a decidedly high-end experience. But while 3CC may attract an upper-class clientele, it also provides a surprisingly relaxed, casual atmosphere -- one that may not become apparent until seated. The menu varies, covering a wide range of entries and appetizers. For those looking for a light meal, the grilled cheese is bar-none the best in Chicago; you'd swear it was grilled in sunshine, not better. Those arriving with a more serious hunger will obviously be looking for something more substantial, which is where the spicy penne pasta with chicken comes in. Add bacon bits for over the top flavor -- provided you don't have a heart condition. And top the whole thing off with a massive, multi-scoop brownie sundae, with non-traditional sundae scoops of mint and coffee ice cream. Given the quality and portions of their servings, 3rd Coast can come across on the more expensive side. Luckily, every bite is worth it. And you'd be hard pressed to find a more inviting location in the entire Gold Coast.
