I've been coming to Sushi-X for years now. It was my favorite under the radar sushi joints, but I think half off all sushi rolls for happy hour from Sunday - Wednesday put them back on the scene. I was especially happy when they had opened a Diversey since it's in my parents hood, but unfortunately, they recently sold that location. They also changed their happy hour to two days a week. It's still one of my favorite sushi places even if just for their Double Stack roll (three types of fish, chili oil, cilantro, pepper, avocado and spicy mayo) and the hearty vegetarian Buddha roll (you won't miss the fish) served with their house made ginger dressing. I'd also recommend the Thai Stick roll and the Pollo Loco as well as the wasabi garlic mashed potatoes.  Also, this place is BYOB - even better! Only downside is that the dining room sometimes feel a bit like a club with loud music and very dim lighting, but the last time it seemed like they corrected both of these issues. Oh - and come early for happy hour sushi!
