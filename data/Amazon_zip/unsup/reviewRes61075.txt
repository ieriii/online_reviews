First off, my husband and I love the food. It is not important to us that some dishes are not authentic, all we care about is that the food taste deliciouso, margaritas is really good, prices are reasonable and it is very convenient for us to stop by after work when we feel lazy to cook at home. The location is also very nice with other small shops in the Lincoln Square strip. However, there is a certain waiter that we always wish wld not be our server, unfortunately we are not always in luck and the latest incident was I thought very annoying and worthy of sharing (thus the 3 stars only rating). This guy is unbelievable. We order a pitcher of margarita right after the bus boy serves us the usual salsa and chips. We are on our 2nd salsa and chips and still no margaritas. In the meantime, we see our waiter taking orders from various customers who has just come in and taking checks. After we were getting full with all the chips and salsa we had consumed, my hubby finally asled him about our drinks. He then went over to the bar w/c was literaly next to our table. Our drinks were stting there all this time (12 min. wait), and guess what, not one apology from this guy. Ofcourse after dinner, he was quick to serve our check and came back for it 3 times until my husband finally put the pitcher on top of it in full view as the pitcher was only half empty. My husband is usualy very generous with his tips for he has worked as a waiter once, but this time, he made his displeasure felt.
