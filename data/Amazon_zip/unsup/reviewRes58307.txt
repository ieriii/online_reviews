The food looked real pretty but....I'll start with the dessert. I ordered a piece of carrot cake that looked like it was going to be something that stopped my heart with bliss. Well, no real eggs in it and no milk and no processed sugar - oh my god, it tasted like crap! I almost cried.Radichio salad is good, though the dressings have always been rather bland to me-pretty disapointing. I don't know how they managed to mess up oil and vinegar but they did.I had a very pretty but disapointing lasagna in there once, and a noodle with mock beef dish - again, oh so pretty but so disapointing in taste! So bland!Here's what I think: If you are a diaabetic or you have food allergies, okay, I can see you eating this stuff. But if you don't have a problem like that, don't do this to yourself! Unless you hate food in the first place or have a martyrdom complex. Sorry for my mouthiness, it cost so much and tasted so bad I think Im still in shock from the experience.
