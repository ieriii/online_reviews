It was good, but not as good as I expected...faulted again for overly high expectations! nooooo!  I had one of the specials - the Caribbean Goat sausage. Sounded great, and the actual sausage was great...just wasn't that much of a fan of the mystery cheese on it. Kind of ruined it for me, but the meat saved the day I guess...no, the duck fat fries saved it. They were outstanding. Everyone else I was with loved their meal too. We arrived at 10am, they opened at 10:30 and I'm pretty sure we were eating by 11am. Not bad for a Saturday morning!
