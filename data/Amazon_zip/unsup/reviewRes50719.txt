Great food, good service worth the trip and expense! The ambiance is wonderfully lush with Louisiana style backdrops and well balanced in their use of whites and colors to give the place an authentic look. That being said, the food, the flavor, the overall experience was just divine. Service was prompt and extremely helpful. While the service was great and the food lived up to it promise of authentic creole cuisine. the gumbo ya-ya itself had a borderline dark-burnt roux which gave the dish a unique positive flavor. i just wish they didnt burn my andouille sausage in the process. top it off with a wonderful ice cream desert i forgot what it's called but it had ginger ice cream, peach sauce and a bunch of other delicious goodies.
