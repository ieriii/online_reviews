I enjoy the pho they serve here. The service is really fast. It gets really pack and busy when I went at night and in the morning. It is especially jam packed at night, so go a little earlier. Sometimes it gets hard to find parking as well so you would have to park pretty far, but I think its worth it. Portions are perfect for me and they have great service. I also had a drink there, however I did not like it so much because it was a little too sweet for me. For those we likes sweet, then it would be perfect/ Pricing is fair, food is yummy, and great service.
