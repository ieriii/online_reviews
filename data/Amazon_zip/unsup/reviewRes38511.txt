Out of the two most popular pizza places in Chicago, I personally prefer Giordano's. This is Chicago style pizza at it's best. The fried mozzarella was good and the pizza was even better. I think it's the cheese that made the difference. Aside from a good New York pie, this is my favorite pizza. Try it!
