With limited breakfast options, we decided on Grand Lux for convenience sake. It is packed from the moment they open, but we snagged a high top at the bar with no waiting. The service was OK, and the menu is so gigantic there is something for everyone - plus they serve weekend brunch until 2. Looking back, I think going with pancakes, or waffles would have been a better option. Two of us had scrambled eggs and egg breakfast sammy with hash browns and both were just OK. Everything was extra gooey, maybe butter, or oil, or lard? Just too coated in whatever it was - but the passing plates of breakfast carb loads looked delicious! And somehow we passed up the beignets?!? Don't make that mistake! However we did make up for the fatal error by ordering the baked to order open face apple pie with homemade ice cream..mmmmmm..... Easy location, solid food, and reasonable prices makes this a place to stop if you're nearby, but nothing to seek out just skip the eggs!
