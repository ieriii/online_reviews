It's about time I reviewed Calo. The first time I went here was in '97 or '98. My friends and I stumbled upon it while searching for the Neo-Futurarium. Back in the day, Calo had a live band that featured a female vocalist in a one-piece pantsuit, as well as a Casio synthesizer (maybe more than one). I can't remember what the food was like, but I got really into the band... Before I moved to Andersonville, I ordered thin crust pizza (the Chicago special) from Calo all the time. It's really good. Since I moved to the hood about 5 years ago, I regularly frequent Calo. Since 1997, the restaurant has undergone several upgrades. Most notably (and somewhat sadly), they have reinvented the bar area, and it no longer has space for the Casio keyboard band. For most people, this is probably for the better. Calo has really good food. The asiago gnocchi is extraordinary. One of my friends and I refer to the gnocchi as "pillows' because they are light and airy (unlike traditional gnocchi, which is dough-y and heavy). The asiago version used to be a special but is now a regular menu entree. They also have a gorgonzola version, but I swear by the asiago. So good! Calo also has an extensive spirits selection. They have some really lovely cocktails. I love the raspberry martinis, but I'd stay away from the basil one. It had a strong anise undertone and kind of tasted like detergent. Go to Calo. Make reservations.
