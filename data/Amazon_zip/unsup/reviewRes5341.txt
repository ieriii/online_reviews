If you're in Chicago, you've got to go to the Purple Pig! I visited the place for dinner after a friend recommended it, based on the Yelp reviews... and the fact that it was right across the street from my hotel! Since I was on a business trip, I came here solo and sat at the bar. I sat beside a guy and the waitress assumed we were there together so we got to chatting anyway. He had been there a couple times already and made some recommendations as to what to try. By the end, he split some of his meal with me as well so that I could try some extra items off the menu. People are SO friendly in Chi!  Salt-Roasted Beets with Whipped Goat Cheese & Pistachio Vinaigrette- YUMMY given that you like beets and goat cheese! Great little appetizer to start with. Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and Mashed Potato - Tender milky pork that melts in your mouth with the creamy mashed potato. Well seasoned, well cooked and delicious. Pig's Tail Braised in Balsamic - talk about eating every bit of the pig! This one was tasty as well.  GREAT menu. The service here is friendly and helpful, the location is lively and busy, and the food is like none other. "Cheese, swine and wine" - How can you possibly go wrong?! A MUST-TRY! I will be back here if ever I'm in CHI again...
