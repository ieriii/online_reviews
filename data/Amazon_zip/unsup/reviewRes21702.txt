I'm not sure how I haven't written a review for this place yet, since it's sorta my go-to place after shopping in the Loop. Churros, of course, are delectable. I actually prefer dipping them in the soft-serve (get it with the brownie bits, swooooon) as opposed to the recommended chocolate shot. I usually get a Torta Ahogada, which makes my hands smell like pork and tomato for the rest of the day, but eh, it's worth it. Their soups are sort of hit or miss; the first one I had (forget which one, it was meat-centered, I just remember wanting the mushrooms) seemed a little one-dimensional on flavor, sort of like a saltier and less umami pho. But the all-veggie one was pretty solid. One other perk about this place is that, despite being jam-packed all the time, their service is actually pretty good. There usually is a long line, yeah, but the wait has always been bearable. You can probably pop in and out for a good meal under an hour. Plus, you don't have to wait four months for a reservation! (cough cough Topo)
