This could have been the best meal we've had in Chicago so far...... It was affordable too! We had dinner here last week and for around $65 per person you can do the three course prix fixe menu and the kitchen even adds two intermezzo plates as well. We all tried different items and loved everything we had! There was only one criticism I found in Sprout. They have a great way of including info on the menu so you know some of what you are getting but there is an element of surprise....however the problem was I really wanted them to tell me all the details of what I ended up with once the dish was presented instead of just letting me guess what was there.Very small thing to most people I'm sure but I would have really appreciated it. We will undoubtedly be back to Sprout for dinner again soon. We didn't get a glimpse of Chef Dale but fingers crossed for next time.
