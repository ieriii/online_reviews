A great idea for a hotel! As someone who would rather crash at a friends place when visiting an old city of residence than stay at a hotel in a tourist destination, it was a nice change for once. My friend and I had a Groupon for a good rate, and we had a nice room! It was on a lower level than advertised, but it was still a good view. Right in the heart of some nice places to drink. Each level has a theme for each band and a piece of memorabilia relating to that band. We had the Rolling Stones. I got to stare at David Bowie taking a wee, and sometimes if you're in the right place at the right time, you can run into minor celebrities! Unfortunately, the Check In, Rock Out program requires a $1,000 guarantee in case of any damages. What would have been a potential incentive turned out to be something we couldn't do due to the extraordinary price for a guitar that costs less than that, even for a nice model! However, this was only minor as the experience was very well-received. We also were given a code for free wi-fi that didn't work. We didn't say anything since we didn't need it for anything important. And thinking being a Groupon user would make them incorporate some crazy fees, we only had to pay extra for taxes. Not bad for a one night stay!
