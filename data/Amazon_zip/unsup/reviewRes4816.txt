"Cheese, Swine & Wine" how could you possibly go wrong?! Call me bias for my love of pork and wine, but the Purple Pig is the place to go if you are looking for good food, amazing wine, and a great atmosphere. Though it's not great for groups, the small plates concept is great for sharing and trying different items from their diverse menu. Keep an open mind, some of the plates served are of disparate nature, but amazing nonetheless. Hands down, my favorite dish is the crispy pig ears with fried egg! You must try this; it was my first time having pig ears and I have no regrets- in fact I have returned to the Pig for solely this dish on multiple occasions. Other favorites of mine include the fried sardines and the pig neck rillette. I must say that I was disappointed with the bone marrow, being such a huge fan of bone marrow I was a expecting fireworks from a place this good. The portion was small and there wasn't enough of a sweet aspect on the plate to balance the richness of the bone marrow. Other than that I would highly recommend trying this place if you haven't done so already. Having most of the wines available by the glass, third, half or full bottle allows for a truly unique meal. I wish more restaurants had this option. Though some servers don't know much about the wine list, if you do happen to get an awesome server let them guide you through it, you won't regret it. The food is worth the wait, but there is a wait. The only reason I did not give The Purple Pig 5 stars is because of the sad bone marrow, and my last service experience, the waitress we had was slightly clueless and didn't care much about our intrest in the wine menu.
