The Sheraton is a large convention-style hotel with a nice location along the Chicago River and just off from Michigan Avenue and the lakefront. The lines can be long at the front desk, but the rooms are comfortable and reasonably spacious. Check out the health club's sun deck, which looks out onto the river.
