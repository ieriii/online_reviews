My boyfriend took me here for our first date. We have been together for over 3 years. Enough said... lol...but seriously, the food was great, the atmosphere was great, service was great, and even though we had to wait for a table we got to sit at the bar and the drinks were great. We even went back here for our 1 year anniversary and I am happy to report their brunch is just as good as dinner!
