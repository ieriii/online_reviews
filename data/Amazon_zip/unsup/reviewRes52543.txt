Meat! meat! meat! Meat coming at you from all sides. This is LITERALLY the experience that you'll have when you go to Brazzaz. We got a couple of coupons for a $20 lunch there and we got our money's worth and then some. There were so many different types of meat that it was hard to keep track AND everytime you're done eating, the servers bring you more meat right away. My favorite was a pork sausage that was delish. Just juicy and salty enough...yummmm. There was a pretty extensive salad bar that had some great cheeses as well. I suspect that it was put there to relieve some of the guilt from eating all that meat. The decor was also amazing, very contemporary and the servers were great. Very, very attentive. I could not ask for a better experience. The best I've had so far.
