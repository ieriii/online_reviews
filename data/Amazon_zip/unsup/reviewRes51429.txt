This place is amazing! I have been here so many times since moving to Chicago in 2008. I am never disappointed. Their tacos al pastor is the best I have ever had. I also recommend their combination # 5 carne asada and chile relleno. The only thing I would avoid is their guacamole, it has a weird taste to it. The service is always great! They also make great pina colada.
