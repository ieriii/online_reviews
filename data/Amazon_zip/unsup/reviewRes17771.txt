This place is AWESOME!! My friend took me there last night for the first time, we both love wicker park but I've never heard of this place!! WTF?!?! Where have I been then, right? I love a good cocktail, so he was like, I know the perfect place with the best cocktails... TA-DA! We ended up here :) I was definately impressed. Best cocktails in Chicago. Can't wait to go back.
