I always wanted to try the Bongo Room because there's usually a long line of people waiting to get in. Is it really that good? Not at all. I think they over complicated breakfast. I had the french toast with some apple and pear compote I believe (not very memorable after all, is it) and it was way too sweet. The flavors did not go well together too. What's outrageous is their small glass of freshly squeezed blood orange juice which is $5. Geez. With tax and tip, it came to about $20 a person. I wasn't very happy paying that much for food that I didn't enjoy. Will I stand in line to get in again? Forget it!
