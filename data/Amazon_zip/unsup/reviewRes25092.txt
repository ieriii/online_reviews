Here's what led me to write a review for Artopolis - the Bougatsa. Keep in mind I've been here for lunch, dinner and dessert (in that order too over the course of living nearby for a couple of years).  Initially I had the tiramisu, fruit tart, baklava, but in the summer of 2009 at GreekFest I noticed that I could get 'more sweetness for my money' by trying the bougatsa instead of the baklava. (Essentially it's phyllo dough filled with a lemony custard and some powdered sugar on top.) It was AMAZING, and I have never tried any of the other desserts there since. It had the perfect flaky bite with enough custard, and the sweetness it spot on. In case you've never seen/heard/tasted a bougatsa, here it is: http://en.wikipedia.org/
