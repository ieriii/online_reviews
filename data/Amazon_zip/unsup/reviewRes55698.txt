YUM!! Don't judge this place by the name - the fish is fresh and all the food we had was excellent. I reccommend the calamari - it's unlike any calamari I've ever had! I strongly suggest making dinner reservations because this place gets packed, and even with reservataions we had to wait like 15 minutes, but the overall service was wonderful. I've also been for breakfast, which was also really good and in the summer there is outdoor seating, which I love.
