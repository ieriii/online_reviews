I did my potential roommate interviews here (met the sketchies from Craigslist IRL, ha) and always had a great sandwich for lunch. My favorite is the chicken pesto one. I suppose they do have a limited amount of choices, though. I also just purchased their granola from Whole Foods and it's AWESOME (so far I've tried the regular flavor), I love it with a little vanilla yogurt.
