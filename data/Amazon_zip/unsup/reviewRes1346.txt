COMPLETELY worth the hour wait! So good! Ok so I am not a Hot Dog fanatic or anything of that sort but I am a foodie so when my friend explained that this was THE place to go (even featured on the Food Network) I had to go! The line went slow...and I was hungry by the time I reached Doug. That's right Doug! The owner kindly greets each and every one of you in that line...(of about 130 people). I have to admit I was instantly impressed when he gave the lady and her kids in front of us a break on the cost of their meal since they were short on cash -and its a cash only venue. He doesn't try to rush you one bit - so be prepared for a wait...but you'll have time to peruse the menu and you wont get shot if you ask for a recommendation ...he's not like the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. (although as I was getting hungrier I was kind of wishing he was-but that's part of the charm). We were able to find a seat easily and the bussers even brought us over some knives and forks when we explained that we wanted to cut our hot dogs to share...I didnt even have to ask- he offered : ) We each ordered 2 dogs a piece to split- we went with : Smoked Shrimp and Pork Sausage with Cajun Remoulade and Moody Blue Cheese $8 - My favorite sooooo delicious but very filling Chili Cheese and Onion Dog - ~$2 pretty basic The Elvis- Bratwurst (plus we added Kraut) $2.50 - Also one of my favorites The Sonoran Dog: Jalapeno and Cheddar Beef Dog with Jalapeno Mayonnaise, Jalapeno Bacon, Pinto Beans, Tomatoes and Onions $5.00 - Too spicy for me but good flavor and of course the Duck Fat Fries- Good -definitely enough to share with 3-4 people All in all I was very impressed- I loved Hot Dougs! Check it out if you're in Chicago !
