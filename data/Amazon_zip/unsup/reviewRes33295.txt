If there's one thing I can't live without, it's an egg. So, when I first heard about this breakfast joint called Yolk, I knew it was a must try. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed. Like most breakfast places, Yolk has a very casual vibe, and service is quick and friendly. Just a glance at the menu and I knew we had to try Hey Ricky: a Spanish omelette with chorizo, avocado, jalapeno, and most importantly melted jack and cheddar cheese. We also ordered the Eggs Florentine and Pecan Waffle. The Pecan Waffle was topped with sliced bananas and a caramel sauce. Everything was perfectly flavored, and nothing was too sweet. The omelette and Eggs Florentine were also amazing, but nothing I haven't had before. The combination of eggs, cheese, salsa, and sour cream has to be one of the best invention ever made. I can honestly eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you like savory breakfast foods, you won't be disappointed with Yolk!!
