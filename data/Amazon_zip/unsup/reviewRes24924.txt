Stopped in with a friend for coffee & dessert! The entire atmosphere of the restaurant was super cute! I went in wanting bread pudding, my FAVORITE dessert in the whole wide world.. it was on the menu & I was totally stoked! We sat in the lower level dining area which was cozy & cute.. our server approached us with menus promptly! Awesome! After ordering our coffees we looked through the dessert menu & were both very excited about our choices.. to our surprise they were OUT of BOTH desserts we chose. I was very disappointed because I went inside specifically wanting bread pudding. We chose three other desserts on the menu to share.. they were all delicious, but two of them were pretty much the same thing. The service was nice, the experience was good.. I'll definitely go back for lunch or dinner! Hopefully they will have the bread pudding next time! :D
