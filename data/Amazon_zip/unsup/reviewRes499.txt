Now this is a place that writing a review is almost unnessesary. It goes without saying that the concept of food has been taken to a new level. Maybe if you visited Spain and saw one of the new concept resturaunts you would have something to compare it to. MOTO is a shadow of Alinea, a strong shadow, but a shadow none the less. What can I tell you about this place. You must be a foodie to enjoy it. You must be willing to submit to the will of the chef, his architect, his lighting designer, his artist who hand crafted the plates and utensils to accompany and harmonize with the food. This is food taken to the hieghts of showmanship, you have light, you have smell, you have touch, texture, imagination, you get it. What you also have to be ready for is the concept that price is no object. If you have to look at the bill dont come, you will be disappointed. If you are prepared to treat yourself and damn the recession than full speed ahead.
