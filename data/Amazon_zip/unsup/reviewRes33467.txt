I grew up in the middle east, so I can't say this was the best shawarma I have ever had. But easily one of the better ones I have had in the US. Like the spinach pie and the zatar bread. And the Baklava. Great. now my mouth is watering. I hope you are happy, yelp. It's definitely my go-to place for my Lebanese fast food fix, just because its so damn close.
