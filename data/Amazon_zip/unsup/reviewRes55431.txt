I had dinner the second night of their opening and it was FANTASTIC! Me and my partner had the sprout salad, crab cakes, rolled leg of lamb and the tenderloin dinner. The space is very nice and the music was funky-lounge. Very gay-friendly! Great staff and the organic riesling was to die for. My only negative comment would be that more people need to know about this hidden! We will definitely be back for more!
