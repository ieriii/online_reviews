Bonsoiree was truly outstanding.. Have been trying to get a reservation for a Friday / Saturday night for a while but never seemed to call far enough in advance. A few Friday nights ago we took a chance and called them at 6:00 to see if they had any last minute openings. To our luck/surprise they did. The space is small and intimate with beautiful attention to detail all around. We both got the 7 course menu and were lucky enough to be served by Chef Shin himself.. He took time to explain each of the dishes extensive ingredient list and how they were prepared. I felt like a judge on TopChef... Ill just say that Chef Shim will not be " packing his knives and going" as the meal was excellent from start to finish. Worth every bit of the $85.. Cant wait to go back for the 13 course...
