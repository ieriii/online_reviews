I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that Longman & Eagle may be my new favorite dinner spot in Chicago and I suggest you join me on that limb. The 1.5 hr wait estimation is not a lie but I can tell you it is well worth it. The sweetbreads was by far my favorite thing I ate the whole night followed closely by the open-face ravioli with scallops. The other dishes we sampled (the pretzel, the meatballs, the chicken, the pasta) were are yummy as well.. but honestly the pasta leftovers were not very good day 2, as a note. The interiors are warm and moody.. if that makes sense. And it doesn't hurt that it is accessorized with some attractive waiters.
