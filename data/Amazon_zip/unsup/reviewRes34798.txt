Pure excellence. If you want to pay a whole bunch for inferior food, head to Andie's in Andersonville. If you want good falfel for what seems like pennies, then Sultan's is it. Only having been there a handful of times, I stick to the falafel sandwich, but I don't know why I would get anything else. I usually get that and a pop and its $5, and then you're full for the night! Win-win as far as I'm concerned.
