My Grandma from Michigan is a huge Tigers fan, so when she came to visit she was really excited about heading to the Fifty/50 for lunch. The food is absolutely wonderful! Especially the onion rings. They are quite possibly the best onion rings I have ever had. And they come on a spindle! The burger that I had was substantial, hot, and fresh. I also tried the pork barbecue, and it wasn't bad! I'd like to stop in at night sometime (sans Grandma) and see what the bar has to offer.
