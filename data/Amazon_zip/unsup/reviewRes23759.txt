I'm not sure why everyone likes this place. I found the food to be overly salted, the service perfunctory, and the atmosphere kind of annoying. Now granted I had the "vegetarian plate". But really, did it have to taste like canned minestrone on a plate? The mousaka was marginally better, and the prices OK, but really you can do much much better in Greektown, especially considering when we left the waiting area was packed with well-scrubbed suburban tourists, anxiously awaiting their table. I wanted to ask them: Why bother?
