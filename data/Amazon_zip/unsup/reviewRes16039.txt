Damn this place is stealth...we walked past it once and close to a 2nd time trying to find it. I loved it's incognito status. We waited about 20 mins for a table for 3 in between curtains - a little strange. I loved the decor, and the high lounge chairs. The drink menu was thorough. I wasn't thrilled w/ the waitstaff - hence minus 1 star. We inquired twice for their "spiced nuts" - it never came. We had to flag our lady down twice for our check...double annoying. But honestly she did try to recover with bringing a artichoke digestive.
