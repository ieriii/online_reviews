I am the man. Ya know why? Because after hours of trying to figure out the perfect place to have dinner with a bunch of my friends that wouldn't be too far or difficult for everyone to get to, I realized we could all go to Piece. I am the smartest man alive! Seriously though, one of my friends was in town for work and wanted to grab dinner with the rest of us and I couldn't think of a better place than Piece. Great location, awesome microbrews, and possibly the best thin crust pizza in the city. Plus, 5 guys were able to have a filling dinner for less than $36! That is insane. Do yourself a favor and go to Piece.
