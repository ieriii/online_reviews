This place is actually the reason I decided to finally cave in and make a Yelp account. Let me start off by saying I've worked in the service industry for over ten years and cannot believe that a place like this has such AWFUL service. I have never, ever, complained about a server or bartender, but I actually really wanted to last night. I dined at the bar last evening and was underwhelmed by my whole experience. The only reason I am even giving this two stars is because of the free flatbread (5 stars) that preceded my meal, which was fantastic. I ordered the patatas bravas (NOTHING like Las Bravas in Madrid, which has the world's finest) and the slow cooked pork belly (which was good, but super tiny, and nothing to write home about). Upon contemplating ordering another small dish or dessert, I asked the bartender (who didn't smile once in the almost two hours I was at the bar; oh, or ask how anything was) if there was anything that really stood out on the dessert menu that I should consider. Her response? Wait for it.... "I don't really like dessert, so I don't know." Jose Garces, Iron Chef winner, I think you need to give your staff a lesson on customer service. Not only was the bartender uneducated on service (you could've made something up, and I would've never known!) but your hostess stand and service area were continually complaining about tables (they even were talking about asking a table to actually get up because they sat them in the wrong area). Unreal! Needless to say, I won't be back, EVER. And I won't try any of your affiliated restaurants in the Philadelphia area, which I frequent often.
