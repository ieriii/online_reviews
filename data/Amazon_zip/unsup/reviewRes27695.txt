I've been to Pequod's SO many times since we discovered it, it's ridiculous. We always get their deep dish pepperoni and every single time it's been delicious and perfect. I LOVE the caramelized cheese at the crust part. Not only is their pizza amazing, there is also something special about their Blue Moons on tap. I've tried other Blue Moons at various bars, but theirs is so tasty and rich (no clue why). You HAVE to try their Blue Moons. It can get pricey though (~$6/beer?). Writing this review makes me want to go there tonight...I just might...
