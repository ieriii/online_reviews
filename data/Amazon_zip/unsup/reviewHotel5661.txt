Stayed at the Talbott for a two day business meeting. The rooms were nice and clean. There was bad Wifi reception and a huge delay in the TVs remote control and with satellite TV. The carpet was a little old and I wish there were more amenities in the hotel.  I was in a meeting room on the second floor during the day. The catering in the hotel is horrible. The continental breakfast was disappointing at best. There was food ordered for 12 and there wasn't even enough food for 9. They made a little more food but it was disappointing at best.
