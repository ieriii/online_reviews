When I reviewed Hot Doug's last year, I noted that it had 350+ reviews. Now it has 750+ reviews. And I'm reviewing it again. Why? Because it's there. So I have now had the full-on HD experience, meaning 1) I came on a Friday, and 2) I waited in line. Oh, I've waited in line before, but 20-30 minutes on a weekday. Nothin'. And since we got to Doug's by 11 on Friday, the line was still only about an hour long. It wasn't even across the alley, down the block. Easy. I will say this: it was probably the nicest line I've ever waited in. Perhaps because it was an equal collection of locals and tourists -- I'm still not sure why that Australian in front of us was brandishing a deer hoof -- or perhaps because people know if they get unruly, Doug is not above sending them to their room. Here is my question about Hot Doug's: Where does everybody go? You wait and wait and wait in line, and hundreds of people go in before you, yet only a handful come out. And when you get to the front of the line, there's always seating inside. So where does everybody go? I'm thinking Sweeney Todd thoughts. Due to unfortunate circumstances, we had to take our purchases with us, rather than eating them there. And we had to make a stop on the way home. So the duck fat fries had turned into standard steamy, droopy fries. And the foie gras was not quite as tasty as it would have been hot. But the Thai chicken sausage with the peanut sauce was surprisingly good. And the jerk sausage was delectable. The venison with raspberry mustard was good, but last, and it's always hard to be last. So yes, wait in line, because it's worth it, and Doug is always friendly, and there will be somewhere to sit down. And the bathrooms are cool, even though some dickwad defaced the Duchamp.
