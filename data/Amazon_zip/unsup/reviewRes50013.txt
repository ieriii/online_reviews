This upscale sports bar is in a very lively, fun area of Wicker Park. They have great outdoor seating - and they also have a big flatscreen tv for the outdoor patrons to watch. The only thing that sucks (for me personally, as a non-smoker) is that all the smokers come to the outdoor seating area in the front sidewalk for their smoke breaks.  This place is stocked with employees - maybe because it was for a sports night...but they are awesome enough to not be understaffed! Our server was really friendly and nice. I think her name was Stephanie? The food was good too! We had one of their signature sandwiches - the garlic bread steak sandwich. Freakin' good! I personally would stick with the regular fries here; the sweet potato fries there got old pretty fast.  I think the bf is going to drag me here again for sports nights...but at least it's great for people watching outside. :) Street parking difficult in the area.
