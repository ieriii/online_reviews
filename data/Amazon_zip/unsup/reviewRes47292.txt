First off I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews on here in that this place isn't up to the same standards as Kuma's. That being said, not having to wait for two hours for a table goes a long way and their burgers are far better than you would find in run of the mill bar fare and only priced a few dollars more. I had the Wild Bill and the flavor of the meat as well as the toppings was excellent. The bun tasted fresh and held up well given the amount of meat and toppings. The fries weren't anything special but were above average compared to the flash frozen after thoughts you get at most places. My only suggestion is that if you're going to try and be known for your burgers learn what medium rare actually means. The meat was a little over cooked for my tastes and my friend's burger was clearly well done when he had ordered medium.  The beer selection is extensive enough to satisfy just about any one. The atmosphere seemed like an attempt to replicate Kuma's but was consistent throughout so I can't really knock them there. The servers were certainly busy however we didn't wait long for our food and never were left with empty glasses sitting in front of us for very long. Overall a good place to head if you're in the area an looking for a bite to eat.
