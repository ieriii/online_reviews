I'm a pizza fiend. I wouldn't call myself a snob because I'll pretty much eat any kind of pizza and release an earth-shattering belch afterward to let you, everyone in the room and everyone in a 5 block radius how good that shit was. With that said, Pequod's is one of my top 3 favorite pizza places in this city. Walking up to it, the aroma of hot salami fills your nasal cavities which makes you pray to god there's not a wait (I've only ever encountered a wait a few times). I prefer to sit upstairs in a booth, but I did get to sit at one of those tall tables in the window last week which felt pretty baller. Get the pepperoni. I don't care if you're a vegetarian or anti-peps. Give up your silly rules for one night and do yourself a life-changing favor. Indulge in some delicious red meat and burnt cheese crust. Let the hot sloppy cheese burn the inside of your mouth so bad that when you go to the dentist the next day, he asks you if you had recently eaten pizza. So, when you admit it, he can show you on that mouth cam what kind of damage it did to the inside of your mouth. WORTH IT. I take all of my out of town guests here. It's within walking distance of my apartment (dangerous) and they advertise their lunch special like whoa ($5 for a personal peetz and beer, who wants to ditch work one day and take advantage of that gem?)
