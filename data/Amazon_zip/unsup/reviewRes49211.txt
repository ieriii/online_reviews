I just went here with my fiance for the first time the other day and even though I only had an Iced Decaf Coffee.. Americano or something like that.. I definitely had a good first impression of the place. I am not the biggest fan of sitting outdoors at cafes ,but my fiance is so we sat outside, because she always wins and it was pretty comfortable out there. The chairs weren't painful or wobbly, the tables aren't too close to one another, and their garbage wasn't inside the seating area. Of course the garbage wasn't out there at all but that probably won't bother most people.. I'm just lazy. When we were done, we went back in so i could get another for the road... actually for the sidewalk, because we walked along the block shopping for awhile. (You can see my opinions of those places on my page also.) Then, we stopped into another part of the place to use the restroom. I was completely unaware that this side existed. I thought they only had an outside place to sit because this part's separate from the part where you buy stuff. Anyways, this side looked really cozy and ideal if you wanted to just relax and read something or surf the web on a mobile device, or write screenplays.
