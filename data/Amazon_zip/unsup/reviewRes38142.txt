OK, so two stuffed pizza places in two nights may mean I never make it back to my wife alive, but hey, what ya gonna do, it's Chicago babay. After many varied recommendations by former Chicagoans we headed here just to try ad compare the original, tha real deal. Bunch of us split a spinach stuffed and yes it was damn tasty, nice crunchy crust that held together, solid layers of natural goodness in the middle. The place is a little more tacky/touristy than say Due was but it's much bigger and feels like a large pizza place that's been around a while. Have to say this place made good pie but also made me realize that Zach's is actually pretty hard to beat in Cali. Prefer Due for atmosphere and much cooler/friendlier staff but the pie is def worth a visit here.
