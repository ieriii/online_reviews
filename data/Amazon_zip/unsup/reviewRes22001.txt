While in Chicago on business, I turned to Yelp to find a good place to eat near my hotel. Fortunately, I discovered that I was in "Greektown" - and I love Greek/Mediterranean food. After looking over the many offerings, I settled on Greek Islands. The restaurant itself is very attractive, and the decor is very nice. There was a queue waiting to get in, but being alone I was able to get a table right away. This is where it started to go downhill. The dining room was noisy to the point of distraction, so it wouldn't be a good choice for a first date IMO. The service was efficient but mechanical - not unfriendly but not welcoming either. I ordered an app of dolmades, which appeared within 2 minutes of ordering. They were nice and hot, but the grape leaves had lost their "tang"; so I think they had been sitting there for awhile and probably nuked in a microwave. They also provided a small basket of bread, which was so chewy it gave my teeth a workout (and I have strong teeth, but this was a challenge) For an entree I selected the special of Lamb a la Garden - which appeared to be bone in lamb with vegetables and sauce. LOTS of sauce - so much it pretty much drowned everything on the plate. The lamb itself was very tender, but had no flavor. The vegetables were overcooked and somewhat mushy - except for the carrots which were good. Overall I was disappointed. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - many of the dishes passing my table looked much better than what I had. But I'm not going back given the tons of other Greek restaurants in the area.
