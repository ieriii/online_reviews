Step out of your comfort zone and have an experience at Tank. I couldn't tell you if it's authentic Vietnamese, but it's damn good! This place is fun for groups if you can get a table and would be a great start or end to your evening (depending on your schedule). I've had the self wrap beef on two occasions and was happy both times. Their bubble tea is awesome as well. The potions are huge and the prices are somewhat decent. The atmosphere is a welcome change from the red colored walls of your regular fair. No go on, try something new!
