Pros: Open all day and night, grill your own food, filled with smoke, creepy vibe, a billion free side dishes, yummy Cons: To grill at your table, you must order at least two grillable items, which generally cost about $17 each (soup and rice included). And if you're just there with another person, that's quite a bit of food. However, if you're there with three people or more, it's far more affordable than fondue or other do-it-yourself eateries. And I love the servers. They're so blunt and nearly incapable of speaking English, which makes it their restaurant, not yours, and that's how it should be.
