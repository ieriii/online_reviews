Don't believe all of the hype!!! (like I did) my boyfriend and I went there last night, waited 45 minutes for a table only to be extremely disappointed. I had the steak burrito and he had the pepito sandwich, both tasted like bad mexican food, nothing at all like the delicious Costa Rican food that I was expecting to have. After reading all of the great things about both the sandwich and the burrito, I was expecting soooo much more. We also had the civeche which was the tastiest thing that we ordered. It was BYOB with no corkage fee which was nice but I can definitely say "been there, done that" and I will not be going back.
