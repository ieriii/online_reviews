This place is funny. Like real funny. When we arrived our table wasn't ready yet so we passed the time by playing celebrity shooting fish is a barrel. Pick a table and name the celeb. It was highly entertaining. What makes it great, it when you notice the table of suburban couples oogling over *insert lame celeb here* that they can barely enjoy their meal. Joking aside, the food is good. Really, really good. We had two of their house signature rolls, the names of them escape me, and a bunch of other items and, literally every one was good. The girlfriend and I tend to order a bunch of items and just share everything. We ended up killing 2 bottles of sake and damn does that stuff go down easy. That's what happens when you give me a porcelain cup the size of a shot glass. All in all, we had a great time and we will be back again.
