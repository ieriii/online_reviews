I guess you have to like to put-on-the-dog in order to enjoy Le Colonial. I've given it a try now three times. The food is beautifully presented, but expensive (the bill was $140 for 2 people, which included 2 small martinis at $13 each, one salad, and two entrees).  The artichoke and crabmeat salad was bland, and the other dishes (average size portions) were just mediocre. I enjoy the simple-to-complex array of flavors of a variety of ethnic cuisine, but Le Colonial does not meet that requirement for me.
