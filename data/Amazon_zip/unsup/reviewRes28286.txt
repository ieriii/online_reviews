3.5 or a 4. Don't get me wrong, everything we had was good and tasty. Its just I feel like if you put this restaurant in Los Angeles, people would not make as big a deal about it due to all the cheap authentic, amazing mexican food going on there. - Yellowfin tuna ceviche - real good, would go with trio of ceviche if I had to do it over. - queso fundido - was wondering how they would make fundido different from one you would get at say....chili's. homemade chorizo did it. served with tortillas. this was my favorite thing. - Tlacoyos de Tocino - an item rick bayless has apparently called his favorite. pretty good. good sauce. nothing i would order again though. - cochinita pibil - special of the night. i actually enjoy the one my girlfriend makes more. this one was definitely cooked perfectly. served with a small side of salsa they said was real hot........i tried it anyways. holy shit. hottest thing i have ever been served at a restaurant. - GREAT margarita. there are so many good restaurants in chicago and you really need to do a rick bayless one. i would recommend oging next door to Xoco and getting a cheaper torta which is probably insanely good....and more cost effective. all those items plus a round of drinks was only like $75. not bad at all.
