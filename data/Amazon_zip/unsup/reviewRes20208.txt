I tried Xoco this past weekend while in Chicago and was happy to see that the place met the high expectations I had as the result of several recommendations. First of all, the food is decently priced. I might be used to NY-priced food though and in general Chicago seems to be much cheaper, but it definitely felt like a lot of food for the price considering I got two meals out of my torta. I had the fried something chicken torta w/ jalapenos, monterey jack cheese, and avocado-tomatillo salsa. It was delicious and oh so filling; plus that paired with the "aztec" hot chocolate + chili powder and all spice was the perfect 'brunch' to start a brisk but sunny Saturday in the city. I do wish there was more on the menu that didn't involve pork; but there were enough options for my one visit. Lastly, my recommendation is to get there early. We got there a little after 11 and were lucky to do so. We might have waited 20 minutes before reaching the register but at least the line was still inside the building when we got there as opposed to wrapping out and around the corner by the time we left.
