this place is so upscale chicago. the gourmet hot dogs are damn good. i only give them a 4 star rating because the line was very long but doug is awesome - what a great guy - i'm assuming he's the guy taking the orders. i would for sure go here again - perhaps in the summer where the wait isn't so cold. the only thing was the duckfat fries didn't taste any different from regular fries.
