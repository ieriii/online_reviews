Sure, crepes can be good for dessert. This I will concede. But as a meal? Wow! Who knew a crepe could be so wonderful?! I met a group of friends at Icosium for Saturday brunch. I had slept in, and since it was close enough had walked there - not a short walk - so once I arrived, I was hungry and needed my caffeine fix. First impression, it was a little cramped, but sitting down with a group of good friends, the close quarters never bothered me. They quickly took coffee orders, and delivered on the hot, tasty promise that ordering a cup o' joe should be. When perusing the menu, I was disappointed at the lack of options, specifically, where is the meat? This was not in my breakfast wheelhouse. I was oh-so-tempted to build my own omlette and stuff it with choices from the "add meat" option - but then again turkey, salmon, and escargot are not high on my list of meats to throw in an omlette. After talking myself into going with the flow, ordering a silly crepe off the normal menu, and likely searching out an extra snack on the walk home, I chose the Icosium Crepe. I figured if I was going to judge this place, I may as well give it no excuses and order the crepe with its name all over it. Was I proven wrong or what? (I was proven wrong.) The crepe was large. The crepe was delicious. The crepe was so light and fluffy. The crepe was filling. My belt was begging to be loosed, and yet I could not have stopped eating if there was more. Everyone in our party left happy with their choice and stuffed to the brim. All in all, I'm a fan, Icosium. Way to turn me around. I would recommend it to all. And my story is a case in point that even if you think you desire something different, these crepes will change your mind.
