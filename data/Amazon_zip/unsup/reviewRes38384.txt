Eh. My experience in this place was mediocre. I came here for drinks with a friend and the bartenders had attitudes and did not seem to want to serve us. It was hard to get their attention and it was not a busy night. Also, I really wanted some food and the couple next to us really wanted some food but they were not serving food anymore! Bummer. I would probably check out one of the other millions of bars on Clark street before I came back here.
