I have been trying to get to Frontera Grill for dinner over the last 3 years.  Never been able to get a dinner reservation so I finally decided to come for brunch.  The Michelin Chicago guide said that it is possible to get in for brunch and they were right. If you come in around open time at 10:30 there is no wait.  If you come in closer to noon, the line is pretty long. I came to try th Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena which was featured on Best Things I Ever Ate.  This thin cut of ribeye is marinated and has great flavor.  Given how thin it is, it didn't come out at the medium rare I requested.  It was good, but not worth the close to $30 price tag. The Mexican hot chocolate drink I had for dessert was the highlight of my meal! Rich, creamy, and not too sweet. I am glad I finally got to try out Frontera Grill, but my conclusion is that it is overhyped!
