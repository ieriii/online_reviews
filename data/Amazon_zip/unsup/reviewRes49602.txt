I absolutely love this place! I went here for my 25th birthday dinner with a group of friends and had an AMAZING dinner.  Started out with some cheese empanadas which were crispy and oozing with cheese. Ordered a limonada (like a lemonade but made to order with fresh squeezed limes highly recommended!). Then had the combination platter with the skirt steak and grill octopus. Now I usually expect octopus to be pretty bland so I order it more for the texture than the taste. But the grill octopus was so juicy and flavorful that my friends kept grabbing them off my plate! The steak was also equally if not better than the octopus. I ordered mine medium and it came out perfectly pink and oh so tender. It was SO GOOD I immediately think about it every time I hear "steak." lol Service was a bit slow but expected since we had such a huge group and the place was super packed and crowded. But the waiter totally made up for it with the FREE columbian coffee. Overall a great experience and I would love love love to go back again!
