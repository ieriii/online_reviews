Intimate atmosphere. Got the wild boar sloppy joe, which wasn't crazy gamey, very nice as everyone else has said. The gruyere donut's are insanely good. As for whiskey I had to go with standards to see how they stacked up. Their Manhattan and Old-Fashioned were both well made and tasty. Blood and Sand was a little too sweet but still a very interesting cocktail. Also got the "White Flight" of Koval unaged white whiskey. It was divine. I need to drink more Koval. A lot more. Overall, a great experience. The hostess was fun, and our waiter Cortland was knowledgable and enthusiastic. We sat down at 5:30 on a Monday with no wait, but by 7 it was packed. Got a Chef's taste of some lobster bisque as well, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommended.
