My boyfriend and I wanted to find more places in the Andersonville area to go to brunch. So, I actually looked on Yelp, and we decided to try Big Jones. This is by far one of our favorite brunch spots. And this is after only one visit. Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff and great food. You are met with scrumptious beignets to nibble on before your food comes out. The drinks are also amazing. I ordered a sweet tea, and was brought a carafe of tea, with a smaller carafe of the sugary flavor I had chosen. My bf had the banana pancakes as well as a 2-egg meal. He loved the pancakes b/c they were the first banana pancakes he's had that weren't overly sweet. I had the migas, an egg dish with chiles and avocado. Delicious. We will definitely be going back!
