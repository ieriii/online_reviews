Beyond disappointing. When I think of southern comfort food, I think of relaxing, fun environment. It started with a surly, indifferent waiter and went downhill from there. They were out of the special by 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Waited at least 10 minutes for the first drink. 30 minutes between appetizer and entree. And when the main course did arrive -- the highly recommended chicken-fried steak -- the meat and accompanying mushrooms were ice cold.To top it off, the bathroom was flooded and no attempt had been made to clean up/clear up an over-flowing urinal. Disgusting.
