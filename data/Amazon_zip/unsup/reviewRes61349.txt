...10/16/08 Thurs.What can I say that would add to the already stellar reviews Brazzaz has already received? Nothing... but I can stress the fact that this was the best lunch meal I have ever had, also our party being seated right next to the buffet was a plus. The service was fantastic, both of our servers where kind and very professional. The food was delicious and plentiful. The overall experience was eye opening.
