I was in town on a business trip and had to make sure to try deep dish pizza while here. We chose Gino's East based on recommendations, and it lived up to the hype. The first thing we noticed was how organized the waiting/seating process is. We ordered a half meat lovers half veggie lovers and it was delicious. It was extremely cheesy and the sauce was fresh and tomato-ey. Since I was the least picky of my group, I had a piece of each side, and the meat was far better than the veggie, IMO.
