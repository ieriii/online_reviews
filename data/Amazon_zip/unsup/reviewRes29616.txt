Outstanding vegetarian & Vegan food. They have been doing it for nearly 30 years and obviously they have a good formula, "Meat-free since 1983", as they proudly proclaim. Over the years they have improved the appearance of the interior, while preserving the unpretentious ambiance. The menu is dynamic and continuously evolving, yet certain "fan favorites" stand the test of time, in particular, the shakes. Even if you are not a vegan or vegetarian, you will enjoy the food.
