Wonderful service. All of the servers/mgrs. were extremely nice and attentive. Went w/a big group- mostly out of towners- wanting seafood. 2 of the 7 loved Glenn's...5 didn't.  I had a nice house salad, w/crisp greens and a delicious garlicky dressing. I also shared the crab cake app- which disappointed us all(lots of mayo, really fishy) and tuna melt (tasted like tartar sauce).  FYI- the two that loved it had the sturgeon, so maybe give that a try!
