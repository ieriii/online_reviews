Aaaaahhhh, the Diner! What's not to love? Well, actually, sometimes (rarely though) the service isn't up to par, but I keep on forgiving them. Why? Because the food ROCKS!!! Albeit, I've had a few items (that I don't think are on the menu any longer) that were a bit...meh! I LOVE the Radical Reuben. That sandwich is the best thing since sliced bread. The California Reuben is substandard when compared to its Radical predecessor. I also enjoyed the Caesar Wrap and the Shepherd's Pie (neither are on the menu). They change it periodically, so I haven't tried many of the dishes on the current menu. They also have some BBQ or Buffalo Wings that are scrumptious. Their side dishes are great too. I think their Sweet Potato Fries and Mashed Potatoes with Gravy are the best. The shakes are basically dessert (the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is....aaahhh (drool)! There Lemonade is refreshing and I think you get unlimited refills (but don't quote me on that). They always have kick ass music playing, so you can jam while you wait for your delicious, mouth-watering food to arrive. What can I say....I LOVE THIS PLACE!
