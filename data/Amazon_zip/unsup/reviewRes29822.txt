Wow, I'm surprised this place gets such good reviews. I was super excited to brunch here after doing a little yelping. Got there at 11 am on a Sunday and there was only a 10 minute wait for 3 people, so far, AMAZING! Sat down, it was about 5 minutes before we were given our menus and another 5 for water and to take our drink order. 15 minutes after that we got our drinks and ordered (iced coffee and iced tea). 30 minutes later and our starving bellies were served. The waitress mentioned that the BEST thing on the menu were the benedicts, hello! Being my favorite brunch item I of course ordered it. The BF got the italian omelette (my second choice, score!) and our friend ordered the huevos rancheros. This was one of the most sub-par, bleh benny's i've ever had. The english muffin, ham, and egg were fine but that was one of the worst hollandaise sauces I've ever tasted. I'm not sure what they did to it but it was gloppy and stale. There was no hit of buttery rich eggy goodness. The hashbrowns were good but couldn't make up for the benny. The italian omelette was ok but I could make better at home. Overall the combination of SLOW service + mediocre food = Meh. I've experienced better. I will not be going back for brunch.
