Reliable, consistent good service along with great location and reasonable price make this a very desireable resting place in downtown Chicago. I'm still not sold on the Garden Inn adjustable beds, but aside from that it is clean, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the breakfast is hot and made to order. Within an easy walk or short cab ride of anything you want to do downtown, this hotel is affordable and suitable for business travelers or families on vacation.
