I really enjoyed dining here, even if the service is slow, and that the servers aren't the most attentive in the world. To anyone who may get upset about this, just expect that you'll experience this to some degree, if you dine here. And if you're a snob who expects extra-attentive service from servers, dine somewhere else. I can't complain about the servers too much, since at least they explained to me the difference between the regular crepes they served. Not to mention that other reviewers are right that you can choose feta, as one of several cheeses you can choose to get on their crepes. And I ultimately decided to get a feta and egg crepe, when I dined here(forget what it's called on their menu), which didn't disappoint. My friend got some sort of crepe that had ham in it, which I sorta liked(though I definately preferred my feta crepe). Finally, due to the fact I loved the interior decor and ambiance of this place, I'm adding an additional star to this place(and what would've been a 3-star review, otherwise). ----------------------- 11/02/07 update: I was definately not wrong in giving this place an extra star(upping this review from 3 to 4 stars), ahead of when I did finally revisit this place earlier this week. The dessert crepes are as good as the regular crepes, and I enjoyed both the chocolate(which is what my friend ordered) and cinnamon crepes that I had here. And sorry that I don't remember the exact names of both these 2 crepes off the top of my head! Coffee was decent, too. And though I somewhat wish the cups they gave the coffee in were a little more fancier-looking(like the way their cups of tea look), you do get a lot of coffee for your money, so I can't really complain.
