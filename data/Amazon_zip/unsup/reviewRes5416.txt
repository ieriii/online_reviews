The crispy brussels sprouts blew my mind. I would come back just for that. They were sprinkled with a touch lemon juice which took those brussels sprouts to a whole new level of awesomeness. Besides the amazing brussels sprouts; I would recommend coming early (especially on a weekend) but not during a normal meal hour either. The restaurant is small and cramped. I had my reasonably sized purse hanging on my chair and the servers kept running into in. It was annoying for me (and for the servers too, I'm sure) but there was nowhere else to put it because we were sitting at one of those community tables - which annoy me as well. I didn't find one of those purse hooks under the table. Not sure if they have them or not, but would be a good idea. There is really nowhere to hang out as you wait for your table, but, if the weather is decent, there is plenty of room outside the restaurant that is out of the way of the mob of tourists with their huge shopping bags. It's pretty refreshing, actually, to have a place like this to go to on Michigan Ave. It's kind of slim pickins' over there. We tried a bunch of things, but the stand-outs were the milk braised pork, the crispy brussels sprouts, the roasted bone marrow and the fried pig ear. I did not enjoy the caponata. It tasted like it was made with ketchup. So skip that if you know what a good caponata tastes like. Bottom line: come early, get the crispy brussels sprouts and don't bring a huge purse.
