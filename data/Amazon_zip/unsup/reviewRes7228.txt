One of my favorite Italian places along with Mia Francesca. But if you're not going with some kind of discount, you're doing something wrong. Pros: Sign up for their mailing list and they will send you coupons for your half birthday (I loved it!) and other promotions. They also have coupons in the local coupon packets every month. Take advantage. The food is great - I always get some kind of pasta.  Cons: No complaints here.
