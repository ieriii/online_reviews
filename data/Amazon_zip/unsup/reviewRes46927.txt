Yipee! A great breakfast place in the place of stinky ol' Speakeasy. My bf and I treated ourselves to breakfast here after a rough night of partying. And what a treat it was! I got the bowl of hot chocolate (I highly recommend it! You can get it spiked, but I my throbbing hangover opted out.) and bf got the coffee. I'd like to also note he was instantly jealous of my hot chocolate when it came out-- this was before we even tasted it. I couldn't even begin to tell you how delicious that hot chocolate was. It was spiced with warmth and fuzziness, I'm convinced. Greediness is not my most virtuous trait, but I'm glad I was and ordered a bowl instead of a cup-- and limited bf's sips. The Eggs Benedict was probably the best I've had.  Service was nice and accomodating. A couple of times, one of the other waitresses helped us out. And it wasn't because we were being neglected. She noticed we didn't have syrup on our table before we did.  It's a little pricier than your average breakfast menu, particularly because they put a gourmet spin on those tired old numbers. I haven't been there for their dinner menu, but I'm looking forward to that adventure.  If anything-- try the hot chocolate in their fully stocked lounge area.
