Peace out, tasty neighbor! I've enjoyed looking down on the patio from my living room to spot open tables when I need a bite. Digging through a drawer of receipts I winced after hitting a vein of Publican slips but only because of volume, not lack of value. The Publican absolutely deserves its widespread acclaim. Never thought I'd like pork rinds, especially with rose brut. Turns out, I do. Servers are always know their stuff, and the amazing thing is the consistently amazing, simple, honest dishes. I've actually never gone wrong with a single dish here. Try the Crudo, Trotter, and despite the fact that it's 'just chicken', get the chicken some time, too. Oh, and BEST breakfast sandwich ever (evar).
