best filet mignon. so juicy, so tender. makes me hungry just talking about it. really, i loved every bit of it from the first bite to my last sip of wine. the dark wood is warm and earthy but elegant. i was surprised since i tend to stay away from chains, but this one is hands down one of chicago's best.
