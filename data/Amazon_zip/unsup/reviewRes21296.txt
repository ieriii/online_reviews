A solid 4 stars. I got here at about 7:20 (10 mins early for our 7:30 "reservation") on Cinco de Mayo. I tell the hostess that I have a 7:30 reservation for 7 but that it will actually only be 5. The hostess gets a blank look on her face and says "Oh, well we aren't taking reservations because it's Cinco de Mayo." I told her "Yes, I know, that's why I called 2 weeks ago to make this reservation." Luckily for both of us, she said they would work something out. So, we only ended up having to wait about 10-15 minutes.  After getting seated in the back room- which was INCREDIBLY loud we got water and chips & salsa right away. The margaritas were great and the food was pretty good. It wasn't exceptional but it was good. Service was pretty decent too.  We left full and pleased. Happy Cinco De Mayo!
