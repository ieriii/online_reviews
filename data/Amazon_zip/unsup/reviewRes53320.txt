Alinea was by far the most amazing food experience i have ever had in my life. Every detail was thought out from the chair you sat on, to the contraption that you ate the food off of. The staff was the most knowledgable food professionals i have ever had the experience to enjoy a meal with. They adapted their personality to you..ie. if you are a snob - they will cater to that. If you are down to earth - they will have a conversation with you. There are too many dishes to discuss here - literally i can't remember all of the courses. Yes it is very spendy, but worth the once in a lifetime experience.
