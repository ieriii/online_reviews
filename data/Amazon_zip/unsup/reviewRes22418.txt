I wouldn't go here again! Problems I have with this place: 1. No booze! What the hell, there's liquor in Costa Rica, get liquor in your restaurant. BYOB? STFU! 2. Disgusting food! Every time I've gone here I've thrown up afterwards. Oatmeal shake? Barf! Veggie burrito? Vomit! Steak pepito? Puke! It doesn't matter, name an item on this list and I will tell you it made me throw up! Maybe it's the way it's cooked? I don't know, but I'm not going to dance with the devil again to find out!
