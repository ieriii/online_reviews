I often look at all the people waiting in line at Milk & Honey on the weekends, and then look down the street at all the places within a 2 minute walk that have open tables. And I think to myself: what is it about this place that keeps people coming back, over and over, to stand in a long line so they can have brunch at a place where the selection isn't really unusual? I mean - they serve French toast, pancakes and oatmeal. Is it really THAT much better than every other place in the neighborhood - or the city, for that matter? I guess it is. I eat at or carry out from Milk & Honey all the time. Their yogurt and granola is so good, and I have had it so many times, that if I have one of those yogurt parfait cups from Starbucks or anywhere else now I wonder what they did to screw it up. They have good French toast and pancakes, good huevos rancheros, and a collection of fabulous sandwiches. Their potato chips suck, but hey - noplace is perfect, and you don't have to eat them. I love the atmosphere on a weekday morning when it's not crowded and I can enjoy the sunny space -- or, in the winter, the sunlit room + the fireplace. I don't love all the strollers, but maybe I will one day if I ever have children of my own to push around and into restaurants.
