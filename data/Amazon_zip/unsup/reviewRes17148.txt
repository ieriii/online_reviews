Visually enchanting interior especially after a few of their fabulous mojitios or margaritas. The outside of the building is so unassuming, it's hard to imagine that the interior is really quite stunning. Upon walking in, the decked-out bar is the focal point in a room full of eclectic framed photographs. The main dining room features lofted ceilings and kaleidoscope-colored walls. The waiter we had(Elliot) was excellent and had great recommendations for appetizers and entrees. Still on a high from Top Chef Chicago where the season finale was held in Puerto Rico, I was eager to eat latin cuisine and in particular plantains-and I was thrilled with my dish at Carnivale -a pork chop entree and a plantain mash, prepared oh so delicately. Great people watching here, enthusiastic and educated wait staff, and superb food and drinks!
