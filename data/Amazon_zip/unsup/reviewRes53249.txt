This place is great for a quick bite during lunch or a chilled out dinner with some friends. Most of the seating is outdoors, and there is a really cool covered area in back with some couches tables too. We have gone a few times now and the food and service has been great. It's BYOB and they make mojito mix for you for a few $ if you want to bring rum instead of wine or beer. The kicker is that all of the food is really affordable, so if you are in the area and want some tasty cuban food, look no further.
