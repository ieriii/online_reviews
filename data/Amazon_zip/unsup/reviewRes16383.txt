I've been to Carnivale a few times now, and each and every time I have thoroughly enjoyed myself. The menu is an eclectic mix of Latin American cuisine - you can see Venezuelan, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and many others. Although it seems that everything is good on the menu, my personal favorites are the Ropa Vieja appetizer and the Arrachera (skirt steak) dinner. They also have a wide variety of mixed drinks, including mojitos, sangria, margaritas and daiquiris. There is also a very large selection of (sometimes expensive) wines to choose from. I really love the atmosphere of the large main room - if you make a reservation, you should specify that you want to sit out there. It's a little louder, but that is where to sit if you want to feel like you're in the action. I won't go into too much detail since it seems that there are plenty of others who have already done that for me. I went with 4 stars for the atmosphere, food, and service. The high price (can run close to $100 per couple, not including any expensive wines) and limited beer selection kept me from giving it a 5 star rating - but I'm sure I'll be back again on a special occasion.
