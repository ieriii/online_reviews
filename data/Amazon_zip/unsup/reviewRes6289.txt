Quite possibly the best ribs I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I wouldn't normally associate Wildfire with ribs, but ordered them for delivery assuming they'd be good. They're amazing. Never had a bad meal at Wildfire...this location or Glenview. All of the sides are fantastic. From appetizer, to entree to dessert. All good. Especially like the creamed spinach. French Onion soup, too. I could go on and on, but I'll stop, now.
