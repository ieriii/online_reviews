I STINK NOW! I'm going to see how I feel after I get home from work, change my clothes and have my jacket dry cleaned to get rid of the terrible smell of grease. I'm not sure if they need a ventilation upgrade, or if I'd smell as bad in any sandwich joint after waiting 30+ mins to order and sit. Until the smell is gone, I'm taking off the additional star I'd give the food. Ok, the sandwiches were good. Like, good enough to go back for if I'm looking for a rich sandwich in the neighborhood. Chocolate espresso was definitely the highlight, was as described. The chocolate chip cookie was good, but the 'rustic tart' was a pretty huge disappointment - at 4.50 it was incredibly overpriced, quite plain, and the dough was d'oh.  Don't avoid, but definitely don't bother waiting as long as I did for lunch.
