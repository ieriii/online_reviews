Yum-Mee!!! I love this place. My absolute favorite item on their menu is the mushroom emmenthal artopita. It is so delicious and filling!! I love mushrooms....and it is a perfect blend of mushrooms and that cheese...and the crispy...flaky crust they wrap it all in just brings it all together so well And don't even get me started on their desserts..Those chocolate mousse cakes....?? They just melt in your mouth...Super soft and silky.. I take slow bites and savor each one....Mmmmmm..... Lucky for me they're open late.....=)
