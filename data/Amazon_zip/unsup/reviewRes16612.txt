Flavor that assaults your tastebuds! My friends and I decided to go the family style route which is a great idea. More dishes to share and try! Ceviche tasting was great, Ropa vieja and empanadas appetizers were delicious. Heard that the guacamole is to die for. We all shared two entrees, a special (salmon) and the pernil. Both were delicious! The owners proudly declare that the restaurant as "Featuring 'Latino flavors with the spice of life,' Carnivale is a reflection of Latin culture and community, as explosive and passionate as the people themselves." They aren't kidding. One of my friends affectionately refers to this place as loud and latin. There's a spacious bar to wait and enjoy your raspberry mojitos and an even more huge dining area. Wonderful bright colors, infectious latin music playing in the background and tons of people having a great time. If you're looking for a quiet dinner, don't go to Carnivale. At times, it was rough to have to strain to hear the person next to you say something, but everyone is having such a great time that you let it slide.
