Went to Ruth's Chris during restaurant week to take advantage of the more affordable prices, and got what we paid for. My bf and I began with the same Pinot Grigio. When delievered (by a random server) his was clearly different, maybe a Sauvignon Blanc. Did the bartender not feel like opening another bottle of wine? The lobster bisque was delicious, and the salad was "eh." I was shocked when our salad and soup plates were left in front of us when we were clearly finished. When our sizzling steaks arrived, the guy looked confused because he had no where to put them! He had to take the steaks somewhere else and come back to clear the plates. I was not a huge fan of all of that butter, kind of grosses me out. The steak was very tender and cooked well. Maybe it was just a bad day, but with all the other great steak houses in Chicago I'm not going to chance eating there again. I prefer my steaks to taste like steak, save the butter for my potato!
