Lived in Miami for several years and this place takes me right back. Have yet to try everything on the menu but what I've had revealed no chinks in the armor of one bad ass Cuban restaurant. Prices are very reasonable, portions are filling but not overwhelming and the Cuban coffee might be..... no, without a doubt is the best I've ever had.
