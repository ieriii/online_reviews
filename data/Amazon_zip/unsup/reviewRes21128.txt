I really wanted to like this place because Rick Bayless is wonderful, but I just wasn't that impressed on my first visit. The torta I ordered was too salty and didn't wow me with its flavors. I had the mexican hot chocolate, which again, was a little disappointing. It might be a result of the great expectations I had coming into this place, but I thought it didn't quite live up to the hype. I would give XOCO another try though because the soup that the person next to me ordered looked great.
