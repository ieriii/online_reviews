I was able to get my room for $95 during St Patrick's day weekend and there is so way I could have topped that. The location is so convenient! The Art Institute is a 5 minute walk and there is so much to do just within a 2 mile radius. The entire weekend the entire staff was so nice and so hospitable. This was m first time staying in the loop and the next time I'm in Chicago, I will stay here again. In defense of the nay-sayers: -Parking is expensive but it is the loop in Chicago, so no matter where you are staying you will have to pay an arm and a leg. If you don't use the valet, your car is parked across an empty street in a secured building and it is a one minute walk. -The rooms are on the smaller side, but for a weekend in Chicago, who really spends too much time in their hotel room? You still get a bed, a desk, a closet, and an extra chair. -The entire weekend I was able to connect to the wifi from the Starbucks around the corner and I was on the 15th floor.
