Love the Red Dragon Roll and the Spicy Shrimp Roll. We have tried lots of the others and they are all delicious! This place is awesome! The delivery is done right too. Its a BYOB so stop by the CVS right across the street and pick up some booze to go along with your sushi. Service is always very friendly.
