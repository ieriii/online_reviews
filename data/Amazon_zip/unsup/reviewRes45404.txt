Woo Hoo is right!! FIrst -location is great as it's very near my place! :) But even so, would travel there for their Mac N Cheese, Blue Cheese Burger, & Sweet Potato Fries! My friend who is a Mac N Cheese nut (borderline obsessed :)) says this is the best in Chicago (and trust me, she would know!!) so we went there for dinner. I had a taste for a burger. Our other friend had a burger too.  For my side, I got sweet potato fries (and also ordered a goat cheese sauce that was, well, nothing short of amazing!) that were glorious! Helen got (of course) the mac n cheese...and we split. This was probably the best burger I've had..and that's saying alot! Good stuff! It was a Saturday evening, so they were busy! And, very accomodating. Good drink specials on each night of the week. Great atmosphere. LOVED it. Give it a try ya'll!
