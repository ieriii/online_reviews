sorry guys i know garcias is popular but really idk y! the price is ok but the food is so plain. no flavor! i also did not like my waitress. she has this attitude about her like i wasnt a important table cuz my bill was low. the place is so crammed in and i could barely hear myself think. this is not a place to go for good authentic mexican food
