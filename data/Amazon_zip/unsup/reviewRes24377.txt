When I agreed to go to Irazu, I had no idea what to expect. I had no idea what Costa Rican food consisted of and had no ideas on what to order. Frankly, I probably just ordered the wrong thing (some sandwich), but the fried plantains saved the day. Although they were a little strange for my taste, they were still quite tasty. The sandwich was very bland, and it was cramped and quite expensive for a place that seemed very "hole in the wall."
