If you are hungry, this is the place to go. They offer a HUGE buffet of every type of food imaginable from red meat to sushi. All you can eat for a fixed price (can't remember the tab but its not cheap - $55 to $65 rings a bell). Went here for a business dinner with a bunch of guys. Its a chain, so it doesn't have a lot of personality, but its the perfect place to chow down and talk sports. I'll definietly be back,,, when I'm really, really hungry
