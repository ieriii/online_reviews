Oh sweet, merciful, Holy Mother of French Toast. I will gladly worship at your altar of delicious. Now, I much more of a savory breakfast type girl. I am obsessed with poached eggs on some kind of bread product, preferably with a side of pork. But this. This may have made me a sweet breakfast convert. Giant fluffy slabs of vanilla brioche french toast with creme anglaise and a dark cherry and apple compote with crispy oatmeal crumble on top. Oh. My. God. That first bite made me forget all about eggs and want to steal all the french toast from the kitchen and run for god and country. I blame the French.
