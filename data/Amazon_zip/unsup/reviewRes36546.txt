While my client was getting fitted by Brandie T. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/) earlier today, Brandie mentioned crab rangoon from "Indie" so I went to check them out for dinner. Now how awesome was it that while I was waiting for my to go order, I was asked, "Would you like some water while you're waiting?" by 3 different servers?! Now that's service at it's best. The crab rangoon smelled so good that I couldn't wait til home and ate it all within 6 blocks!!! Yikes! Eh... I guess I can play the pregnancy card on that one? Ha!
