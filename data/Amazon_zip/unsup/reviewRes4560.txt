i adore the green mill. from what i can remember (nada), you must use your 12 inch voice while patronizing this place, at all times. the whole jazz ambiance is uber relaxing and can make a grown man cry (rick). the lighting is dim, which is a swell idea. the bar is old-fashioned (decor, bartenders, and cash only policy). this is a good thing. no phony bologna, check yo' shit (voice box), and hang your coat at the door. if you would rather die from 2nd hand smoke than that of a shark attack, come to the green mill. the odds are great!
