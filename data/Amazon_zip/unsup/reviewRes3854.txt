Side note- I had it delivered so the complete experience was not had; however, from what I did taste, this place has all the makings of a 5 start joint. Those soul sassy wings are big, juicy and ever so tasty. The slaw was good, not great but I realize that's not why you come here.  Very excited to eat my next meal at their place and experiment with some new flavors. Good stuff!
