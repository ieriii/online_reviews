It's dangerous for a Cuban restaurant to set up shop in my hood. Especially if it's the sister restaurant to the other 90 Miles Cuban, which, of course, it is!! Every time I passed by, the beautiful, brightly painted mural on the side of the building caught my eye. Couldn't wait til 90 Miles opened! After my week long Vietnamese food stint, I was off on a Cuban craving, specifically, empanada's. I made my way into 90 Miles and ordered a few things to go - 1 plantain shake, 2 guava w cheese empanada's,1 veg empanada and 1 meat empanada for the bf. The staff and owner are super friendly. The owner asked how I liked the place, and I told him I've eaten at the other location and was super glad they opened a 2nd location in my area!! They invited me to make my mark on their new walls. I declined as I was in a hurry and said I'd do it on my next visit. My shake and empanada's were ready in no time. I grabbed my things and went right out the door to catch the bus, whilst sippin on my plantain shake - SO GOOD!! Got home and ate my veggie empanada. It came with an olive oil sauce that was a delicious dip!! (So good in fact, I used the 2nd container to pour over my pasta dinner the following night!) Next was the guava and cheese empanada - !!! It was one of the best I've had in a while. The dough was delicious - crispy, golden colored perfection. The guava and cheese oozed into my mouth and my empanada cravings were more than fulfilled!! My bf later said that his beef empanada was also delicious!! Definitely heading back to 90 Miles Cuban, many more times - the patio, Cuban coffee and so many more items on the menu are calling my name!! They could be calling yours too, you just may not know it yet...
