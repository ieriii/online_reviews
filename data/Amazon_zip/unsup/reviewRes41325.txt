Absolutely my favorite restaurant of all time. There is simply not a better steak in the city. Yes, it's a chain,but in my opinion if a chain is successful, there is a reason. The 500 degree plates and steaks cooked in butter...so delicious.  I have yet to have something here that wasn't absolutely delectable. I miss the turtle soup -- bring it back!  The ceasar salad is awesome, and the black cherry martinis are by far my favorite martini in the world. Don't try to order it elsewhere -- you will be sorely disappointed. I've been getting the fliet and lobster combo for $39.95 and it is absolutely delicious. There is nothing about Ruth's Chris that isn't wonderful. The service is spectacular.  I would go here once a week if I could.
