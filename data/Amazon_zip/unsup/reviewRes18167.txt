So, I am not a fan of onions & I understood that ordering at XOCO would be challenging because the majority of Mexican dishes use onions. So after reviewing the menu I asked if I could have the Huevos Rancheros: 2 eggs, roasted tomato-serrano sauce, corn tortillas black beans, homemade fresh cheese for $7.50, with the sauce on the side. They said that this would be possible, but that there was no point since the dish would not taste good without the sauce. Huh? Are you kidding with me? How can it not taste good without the sauce? I am Hispanic & I have been eating tortillas w/ eggs, beans & cheese most of my life WITHOUT a sauce! So they suggested the French Toast instead. NO! I said. I know what I want & put the sauce on the side. With a sigh the put in the order. Pictures can be found in this link.... http://www.facebook.com/
