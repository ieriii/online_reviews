We went on a recent weekend evening. We had made reservations and sat outside in the smallish, somewhat cramped outside dining area fronting on Dearborn. It was a nice evening to sit outside. Shortly after we were seated we were presented with plates of barbecued potato chips and pickles (!). The chips were very good and, we reluctantly, declined the restaurant's offer, to provide more. Service was efficient. The barbecued baby-back ribs were very good (meaty, fall-off the bone good) as was the pulled chicken. A nice touch was to provide 4 different barbecue sauces for the table. The Kobe baked beans are also recommended. The wine list was larger than I thought it would be and there was also an interesting bourbon flight to choose from. Portions are large and it would difficult not to walk out without feeling stuffed. We would return.
