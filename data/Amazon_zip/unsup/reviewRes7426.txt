I lucked out on making it to "family night" with two friends and was amazed with the amount of delicious food we got for about $20/person. The service was probably the best I have ever had. My water was never past half full, even though it was a small glass. The lobster ravioli was my favorite entree, but the veal meatballs were a close second. The meatballs were so soft and moist: cooked to perfection. Also, I generally don't like the overwhelming fennel flavor in Italian sausage but Sapori Trattoria's Italian sausages, which accompanied the veal meatballs, contained the perfect potency for my liking.
