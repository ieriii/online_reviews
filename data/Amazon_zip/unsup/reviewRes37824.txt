After finally flagging down a bartender, I was served something strange and delicious. I just pointed at the taps and hoped I hit something good. It isn't hard to do, they have a wide and fancy selection. After that I started asking the bartender for recommendations. He let me taste test and I was usually pleased. It was packed though. I was there with a crowd and we were tight in a corner area.  Also - the bathroom door was really heavy, so I stood outside for a while thinking it was occupied before I finally gave it a good shove in frustration. Then things were good.  I would return.
