I believe most people would say this restaurant is the best Cantonese BBQ in the town. Personally, I'm not a fan of Cantonese BBQ but some pork and chicken here tasted really good. I think the downside was some of them were salty and I felt thirsty after the meal. Overall, it is a good restaurant, especially with a group and have different kinds of meals.
