The best pizza in Chicago! I realize this may offend some hard-core stuffed pizza fans out there but thin is just so much better... If you have been searching for the perfect thin crust, look no more! They also have abundant number of tasty appetizers that make up for the lack of entree choice. The atmosphere is relaxing and seats are spacious. You won't regret coming here!
