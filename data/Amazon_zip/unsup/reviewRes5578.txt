I wouldn't visit this place again, but I'm glad I marked it off the list. It was a fun experience, but it is extremely loud inside. If you're seated at the large tables where the family style seating is, it's also hard to have a conversation with your date. Here's what we had and what I'd recommend: Scallop Spiedini with Chickpea Aioli - This was awesome. Definitely would recommend. Pretty small portion but packed with flavor. Cauliflower topped with bread crumbs - probably my second favorite thing. Great flavor and texture. My fiance was not a fan though! Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes - Very tender. A little bland on flavor but was still good. Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde - Not a fan of this dish at all. Was very bitter. Sicilian Iris for dessert - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip filled Fried Brioche - This was a well done dessert. Beautiful fluffy pastry filled with cheese and chocolate. I wish it would have been a little sweeter. A glass of wine I had was bad. Waitstaff was great about it though and very friendly. I left feeling a little hungry and a little unsatisfied. If you only have a few nights in the city I wouldn't necessarily recommend that as a top choice, but again, glad for the experience.
