4 stars on the Chicago pizza snob scale is actually very good. I generally judge pizza with the hot sauce test. If I can put tabasco on it sans guilt, it really isnt good pizza. I would never taint Lou's with tabasco, and I put tabasco on everything! Dominos? Papa Johns? I will probably need a gallon of hot sauce, but none on good pizza. Not that I don't partake in non good pizza from time to time, but it just isn't the same. (deep dish) Art of Pizza definitely shouldn't be accompanied with hot sauce.  I walked in not really familiar with how this place works. I was trying to figure out how we were going to navigate getting what everyone wanted without ordering too much food. I was pleasantly surprised when the majority of the dine in people were just chowing down on slices. I was even more delighted when they had slices of stuffed spinach mushroom that day, which was exactly what I was in the mood for. I was feeling good after two monster slices but I wanted to try the thin so I went with a slice of cheese. Ironically, that left me with a strong craving for tabasco...
