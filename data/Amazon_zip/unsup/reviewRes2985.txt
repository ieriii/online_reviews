Fully expecting to be told No, we contacted TRU two weeks before our wedding anniversary to see if the Kitchen Table was available. Luckily for us, due to a cancellation, it was available! So, we booked the Kitchen Table and were very much looking forward to our evening. Two days later, the private dining coordinator, Ruthann Gagnon called to tell us that she made a mistake, and that the Kitchen Table was not available. A restaurant of this caliber should not make such a mistake in the first place, even worse to take two days to notice the mistake. It seems more likely that we just got bumped for 'important' people. Ruthann did reserve a private dining room for us at TRU's sister restaurant, a seafood place, but the room was not at all what we had in mind - can't see the kitchen, have to sit at floor level, etc. So we made arrangements elsewhere for our anniversary dinner. Extremely disappointing.
