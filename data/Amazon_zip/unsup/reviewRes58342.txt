It is true that the Hop Leaf has a wide selection of beer. I suppose that this is a plus if you are or you know someone who, instead of just ordering one of their standard favs, prefers to pick and choose between 20 or so different European beers, taste it and then tell everyone at your table how your beer tastes so different, and how it is so cool that it is served in a goblet-like glass, and how it tastes kind of like raspberries. This same kind of person would enjoy paying $7 or so for each one of these fancy beers. This same kind of person would order from the Hop Leaf the cashew butter sandwich (a fancy way of making a peanut butter sandwich taste bad), or some other high-priced, not-so-tasty meal. If you are this person than you will love the Hop Leaf. I am simply not that person. And, I thought that the mussels were no good. Why skimp on the garlic?
