I've been to all the fancy wine bars in the city and Bin 36 remains my favorite. It's absolutely huge so they can fit plenty of people and it's a really fun atmosphere. The waiters really know their stuff and do a great job of helping me select my wine. The food is fabulous as well....I really like the fish here.
