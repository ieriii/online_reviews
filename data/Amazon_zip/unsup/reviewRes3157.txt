This restaurant is only saved by their chicken wings; the rest of the food that we tasted basically sucked. Ordered: - 5 Chicken Wings: 4 stars | We got a combo of both sauces, and the spicy BBQ is definitely superior to the Sassy Seoul. Wings are a substantial size and are crispy and delicious. Try your wings with a bit of Allison's atomic sauce; it's a nice creamy balance to the sweet sauce. While snacking on these wings, I wished it was served with a Korean pickled radish to cut through some of the sweetness in the sauce. - Big Buddha Bowl + Bulgogi: 2 stars | The bulgogi is is dry and chewy, and the flavor is just meh.  - Radish Kimchi: 1 star - I would give this 0 stars if I could, but the minimum is 1. | It is awful... way too fish sauce-y, and the radish was a dry and withered. Also paying for kimchi at a Korean restaurant = wtf? Also want to make it clear that this is more of a Korean fusion place (or Korean with major American influence) instead of the more traditional Korean cuisine; I know I was expecting a more traditional Korean food experience, and that isn't what you get at Crisp. Service is brusque, and a bit of a turn off, imo.
