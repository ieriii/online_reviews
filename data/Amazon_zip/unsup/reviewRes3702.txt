This place is good. They do Korean Fried Chicken and some other stuff. I was feeling really cheap when I went and so I got the Chi-Town Chicken Bowl because it was cheap. For $9 I got two meals (my lunch leftovers were great!) and a soda. It was just what I was looking for. My friend got some fried chicken, which is what they do, which I tried and it was great. This was my second time there and both times all of the staff have been super super nice and helpful. All in all, no complaints.
