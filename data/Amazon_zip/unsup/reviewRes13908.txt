This is only a preliminary review since I only have been here once so I am reserving my judgement until I get more visits under my belt but there are some things I need to say. I have to say I have been anxiously awaiting for them to open, It seems like everyday I would walk by and look to see how much progress they were making. I also followed them on Facebook and awaited their grand opening. First impressions when I finally was able to go where these, very big space and large middle bar, friendly and attentive wait staff, and the tables for two where very long and made it hard to have a conversation over the buzz of everyone talking. Now to the food and drink. A friend and I ordered the mussel's for an appetizer which were excellent and they gave you a lot unlike other places that only give you like 6. I ordered a Workingman Burger which was very large and was tasty but not amazing. I also had the Cross of Gold to drink which was OK and tasty but not amazing. In other words it was just A-OK. Now my opinion can change as I go again and try other things out. Another thing, this was the first time I ever felt like I was at a Lincoln park bar in Logan Square, it had a very Lincoln park vibe to it. Not sure if I liked that or not. More to come.
