Came here for restaurant week and so glad I did. I could barely eat two bites of each of the three meats offered because the harvest table food was so good! I don't know how people can eat their entire meat selection...so much food! Next time I go I think I might just eat off the harvest tables because it had everything I needed - meat, cheese, vegis, fruits, and soup.
