This restaurant is pretending to be a "high-end" place. The whole experience was rather lackluster...I have been to places with better food and much better service. I wasn't expecting: 1. to never have my water glass refilled 2. to have not 1, not 2, but 3 bottles of wine not stocked...don't have a long wine list if you only have one bottle of each wine on the list! 3. our bread basket to never be refilled (there were 4 of us and it took our waiter over 30 minutes to even place our order) 4. We ended up order champagne instead of wine and on a small table with four of us, the waiter needed to have cleared off our unused wine glasses. But instead he brought out our appetizers and had no place to put them because we had our water glasses, empty wine glasses, champagne flutes, bread basket, salt/pepper, and plates on the table. This made for some very awkward maneuvering and I ended up having to stand up from the table. When we finally did get our main course it was flavorful, but like other Yelpers, the portions were small. I left disappointed and won't be back. There are way too many good restaurants in Chicago to come here again!
