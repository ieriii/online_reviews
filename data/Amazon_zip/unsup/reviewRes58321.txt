Welp, finally was able to get over to Shaw's for a meal and it was so disappointing. We had the in laws in town and had bought them a gift certificate awhile back for Shaw's because they always wanted to try it (and so did we). I ordered the king crab legs, which you would expect to be BIG king crab legs and they were tiny. Plus they over cooked them! I would not expect a high end seafood place with crab house in their name to over cook crab legs but they managed. On top of that my father in law got the scallop dish and guess what? OVER COOKED! They were rubbery and even had sand grit all over them...Can't even remember what my wife got, I think it was a fish dish and she was not impressed either. The only good thing we had was Oysters Rockefeller for an appetizer...but that dish is hard to mess up. So so disappointed..will never EVER go back and I felt bad because our bill was ridiculously high for crap seafood and my father in law picked up the check Go to Joe's Seafood insteadOh and the wine was super over priced too (of course, but just thought I would mention)
