My fiance and I ate here while spending a weekend away from Indianapolis. We ate at one of the hi-tops in the main bar area, which we thought had a lot of character. The Oyster Bar section looked casual and interesting as well, but the main dining room seemed a bit stuffy for our taste. Our server was courteous, quick, and very helpful when we asked him for suggestions. We actually went with his recommendation for Cotuit half-shell oysters to start, which were fantastic; the shallot champagne vinaigrette they served on ice was great with them. Next, we split a double Maytag iceberg wedge salad...also excellent. For our main entrees, we shared the seafood platter and the fresh walleye with horseradish crust. The platter came with a crab cake, some scallops, and three garlic grilled prawns. The prawns were the highlight of the entrees, but all of it was good. We also ordered a side of au gratin potatoes--they were a bit underseasoned but were otherwise good. I also found the draft beer selection to be very nice (Goose Island Matilda and Blue Point Hop were great!). Overall, we had a very nice dining experience. I would go back and suggest to friends.
