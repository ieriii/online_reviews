This place is absolutely amazing. I would definitely say this is the place to go for comfort food. They have almost anything that you can think of and some things that you never would've thought of (like pineapple-basil flavored cocktails). They will even freshly bake your dessert for you if you order it before your food and bring it out to you after you finish. Reasonably priced, I'd say... and excellent service. Can I just eat here every day? LOL. cause I probably would...
