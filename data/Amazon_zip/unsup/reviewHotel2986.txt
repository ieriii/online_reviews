The good: the view; location The bad: service non-existent (or rude when you get someone's attention) Dirty, dingy, tired rooms (stains on sheets, walls, really foul) Cheap furniture Air conditioning erratic and LOUD Poor lighting (don't even try to shave in the bathroom); dimly lit elevators Constant barrage of music. Very dated atmosphere. So many better choices (and cheaper).
