Sushi is great, but I couldn't get over the bad service. I think we saw our server twice, when we ordered and when we got our check (which wehad to wait 20 minutes before we can even ask for it), he was nowhere to be seen, didn't even stop by to se how things were or to refill drinks. Good thing their sushi is so god, otherwise I would NEVER go back.
