Definitely one of the best Persian restaurants in the world. Now I know saying in the world sounds like horse pooh, but it's true. I've been to Persian restaurants all around the world including in Iran. Noon O Kabab actually beats out most of the Persian restaurants in Iran. I've been going to Noon O Kabab since it opened up years ago and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger... the food has always stayed amazing! I am a huge fan of the Soltani, which is one piece of Koubideh and one piece of Barg. I can't stop ordering that, but when I've stole food from friends I gotta admit everything else tastes amazing as well. Last time I got the Gormeh Sabzi and Koubideh combo and damnnnn get in my belly! Ok writing this is making me hungry... I need me some Noon O Kabab. Crap this review is starting to sound like they paid me for it :)
