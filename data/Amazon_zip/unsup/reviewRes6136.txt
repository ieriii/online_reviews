Disappointed from the food expirience in chicago after testing the famous dip dish pizza ( uno) and some other places, my last day i took an hour and 1/2 walk form down town to little Italy. I was hoping to find somenthing you know ,kind of special there, while building a good appetite after a late breakfast. Well! davanti made my entire trip! i would have walked another 10 miles to get there....problem is! Los angeles is over a thousand miles away now that i am back here....but i will think about it! Best Italian food since i left my country...Italy ( florence). I will be back !!! either walking or flying in :) Buon appetito!
