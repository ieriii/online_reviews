Finally made it to Superdawg. My brother-in-law in town from LA asking me what a Chicago-style hotdog really was (AND Hot Doug's being closed for most of October) gave me the excuse to go. I panicked when I saw the menu. I had myself and 2 kids to feed. So what did I do? Get 2 Hot Dogs, a Cheeseburger and a chicken finger dinner. It was way overkill, especially since the chicken was not good at all.  The hot dogs were great. Just great. I wanted regular tomato to be strict, but the pickled tomato was interesting, even if you couldn't eat it off the hot dog. The burger has made a lot of lists around town. I was underwhelmed. It is good, but standard. The fries are crinkle-cut fatties and outstanding. The drinks come in those waxed paper cups that start to feel like they're going to collapse within a few minutes, but both my brother-in-law and I thought they were remarkably tasty. The fountain mix must have been perfect.
