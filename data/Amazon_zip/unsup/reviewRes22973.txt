A Must Try! One of the first restaurant that serves all-around authentic szechuan cuisine in Chicago! For those with a palate for spicy food - I can't even remember when I started coming here.  I order the same two dishes every time. Red chili pepper drenched fish fillet and baby pea pod leaves. They really do have less intimidating names on the menu but I'm embarrassed to say i still don't know what the dishes are called or even how to pronounce them. I speak chinese and must have had the same order 20 times. The baby peapod goes really well with the chili pepper sauce. If you're feeling the taste of the cuisine, also try the chili beef appetizer (cold dish - again I know my description is lacking but the waiters are helpful). Just be aware if you're allergic to peanuts or have a distaste for cilantro. They are key garnishes on the dish.  The restaurant also serves hot pot there. For those who are not familiar with it, I'll equate it to chinese fondue (like you get at Melting Pot) or shabu shabu if you've tried on the West coast. You cook all kinds of seafood, veggies, meat in a broth of two selection.  The chili one is my preference but of course there's a herbal broth for people who can't take the spice. You pay anywhere from $16 to $24/pp for all you can eat depending if you go on a weekday or weekend. The experience is fun and definitely more intimate.  There are a few places in Chinatown that serves hotpot and lao sze chuan is decently good. Try it in the winter, nothing's like cooking your food over a steaming pot of delish broth to warm you up. I want to say that the rest. is BYOB but I've never brought my own bottle there before and they do have a wine bar upstairs. It'll be good to check beforehand.
