Visited this place with my office collegues. I had heard about this place for good indian food. We opted for the lunch buffet. It starts with appetizers in which they served tandoori chicken. I didn't quite liked it since it was not authentic tandoori chicken, it had too much of artifical colour and taste was not good. Unlike Indian Garden the main course had quite a lot of variety of dishes. I tried couple of them like Chicken Curry, Dal Makhani and Biryani. I didn't quite liked taste of anything which I had at this place. The dessert section had Mango Ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Kheer. Gulab Jamun and Mango Ice Cream were awefull and kheer was too sweet. So my overall experience was quite bad and on top of that this place is costly as compared to Indian Garden on Ontario.
