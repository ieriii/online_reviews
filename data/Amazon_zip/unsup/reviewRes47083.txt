Great pepper infused bloody mary! Big fan of those. I went for breakfast and had an omelet with spinach, goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and roast garlic. It came with crispy potatoes and toast. It was awesome. The potatoes were super crispy, the wheat bread had that homemade feel to it and the omelet was perfect. My friend had corn pancakes with bananas slice on top that were equally impressive. My one complaint was that the breakfast items were all so similar. I think they could be a little more variety. But the flavors were great and the service was nice. I would go back.
