It has a buffet setting. You pay 50 bucks for whatever you want(excluding drinks). I'd go there for lunch, which is half of the dinner price. A 4.5 star place for sure. Great steaks. It was especially good for me because I don't like overcooked meat. Their gourmet salad bar is also great. From smoked salmon to fresh mozzarella cheese. It's sort of expensive, but it's a great place to pig out!
