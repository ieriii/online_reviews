I really love this place. I've been here 5 times or so, and each time I return after eating other places, the more I love this place.  So here is what I love about it: *Death of St. Germain- best gin drink in the neighborhood. It's awesome and I'd come here just for this awesome cocktail. The homemade ginger ale is also quite tasty. *Complimentary Cornbread/Beignets- enough said! They are addictive! *Catfish with a Curry Sauce- Seriously awesome curry which took me off guard because I didn't expect it from a 'southern food' place, but it's great. *Shrimp and Grits- Simple, but so rich and tasty. Besides the food and drink, the fact that this place is consistent every time I've been there is worth a lot. To me, there are many restaurants that can have a fluke good dish once in a while, but a consistent awesome meal and cocktail is worth that fifth star. True, sometimes the staff seems busy or 'hands-off" if you will esp. if they're busy, but I come here to enjoy not only the food and drink, but to enjoy my friends company and conversation so I've never felt ignored or that the service is lacking. For me it's the perfect mix of allowing us to talk and take our time while not feeling pressured to order, eat quickly and leave.
