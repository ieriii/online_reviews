The food was delicious as Vietnamese fusion and the staff was AMAZING and super accommodating. The owner is ALWAYS there to greet you and say thank you as you leave. He's an adorable, short Asian.  I recommend going for their lunch special Tu-Sun 11 am til 3 pm). It's around $7 (depending on which entree you want). You receive bottom-less squeezed lemonade or iced tea, a small salad, tofu soup, your entree, rice (except with noodle dishes) and dessert fruit. I always get either their sweet tilapia with tomato/pineapple sauce or beef pasta-Bun Bo Xao (although if you don't like fish, ask for it without the fish oil which always comes on the side). The egg roll you get is also some of the best, like a spring roll yet fried. If you like to drink, it's BYOB with no corkage fee. Also, CLOSED MONDAYS!
