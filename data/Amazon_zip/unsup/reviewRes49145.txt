We got there early... before 5 I think and had a great time. We got a couple or three 'flights', with a cheese and salami platter.  One of us had a hamburger, cut into four pieces. Another a bowl of Tuscan Tomato soup.. yummy. All really good and really fun Comfortable, friendly, trendy, clean, all good.
