One word - disappointed. I have Celiac and must eat gluten-free. I said that in my reservation and the "girls" at the front desk looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. The salad bar looked beautiful but since everything was sitting in a sauce, I couldn't eat much. The meat offerings seemed slim. Not as much offered as advertised. I have eaten at Fogo de Chao where the manager came out and walked me around the salad bar and explained which dishes I could not eat, and that there was one meat I could not eat. Brazzaz costs the same at Fogo de Chao so unless you have a buy one/get one coupon (like I did), go spend your money at Fogo!
