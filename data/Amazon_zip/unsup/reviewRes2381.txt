I was lukewarm about this place. We weren't too hungry and decided to wait in line anyway on Tuesday. I got the pear-infused elk sausage with foie gras dijonnaise and gouda cheese, one regular dog for the kid and and my husband got the bratwurst. Nothing seemed extraordinary. The elk sausage was a bit too dry and the sauce didn't balance it out. My son like the Portillo's dog better. and the bratwurst was meh. It can't say it was horrible though, I'm willing to try the place again on my next trip out there.
