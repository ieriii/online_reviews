Now that they have renovated the whole place, I love it even more. (Be prepared to take off your shoes before entering the dining area!) Of course youre going to leave here smelling like Korean BBQ, but you should expect that. The food is so good and the sushi is much better than it has been before. This is a place everyone should try... and if youre out late... great! cause its open 24hours. You'll need some patience with the waitresses because most of them don't speak english, but eh. The worst part of the evening is trying to park inside that damned parking lot. It's easier to find street parking and walk a little bit.
