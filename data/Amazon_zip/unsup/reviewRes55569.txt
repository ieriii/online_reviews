With the incredible wealth of world-class breakfast spots within walking distance of this place, it boggles the mind that so many people stand and wait hours on end for their ordinary food and amateurish service. Not that the food was bad, nor the atmosphere uncomfortable, but the appeal was completely lost on me. Don't believe the hype. Visit Flo, Milk and Honey, Handlebar, Vella. These bongos are played out.
