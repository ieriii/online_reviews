Service was good. When I went it was packed so we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, but it's not like burning through 45 minutes is difficult on the near north side. When they seated us they gave us chips and pickles. Chips were okay, pickles were AMAZING. I don't remember how they were made, but they were really good. And having food while you wait for your appetizer/main course is always a plus. We were originally seated outside, but when it started raining the staff immediately made accommodations for us to move inside--greatly appreciated. The 1 star off is for the main course. The food itself is amazing: ribs were great and I've never had cornbread this good, also having the 4 sauces was nice. But, the portion size is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure I got more coleslaw than ribs...the side dish is way too big.
