See, what you need to know is that I want to live in the 20s: Alcoholic bootlegging? Check. Cloche hats? Of course. The foundations of American jazz? Yep. Flouting conventional social and sexual norms? Hooray! Women's suffrage? I guess. Besides the voting you can find all of these things at Violet Hour. So obviously I fell in love. Plus I'm not really that concerned about declaring my voice in our political system (I jest! http://www.ontheissues.o). I wish every bar was the Violet Hour. Because then all cellphones would be silenced, every venue would be dark enough to make me look extra pretty, I could have rousing conversation at a decent decibel, and I'd be drinking nothing but unique and fancy concoctions of weird liquors and full flavors. If you ask me, you can scram if you don't like this place. But I'm just a sheba looking for a gin joint where I can tie one on and make some whoopee.
