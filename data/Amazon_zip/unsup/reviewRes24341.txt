No need to go to Costa Rica now that I've been to Irazu. The lively atmosphere feels like you're eating on a street in Central America, the great music keeps you energized, and then there's the food. Make sure you upgrade to the Costa Rican rice as the flavor is outstanding. The beef here is causing me to salivate right now. And then the oatmeal cookie shake is probably illegal. Go here!
