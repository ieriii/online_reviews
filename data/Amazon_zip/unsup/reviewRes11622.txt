i had more humor than i did with good food. the hostess told us to stand along a certain colored wall. apparently we were suppose to stand on top of a family of six in their booth as they were eating. we were seated at the bar and enjoyed people hanging out behind us, elbowing, and talking about their life that sucks. and i found it hilarious that the blonde waitress behind the bar said, "we have a special going on for our blood orange juice." after a couple of minutes debating, we decided to try out a small glass to see what it tasted like. looked at the bill...the special was 4 something crazy dollars for two sips of this juice. wouldn't go back on their price or their food. i make better things at home. the three stars are just because of the kind bone i have in me.
