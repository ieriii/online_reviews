GYROS! I loved this place. Went there last night to fulfill last minute greek food cravings. My boyfriend and I both ordered the gyro platter with the feta cheese appetizer. It was DELICIOUS! The feta was sooo, so good words cannot express. I'm rather a cheese connoisseur and thought the drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and savory black olives were a great touch to make a simple starter even better. If you do order the gyros, it's a large serving. Honestly, we should have just ordered one and shared, but it makes for good leftovers! This place seems great for groups (make reservations and dress nice) and to order many things to share!
