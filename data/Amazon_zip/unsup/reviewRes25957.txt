Yum, yum! I ate here again last night & am equally as satisfied. I had beef pho this time-absolutely delicious. I added a bit too much hot sauce, so by the end of the meal I was sweating. My fault though. I did want to mention, however, that they have this new "dinner for..." menu. My bf & friend split a dinner for two, which came with 2 appetizers, 1 salad, 2 entrees, and a big bowl of stick rice. Delish! Their meal was only $25.00 too! Yeah, all that food for only $12.50 per person. This is defintely the way to dine. They have dinners for 2, 4, 6, and 10. Wahoo!
