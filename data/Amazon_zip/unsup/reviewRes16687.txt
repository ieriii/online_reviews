This is the best Indian restaurant in Chicago (okay so my sample size is about 12).  I have only been to two other Indian restaurants since I discovered this place and that was only because my friends wanted to be cheap. India House serves high-quality Muglai/Punjabi (North Indian) cuisine. This is the only Indian restaurant in Chicago I would not be embarrassed to take guests from India to. The restaurant's decor is classy but not pretentious, the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable, the management is professional, and most importantly, the food is excellent.  Also, some people need to stop having double standards for ethnic restaurants. If you want high quality Indian food, stop complaining about having to pay for extra rice. That's like complaining that you had to pay for a side of mashed potatoes at a French restaurant.  Last but not least, try the butter chicken / chicken makhani. You may help Pfizer's sagging stock price rise by increasing the demand for Lipitor, but I assure you, for that hour you spend savoring it, you will be in heaven. P.S. The buffet is good too.
