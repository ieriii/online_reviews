My hubs and I pack up the kiddies and head to Superdawg whenever we need a little nostalgic pick me up. From the huge weiner sweethearts on top of the restaurant to their friendly "hiya," I'm sold on the whole experience. The pure Vienna beef dogs are delicious and the fries are soggy, salty and perfect. Everything is served together in a cute little greasy box, and you don't even need to leave your car! There's a reason it's a Chicago institution.
