Quite recently, my friends and I were having a huge party! We rented out a huge space, invited all my friends, had a DJ, and everything setup. Until I realized we had no one to cater food. Calling up the owner Tuan two days before he agreed right away! I've been into Simply It 5 times before and every single time has been a blast. So I thought why not? Vietnamese after all, is one of my most favorite cuisines.Tuan immediately took my order asked what I'd like and even gave me a free bubble tea just for ordering with him. We ordered quite a few things, lemongrass chicken, beef short ribs, chicken fried rice, dumplings, avocado wontons, beef and asparagus, sate shrimp and they all came with enough white rice!!! The price was probably the best part, it was all such great value. All this food fed my huge party the entire night everyone gave me big points for ordering from Simply It. Delivery was very fast, the food came on time with everything hot and ready to be served. When it first came in and was placed on the tables we had a frenzy of people running up to it and fighting for the avocado wontons! lol! Well what else is there to say? I love this place and it's food. It's got excellent value and Tuan if you're reading this thanks so much!!!!! I'll order catering for my next party from you again!
