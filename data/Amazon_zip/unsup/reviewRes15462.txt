I have only had delivery from Calos. And, I have delivery about once a week - usually Tuesdays. The ribs are great - tender, not too spicy, not too sweet. I also have tried several chicken dishes, all good. With each dinner order, you get soup or salad (I always get the salad), pasta or potato (I have sampled all , again, good). I always save the pasta for another meal. And, of course, bread, Which leads me to my only complaint about Calo's delivery. The butter is usually melted by the time it arrives. (They put the butter in the bag with the hot food, not the salad bag.)  Oh, by the way, the Tuesday night special is Ribs!!
