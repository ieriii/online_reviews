This place has great pizza and a good beer selection. I really enjoyed ordering a different micro-brew each time the delightful waitress came to our table. She was very helpful. There are also alot of TV's so you can enjoy your favorite sports team, stupid reality show, or news program while stuffing your greasy face. The place can get crowded but it's a great atmosphere for pizza and beers.
