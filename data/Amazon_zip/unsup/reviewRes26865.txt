Beer: Marisol Frontera's signature beer brewed by local brewery Goose Island. It's a Belgian style wheat ale brewed with citrus and coriander. It's fruity & creamy with a crisp finish (according to the menu). It was good, refreshing, and I'd get it again. I'm not a beer expert so I don't know how else to describe it. Food: Street Food Trio - $19.75 Potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamzula) - this one was my least favorite out of the trio. I don't know what Tamzula is, so it must've been the Tamzula that made me not like the potatoes. Skirt steak pellizcadas (smoked cheese, balsamic, chipotle) - Very good! It was small, but super flavorful. You can definitely taste the chipotle. The meat was soft, and it was just yummy overall Sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile) - Also very good. Pops with flavor! The amount of food in the street food trio isn't much. There are two of each dish but they're all very bite sized. Oaxacan style carne asada - $29.50 red chile-marinated Creekstone Natural Black Angus rib steak. Black beans, sweet plantains with homemade crema, guacamole. Holy moly! This is the most expensive and the tastiest carne asada ever. So yummy! =) The angus steak was very tender, well marinated. Not too salty. The plantains were perfectly cooked and the crema was the perfect topping. I'll definitely be back to try more of Rick Bayless' genius dishes. =)
