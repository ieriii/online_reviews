Waited for about an hour and finally got a chance to taste Rick's food and I'm sad to say that it was middle of the road. Had the margarita at the bar while I waited which was amazing but when I ordered it from our server when we got sat, the taste and presentation was different. The service might need some attention but I'm more disappointed with the food that was served. I can't believe that I paid so much for so little. The taste from my epanadas was off and the margarita needs some consistency. Sad but will try again another time
