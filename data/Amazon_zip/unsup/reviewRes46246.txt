Stopped into the Grand Lux for after dinner drinks and some dessert. Both were were perfectly fine. The dessert I had was the Warm Sticky Bun Bread Pudding , which certainly hit my sweet tooth spot. The server was, however, a bit of a douche. Two of us ordered the Chocolate Martini and he told us the bartender hates when people order them because they take 30 minutes to make. One, I'm not buying that and Two, why would you tell your table that? He had other douche-y elements, but really not worth talking about.  A couple other observations about this place since it was my first time here. The space is HUGE. The Menu is HUGE. The portion sizes are HUGE. And the wait is LONG. While being walked up to our table, I noticed that EVERY table had bags of food to go. Everything about this place is HUGE. Ridiculous. I probably wouldn't want to eat dinner here, but the drinks and dessert were good enough. Restaurants like this and the Cheesecake Factory are the reason why America is Fat.
