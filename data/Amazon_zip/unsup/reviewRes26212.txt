The atmosphere here was perfect for a romantic date and the food was very good. I normally don't dig fondue but it certainly let me have a lengthly and leisurely dinner with my wife. Very dim and moody with a Spanish guitarist playing literally feet away (thought it was a record playing until I looked to my side). Seating was rather tight as was table-space (our fondue plates were nearly falling off). Food was tasty but felt like a bit too much grease for my tastes. For this price, I'd prefer to have my meal prepared for me, but it was still a nice treat. If you come here, make sure you reserve a BOOTH and come with a small group.
