Went here for the first time and was surprised by the amount of food. We ordered way too much with burgers and wings as appetizers. The wings are big and they are supposedly famous for them. We tried the buffalo style ones and the sauce wasn't great, but not bad. Good amount of spiciness. The burgers were great! They even have their own website (http://www.triplesecretb) They are very large, probably bigger than a half pound patty. The best part is you get to customize your burger by choosing one item from each three categories: sauce, cheese, and toppings. There are probably 50+ combinations and they have some unique choices to choose from. They also have 6-7 pre-designed favorite burgers. Burgers ranged from $10-14, so a good price for the amount of food you get. Wings are $10 for 8 so they are kind of pricey, but they are bigger than normal wings. We sat in the outdoor seating area which they definitely tried cramming as many seats as they could outside so it was a little uncomfortable. The best part about their outdoor seating is they have two large flat-screens outside!! So if you are trying to catch a game, you can still sit outside and enjoy it. Supposedly there is a lounge/club downstairs and a room for private parties upstairs but we didn't check any of that out.
