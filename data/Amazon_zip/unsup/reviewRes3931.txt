3.5 stars the wings were tasty - bbq and seoul sassy. got a little oily near the end which always makes me a little nauseous. also shared the big boy buddha bowl which was basically standard bi bim bop. all good but nuthin spectacular. left feeling full but not happy like i usually feel after a great meal. plus, the idea of a korean burrito just seems wrong. prolly shouldn't knock it til i try it but think i'd rather have great seas/take me out or k town.
