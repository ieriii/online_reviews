A Cuban treasure! Fresh authentic cuban food, the best coffee in town. Try the Lechon dinner, melt in your mouth pork with rice and beans. Their home made hot sauce is just amazing and just the right amount of heat. I wish it was the space was bigger, don't expect to hang out for long, but maybe that is the point, get your amazing food and GO! Decor is very ingenious, probably what a restaurant in Cuba looks like today.
