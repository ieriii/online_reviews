LOVE THIS PLACE! I have been here twice, once with no reservations and once with. The first time we didn't have reservations and waited about 45 minutes for a table. Not too bad when you have your own bottle of wine to drink! The second time we had reservations and sat down immediately. Regardless, both meals were phenomenal. The crab "lollipop" appetizers are fantastic and the Volcano roll is outstanding, I could eat 5 of them as my entire meal! Sushi can get really expensive if you do it right, luckily at Coast you can bring your own liquor and that cuts down the cost drastically. 4 of us had dinner and were stuffed (sounds weird when you talk about Sushi, but we were) and our total tab came to $98. CHEAP! I will be back as soon as I can get over there!
