Yummy. The only word I can say. Very crowded on a Sunday and of course no one in my party thought to make a reservation since there was 5 of us and a baby. We waited about 45 minutes and got a decent table in the back. I had one of the best burgers I have had in a while. Sweet potato fries were delicious as well.
