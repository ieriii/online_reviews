I went here for a bday party. I personally think it'd be a better date place as they seemed a little overwhelmed by our group of 10 and the dishes aren't really sized to be shared by more than 2, 3 max. Here's the rundown: The Burrata was flipping amazing as was the Whiskey mash. For these alone, I will be back. To those of you who aren't big cheese heads or whiskey consumers, I say this: DO NOT leave here without trying the cornbread! I can't even describe the deliciousness. There's sweet corn and salty and smokey something going on...I think a tingle just went down my spine thinking about it. Unfortunately there a few reasons Gilt bar doesn't make the big 5: 1. It's a wee overpriced for what you get. I'm not shy about paying good money for my food, but if I'm going to, it'd better be damned worth the price. Here, the drinks are marked up as are several of the dishes (fyi. for those of you looking to just order a main course and be sated, you won't be. You will have to order apps and maybe dessert.) 2. The service was unbelievably slow. I arrived a little after my companions and it took 20 minutes for me to place my drink order and another 10-15 before I got it. And don't get me started on how long it took to get the food 3. Maybe I need to try other things on the menu, but the aforementioned items were all that really wowed me of the 8 dishes we ordered. I found the others to be decent, but pretty uninspired. All in all, the few dishes I liked, I REALLY liked and I will be back for those...but I'll def take a much smaller party.
