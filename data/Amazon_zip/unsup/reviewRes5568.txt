This is the kind of place you'd want to go with people you really like.  I went with two friends on a Saturday night. As we walked into the restaurant, Benny and the Jets was playing and everyone seemed to be having a great time. It really felt like we walked in to someone's house party, and all the guests had gathered into the kitchen! The food is served tapas style, where you order several plates and share with everyone in your party. I loved their Mortadella, Balsamico, & Pistachio Smear, Whipped Feta with Cucumbers, Prosciutto Bread Balls, and their Milk Braised Pork Shoulder. We also ordered the Clams with Rosamarina, which I would not recommend. It was unimpressive in taste or size (but still not cheap either). I really enjoyed my meal at The Purple Pig, but it's hard not to love a place whose motto is "Cheese, Swine, & Wine."
