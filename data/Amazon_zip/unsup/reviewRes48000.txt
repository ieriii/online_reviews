Review of Brunch: apparently the new trendy meat now is Pig. If you are not into that the remaining options are not that exciting. (exception is zucchini bread - i did enjoy that). Otherwise none of the meals seem complete- they are all missing something aside from taste. The majority of the taste is from fat and cholesterol rather than distinct flavor. Even if you like bacon I would pass on the pig belly fat and instead purchase some lard with maple syrup. The only "booths" are actually barnyard stables which is perfect for fat people who eat this type of food. Im not sure how long girl and the goat has been around and which came first but Im assuming this was a lame attempt to copy the trendy rustic heartiness of G and G.
