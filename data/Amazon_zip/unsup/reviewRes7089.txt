The Good: The quality of the meats are superb. St. Louis Spare Ribs and Pulled Pork both of very high quality. Hush puppies are excellent and the complimentary pickles are very good as well. The Bad: Ribs were a little light on flavor and falling off the bone-not ideal for ribs in Chicago. My dining partner actually asked me if I thought that they were "par-boiled" an unacceptable way of cooking ribs in our town. I told her that no, they were not par-boiled but had simply been cooked for so long in the smoker that they became "overcooked". The pulled pork was better. Nice smoke ring and good flavor. Pork shoulder is a meat that demands low and slow cooking. Ribs do not. Carson's has nothing to worry about. They are still rib champs in Chicago. The Ugly: Where to start. Well, here goes-$3.00 for 8oz of diet coke with no refill. $11.00 for a very small pour of JTS Brown Bourbon-Wow, didn't see that one coming. Mediocre service. Too many hosts standing around doing nothing. Dirty plates sat on our table for 15 minutes before they were finally cleared and the place was more than half empty. $25.00 for ribs that were just o.k. This is BBQ for tourists only. Real Chicagoans stay away!
