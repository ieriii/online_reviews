One of the main contenders in the Great Chicago Pizza Wars! I've been to others (Lou Malanti & Gino's), & I think this one wins. Went there on 12/23/11 - No bar & feels like a National chain, but the deep dish pizza is the best. The appetizers & pizza portions are huge. The service is good, but pizza is made to order so takes 35 - 45 minutes -- best to have an app while you wait for the amazing main (BTW if you like cold pizza for breakfast - one slice of deep dish the next day or for a midnight snack, can't be beat!
