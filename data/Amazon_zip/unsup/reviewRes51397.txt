Y'know, I should've known I was in trouble when I read one of the reviews here on Yelp and it talked about how great Garcia's is because it doesn't put much heat in its dishes. A Mexican restaurant without spice? Chi-Chi's on line 1! And I should've taken notice of the review that praised this place as a good spot to hit up at 2am. But I didn't.  Los Nopales, my usual Mexican standby, is closed on Mondays. And I was craving Mexican something fierce. So I dragged my boy there on Monday, against his own protests. The salsa had no heat and the chips were mondo-greasy. And the guacamole? Meh. Anyone can smash an avocado up and call it guacamole. But there's more to it than that. Apparently Garcia's never got the memo on that.  I had chicken in mole sauce. The chicken was ok, but something about the mole sauce was just off. The boyfriend had the skirt steak, and the steak was not cooked right - it was tough and chewy. There was no heat in anything - it was boring, Americanized Mexican food.  Two stars for the margaritas. That was the only redeeming feature of this meal.
