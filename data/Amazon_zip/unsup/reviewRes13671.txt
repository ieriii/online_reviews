I have always been meaning to stop by since moving into the neighborhood but always remember while walking by on a Saturday or Sunday & the place is always jammed packed. FINALLY made it to Glenn's this past Friday for lunch and LOVED it. One of my friends had the Reuben & she devoured it. Another had the Maple Ham & Swiss which was delicious. I had the Chicago BBQ which was great but had a lot of fat on it. The mac & cheese made with 10 year aged smoked cheddar that came with it was to die for! I'm definitely coming back for dinner!!
