Ive been here a couple times for lunch and got the vegetable sandwich. It is pretty good. Tonight I got the tofu dinner. it was just okay, I dont really know what I was expecting. As a vegetarian, this is not a place that I would be excited about going, I have always been dragged there by others. i did have a goat cheese empenyata that was very good though. Next time ill just get a plate of those.
