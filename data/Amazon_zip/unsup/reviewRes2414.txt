went to HD for first time last month...went early to avoid crowds (10:40 am) and was lucky, only five people in the queue! talked to Doug himself as he takes your order, who is a super guy. after his recommendations, i had the chicago dog, polish dog, and fries. man, it was all good...had to go back to pick up some dogs to go and the "encased meats" souvenir t-shirt. driving around California Ave the next day about 1:20 pm, thought we'd get some lunch...and the line to Doug's is snaking halfway down Roscoe!? looking at an hour and a half wait....oh well, we got really lucky the first day.
