I want to love this place but I can't... They told me my pizza would be delivered, "within the hour" and it took an hour and 20 minutes. I can deal with that. The deep dish was good but not great. It was very atypical. I'm not sure if I could tell the difference between their deep and gino's, gioradanos, ect. We also got a thin crust which I didn't care for, the crust was still quite thick and it just didn't have anything that screamed, "DELICIOUS". Not that this is a shocker but it was $40+ for 2 pizzas.
