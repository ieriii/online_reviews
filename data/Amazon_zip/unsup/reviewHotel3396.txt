Stayed here on a groupon deal. I think this hotel is such a cute little boutique hotel. They refurbished the hotel with a modern look. The rooms were spacious with a sitting area. Again, stayed here to celebrate a special occasion so I didn't get to spend much time in the hotel. Staff was very nice, rooms are clean, lobby nice.
