I hobbled here with my mom the day after I had a minor surgery. The staff must have known that I was suffering because they treated me with incredible kindness. Most importantly the pizza was excellent as was the salad. Have been back a few times since but the service wasn't nearly as good. This place is not to be missed though-- delicious food for sure!
