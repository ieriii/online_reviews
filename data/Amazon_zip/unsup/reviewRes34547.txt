As much as I love Sultan's, I'm not a dummy. Anyone else notice that as soon as they opened another restaurant and started running commercials, food prices went up, food size went down, and they started charging extra for everything? I'm not an idiot, Sultan's. I'm onto you! That said, everything else is great. This location is single-handedly responsible for keeping me from starving to death when I was poor. Dip into the salad bar and get pickled turnips put on your falafel sandwich. Trust.
