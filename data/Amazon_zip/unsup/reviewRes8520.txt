Just don't do it. Seriously a circus and by far one of the most over rated restaurants in Chicago. I went to a comparable Brazilian steak house in Memphis about a year ago and was impressed with the quality of food, knowledge, attentiveness of servers and intimacy of the restaurant. None of these things describe Fogo De Chao, which sadly I learned while taking my parents there. They seemed to like it but it was hard to tell since you can't really hear much in this place. I say if you want meat, go to one of Chicago's many fine chop houses and skip this madness.
