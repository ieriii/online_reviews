I had heard about this little pizza place a while ago, and finally had a chance to try it. I also was prompted by a recent review in Timeout, which compared it to Coal Fire Pizza. First, not sure how they could compare the 2, as the style of pizza is like comparing apples to peaches. Yes, they both use an oven heated by fire. That's about it.  Anyways, back to Spacca: Went on a Friday night, just before they really got busy. Yes, per the complaints of some other reviewers, there is a wait until all of your party has arrived, but that is their policy, stated upfront, and I don't see it as a bad policy. I have seen restaurants move tables together for a larger party, only to have some of the extra table space go to waste when part of the party decides not to show up. For a small restaurant on a busy night, this policy is totally in line with an efficient business plan. There was a short wait for our table, but it seemed like every 5 minutes the manager/hostess? or the owner was coming around with a sample of wine, or cheese, or pizza! My only suggestion would be some more space for those waiting, but due to the actual size of the space, not sure that's possible, without losing tables to be seated. I don't know Italian, so I had many questions for our waitress, who answered everything in a friendly manner, and made some great suggestions to our party. Not a huge wine list, but excellent wines that complement the menu items! I recommend any pizza with the authentic Italian sausage. And the mozzarella they use is amazing. That said, this IS NOT Chicago-style pizza! This is authentic, simple Napolitan pizza. The room tended to be a bit noisy, but it is not designed to be a quiet romantic 5 star French restaurant. The way the owner went around to the tables, it was more like a big family dinner with waitstaff! And a handshake from the owner on the way out, thanking us for coming? Very nice! Overall, a great experience, I will definitely be back.
