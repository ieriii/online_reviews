I have eaten in all of the Brazilian steakhouses in Chicago and without doubt Fogo de Chao is the best. The service is very slick and their salad buffet is better than Texas de Brazil's and significantly better than Brazzaz. All steakhouses make a good effort with their meats, however Fogo still trumps the other steakhouses mentioned above. The breads, sweet banana's (whoever thought of putting banana's with steak is a genius) are all very well done and your server will keep on filling your plates as soon as they look even half empty. If you want to try one of the best steakhouses in Chicago go here.
