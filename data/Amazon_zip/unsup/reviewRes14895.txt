Nice bartenders, tasty drinks, and in-house brews. I went there for drinks with some girlfriends and I loved the atmosphere (except all the giant fists everywhere made me a little nervous). Also, who doesn't love a bar where everything is CLEAN (especially the giant, gleaming fists)? While I didn't partake in the food, the woman next to me at the bar was eating a burger and it smelled delicious. I want to come back on a Saturday for the free tour, a burger, and a beer.
