Great Place!!! Awesome spot to take a date for a nice drink or a few. The seating if very cool allowing you to feel like you have lots of privacy, but you're also part of the mix at the same time. There's nothing I could think of that they haven't already thought of. Very cool and different types of drinks, the lighting is awesome, it has that cool low lighting that makes the experience feel that much more romantic and intimate. The fact that there's no signage just adds to the cool factor of the place, especially when you're bring people there from outside the neighborhood or people who haven't heard about it. Its a great place to have a drink before dinner or if you need a chill spot to have a couple drinks and talk.
