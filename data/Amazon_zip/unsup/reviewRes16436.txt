Being from an Indian background, I am particularly harsh when it comes to critiquing this cuisine. This place is actually one of the few I can recommend! My girlfriend and I were visiting the city and were craving some good Indian food. We ordered their Feast for Two, and it was truly worthy of its name. We were given our choice of soup, a salad, unlimited Naan, a curry and a platter of various Tandoori foods. Lastly, we had a choice of dessert and some tea. Everything was very good, not the best but very good nonetheless! Best of all, the place was clean, modern, and a great value!
