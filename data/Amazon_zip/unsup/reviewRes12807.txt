In the 8 years I've lived here, I've probably been to Cafe 28 6 or 7 times and it's been consistently wonderful. Having purchased a groupon for this place recently, my most recent visit took place last weekend. We didn't make reservations and tried to get in on a Friday night. Though the place was packed, it only took about 20 minutes to get a table for 2 and enjoyed mojitos at the bar (which were made 6 at a time but very well nonetheless). The delicious fresh-baked bread comes out with a honey/jalapeno/chipotle butter that is absolutely mouthwatering. I ordered the cuban-style chicken and my husband the ropa vieja. The chicken was succulent, perfectly cooked, and very flavorful. The ropa vieja is a staple here and I would highly recommend it to first-timers. I was just a tad taken aback by the waiter's forceful and very transparent pushes of ONLY the most expensive items on the menu. Other than that, service was impeccable and I've never experienced that otherwise. Everything that I've had on the dessert menu is fabulous.
