this place is cool and i have to say there is really nothing like it in chicago. i ALMOST feel like it's trying a LITTLE TOO HARD, but it's worth the wait and price. the drinks are super chic and made with ALL homemade, natural, and fresh ingredients. no super sugary drinks here. even the ice cubes are freshly cut. yes cut from an ice block. wow. this place seems like it stepped right out prohibition except it's tres chic. i love the decor. and the fact that it has a plain plywood exterior makes it that much better. yes, you will wait and yes it is a little pricey, but like i said it's worth it. i love the no cell phone policy. this place is quiet so it would be super annoying if i had to listed to some suburbanite yelling to her friend on the phone about how crowded soundbar is. i love that the bouncer wears a tux and make EVERYONE wait. i think it's funny and it usually weeds out the d-bags who think they are too cool. u know the ones im talking about. the guy with the embroidered ed hardy button down and blow out. ya that guy who's girlfriend is probably wearing a bebe dress and 5 platform shoes from guess. the violet hour is not for you. please go back to soundbar or crescendo or wherever you came from. thanksi do have to say i liked this better when it first opened and only chicagoans knew about it. now there are way too many people from places like naperville and downers grove waiting in line complaining. i do wish they had more food but they still get a 5 star review b/c i adore the fresh cut ice cubs, decor, and tuxedos.
