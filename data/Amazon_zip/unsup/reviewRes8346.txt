Meat, meat and more meat.... This place is great if you are a serious carnivore. The filet mignion is great and so is the house special cut. The salad bar is fantastic as well. If you go here, there is no way that you will be walking out hungry. More likely they will have to roll you out of here! Great place and great service.
