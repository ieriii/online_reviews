We were out of town visitors and we heard this was a deep dish pizza place. We received the recommendation from the concierge at the hotel. We were so disappointed with both the pizza and the service. First, we were told it was an hour and a half wait for a table for two. We decided to stick it out and waited...it was crowded which in our minds confirmed the reputation of having amazing pizza. They did allow us to place our pizza order early in advance of being seated (after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting). All of a sudden, after two hours, we're still waiting to be seated, when and we notice people who came after us getting a seat. When I checked on our seating, they had sloppily written my name wrong and called the wrong person. OK..fine. So next, we get seated without even a hasty apology. It took 10 minutes for someone to come and take our drink orders. When we get the pizza 20 minutes later, it was a wrong order (we ordered half and half, we got an 80/20 split), the pizza was half cold, and the dough was undercooked. By this time we were starving, so we ate it anyway. When my friend asked for anchovies, the person we asked began to ignore us after we waited more than 10 minutes. Finally, I flagged another waiter and he got it and returned after 5 minutes with a bowl full of anchovies. He placed it on the table rudely. By this time, my friend was almost done. We paid and got the heck out of there. Although most people say Giardano's is a great place, we found it a disappointing and terrible experience.
