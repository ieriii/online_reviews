It's a lot like Cheesecake Factory. Big, big portions that are bold on taste and seasoning. I really did enjoy the food. Its price compliments the hearty servings, but the same thing that has turned me off to the Cheesecake Factory, turns me off here. There seems to be an arrogance in the air of many of the people who patron here. Again, the food is good, but an institution that serves burgers, Asian stir-fry, and lasagna all at once seems just a bit...pretentious. The attempt is more than laudable, but the outcome falls a tad short. I would rather the menu be more focused for I have no doubt that the food makers in the back have the talent and skill to hone on specialties (which there are a few). I want to see more of that. With their attempts to please everybody, they in turn draw in everybody. Meaning, when we visited, it seems like the entire Chicago Loop population was crammed into the restaurant and lobby. Yeah, it has a freakin lobby. This tells me that masses of people visit here, which tells me it's probably a bit overrated. I hope I'm not sounding like a hater, because I really did enjoy my visit. I just think that in a town like Chicago, there are plenty of other food joints to visit first before here.
