Besides having to wait a WHILE to get a table, I'm always nothing but satisfied with this place. I always take a nice group of friends here. It's a BYOB place so you either like it or not. I personally like it since it gives me an excuse to bring my own girly drinks. The food is always fresh. My favorite rolls: Dragon, Una Avo, Philly, and the Rainbow~ YummmmYy!
