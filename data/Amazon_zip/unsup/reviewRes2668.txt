really.... i just don't get it. i have been here multiple times. i have reallllly tried to understand what the fuss is about. i've had the duck fat fries, i've had some crazy sausages. but i've never been really satisfied. those fries do NOT merit the block long line that develops on fridays and saturdays (really people?!? come on....). i used to frequent hot doug's at their old location on the other side of the river, but back then you could get a hot dog without waiting in line for an hour. the food is good, and i can definitely appreciate the unusual sausage variations, but the hype surrounding this place is so ridiculous that i would rather go anywhere else to get my hot dog on.
