Probably the BEST Mexican restaurant in Chicago, hands down. Well at least the best Mexican restaurant on the north side. I'm only sad they're closed while they're remodeling. EXCELLENT Mexican food, they're fajitas are awesome and really filling, so filling I had to take the rest home in a doggy bag. Some other things that are pretty tasty are they're huge tacos and burritos and they're wicked enchiladas. They make a mean drink too, especially there margaritas. So if you're in Lincoln Square and not wanting to eat at the many bougie restaurants that line Lincoln Avenue, head to Garcia's and get your Mexican grub on
