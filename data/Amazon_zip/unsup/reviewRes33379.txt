Another one of those, I'd go more stars but reviews.... I'm a clean fanatic, so for this very reason alone, I probably under any circumstances go back. But I do go back willingly, even eagerly. Must be because it's good. Kinda like my old dating days, there was this one bad boyfriend, you knew it was going nowhere, why continue, well...it was fun. That's this falafel sandwich for me, I'm just addicted to it, I don't know why, and I will look the other way when it comes to the dirt. I just love the falafel sandwich, get it extra spicy. My husband likes the lamb. The lentil soup is very good especially with lemon squeezed in. Rice is good, but not worth the dinner upgrade. Good place to run in and pick up some pita and hummus to have on hand instead of the generic stuff you get at the grocery store. Take out is very fast and efficient, everything is ready right up front, so it's ready and you can see if it looks fresh. Parking is near impossible, some people park on the little street just North of North Ave., partially on the sidewalk, its really not legal parking and run in. I haven't seen tickets, however I only do it with someone waiting in the car. If you're dining in, close your eyes and eat. Don't worry, what doesn't kill you will make you stronger. Update: We tried the delivery service, food arrived fast. Soup was hot and the falafel was crispy. Usually something gets lost in have dinner delivered. So we're big on just pizza, however this I'd do again.
