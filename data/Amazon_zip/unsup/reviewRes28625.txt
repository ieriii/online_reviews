When I came here a few years ago on a work trip to Chicago, I had no idea who Rick Bayless was. Now I know he is the man responsible for inspiring a new wave of Mexican cooking in America, has a cookbook, a television show (along with multiple appearances on other hit cooking programs), a line of spices and salsas, and is the executive chef and owner of Frontera Grill, established in 1987 and still pops up on the hit list of Chicago's best restaurants. Well, now his wife runs the joint, and she is doing an incredible job. This place is delicious! Bayless has an impressive menu, and having gone here with a large group of co-workers, not a single person was dissapointed. When I was here I had a Sea Bass dish, which now, looking back on the menu the closest thing to it is the Pescado en Crema de Calabaza: Wood-grilled day-boat catch (salsa negra glaze), spicy/smoky butternut crema. Roasted garlic spaghetti squash, lime-dressed arugula. I mean now doesn't that sound good?! Come on Rick, give NYC some love and bring us a restaurant!
