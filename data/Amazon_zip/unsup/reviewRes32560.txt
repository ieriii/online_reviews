We went here because the reviews said it was a cut above the rest of the Chicago Ethiopians places. And it was. It's a little more Western-paced and less laid back than some of the other African restaurants we've been to. The tables are western, no traditional woven mats or anything, but at about 8 o'clock, when the traditional dancing lessons begin... it becomes clear that eating here is supposed to be an Ethiopian experience. I'm not going to promise that you will get lessons in chest-bouncing dancing every night, but this place starts out very respectable and then gets quite lively as the night goes on. You're not just coming to eat. You'd do well to arrive late on a Friday and expect to stay a while for dancing. The meal is what you might describe as a variety of curries eaten with injera soft low-gluten flat bread. It's not literally Indian curry, but that's the idea. The servers create your meal with you based on a brief discussion of the menu, which has some complexity to it. If you drink, you have to drink the honey-wine of course, though there are many other options. I wish I remembered all the details of the meal but I am writing this review a month afterwards and all I can recall in detail is the chicken pastries. I'll have to update this when we go back.
