Taking advantage of a groupon coupon I decided to use this for Valentine's Day, so the price was right for what is typically a pricey hotel. The staff here is very friendly and nice offering us a late checkout, but we had to go to work the next day. The room was nice and plush. The bed was comfortable. Our view wasn't that great, probably the worst of any other hotel I've stayed at in Chicago. It was smaller than what I was used to but it was just nice to get away. I was a little surprised that they didn't have free bottled water considering it's more of the higher end of the Priority Rewards end of the chain, and we got bottled water at a Hotel Indigo. I like that there's a Starbucks attached to the hotel.
