i am in here in the very least once a week if not more. everytime we have a guest in town we go here. every week i go in for the CBJ. the beer list is amazing and always being updated with new local and world beers. The bartenders and servers are fantastic. this has to be one of the best places in the city to enjoy yourself, they dont allow kids! and if you weren't sure if you were and asshole when you went out you will know when you go up and get pissed that they don't serve bells oberon in the winter, or at all. branch out and ask one of the bartenders for a suggestion, they will help you out for sure. if you're genuinely into trying something new on tap or a beer snob looking for a flemish or trippel this is your place. cheers hopleaf.
