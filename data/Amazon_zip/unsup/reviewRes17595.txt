I had high expectations for Carnivale after reading the reviews and was slightly let down. I loved the atmosphere and the decor. I got the raspberry mojito which was excellent. My entree was the arrachera, which is grilled skirt steak. It was ok- nothing to write home to mom about. The waiter walked us through the entire menu. He was a little overly helpful. I think I would come back here more for the drinks and the atmosphere than the food.
