What a disappointment for 2011 Restaurant Week. I've always been a fan, but when we visited for the prix fixe menu we found our steaks just not up to Ruth's delicious standard. The 12 oz ribeye was very thinly sliced and ended up over-done when served on their extremely hot plate, so much so that we had to send one back for a do-over. My husband felt like Ruth's had brought in steaks substandard to their norm just for the specially priced Restaurant Week menu. When compared to the Capital Grille that we also enjoyed during Restaurant Week, our meal at Ruth's fell disappointingly short.
