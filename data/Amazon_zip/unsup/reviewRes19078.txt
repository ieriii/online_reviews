Came here on my first day in Chicago for breakfast. We were determined to eat as much Rick Bayless food as possible. It was a great start to the day. The Chorizo was amazing and the churros were excellent as well. The hot chocolate was very very chocolaty, but exactly what I was hoping for. I will definitely be here again next time I am in Chicago!
