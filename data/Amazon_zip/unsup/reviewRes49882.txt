After a night of drunken debauchery, it is recovery time. That means some hair of the dog and good food. The Fifty/50 delivers! Order a Bloody Mary with a huge piece of thick cut bacon, olives and celery in it, served in a glass rimmed in spices. Or, enjoy Mimosas, brought as a carafe of OJ and a bottle of bubbly in a wine bucket to your table. Follow that up with their thick-cut, maple soaked bacon. And it is maple-soaked. So if you don't like your bacon served slathered in a pool of maple syrup, then it may not be for you. Sugar is my hangover cure, though, so I love the stuff. The fried Wisconsin cheese curds are awesome. As are the nachos, served with guacamole, tomatoes, cheddar cheese, sour cream and an cheese bechamel. I like to add the skirt steak. Best nachos on Division. Hubby likes mac and cheese as his hangover cure, and they do it right here. You have your choice of what they will add to it. Hubby always gets his with chicken and bacon. The wings here are awesome, too. If you want to catch a Bulls game, this is the place to do it. The walls are covered in TVs. And, there have a great outdoor seating area. They have patio heaters blaring to ward of the spring chill, but it's in the summer that this patio really rocks. Service here is always fast and friendly.
