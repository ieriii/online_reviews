I've had dinner at Publican a few times, but this weekend was my first foray into Publican brunch. I really liked it! It is a rare occasion that I do not order an egg dish at brunch, but for some reason I just was not feeling the eggs that morning. Instead, I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with dried apricots and maple sugar and a side of maple braised Publican bacon (which was more like pork belly). We ordered a few orders of frites for the table, which came with garlic mayo for dipping. I was really pleased with my breakfast. I love steel cut oatmeal, and this was perfect - it had a little bite to it and wasn't mushy or gummy as oatmeal tends to be. The maple sugar provided just enough sweetness, and the generous amount of dried apricots added some tang. The pork belly was also pretty good. It was a bit fatty (but isn't that really kind of the definition of pork belly), but the flavor was excellent. It is a generous portion, so I would recommend sharing. The frites were yummy, as was my breakfast cocktail (The Orchard - whiskey, hard cider and some other stuff). Service was friendly and quick, especially given the fact that I was with a large group. Publican has earned a place on my brunch faves list!
