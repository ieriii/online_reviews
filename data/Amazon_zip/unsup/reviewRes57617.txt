I tried this place for the first time. It was packed and our table were next to other table which i didnt care too much about. Fondue was nice experience, seems like product (meats, seafood, cheese) were good quality. However i didnt know that you pretty much deep fry everything which is not that good and healthy, i know some Asian places use water instead. Indoor air quality was not sufficient in terms of ventilation, therefore i got a headache from burnt oil and my coat absorbed lot of that smell too. Interesting place, but i wouldn't come back. Im happy i tried it though. Its expensive, seems like they are trying to sell you an experience rather them nice prepared food.
