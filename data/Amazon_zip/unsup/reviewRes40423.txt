Now I've been to the La Padasita on Elston and it's one of my favorite places in the city. This La Pasadita was good but not quite the same. I had the carne asada burrito, and I must say it was still pretty on point. Make sure to ask for everything you want in it because they won't but most of the basics in without asking. I will defiantly be going back to this place. Also, the horchata here was literally the best I have had yet in the city, smooth and just darn good.
