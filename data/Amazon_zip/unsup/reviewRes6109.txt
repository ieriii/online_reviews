I have heard too much of this place from various sources. Finally we came on a week night to no wait but still busy restaurant. We ordered Honey comb + ricctta - really amazing combination. Opens up brand new possibilities to spread on toast. Truffle egg toast- another yummy combo with toast Crispy pork belly - ok tasted porky Roasted beet - who knew beets goes well with walnut? Linguine + sea urchin + crab - never thought sea urchin is good on pasta. Absolutely wonderful experience with new food combinations that stimulates the tongue. This is food experiment done right.
