Oh, what the hell, since it's on the front page of Yelp every time I log in, and I've been here half a dozen times, I'll review Hot Doug's. It's good - probably the best hot dogs you'll ever have. However, you're still working within the limited range of Hot Dogs there - so bear that in mind while you're expecting culinary ecstasy. The duck fries aren't much better than the regular fries, and the line outside is annoying. But once you start eating at Doug's, the idea of going to another hot dog place just seems silly. You've already reached the pinnacle, so why bother with anything less? Fortunately for me, the hot dog craving comes only about every couple of months, so Doug's is more like a quarterly pilgrimage for me. If I was a true Chicagoan and needed a hot dog each week to survive, I'd be spending a lot more time standing on the corner of Roscoe & California, because there truly is no better place for them in the city.
