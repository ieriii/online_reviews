The food is fantastic, the service attentive and adorable, and what's that? Oh, yeah, it's a BYOB! If I lived a little closer, my boyfriend and I would be heading here every couple weeks! After bookmarking Caro Mio over 3 months ago, I finally made it in. That is the one downside to this place: no reservations, so get there early or be prepared to wait a LONG time. Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of food and the ambiance is great. It's small, but I love the funky, bright art on the walls and the plants by the window to shield the restaurant from the sidewalk without losing the natural light. My group of 3 decided to all share our meals. We started with the polenta which was good, but didn't realy blow my mind. You could tell the tomato sauce was homemade, though. We also ordered two of the special entrees: Gnocchi stuffed with pesto ricotta in a tomato cream sauce (definitely my absolute favorite-incredibly light if you can believe it from that description. yummy pillows of hand made gnocchi with and intense, basily, cheesy center.) Lobster Ravioli: Lots of lobster stuffed in each ravioli with an incredibly rich cream sauce. I'm really glad we shared because I'm not sure I could've eaten an entire plate of this. It was almost too decadent for me. Our third entree was an eggplant rolled with cheese, rice noodles and baked with more cheese on top. It was yummy and a great, lighter dish to break up the heaviness of the other two. Um, yeah, even with all that cheese, I consider it "light" since it contained a vegetable. Ha! They were out of the tiramisu which seemed like a tragedy, but our super sweet server took the blame as it seems he's the one who usually makes it and he was out of town. Oh well, guess I"ll just have to come back!
