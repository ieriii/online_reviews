BF loves Giordano's. Being lactose intolerant, I figured I would indulge his love of deep-dish pizza while settling for a salad or sandwich. However...I decided to ask if I could get a pizza without the cheese, and the answer was surprisingly yes! Maybe it's not the same without the cheese, but it's not like I would know the difference. I ordered mushrooms, so they put them in the layer where the cheese would have been.  I really liked it! I had the house salad while we waited the 40 minutes for the pizza to be ready. It was very fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette was flavorful. We came back for lunch a few days later and got the individual-size stuffed pizzas. Definitely a great deal, and you can call in your order ahead of time so you won't have to wait once you arrive. Lactose-intolerant pizza lovers rejoice!
