If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine at a reasonable price, this is the place for you. While this delicious restaurant is in an unexpected area (perhaps just for me since I don't usually frequent Wilson Ave.), the food gets two enthusiastic thumbs up. We started with the bruschetta special, which had slices of freshly cut mozzarella cheese drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It was by far the most delicious and perfected bruschetta I've had in my life. Most places, the bread is either too crisp or too soggy. This bread was perfect with a great garlic flavor, the fresh tomatoes were seasoned well and all together with the slightly melted mozzarella, well, let's just say I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I then moved on to my main course. I again chose one of the specials which is pretty standard for me when trying a new restaurant. I had the asiago and pesto stuffed gnocchi with a hearty meat sauce. It was amazing, almost like little pillows of fluffy deliciousness. The meat sauce had a robust flavor and didn't overdo the meat to sauce ratio that so many other Italian restaurants fail. The only real downside to this restaurant is that it is so small. If you are trying to have a large group meal, I wouldn't recommend doing it here. My only other small critique of this restaurant is that the olive oil they serve on the table is quite salty for my personal taste (and shame on me for not trying it before I added salt and pepper)! When I used it the second time without adding salt/pepper, it still seemed quite salty but is definitely something I can overlook in comparison to the rest of the quality cuisine.
