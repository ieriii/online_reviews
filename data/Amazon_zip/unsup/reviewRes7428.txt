I went here last night with a group and 7 and it was wonderful! We sat outside and it was a perfect Chicago night. The service was great....our drinks were never empty and then since this was a going away party...they brought us a dessert plate....such a nice added touch to finish a great dinner! There were so many wonderful things on the menu it was hard to narrow down to just 1 meal. I went with a pasta and seafood dish and was very please with my decision. Everyone in the group was very happy with their food.
