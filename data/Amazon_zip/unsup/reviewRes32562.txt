One of the best places I've eaten at this summer, and hands-down, the best Ethiopian I've had. This place is a gem. Had lunch there a couple of weeks ago and it was great. We got one of the meat spreads, the kind where you get a bunch of dollops of meat on the big circle of sponge bread, and everything was really tasty, really interesting, a true dining experience. Nice place, too, and the server was very nice. Not sure if Ethiopian is for everyone, but if you like spicy food, like something different, and want a great experience, this should be at the top of your list.
