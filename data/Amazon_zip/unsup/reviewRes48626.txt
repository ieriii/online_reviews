Of the 5 days I recently spent in Chicago, we dedicated at least 60% of our waking time to food and eating. At The Publican, we ate fantastic salad, silky cheeses, perfectly prepared squid (sourced as it turned out from my hometown), and sweetbreads, oh the sweetbreads. The food was simply fantastic, five stars in the category of gastropubs.  Negative three stars however, for the deafening noise. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, put some acoustical tiles on the ceiling. I understand, indeed I admire, the desire to encourage conviviality in an atmosphere like the Publican. But I assure you no one enjoys shouting at table mates, at servers, at hostesses. And shout you must, if you are to be heard. Please please please spend a little cash (for goddsake the place was jammed at 9 pm on a monday) on some noise dampening measures, restaurants are as much about the experience as the food.
