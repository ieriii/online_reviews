I love love love the inside of this bar/restaurant. It has an incredible feel when you walk inside with the large carved wooden bar, the stained glass over the lights on the ceiling, cozy booths in the back, and great seating area with leather chairs near the fire.  I usually order the mac n' cheese here which is incredibly cheese with bacon, tomatoes and a nice crispy topping. The shepherd's pie is also pretty yummy. If you save room for dessert they have ice cream pie from Bobtail which is of course yummy too. It's Irish and British type food to complement the Oscar Wilde decor.
