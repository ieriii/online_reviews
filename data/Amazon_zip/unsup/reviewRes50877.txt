my husband and I went on a Sunday night, after the Bears game. We randomly picked it. It was quiet inside - around 7pm. For whatever reason they seated us in between two couples, you know those tables where you can hear what the couple beside you is talking about... which was weird to me because the place wasn't even busy - were they trying to create the illusion of a busy place... one can only wonder. husband ordered the crab cakes dinner - they were mediocre at best... too bad. The side sweet potatoes with nuts were good. I got the grilled chicken with mango salsa - the ck breast was very good - nice and marinated, juicy and yummy. The sauteed spinach was outstanding, very small portion though. Cornbread was not "corny" enough - tasted too floury - we didn't eat it - which is such a shame, because you'd think they would have mastered a staple such as a cornbread - My cosmo was okay - all in all - don't think we'd go back... better choices for cajun food
