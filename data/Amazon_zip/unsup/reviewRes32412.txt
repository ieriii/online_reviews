I was taken here for Mother's Day. He knows I don't like to eat the same old stuff and I was so pleased when he told me we were coming here. We had the Beef Sambusa as our appetizer. It was really good even my daughter ate it! It reminded me of an empanada. He ordered the Ye-Shrimp Tibs which were little shrimp marinated in honey wine, rosemary, Awaze sauce and pan fried with green peppers, onions and tomatoes (yea i copied this off the menu) He said it was ok, he has a hard time with tiny shrimps. He loves those huge ones so I think that was a turn off for him haha I ordered the Michetabish which was finely diced prime beed fried in a pan with ginger, onion, cardamon and white pepper.  This all came on a huge platter with this type of pita bread...well it wasn;t pita bread it had a different texture. You rip pieces off and just scoop everything in there and eat it.  I got full really fast, which is really odd! So we took the rest home. I was very satisfied with my meal and I was pleased that my picky daughter even ate some.
