Hot dogs are a curious thing to review, because how much can you really say about hot dogs? But then again, growing up in Chicago makes you a little unaware to the fact that a seemingly simple snack food can be quite easy to screw up. My personal favorite for hot dog places is Portillo's, so take my review with that in mind. Even considering the fact that I would more often choose a chili dog over a Chicago-style dog (and yes, I like my hot dogs with ketchup, so suck it up), I found the Superdawg really delightful. It's that home-style, sure-thing, never-let-you-down meal that is good time and time again. The dog itself was very flavorful (not full of water), and the toppings are of high quality. I had a Chicago-style dog, which comes with relish, mustard, chopped onions, a pickle spear, green tomato quarters, and optional hot peppers all on a poppyseed bun. The dog comes neatly packaged in a Superdawg box stuffed with crinkle-cut fries that are fried and seasoned to perfection. So why is it that I gave this place just 3 stars instead of 4 or 5. Yes, the dog was great, the fries were great too. But when you go to Superdawg, it's not that you'll have a hot dog that tastes better than a $100 steak. It's an experience. It's about standing in line (or waiting at the drive-in), ordering the Superdawg like everyone else (no ketchup!), and not having a table to sit at (though there is a side room with a bar area). Living in the suburbs, I'd gladly take Portillo's over the 40-minute drive on your run-of-the-mill weeknight. But if I'm in the neighborhood, I would still consider Superdawg a must.
