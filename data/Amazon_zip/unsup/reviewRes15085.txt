Still haven't been able to eat here as it's always WAY too crowded to even sit down, but the beers are very good. I'm always up to try some new homemade brews and this place seems to have one of every kind. Maybe one day the crowd will die down just a tad so I can actually sit and have some beer and possibly try some of the food...
