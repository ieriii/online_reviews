We stayed here for 3 nights in June 2011. It was clean, well kept, and definitely affordable. If your looking for a spa experience, this isn't it. At all. Not even close. However, if your looking for a clean, safe, affordable place to stay while exploring Chicago - with weekend rates of $79 bucks a night, and a free and safe place to park your car it doesn't get better than this. Some quirks which I personally didn't find to be a deal breaker: *DO bring soap, shampoo, hair dryer, etc. *The entire bathroom was yellow. I mean YELLOW! It was hilarious. The tile, the paint, the shower curtain, you needed sunglasses in there in the morning. *The towels are small, thin, and scratchy. *There were no towel racks or hooks to hang your wet towels. I thought it very strange, but on the other hand, the floor is fine since they'll bring you fresh ones anyway. *The air conditioner pumped out room temp air loudly and we were unable to adjust the temp or the level at all. Pretty sure the controls were just for looks. All in all, we have very fond memories of this place and plan on coming back next time we're in Chicago.
