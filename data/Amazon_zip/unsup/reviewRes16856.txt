One day last week, a friend and I decided we were starving for lunch and needed a place that served food in large quantities. There's a Thai buffet near where we work (Michigan and Chicago), but it lacks suitable vegetarian options. I searched on Yelp and found India House and their lunch buffet. My life will never be the same. Getting to India House required a much longer walk than we would normally venture to take during a lunch break. In the pouring rain. The whole way there, my friend and I kept saying to ourselves, "This had better be worth it!" We arrived, dripping and famished. And we were not disappointed. Everything was excellent, including the service and the ambiance! And, in addition to the buffet, they bring you unlimited sizzling tandoori chicken to each table. And they have chicken tikka masala, a personal favorite! We'll definitely go back. Maybe this week. Yum!
