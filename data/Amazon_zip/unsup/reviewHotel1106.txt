This place disappointing for a high class hotel. Service is only marginal, staff is a little ridiculous and they nickle and dime you along the way. It's definitely nice decor, nice location but while i was trying to have a business phone call in the morning before i checked out, maid came by 4 times throughout the morning (as early as 8.30am) although the checkout is not until 12. I expect a lot more from a hotel of this class.. Also when i got there stuff like coffee, drink glasses and such was missing.. once again a high-class hotel like that does not have second chances when it comes to some of these basics. I would say go to W Lakeshore or Four Seasons if you want a nice place to stay.
