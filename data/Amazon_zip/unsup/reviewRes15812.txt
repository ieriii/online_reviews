I have been checking back obsessively since I first came here in March to make review #666. Perhaps that is a bit ridiculous. I don't care. Just know that when it comes to the number of the beast, Violet Hour is going to have one hell of a review. I'm gonna get it out of the way. You don't need me to tell you this place is good or bad, cuz you're gonna go to it anyway. Those 2-hour waits are happening for a reason. This place is good. Great. No shit. Would *I* wait 2 hours to get in? Oh hell to the no. But being that I waited a solid 10 minutes, I'm all down with the Violet Hour and their spiffy gin cocktails and scrumptious donuts.I don't even like donuts. After all, I just learned what a bismark and long john is. Speaking of the donuts, if you're a girl with a figure to maintain, you should know that if you go with the likes of the one and only Johnny T, and he asks if you're interested in eating donuts, just remember Johnny T don't like to share dessert and will order you a stack of donuts of your very own to try and resist. SIGH!!!
