I recently dined at Caro Mio for the first time and fell in love with everything about this restaurant. The restaurant is very small but in a warm, cozy kind of way. I didn't feel over crowded even though there were a lot of people sitting closely together. In fact, that was part of the charm.  The service was amazing from the moment we stepped in....everyone from the waiter, to the bus boy to the owner were all excellent. We never had an empty glass; we never had a dirty plate in front of us and even though there was a wait to be seated we never felt rushed. The waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu as well.  We ordered bruschetta and it was amazing - it was the best I've ever had. Our entrees were very rich and warm and delicious as well. The owner takes pride in walking around the restaurant and talking with the guests which enhanced the experience as well.  We chatted with him for about 15 minutes and he was so thoughtful and genuine. We also saw him bringing around trays of bruschetta to all the guests that were waiting for a table - you can't beat that.  Fantastic service, amazing food, good atmosphere - great restaurant!
