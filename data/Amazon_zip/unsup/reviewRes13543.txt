I've never had a bad experience here. It's that easy place to go to where you know exactly what you want and you can expect to have a good time with the people you're with. Favorites: popcorn rendered in bacon fat (why didn't I think of that?), cheddar ale soup, hombre burger, mushroom goat cheese pizza and bread pudding. I think their beer is good. My friends who are much more astute in regards to beer always find something they like. Therefore I highly recommend this place if you a) like beer and are into that local thing b) like good food to go with your beer c) have a friend or 2 or 6 to have a good time with d) all of the above.
