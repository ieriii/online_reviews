Great @ Beer: Well curated beer list here. They had Left Hand Imperial Stout on tap, rarely spotted in the wild in these parts. Emphasis on hoppy IPAs and Belgians (shocker!) Great @ Food: Edmund Fitzgerald burger was win. I'll try it med. rare (bloody) on a pretzel roll next time but medium on a toasted roll was also good. Hand-cut fries were long in the oil and extra salty, as God intended. Ketchup was fine... not ready to get a Top Chef boner for freakin' ketchup. My hard-to-please companion's house-made veg burger was judged outstanding. Nice job, Bapple. Ppl: Mostly packs of youngish folks. Didn't see the stroller set around 9 on a Fri. nite, did see a smattering of geezers. Pro tip if you're in the latter category, bring your readers to parse that tiny type on the beer menu. My one dick comment would be about the art. But for once I'll keep my negative opinions to myself.
