The pizza here is great. All of it is good, thin, stuffed, deep dish....  Man this place is great and only a couple of blocks away. The only complaint I have is that when you are not getting a slice, there is usually a crazy long wait when ordering from the menu! Spend more than $10 and get a free 1L bottle of pop! How can you beat that! Pizza here tastes a helluva lot better than the other popular Chicago chains.
