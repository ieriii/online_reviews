After reading so much about Longman & Eagle, I had high expectations, but the restaurant easily exceeded it! This is definitely one of the best restaurants I've eaten at here in Chicago. My bf and I arrived on Saturday shortly after 7pm, thinking we were somewhat early for dinner service. Boy were we wrong! We were quoted a 2 hour wait, however, we lucked out after five minutes of standing by the bar when two seats opened up! People, if you don't want to spend two hours waiting around the area for your table to open up, go to the bar! We were able to order from the full menu and the service from the bartenders was excellent. We ordered 4 dishes: the roasted bone marrows, scallops and oxtails with potato gnocci, the pork belly confit w/ butternut risotto and finally the pan roasted escolar w/ clams. All of the dishes were delicious, but my favorite was probably the scallops and oxtail dish. We were told that it was only going to be on the menu for a little bit longer, which is sad. Keep this dish on the menu!!! So glad I was able to eat here.
