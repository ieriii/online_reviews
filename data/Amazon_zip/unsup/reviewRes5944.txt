An okay place if you're in the mood for okay food and all American bar/restaurant. We (three of us) checked it out on a Saturday night after an art show in the near bar area - made reservation first. We had the signature salad and burger - salad was way big, burger was juicy. Overall not a bad experience. The warm and cheerful waitress and front desk people are definitely a plus.
