Wow... all of the sushi was amazing! I ordered the Peter Parker roll and it was fantastic. The texture and taste combination was outrageous and I will definitely get it next time. My friend got the mango roll (sorry I forget the name) and the tempura sweet potato roll. I didn't get to try the mango roll but she swears by it. I got to try a piece of the sweet potato roll and it was spot on. The ambiance was nice, too (small so may get busy on a weekend). Another plus is outdoor seating for nice weather.
