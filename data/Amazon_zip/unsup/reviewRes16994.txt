There is not a more beautiful sight than returning to your table with a plate full of buffet food to see a plate of sizzling tandoori chicken and a basket of warm puffy garlicky naan awaiting your return!  A very good buffet with a wide variety of curry and even biryani. I liked the atmosphere (definitely get a window seat!). The mint chutney really cooled the curry off as did the fresh slices of cucumber and tomato. And don't forget to hit up the desserts, mango ice cream and kheer (my favorite). YUM.
