I was hoping Bad Apple would be my answer to Kuma's long wait and further commute. And yes it was, but Bad Apple burger was not as amazing as Kuma's. I thought the ground beef seemed to be loosely packed compared to other burgers, but when eating a burger, I'm in a carnivorous state and going for the kill. I want a nice juicy, full-body bite. My friend ordered the Strange Famous, and he said it had nothing on Kuma's veggie Neurosis burger. I do like Bad Apple. They have a great atmosphere, great beer and cocktail list, and some decent burgers with creative toppings. I say they put together a pretty solid program.
