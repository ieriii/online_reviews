I had a corporate meeting with the higher ups. They all love Chicago pizza and trust my guidance when it comes to food. We had the spinach pie and another sausage, mushroom and onion pie. All delish, I love the corn dough! The only thing that I didnt like was the ordering process, the lady who took my order seemed annoyed with me order so early (11am). Besides that it was a good experience.
