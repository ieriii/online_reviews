Barf. We just got Opart delivered and each of the three dishes we ordered were disappointing. I got the peanut lover's, which was oily and required me to order noodles/rice separately. Boyfriend got the bami pad paak, which was the equivalent of ramen noodles in soy sauce. BFF got the bami pad lard nar, which was a tub full of gelatinous gravy with a few pieces of tofu swimming in it -- accompanied by...nothing. No noodles, no rice. Nothing. Just gravy. I've eaten in here before and I remembered it being much better than this.
