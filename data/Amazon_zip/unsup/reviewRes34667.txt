I thought I'd be blown away, based on yelp reviews, but ultimately I thought Sultans was just OK. Major pro's are that it's cheap and it has a pretty big menu. But I definitely had some complaints. I got the falafel sandwich, and the only question the guy asked me before whipping the sandwich together in 10 seconds flat was "mild, medium, or spicy". I guess I'm just used to places like Roti and build-your-own style, but I wanted to pick some toppings! He just plopped in hummus, a tomato/onion/cucumber mix and the sauce and wrapped the sucker up. And frankly, my one and only choice of "spicy" was for naught, b/c I did not detect a single hint of spice. As for the components, the falafel themselves were ok, not too greasy, but they weren't amazing by any means. And the pita was falling apart - I could barely eat the thing, and ultimately had to give up and just eat it with a fork. Prices are cheap, and I'd probably go back because I live near by, but I think I'll stick with the salad bar or plates instead of sandwiches.
