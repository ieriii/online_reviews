I love W hotels. This one is definitely not my favorite one. We opted for this one over lakeshore to get two rooms for a bachelorette party in April because I was able to get a better airline industry rate at this one. The rooms are quite small. The girl at the front desk was helpful she was able to get us connecting rooms. However, we had to turn one of our rooms from a one king to a one queen. I didn't even realize such a thing as a one queen bed room existed but ok...the rooms were the exact same size except in the king you didn't really have much walking room. Also note, the king room didn't have a real door on the bathroom but a sliding one that was pretty see through. Can be a bit uncomfortable.... However, my main issue with this hotel was the lobby smelled BAD. It kind of smelled like sewage. They were doing construction across the street which may have caused it but either way it was gross.
