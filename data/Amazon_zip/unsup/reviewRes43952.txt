if u want to try this place on the cheapee-cheap, now's the time. they just reinstated their prix-fixe special which includes the house salad, choice of 3 entrees (beef, chicken, or salmon), & choice of 3 desserts for $19.95. everyone in our party opted for the prime rib, which when brought out kinda resembled a junior meal... but to its credit, was very tasty and ALL were cooked to perfection at different levels of doneness....wow. all 3 desserts were equally delicious.  & lastly, they validate for the parking garage next to the restaurant but not for the one across from it.
