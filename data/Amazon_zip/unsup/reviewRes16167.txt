I was here in June 2010 with the boy, and we had a romantic, relaxed date. The line system is a little weird because they'll take reservations for groups of 6+ and make smaller groups wait in line. The bouncer was very nice and fair, which made this policy a little better. We were seated in giant chairs, and we just started feeling relaxed immediately. Although it's not too loud, everyone is chatting and laughing.... and no one is obnoxious. Our waitress was fairly attentive and gave us some good advice on the drinks. We loved everything we ordered, and the night made for a great memory and a great first weekend in Chicago.
