I don't know why I've put off going to this place for so long but now I'm kicking myself for it. I had the Falafel and it was one of the best I've had. It is all totally authentic, cheap, and healthy, and to me that is the holy trinity of restaurant characteristics. There is so much good food there I have to go back and try it all. The only way it could improve is if it accepted credit cards. Don't be like me and put this place off. You will love it.
