4.5 stars Enjoyed my experience for dinner at sprout! The ambiance was warm, and our waiter was so friendly and knowledgeable. The "vodka" and "aviation" were both delicious drinks (probably prefer the vodka drink since it was a bit sweeter than the more citrus, acidic aviation.) The veal appetizer was so tender and fell apart perfectly. The diver scallop was seared to perfection and was well complemented with the citrus. I had the salmon which was cooked about medium, and I really enjoyed it. Also tried my friends' poussin and bass dishes- both were excellent. But I felt the entrees were slightly less memorable than the appetizers. Finally we finished off with the "pineapple" which comes with a cinnamon-sugar doughnut with tropical fruit. Next time, I'd like to try the "chocolate" which the waiter told us is inspired from the elementary school days of dipping your french fries in the Wendy's frosty (totally delish if you've never tried this). Overall a great experience with creativity that was well-executed. Will definitely be back for brunch!
