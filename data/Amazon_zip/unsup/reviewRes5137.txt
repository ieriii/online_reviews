So good. Never thought I'd say that to describe a turkey leg dish, literally. Turkey Leg Confit presents itself on the menu, and my many years of Chicago living have trained me to instantly think when I see turkey leg "everything wrong with the Taste of Chicago". (quickly following eating funnel cake with a bland lifeless corn in the cob). Anyway, the Turkey Leg Confit at the Purple Pig is decadent, and when I've had it (twice now) it was always to share, I need to stop doing that, it's too good. Tooo gooooood. Along with fried brussel sprout leaves, fried devil eggs, Panino Nutella, Bread Pudding, Cured meats...it's just soooo good. The food is smart rustic European. It has modern whims like it's use of aged vinegar with turkey confit in a braised preparation, but served literally as a leg with no fancy advances in presentation. Service has always been friendly. They've thus far always been attentive as well, which I find impressive only because they are always busy. Attentive is hard to do when you're talking about a small location, crammed with locals and tourists, and there doesn't seem to be such a thing as "down time" for the location. Located in the funky "around the corner" spot on Michigan Avenue, you pass through an outdoor area to get inside, to generally find it at 90% capacity, (even on a monday). They currently do not accept reservations, which is annoying, but the times I've been here I've always gotten seating.  THE TOP FIVE REASONS NOT TO GO TO THE PURPLE PIG: 1) No reservations 2) You have issues with the idea of eating "pigs ears" (hell my old dog did it) 3) It can be loud 4) No parking 5) You're a vegetarian THE TOP FIVE REASONS TO GO TO THE PURPLE PIG: 1) The food is modern rustic and delicious 2) The bar area is just the right level of exhausting and charming - and great wine list! 3) Service is positive 4) The location is safe 5) The desserts are just as modern rustic and delicious as the main dishes.
