YES! Maybe my review'll be a bit skewed as I only had the buffet, but said buffet was head and shoulders above that of Indian Garden and other such places. Not mega spicy, but i wouldn't expect it to be so given the local clientele. The samosas were crisp, tasty and borderline sweet. The Chicken Tikka Masala was pleasantly snappy, as was the cheese version. I'll be frank, I never remember the names of stuff I have at indian restaurants, but I didn't have any thing bad here. This means I sampled probably 8 or 9 different dishes. It's cheap too. Good stuff!
