We had the "experience". Overall, we were not super impressed by the food. There were couple standouts, such as the watermelon consomme, the caesar w/ anchovy and probably the sweetbread. But the others were just okay. The popcorn was not as good as we had anticipated. But I have to hand it over to them that service was excellent, it was not too much, not too little, just the right amount attention and professionalism. And our assigned attendant even hailed us a taxi, opened the door for us and bid us goodbye, wow what a service! BTW, we caught a glimpse of Mr. Elliot himself passing by our table. He moved really fast we couldn't stop him to get some pictures. All I remember was he was wearing a very unique casual attire with cool glasses. 3.5 out of 5 stars.
