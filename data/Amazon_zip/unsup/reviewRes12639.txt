The food was very good, but service was slow and inattentive and the restaurant was incredibly loud. (People have called it a date-night place and I'd agree. A group conversation is impossible, plus there's no fear of sweet nothings or dirty talk being overheard.) I ordered the wine special and it tasted like an open bottle was sitting in the fridge for a week. I sent it back -- only the second time in my life I've had to send back wine -- and they replaced it willingly, although it took 15 minutes to get our waiter's attention. This was my first visit to Cafe 28 in a few years, and I'll probably wait another few years to go back.
