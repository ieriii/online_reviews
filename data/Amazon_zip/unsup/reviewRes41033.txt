This place has decent pho and it's really affordable. The line can get pretty long sometimes, but it usually moves pretty fast. The restaurant itself is no frills, but it gets the job done. My husband usually gets pho, and I usually get banh mi or a noodle dish. We usually start with the fresh spring rolls too. Pretty tasty! One thing to note: When we come at lunch time, my husband says he can tell that the pho broth isn't as flavorful by like 1pm. Try to get their earlier like 11:30, for the best broth!
