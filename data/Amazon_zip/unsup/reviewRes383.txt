Most of the other reviews pretty much cover how spectacular everything is at Alinea. I cannot agree more. The place is unassuming with the entrance on Halstead. The long hallway to nowhere when you enter is a neat illusion only to be surprised by the doors halfway down on the side.  A friend and I did the tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Each of the 16 courses was great. Some over the top amazing, but all were great. The staff was amazing and extremely knowledgeable. Even better, they are very observant. I was chewing gum when I sat down, and nonchalantly, I was given a paper napkin on a serving dish to dispose of the gum.  Each of the courses was paced perfectly and the wine was matched very well.  The black truffle explosion was probably the table favorite. The savory courses outweighed the dessert options by a lot. The appetizing courses were delightful as well. The seasonal choices of everything was absolutely perfect. Even the watermelon with the brook trout was a good twist. It is pointless to go on and on about each course, but just GO AND GET THE EXPERIENCE.   Being in New York and having a veritable plethora of fantastic restaurants, I must say no experience is as complete as this one in Chicago. Definitely worth the trip, the time and the investment.   Hoping they open another concept like this in NEW YORK soon.
