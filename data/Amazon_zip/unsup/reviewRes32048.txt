Yes, I order sushi rolls as opposed to sashimi, nigiri, etc. and am proud of it. That being said, try the Firecracker Roll. I ordered it twice it was that good. Average roll is about $15 and there is nothing particularly spectacular about the sushi, but you pay for the ambiance and location. I would like to try happy hour on a Friday as the bar and lounge looked inviting.
