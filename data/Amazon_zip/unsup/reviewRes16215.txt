We came here for my old roomie's graduation dinner last year. It was such an amazing experience. We had a reservation, and I think we only had to wait five minutes to be seated--just long enough to get a few cocktails. I admit, I hear that the cocktails here are amazing, and I was sick so didn't drink, so keep in mind that my 5-stars comes without even having sampled one of the staples of the menu. I don't even remember what I ate. All I know is that every single dish from the appetizer to the dessert was scrumptious. We all shared, so sampled a good cross-section of the menu, and there was nothing that I didn't like: only food that I liked, and liked more. Carnavale is also conveniently located off of the Eisenhower, and had available street parking, though valet was also offered. Also a great place for all kinds of occasions--you could come here with a group or on a date. I would suggest this as a third date kind of place, since it's a little more upscale and after throwing back a few cocktails you might be ready to head home . . .
