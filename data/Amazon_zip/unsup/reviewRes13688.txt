I was very disappointed in Revolution Brewing Co. My friend and I sat at the bar, because he thinks that we get better service that way. Not true! The bartenders barely paid any attention to us and when my friend asked for a menu we were only given one. I did love the Bottom Up Wit beer. It had hints of citrus and clove...sort of Blue Moon but a touch "warmer" flavored. The popcorn with the prosciutto and parmesan and sage was a bit off. I liked it, but it seemed like too much going on for popcorn. Maybe the prosciutto needs to be in smaller pieces? Maybe the sage needs to be taken out of the equation? It just didn't do it for me. The pizzas were phenomenal! I snatched a few bites from my friend. Yummy! My entree was the sausage and ham plate, with little slices of toasted rye bread, mustard, and gherkins. The server delivered them without explaining what the sausages were and when we finally asked the bartender he said "oh, let me resort to my little cheat sheet." I kept the cheat sheet to show my friend and noticed a whole host of specials that NO ONE TOLD US ABOUT (including something that sounded like the best burger evar, but we wouldn't know because no one told us and we had already received out entrees.) Service fail!!!! I think Revolution Brewing Co. is decent. It has potential. They really need to work on their service though.
