Dude, this place is friggin awesome! Doug is friggin awesome. Last time I went I had the rattlesnake sausage with blueberry sauce and some kind of cheese and it was amaaaaaazing. I always love trying their various game sausages, they never disappoint. My brother got the duck sausage with foie gras which was pretty good, but not great. He also says that they have the best fries he has ever had. They also serve duck fat fried fries every Sunday(?) which are pretty cool. Every time I visit my brother in Evanston I make him take me here no matter how far away it is!
