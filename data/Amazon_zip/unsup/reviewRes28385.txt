Honestly, I've been following Rick Bayless' career for years now. And I have to say that he is a remarkably talented chef! Being from San Antonio, TX I know good authentic Mexican food as well as Tex-Mex (there's a difference). Rick's commitment to stay true to authentic Mexican cuisine truly honors our culture. All of the ingredients are fresh, you can taste the freshness! The flavor combinations in one dish can be overwhelmingly pleasant and truly work together as if in a chorus. I have never had a bad dish that I didn't like, and always stop by at least for one meal on my trips up to Chicago. Thank you Rick Bayless for your commitment to quality and truth in Mexican cuisine!
