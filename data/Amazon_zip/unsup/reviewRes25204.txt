We didn't do the bakery items, which all looked good, but it was dinner time and we wanted FOOD! We had the traditional lemony soup, Spanakopita, Mediterranean salad, Briammi and enjoyed it all. There was nothing wrong with this place, though I think the seating is best suited for solo and couples than families.
