I know, I am like the one hold out. While I enjoyed my Hot Doug's experience I feel like it was not worth the Saturday early AM wait. We went at 10:30 am and waited for OVER an hour- yuck. I grew up in Wisconsin and we have amazing variations of Brats that are far more delicous. If you are looking for a real winner order from RJ meats in Hudson, WI and have the killer brats delivered for your own barkyard BBQ. I highly recommend the Jalapeno Cheese and Hawaian brats- yum! http://www.rjmeats.com/
