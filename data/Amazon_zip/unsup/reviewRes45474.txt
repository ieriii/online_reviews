-only bar like it in the neighborhood -large space -tvs at bar to watch game, cozy atmosphere, fireplace -service was slow -chopped salad shouldn't advertise that it has chicken in it since there was so little I couldn't be any more excited to have a bar like this in the neighborhood! I look forward to reviewing it again.
