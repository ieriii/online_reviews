I made my account specifically to rate Wakamono, and unfortunately it's not favorable. I ate at Wakamono about a week ago for dinner with my girlfriend, and we had a good time. The food tasted great, the wine was good, and the service was 100% on it's game (In fact, I don't think I could get my water glass halfway empty before the busboy came to refill it). So what was the problem? Food poisoning! About 5 hours later, I woke up and had to run to the bathroom to vomit up my dinner. My dinner = 1 glass of malbec, 1/2 Godzilla roll, 1 Maki Mexicano, and 1 Kani Chung roll. The only difference between my dinner and my GFs dinner was the Kani Chung roll. Thankfully, she avoided this king crab covered time-bomb and was able to take care of me for the next 24-30 hours. If you want to roll the dice on this place, please avoid the Kani Chung. It could be hazardous to your health!
