i mean!! so delicious. my bestie and i went last week, and altho we waited in line FOREVER and they are aggressive about seating, we looooved our tortas. i got the cubano (AMAZING!) and he got the jamon. these tortas are made with love and you can tell. my only problem is the terrible seating area. i'd rather get my food to go and enjoy it in a non-chaotic atmosphere. yikes. but overall, the food is amazing and that's what ultimately counts.
