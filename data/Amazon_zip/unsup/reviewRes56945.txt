Of course the prices are as high as can be, but TOTALLY WORTH IT! Amazing food and meat is absolutely gourmet and their specialty. And talk about service! The serves walk around constantly with new food for you to try, we really felt like kings eating! The cheese bread is the best. They keep refilling it. I have no complaints. I understand the price is high, but this isn't any everyday restaurant. You get what oyu pay for and it's excellent food.
