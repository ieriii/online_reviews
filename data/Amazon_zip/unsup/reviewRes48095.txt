I've been to Publican for both their dinner and brunch offerings....and both were very good experiences. I have to say that for dinner, I would opt to go to Avec. But for brunch, Publican is a must try....so this review will only be for the brunch menu. Let's get the venue and service out of the way...both are fine. Servers are nice and attentive, but nothing spectacular. The venue is very gastropub inspired with long communal tables and larege globe lighting. And now the good stuff...FOOD!!! Menu has changed over the past couple of years, but everything we've had has been really good. That would include the sticky buns, walnut banana cake, cheesy buscuit with turkey sausage, skirt steak and eggs, and the pork shoulder. Also, I would recommend getting a side of their bacon....not your typical thin and crispy style. Nope, their bacon is thick and sumptuous....reminds me a little of chinese bbq pork. The portions are adequate, but not huge by any means. My favorite would be the combo of their waffle and side of bacon....that's the real breakfast of champions!!!
