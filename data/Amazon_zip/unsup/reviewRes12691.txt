Me: I almost didn't come. I think Fogo suspects something. TdB: Why? Me: I don't know, it's just a feeling.  TdB: Fogo doesn't deserve to have you to herself. You're too good to be tied down to one Brazilian steakhouse. Me: I wish I could make a clean break before starting with a new churrascaria. TdB: You have nothing to feel guilty about. Fogo takes you for granted. She doesn't send you vouchers for free meals on your birthday like I do, does she? Or entertain you with an aerial wine girl? Or offer you delicious all-you-can-drink lobster bisque? Me: No, but she was my first. TdB: You do love my succulent bacon wrapped filets and my juicy flank steak, don't you? Why not get another of my refreshing caipirinhas and just forget about Fogo? Me: It's so hard. TdB: You are never going to leave her, are you? Me: I am so sorry.
