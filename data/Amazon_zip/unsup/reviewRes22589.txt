I bring a Greek girl to Chicago where they've got a Greek restaurant called Greek Islands in a place called Greek Town and it was ok...which is a pretty typical Greek response. Unfortunately, I've been spoiled by a Greek father-in-law to be, his cooking and a couple other brilliant Greek places in NY and South Florida. I don't want to discourage anybody from going here, you'll get a fine meal but, with the backdrop of some really outstanding Greek food in my history, these Greek Islands seemed more Montauk than Molyvos. Maybe they were better a while back. Right now, they're OK. I have a hard time holding onto specific details about the meal. On the positive side, they were polite, sat us quickly, had decent wines and brought a complimentary dessert. On the negative, I can't remember anything that really rocked my world. And great, simply prepared Greek food should remind you that simple but outstanding ingredients are all you really need for a terrific meal. Then while you're carrying on about how mindbogglingly good this simple food was, all the Greeks are calmly making this face as if to say, "Of course it's great; it's Greek food." That wasn't what I had. I had decent Greek food. As I recall, they've got a list in the entrance hallway of the top 100 restaurants - which of course, features the Greek Islands. Maybe that set the bar too high.
