I love this place!!!!!!!! Did I mention I love this place!!!!! Second time we ordered from here and it does not disappoint. We ordered delivery which can cost a bit more than you want to spend. Due to the service they use. I wish you could order directly from the resto. We ordered the combination dinners and the sides that come with are amazing. Not sure what they were but they were excellent. We'll try to do the buffett when we're in the area!
