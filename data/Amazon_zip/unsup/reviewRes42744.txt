One of my favorite delivery places. The chicken, either rotisserie or on the pizza, is really good; the chicken and rapini pizza is a good way to find out how awesome it is. There are some really interesting topping combinations, including some traditional Brazilian options you don't often see like cod, catupiry cheese, or corn. The staff is extremely nice; they've called me when delivery was going to take slightly longer than originally quoted, and never mess up my custom orders. We ordered frequently to my office for a lunch. The first time they convinced their delivery people to deliver outside their delivery area (which has since expanded). Another time, they brought a catering order a week early by accident, and just gave us the early delivered food for free (6 pizzas and a tray of salad) on top of being extremely apologetic. Most importantly, you can get a cheesesteak pizza with whiz on it, in true Philly style. Or, you can just embrace your inner fatty and sub cheese whiz in on any pizza, like the buffalo chicken. Amazing.
