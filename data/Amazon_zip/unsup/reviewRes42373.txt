The greatest slice of stuffed pizza you will ever have. I found Art of Pizza on accident while living two blocks away. I have gained 5-10 pounds easily from an obsession born on that day. Chicago is known for iconic food: the Chicago hot dog, the Italian beef, Maxwell Street Polish and the trump card itself, Chicago deep dish pizza. Yes, there is a difference between deep dish and stuffed. And with it comes a preference. And if your preference is a sauce-on-top stuffed, the monster of all pizzas, then Art of Pizza is the last stop along a long ride of famous Chicago pizzerias. Art of Pizza offers three varieties: thincrust, deep dish and stuffed. They make a decent thin, an excellent deep dish -- the kind Pizzeria Uno gave the rest of the depraved world -- and finally, one of Chicago's top-rated stuffed. The Art of Art's Stuffed:  Flaky, buttery crust (IMHO the best in the city) + Standard toppings + LOTS of cheese + Wonderfully tangy, spicy, rich pizza sauce _________________________________________ =Chicago's Best Stuffed Pizza Among my Top 10 Chicago meals, I would include an Art of Pizza Deep Stuffed Spinach and Mushroom. I am not a vegetarian. The combination of gooey cheese, tons of spinach, the soaked-yet-crispy crust and that punch-you-in-the-mouth sauce are an extraordinary taste experience. Art of Pizza earns my 5-star on their stuffed pizza alone. While their thin and traditional deep dish are very good, they aren't Chicago's best. Helping the grade, the service is always friendly (in person), it's a BYOB establishment (Foremost Liquors is right across the street), they have a new expanded dining room and the lunch and dinner platter items are always cheap and nasty-good. Their Chicken Parmesan is not the healthiest item, but massive and delicious (aided, I believe, by that damned pizza sauce). The competition is fierce and everyone has an opinion. I've enjoyed many a Chicago stuffed pizza, from Gino's to Chicago Pizza Co. to Giordanno's, and Art's features the best crust and sauce combination I've encountered, putting it on top of a prestigious crowd.
