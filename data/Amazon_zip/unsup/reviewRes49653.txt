A large group of us had a reservation at Las Tablas for this past Saturday evening and I can honestly say it was the WORST dining experience I have ever had. I nearly went Real Housewives of New Jersey at the lack of attention to anything that was happening at the restaurant - except my freak-out was directed at the restaurant and not a "prosti&*ion who&*%" Seriously, it was ridiculous. Not only did our reservation end up having us wait an additional hour for a table, they had 1 bartender for the whole restaurant and the bar - which meant it took an hour to get a drink. Staffing simply didn't have it together here... Then there was the table-service. It took 20 minutes to get water and another 40 to take our order. Of course, a half hour later, we were still waiting for anything resembling food to appear and while the quality of the appetizers was good, it certainly took a long time to fry a couple of empanadas for our table. Meanwhile, waitstaff would often gather in small groups to chat - then the restaurant would be empty with nobody present to talk to if you needed anything... Dinner then took another 40 minutes - I got the recommended Combination platter (chicken and beef) - which should have been called Salt-Lick Meat. Like inadvertently swallowing ocean water, I nearly gagged from the severity of salt on my meat. Of course, then the danger here is that IT TAKES 40 MINUTES FOR DINNER, but I sent it back anyway. In return, I did get a beef-dish with less salt, but at this point, I was over it. If there was one thing I liked at the restaurant it was the coffee - that was good. Otherwise, you'll never see me at this place again. It was awful.
