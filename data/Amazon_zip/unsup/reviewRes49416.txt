My boyfriend and I went here for the Valentine's prie fixe dinner. This is such a great place for a special occasion. We arrived a little early and got seats at the bar. The selection is quite large and the menus were really helpful. Neither of us know a lot about wine, but the menu had explanations of each. The prices are average for a downtown bar, but the portions were suprisingly large. The food was amazing! Our waiter explained each course to us, and was super friendly. The wine pairings also really helped b/c again, not a wine experts. Try the braised lamb shanks! We both left happy, full, and a little drunk.
