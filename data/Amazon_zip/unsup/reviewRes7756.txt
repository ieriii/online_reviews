great food, very cozy. and by cozy, i mean small. i think it's best to go during the summer when they have the extra seating on the patio. unfortunately, we were seated at the very end of the patio and i believe that our server ended up forgetting about us. this seems to be a trend with me, though, so it must be something that i do. anyway-it was still a great experience even though the service was sub-par for us. the great food completely made up for it. i will definitely be going back for more.
