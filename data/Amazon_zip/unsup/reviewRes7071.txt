I really want to give Q a great rating. They do excellent ribs, pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. The selection of sauces is great - and love that they serve them in little bowls (rather than sticky plastic bottles!). The portions are a healthy size, so I don't mind that their prices are higher than many other bbq joints. The atmosphere is nice, and the cocktails are quite lovely. They have a great selection of bourbons and some refreshing cocktails that pair nicely with smoked meat. HOWEVER, the service leaves a lot to be desired. They stuffed our party of 5 into a booth with a chair on the end. When we pointed to another more suitable (and empty) table, the host promised us that the 4-top next to us would be seated with 2, so our aisleway companion wouldn't be cramped. He removed the chairs to make his point, only to bring them right back with a party of 4 about 10 minutes later.  Our server was completely indifferent. He brought our drinks but forgot a glass for one of the beers - and it took him 10 minutes to come back with one! He rarely came back to check on us, so we were left thristy for more drinks. My husband never did get his 2nd drink. We also didn't see our entrees for a full hour after being seated - pretty surprising for a place where the food is slow-cooked for hours...the one bright spot on service was the busboy, who did a great job.
