The right potion... of posh and price, Indie is more, than raw fish and rice. Indie Thai and Sushi Cafe? Holy mackerel, salmon, tuna, yellowtail and unagi, my friends! For real, this joint is where it's at. How I love somewhat hidden gems...a crowd of happy neighborhood people, enjoying a quiet dinner, mingling with friends, laughing over their own wine....ahhhh, really, this is what life is made of. Excellent food at ridiculously excellent prices. Can it be so? Yes, in fact it can. One does not need skimp on the finer things in life, one just needs to look a bit harder to unearth the true gems. And this, is a gem in every sense of the word. From the moment I walked through the door until I drifted softly to sleep dreaming of crab rangoon so soft and wonderful...Indie Cafe hit a home run. Service, ambience, location, menu, decor, offerings, selection, pace, performance...sigh, I think I'm in love. Seriously.
