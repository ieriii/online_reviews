I wish they made caldos available before 3 pm. The service can be spotty sometimes. Outside of that, I really have no complaints.  The food is awesome. I occasionally dream about the ahogada sandwich and that spectacularly spicy tomato broth. I'm glad I don't live within walking distance because I think I'd put Rick Bayless's kids through college.
