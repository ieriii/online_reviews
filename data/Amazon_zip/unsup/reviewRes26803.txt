I found this spot shortly after I moved to the city and I love it!  #1 Reason I gave Pequod's 5 stars instead of 4: Great pizza isn't hard to find in Chicago but it's the atmosphere at Pequod's that keeps me coming back. The interior is a laid-back pub/dive bar and the music is a mix of 80s & 90s rock (like many restaurants) BUT Pequod's takes it a step further and plays the corresponding music videos on the tvs throughout the restaurant! It's hilarious and wildly entertaining and reason enough for me to keep coming here rather than somewhere else. Haha, now that aside, on to the food: Contrary to what one other reviewer had said I think the sauce is EXCELLENT and flavorful and you can smell it from outside the restaurant. I suppose it is all a matter of personal opinion but I love that their pizza is more of a cross between deep-dish and pan which leaves room for more sauce, toppings and cheese than the usual 2" thick deep-dish crust . I might also add that the Pequod's salad is very delicious if you're looking for somewhat lighter fare. My parents demand we go to Pequod's every time they visit now!
