Marrow? Octopus? Pork shoulder? Beets? Beer? Wine? Anyway you eat it, and anything that you order it seems, is perfection, set within a casual gastropub like space that's bustling enough to be an ideal spot for a small group who loves to share, yet intimate enough for a date. How'd they cram so much into one space? Love the outside seating. Even on a crisp autumn evening, outside still felt summery, aided by heat lamps. Purple Pig, you've got me crushing on you.
