I was never a red velvet fan until I tried a slice of red velvet from here. Oh my, the cake here is tasty indeed. It's ultra moist and the icing just melts in your mouth. The downside is, the portion is kind of small and it's pricey for what you get. A small velvet cake is $30. Cupcake I think was somewhere around $3~$4 and it's not even the standard size. It's a thin, skinny cake. Aside from that, the cakes are really yummy so it's definitely worth checking it out.
