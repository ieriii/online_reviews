One of my favorite spots in Chinatown ever. Great place to go if you like spicy food. We always order our staples: Double Fried Sliced Pork with Cilantro JiaZhou Style (very spicy), Crispy Shrimp in Mayonnaise Sauce (no spice) and a third new dish to try. We've never had a bad meal here. I love the spicy cabbage salad appetizer they automatically give you upon sitting down. I would give this place a 5 stars if only they were consistent with their portions. Though they are decent sized, some days when it's just my hubby and I, we get smaller portions than when we're with a big group. Not fair! Don't adjust it according to group size. Another thing is the service is not the best, but no different from how it typically is in Chinatown. It's strictly about food and eating it, no frills. Not an issue with me, but may be offputting for some. Other than that, we love this place and it's one of our regular stops in Chinatown.
