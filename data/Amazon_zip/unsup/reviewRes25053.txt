I haven't been to this place in a while - but sure can vouch for it. I love the ambiance, the service, the food, the bakery - in short everything. I like the decor and the bakery downstairs. It has a very European cafe feel to it. The food is invariably delicious. I love their spanakopita. All the desserts are delicious. Their pizzas, salads and sandwiches are yum too!!
