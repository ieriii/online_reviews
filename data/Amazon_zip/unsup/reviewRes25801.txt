Dude. Amazing food. and BYOB. I come here on a semi-regular basis with my friend who knows the owner. I have also come here with friends who don't know the owner. The service is always timely and staff are very attentive. If your water glass is 3/4 full, believe me, in a few minutes it will be full! I haven't been here without people who aren't already familiar with Vietnamese food, so everything that gets ordered is shared and is tasty. Recently had a mango beef dish, that was AWESOME. Since I was late for dinner, I don't know the name of it. The pad woon sen type dish has real crab meat and is the tastiest version I have had. I always leave here needing someone to wheelbarrow me home. Love coming here, and there is no corkage fee. It's great for catching up with friends since the staff doesn't rush you. We've shut the place down before (just 5 people) and the staff is really nice, never complains, and they always thank you for coming! The next time I'm here though I will have to write down what I've eaten. Definitely will be back!
