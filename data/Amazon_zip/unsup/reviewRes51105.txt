Right off the bat, I was disappointed in Big Jones. Our group of 5 had a reservation at 8:00pm. We were going to be a bit late, so we called and they said "no problem, get here by 8:15pm." We got there at 8:10pm and the host made us feel like we had created a problem that he was not happy to solve. He told us that we were already late for our reservation ( we told him that we called and someone told us 8:15pm was fine) and since our 5th person wasn't there, he wasn't sure he could seat us. He said that they set aside 2 hours for a party of five, if our fifth person was late, it would hold us up more so than we already were. He was not very friendly or accomodating and made us feel like we were a problem. The weird thing was is that we called and they said 8:15 was fine and our friend was literally 4 minutes away. We told him that we would order as usual and our friend could catch up. So, he begrudgingly sat us. When our 5th friend arrived (4 minutes later), he said "oh yea, your party is here, just walk back until you find them".  Our waters did not get refilled - even when asked for more water. The food was mixed reviews by everyone - some liked it, some did not. My one friend had been there before and ordered the same dish - the first time it was amazing, this time, it was flavorless and tasted bitter. It was a vegetarian mushroom entree. All in all, the host should lighten up a bit, they should direct bus boys (or someone) to fill water and maybe after being open awhile longer will be more consistent with the food. The Mississippi mud pie was really good though...
