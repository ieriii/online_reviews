I have to give a shout-out to Wilde. We go here all the time, it's our fallback if we can't think of anywhere else to go. The atmosphere is great, the service is great, the menu is great. I really love this place. We were there last night sitting at one of the outdoor tables and it started to rain and it was quite clear a monsoon was fast approaching. The hostess came out and told us they had a table for us inside, so she helped us carry our food and beverages inside and settled us at a table seconds before the downpour began.... on a Friday night when it was busy! Talk about good service. Last night I ordered the black bean chicken wrap for the first time. So good!
