Definitely not for the herbivore in your life. I got the steak and it was so yummy. Probably one of the best steaks I have ever had which really surprised me. It was so juicy, and perfectly cooked. The portions are also huge and a really good price! If you are a drinker definitely try the sangria. It was really tasty as well and strong! I do have one tiny complaint. Our reservation was for 7pm, which is pretty early. We got there and the restaurant was probably a quarter full. When the hostess seated us at a table that didn't have backs to the chairs I asked if we could move to a table that did (I know, so picky, but I have a bad back). She told me the tables were already taken. Huh? They were all empty. I understood that some were for a large party, but 5 minutes after we sat down I saw another party of 2 get seated at a table that had backs! What the heck?
