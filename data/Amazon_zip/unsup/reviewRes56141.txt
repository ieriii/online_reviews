The girlfriend and I had a massive crepe craving so we came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was mildly busy but we didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. The menus offer a great variety of crepes. She went with a Nutella/Strawberry Crepe while I had a Pineapple/Walnut/Honey crepe with added Pecans. One was light and one was more dessert-like. We both had hot beverages and I must say, the size portions of the drinks was outstanding, especially for the price. I only give this place 4 out of 5 stars because the crepe themselves are just not all that filling, for their $9+ pricepoint. It's a great place and the crepes themselves were delicious but my belly was left craving more afterwards.
