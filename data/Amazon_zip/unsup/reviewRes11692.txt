Piece serves up a really great pizza, that's not even debateable! The pizzas are HUGE, cheezy, and crispy! What I'm not a big fan of is how crowded this place gets. I am also sad to say that I really don't enjoy many their beers. Every so often, they'll have a really good one - but this isn't what I'd consider a destination to choose for the beer. Back to the pizza, there's something about it that makes it not really good for breakfast the next day, so I don't recommend ordering a large just so you have enough for breakfast. I really like Piece. I just make it a point to go there when it's not busy and order the Pilsner - it's a decent brew.
