What can an out-of-towner who stumbled upon Wakamono say that the millions of other reviews haven't? We got into Chi-City late Friday evening and dropped our stuff off at a friend's apartment in the neighborhood. Roommate's boyfriend used to live in the area so we decided to head to Ping Pong for dinner. Their sign said they closed at 11:00 and since it was 10:45 we decided not to press our luck. We noticed the cute place across the street was busy (both inside and out on their patio tables) so we figured they'd probably be open later. Well, the host sure didn't say anything, but our waitress seemed a little alarmed when she approached our table and asked if we knew they closed at 11:00. We sure didn't, but we were starving and promised we'd order and eat quickly. Our bottle of wine came soon thereafter and the sushi flew out right after that. My avocado roll (I'm a veg-head so I go with the veggie rolls) was SUPER fresh and stuffed with big chunks of avos. Mmm. I'd say pass on the Salad Roll. I should have asked for the brown rice to be subbed for regular sushi rice, but I didn't want to ask our girl for any changes that late at night. It came with a really tasty spicy sauce, but the roll just wasn't my favorite. This place is CUTE. Service is great, the dining area is dim and sexy and the food is incredibly tasty-face. Hopefully I can visit again with more than 20 minutes to experience it all. And don't forget your apple gummy at the end of your meal!
