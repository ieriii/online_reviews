Hip hip hooray! 3 cheers for Irazu! A friend of mine recently moved around the corner from this fabulous Costa Rican joint and we happened upon it while on a Saturday afternoon stroll. I had no idea that I was setting myself up for a new Chicago obsession. The service was quick and super friendly and the staff was so nice and attentive. And the food. Oh, the food. The yucca was divine with a delicious garlic oil spread (Warning! Not good date food! I can still smell garlic on my breath four hours later...so worth it though...) I had the fish taco special which was amazing. Not as light as your normal fish taco but equally if not more so delicious. And the plantains on the side, well, had I thought it through I would have gotten some to go. Their smoothies are on spot as well. I had blackberry with soy milk and was in heaven. Another plus, this joint is freakin' adorable. Tons of outside seating, some in the shade some in the sun. Great music was playing and the decor felt very authentic and islandy. Price was definitely a plus as well. Thirty dollars for two of us, appetizers and all. I cannot wait to go back...
