I've been here twice and the wheeling location twice as well. the hOtdogs are very very good but the fries are blah-- very oily and soggy. Out of the four times I've ordered from superdawg not once were the fries fresh. Especially late night I think they use the old fries that have been sitting in the pans for hours! Superdawg, you claim to be the best live up to it!!!!
