Went on a Saturday night and arrived around 5pm at the beginning of dinner service. We had a 5-10 minute wait. Brian, our server, was excellent in his knowledge of the drink and dinner menu. We decided to order a bar snack, two small plates, a salad and an entree. Can't quite remember exactly what we had because the descriptions of each item are lengthy, but in a nutshell we had the bone marrow and boiled pig face small plates, great salad with apples and beets, and the rabbit entree. We shared everything. It was the best meal we've eaten in Chicago to date. Everything was orchestrated perfectly and in a timely manner. We felt like we were doted upon and we were the only diners in the restaurant, which says a lot because the dining room is cramped with only 26 seats in the front dining area with about 12 at the bar. If you haven't been yet, get there quickly. P.S. - Bone marrow small plate was excellent to try, but wouldn't order again due to the fact that it was especially small.
