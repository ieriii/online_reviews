it's hard to make a decision at milk+honey...there so many good options between the sandwiches, omelets, scones, muffins... cute and tiny, with outdoor seating in the summer. it's a great brunch spot, but you will be eating right next to randos basically, and expect the line to order food to be pretty long.
