Full of flavors, and many of them. I've had vegetarian messob and meat and vegetarian messob on my visits. Every item has an individual flavor. Almost all of them are excellent, and none are bad. I love the soft, sour injeera. A messob for two gives each person a huge portion of food. It's rich and a little oily in a way where you can tell you're getting plenty of calories, but the taste is worth it. What we had last week: doro wot - chicken drumsticks in sauce with crumbly cheese and hardboiled egg: This was one of my favorites. It was tender, with a unique herbal flavor, almost minty. ye-beg alicha - lamb in a mild thick sauce: One of my friend's favorites. I think I would like it but I haven't completely warmed up to the gamey flavor of lamb yet. If you like lamb, you'll like it. michetabish - sauce of cardamom beef: If I'm remembering correctly this was another favorite, with lots of flavor. ye-misir wot - red lentil stew: good, spicy kik alicha - split yellow peas: our least favorite, kind of boring shiro - mixed legumes: good. It's possible I'm confusing the michetabish for this, in which case this was one of my favorites. The messob prices seemed reasonable. However this is the only Ethiopian food I've had; my friend informs me that it's usually very inexpensive for good quality Ethiopian food, and that Demera is too expensive. I don't mind. 4.5 stars
