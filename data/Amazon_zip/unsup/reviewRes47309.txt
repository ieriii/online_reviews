A friend and I happened upon this place by accident, but I'm glad we did. It was early evening so it wasn't too crowded. The music was a little loud at times, but not overwhelming. The mussels with coconut curry were awesome - I could have eaten another bowl. The service was incredibly attentive and polite. I had a mushroom sandwich - but I would definitely go back for a burger - maybe the "Fat Elvis" - peanut butter, bacon and banana! Tried a new beer: O'Fallon "Wheach" - loved it. Would surely go back - good service, good food, good beer. Can't beat that.
