True. Story. Came here for chef's week with Grace L and Mei Z... for an eventful night of mishaps!! 1) waiter broke a huge bottle right next to my chair spraying shards of glass everywhere.. but it's okay accidents happen. 2) we were waiting for our order for almost 45 minutes when we finally inquired to only find out.... 3) that the kitchen FORGOT our order!! -_- 4) FINALLY our order came out, but my friend's pork rib was 60% FAT. had to send back to kitchen... 5) another pork rib came out that was RAW in the middle.. had to send back to kitchen 6) finally third time is the charm.. and they were nice enough to send out extra desserts and take a beer off our order. Sigh, so I was unimpressed with the coordination of our meal.. I'm sorry this is a PROFESSIONAL restaurant! You don't lose people's orders.. that doesn't even happen at McDonald's.. As for the food, it was good, but the execution was somewhat off. Since our food took forever to come out, they kept feeding us bread which I LOVED. So soft and yummy with butter. The gem salad was deliciously well balanced but the pig ears just sorta tasted like fried crispiness, and I think was more for the novelty rather than adding to actual flavor. The pork rib itself was well seasoned but tough. As for desserts, i LOVEDDDDDD the waffle! oh la la I could eat that everyday. It comes with honey butter and pickled golden raisins which were strange but not bad. The chocolate gelato was also good but came with olive oil and salt which sounds interesting and was for the first bite. But in all honesty, I think people prefer it plain without all the pizazz. The lemon poppy seed cake with yogurt (tart like pinkberry) gelato was also popular. All in all, I feel like this restaurant tries to hard to be conceptually modern and interesting rather than focusing on having a finished product of delicious flavor.
