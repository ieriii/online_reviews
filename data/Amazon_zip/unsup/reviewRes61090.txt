Pretty yummy!I eat at Garcia's about once a week, it seems. The location is super convenient for me - I pass by every day going to/from the train. The place is pretty small - there is usually one server who takes care of the bar and tables. Service is almost always lightning fast and efficient.I tend to be a creature of habit and mostly order the same things - flautas or enchiladas. Can't go wrong with either of those. Margaritas are strong and inexpensive. Chips and salsa good. Refried beans and guacamole kinda bad, though.Not the best I've had, but definitely good, fast and cheap!
