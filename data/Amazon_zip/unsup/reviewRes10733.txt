Went here on a Friday at about 6 o'clock and it was HOPPIN'! First time eating in and it lives up to the hype. We got a (vegetarian) mushroom, onion, green pepper pizza that was to die for. Didn't have the beer, which was lame of me, but I was craving pizza and malbec...? heh heh. What do they do to their pizza? What is it about this pizza? SO YUMz.
