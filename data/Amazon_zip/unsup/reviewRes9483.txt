came here for dinner with my family on their last day visiting chicago. i initially thought that this place would be more vietnamese/french fusion but the food is more traditional vietnamese. had i known that, i probably wouldn't have opted to come here when you can get the same meal somewhere on argyle for half the price or less. that being said, the food was great. some dishes were better than others according to my mom. for appetizers we ordered, bo bia (variation of a spring roll) - mom said that this dish wasn't made right, i still thought it was pretty good. chao tom (shrimp wrapped around sugarcane)- very tasty and served with lettuce and noodles, and goi bo (beef salad) - much better than i expected, flavors were on point. for the main dishes: ca hap (steamed chilean sea bass)- it was tasty but i thought this dish was missing something and i can't figure out what, vit quay (roasted duck)- i've never had roasted duck that was this good and not dripping in fat, ga xao xa ot (lemongrass chicken)- this dish was the most flavorful of them all, super yummy. Ca tim nuong (roasted eggplant)- it was a nice veggie side and tasted just like how my mom makes it. the only thing that was missing from the dinner was a fried banana with vanilla ice cream dessert....but they didn't have that on the menu and thats all that we wanted to eat! lol. overall it was a great dinner. overpriced for vietnamese food but you get the nice ambiance and great service. a good place to start if you're wanting to try vietnamese food and not brave enough to go to a less main stream place up on argyle.
