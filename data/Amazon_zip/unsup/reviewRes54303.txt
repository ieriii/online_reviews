Every time I go to Chicago I make it a point to get one of their amazing deep dish pizzas. I haven't been to Chicago in years and I am very much missing one of their delicious deep dished mushroom pizzas. Made the mistake once of getting soup and salad-both were very bland, which is why the place gets 4 stars instead of 5.
