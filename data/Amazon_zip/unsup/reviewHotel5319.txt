I stayed at this location for the Marriott brand and location while working at a trade show for a week. Last year, it was a great experience overall. Last week was a DISASTER. The bellman, concierge and front desk staff are all very polite. That has not changed. A few of the waitstaff in the restaurant are exceptional as well. BUT, that is where it all ends. The bed is like sleeping on a brick. The pillows are uncomfortable. I had requested a mini refrigerator and foam pillows when making the reservation (verbal confirmation to my written request), but had to call down to the desk, as they had not been provided. TWO days, the room was NEVER touched. No cleaning, no replenishment of towels, toiletries, coffee, etc. I was out of the room from 7am until 10pm! NO excuses. I complained and the first night I was given 3,000 points in my account, an apology and offer to come clean the room (at that point 10:30pm) and a free cocktail in the bar if I waited downstairs for my room to be cleaned. I just asked for some towels and toiletries and went to bed. The second night they gave me a certificate for a free night, as it was already 11pm! I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant one morning....what a mistake. My omlette and toast were burned. They took a while to be served as well. When I complained, they offered to make it again, but I had to leave for the trade show (I worked a booth). They still charged me! They took off 20%. I complained later to the front desk. They did not remove the charge. They gave me a coupon for a free breakfast that I never got to use :( Not enough? The elevators were quirky for 3 days and actually got stuck a few times for 5 minutes. next year, I think I am going to try a new location. There are plenty in the area in the same price range, some are better hotels. I was considering a weekend get-a-way here but not now.
