Have had excellent experiences there. With clients, family, friends, new acquaintances.  You can have a great evening just ordering appetizers or go for it for a full blown dinner. It does get crowded, and you do feel packed in, but the food makes up for it.  Billy is an incredibly nice person. He really knows how to greet guests and make people feel welcome. He also has a great eye for talent: the staff (wait staff, bartenders, bussers) are incredibly professional and serve as a perfect model for other establishments. have fun!
