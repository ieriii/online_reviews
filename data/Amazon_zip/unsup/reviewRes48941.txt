Honestly.. meh.. dont see what all the fuss is about. The food is OK I liked the fried egg on fries thing. And while its somewhat worth the money.. its also somewhat overpriced.  Buit the place is crowded so they must be doing something good.  Also our server was a little pretentious too when we said we couldnt eat our dinner and wanted to take our food home or give it to a homeless person she visibly cringed at the though.. which I thought was offensive... so.. meh.
