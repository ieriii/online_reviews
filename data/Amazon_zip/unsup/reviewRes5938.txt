This is truly the loudest restaurant I have ever been to. Absolutely the worst. So bad that the server joked that the noise makes her want to kill people. As for the food, the shaved fresh hearts of palm salad was one of the worst salads I have ever had. The pizza was very greasy and gross. The dessert was fine, but we had to take it to go to save our eardrums. The ambiance is pretty cool, but SO not worth it. Also, to make it all worse, they do not take reservations, so get ready for a wait. The only good thing about this place is that it gave us an opportunity to go across the street to Beviamo for a drink while we waited. Avoid this place like crazy.
