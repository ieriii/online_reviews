This place is good and almost gets that fried chicken itch I have once in awhile...but not quite. I still miss the perfect crispiness of 99 chicken (in Santa Clara, CA), but this place is pretty close. We had ordered the Seoul sassy and plain. They were flavored well but just not exactly what I was looking for. Overall, it was satisfying and there was plenty of food to go around (we ordered a whole chicken and ended up bringing almost half home). Will definitely return to try the Buddha bowls.
