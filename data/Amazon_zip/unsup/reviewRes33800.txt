I've been here 3 times during my visits to Chicago. Mainly because it's down the block from my friend's apartment. This is a no-frills brunch place. I'm living in NYC right now, so I think my standards for a "good" brunch are pretty high since we have way more brunch places than Chicago does. Yolk has a pretty standard menu. Nothing that knocks my socks off. It's clean. Service is fast and courteous. I went once during the Sunday morning prime brunch time. Even though we were late for our reservation, they still managed to get us a table in a timely fashion. I went during low-peak times the following two times and had no trouble getting a table or getting served super-fast. The food is good but not extraordinary. I've had the chocolate chip/strawberry pancakes. They were mediocre. During that visit, one of my friends got the Hey Ricky omelette. It was really good - must have been the chorizo. If you want a omelette, I highly recommend it. My other girlfriend decided to act healthy in front of us and got the Ironman egg white omelette. Bad choice if you're starving and want some flavor. I've also tried the Belgian waffles and French toast. Breakfast classics that they seem to have perfected. I've giving this place 3 stars relative to its location, competition, service, and food. I still prefer it to the sickingly sweet Bongo Room.
