To be honest, I was growing tired and bored with Deep dish pizza...but then I found Pequod's. This place blows Lou Malnati's and every other deep dish pizza I've eaten out of the water!!! I'm going to make this short and sweet cause I will be re-reviewing this place in the future... Pizza is thick, excellent sauce(perfect blend of flavor and some sweetness), excellent amount of cheese, the sausage needs to be on each and every pizza, AND the crust is the BEST part (does not look the part but it is chewy heaven in your mouth). Great service and decent beer selection as well. GO here and grab some excellent pie for great prices.
