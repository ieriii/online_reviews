Revolution Brewing is a hip gastro pub in Logan Square. The best part of this meal to me was the bacon fat popcorn. It had just the right amount of flavor and tiny little bits of bacon. I ordered a cheeseburger and it was really good. Another friend had a salad. He seemed satisfied, I did not hear much from him about it. But the table winner seemed to be my friend's mussels. A nice large portion incorporating BLUE CHEESE in the liquid made her squeal with delight. Damn I should've ordered that.
