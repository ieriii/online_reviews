I love Cuban food, and this place hits the spot! I love that they have a little eating area on stools, and the dcor makes you feel like you have stepped into a Havana quick bite spot! The big man and I came here on Saturday night whilst we were out on the town (a.k.a. on our way to Costco). We decided on the croquetas, and two sandwiches: media noche (ham, roast pork, swiss, pickles and mustard on sweet bread) and the guajirito (green plantains, steak, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and swiss cheese) with the plantains serving as the bread. The media noche was tender, with succulent meats, and the mustard and pickles added something unique, along with the sweet bread, nicely holding the ingredients together, but flat enough to not be focused 100% on the carbs. I loved my guajirito, which was a nice combo of ingredients, with a nice mild flavoring. The only complaint I could see people having is that the meat is not flavored, and I could see people thinking that the sandwich lacks flavor. I, however, like that the flavoring is all natural, and not added with salt or heavy sauces. The plantains holding the sandwich together tasted like two big potato chips, not crispy, but firm yet flakey with that potato / banana taste. So delicious!!!! I love that they have plantain chips as sides as well. Although we both agreed that the croquetas were not up to par, the sandwiches were so delicious that they made up for them. Also, the owner was sitting right next to us as we ate and he is totally invested in making sure that his guests are happy. We took a bread pudding to go and ate it as a treat later on that night. It was very delicious, a nice balance between soft and spongy, custard, but still revealing the bread texture. I highly recommend 90 Miles, Costco bound or not!
