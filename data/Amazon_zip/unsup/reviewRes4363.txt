At the time of this review, the Green Mill is 103 years old. That's incredible (for the USA.) It's just absolutely gorgeous. If you go during off-peak hours you can sit at the bar with plenty of elbow room and meander around the place at your own pace and check out the history.  If you go there during peak hours, please do not be shocked by the crowds. It's popular, that means crowds. And if you do go during crowded times, do not be shocked and then come to yelp to complain that it was too crowded for you. The bartender that served my partner and I during my visit last Sunday was extremely friendly, very Chicago, surprisingly young and refreshingly kind. I've been to 'established' bars before with my boyfriend and have received a not so warm welcome. I guess the fact that the Green Mill is next door to Crew has something to do with this, but I still appreciate it. He went so far as to offer us a taste of Ruby and Tawny when we ordered a glass of Ramos Pinto and didn't know there were two kinds. A big plus for us was that the bartender had to go into the cellar to retrieve something and we got to peek down the famed stairs into the famed secret rooms for just a little bit. It was awesome.
