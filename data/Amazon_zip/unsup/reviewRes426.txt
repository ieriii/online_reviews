I'm departing from my standard review format since Alinea has been reviewed by so many other people and I generally agree with their comments. Below are a few comments that you hopefully find useful and unique. The food - yes it's amazing. One note, Alinea prides itself on "surprise." If you're looking for "traditional" food or a common theme there are others that do that better (Charlie Trotter's Comes to mind). The service - unbelievable. One of the ladies in our party rubbed her arms as she was a bit cold. A server was over within 10 seconds offering her a pashmina to use to warm up. Yes there is a wine pairing that is optional. It costs approximately 75% of the price of the meal. So if you are doing the tasting at $150, the wine parings will run $113. I would estimate the size of the pairings is equal a standard 4oz pour. I recommend the pairings, but if you are looking to keep costs down this is an easy place to do so. The Chef Achatz name rymes with Jackets and Rackets. There is an Allinea book. Published in 2007, this "cookbook" is really more of a coffee table book with great photos and background on the restaurant. It makes an excellent accompanying gift if you are taking someone there for a birthday,etc. Finally, I know you've heard it before, but black truffle explosion. WOW.
