Amazzzzzing. I used Yelp to search for a good lunch spot on a random summer weekday and came across this place. We opted to sit inside because it was quite hot outside and the place is obviously a wine bar. I'm not a big tapas fan but everything we tasted was awesome. My bf and I were interviewing all day so we needed to keep it light but we didn't want to scimp on flavor. The octopus, Jimmy's Greek Sausage, and Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder were all AMAZING. The portion sizes are bigger than what I'm used to from an upscale tapas place. The pork shoulder was so tender and juicy and the mashed potatoes it came with were excellent. The sausage was extremely flavorful and the octopus was so tender and delicious. They really have their dishes down, it seems. I'll definitely be back to try the other dishes. I saw lots of diners order the steak and beets. We didn't try the wine but I hope they have good pairings for us to try!
