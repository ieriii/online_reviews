I moved from California to Chicago 6 months ago. So, I thought when people refer to pizza in Chicago, they always mean deep dish pizza. That's why I was amazed to see Spacca Napoli is #1 in Pizza category of Chicago Zagat (Lou Malnati's tied for 1st place. I love it, too). In Spacca Napoli, we can enjoy friendly service, fancy terrace, and non-fatty, authentic pizzas. I liked Mozzerlla di Buffala especially. But, I can't rave about it. It is a little pricey. Actually I visited some well-known restaurant of thin-crust pizza in St. Paul, San Francisco, Tokyo and Italy, they offered great pizzas at more reasonable prices.
