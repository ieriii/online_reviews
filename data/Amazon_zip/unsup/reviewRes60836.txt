I eat out 365 lunches and 350 dinners a year. This was by far the worst food I have eaten. For those of you who are used to Prison Grub, this place may work for you. Great decor, terrible service, Disasterous food. Real expensive, real bad. Everyone (or at least 75% of respondants) who has written a positive review is employed by Zed. I warn anyone reading this, don't waste your money and time. Stay far away. Drinks on the roof could be nice, but still, very over priced.
