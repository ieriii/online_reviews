Nice hotel. GREAT location in regards to being able to walk everywhere. The bar when I was there had some sort of party going on in it, like maybe a birthday party or something and there didn't seem to be any waitresses around to get my drink order but I didn't really care that much because I was simply waiting on a friend to pick me up. I utilized bag check on my day of checkout and when I went to get my bag the attendant was very prompt. He was right on it.  The room was very nice and rather large. Huge bathroom, standard W bed (very comfortable), enormous television. Seriously, I am not sure that I have ever seen THAT big of a TV in a hotel room before. LOL  I found the rooms in this while less light filled than the other location to be just as nice and much much larger than the other W hotel. They both have some catching up to do though if I were to compare to either the W Boston or the W Seattle.  I did not try out the restaurant as I was only there one night and arrived late. Also, there are so many really great restaurants in Chicago that I have yet to try that I, more than likely, will never eat in my hotel's restaurant. Well, unless I stay at the Burnham sometime. ;)  I stayed at the other Chicago W location back in December as well. That one had a much better view but the location for this one in my opinion is better. This location tends to run better specials too in regards to room rates.
