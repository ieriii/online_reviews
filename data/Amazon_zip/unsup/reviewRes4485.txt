Too many years have gone by! It has almost been 10 years since I have been to the Green Mill. Last night I finally when back! It was great to know some things never change. IF you are looking for something that embodies the diverse art scene of Chicago, a visit to the Green Mill Slam Poetry Night is a must! It has been a staple since 1986 and survives through the great poets along with the bad poets of Chicago. Bring your poetry or just go to listen, either way it is a great way to spend a Sunday Night!
