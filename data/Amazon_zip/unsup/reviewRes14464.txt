It seems like a nice place but they ran out of food (steak & chicken). My suggestion get there before 8pm on a nice summer day. The people there are very nice and the outside seat area is cool but as a restaraunt you really cant run out of food. I am going to try this place again just for the benefit of the doubt. Right now my rating stands at a 2.
