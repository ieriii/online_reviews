This is a four star brunch review. Thanks to reading Mandy A.'s review, I remembered I had a Groupon for Cafe 28 that I hadn't used. We haven't had brunch in a while and I remembered ooohing and aaahing over their brunch menu.  We arrived around 11am and got seated right away. Service was great and very friendly. I ordered a large tomato juice, coffee and crab cake benedict. The hubs got a bloody mary, torta and the round it all off, a mojito.  The crab cake benedict was good. Not great, but good. You can taste the crab but what I wanted was more hollandaise sauce. That's why I get the benedict. The eggs were poached perfectly. The potatoes were meh. The hubs liked his torta and his beverages. We definitely want to check this out for dinner. I have suggested this place to friends for dinner and I have yet to myself. Can't wait for trip two. I'm sure this four star rating will soon bump up to five.
