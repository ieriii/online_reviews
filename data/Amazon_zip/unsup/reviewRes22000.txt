I was in Chicago for a short trip and Superdawg was the only place I looked forward to going to. This being my first time in Chicago, I got lost on the way there, but the journey was well worth it. I was somewhat confused on how to use the drive-in feature... but I finally got the hang of it and placed my order for a Chicago dog with everything on it. I fell in love again and again with each bite. The hot dog was so juicy and plump. I definitely recommend this place if you are in the Chicago area. The novelty of the place and packaging that the hot dog came in is very creative.
