Came here on one of those coupon deals. This was my second time experiencing Ethiopian cuisine. I thought the restaurant looked good and the food was easy to follow. All of the food I had was plenty and flavorful, and their wines were delicious. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the service. The waitresses were attentive in the beginning of the meal but after awhile they stopped coming over. We waited a long time to get someone to refill on drinks and to bring over the bill..
