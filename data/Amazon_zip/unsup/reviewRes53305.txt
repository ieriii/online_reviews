I highly recommend people bringing out-of-town visitors! My brother-in-law begs me to go here every time he's in town from CA. It's a pretty cool experience if you remember to skip breakfast. Long lines on weekends, but if you're with friends catching up and not in a hurry it doesn't really matter. I've waited 40 minutes on a Saturday even after it just rained and hailed. Yes, hailed. For shorter lines and less than 15 minute waits, get there right at noon or earlier on a weekday. The Foie Gras dog is almost too much for me, but the free soda refills are always there to help me cut the creaminess if necessary. Try them all! If you're going for the 1st time and aren't sure what to get, ASK Doug! He's at the counter and takes orders and is an extremely personable guy. Servers are very nice. Bring cash and I'd say big eaters can probably put away 3-4 dogs, with the most expensive ones being $6-7. Usually with a group of first-timers, we will order nearly everything and just cut up the dogs so everybody can try them. Yes, it's not the purest form of hot dog eating, but it's how you can swing the full experience without busting anybody's lunch budget or stomach for that matter.
