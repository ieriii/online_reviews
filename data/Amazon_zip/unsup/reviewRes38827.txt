I hesitate in giving this place 5 stars because I do not like the fact that you cannot make reservations, there is almost always a wait and service can be hit or miss depending on the crowds. Neverthless, the atmosphere is cozy and warm without being overly heavy on the cozy. The food tends to be on the heavy side as it is Belgium which I can only describe as a combination of German and French so make sure you go there with an appetite. It is undoubtly great gastropub-grub. Great food aside, I mainly go there for the beer selection. Not the largest I have seen in Chicago but extensive and very good. So far I have tried the following beers: Chimay Grand Reserve (blue label Belgian) - dark and rich but surprisingly not as heavy as it looks, Chimay (red label) - medium weight, perhaps nuttier than the blue, Bell's Two-Hearted Pale ale - great Michigan brew, Fin du Monde (Canada) - yum!, Duchesse du Bourgogne (YUCK! I was infomed that this is supposed to taste the way it does. To me, it smells and tastes rancid or like something that has "turned". I took it back and the waiter gave me a Red Chimay on the house!) The other thing I enjoy about Hopleaf is that it is not pretentious and the customers are as varied as the beer selection. You can go there in a pair of jeans or even a little dressed up and it's okay. Definitely one of my faves.
