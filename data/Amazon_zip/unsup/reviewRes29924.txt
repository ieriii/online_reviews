Worst service ever. I had to play the waiter to give back my dish and ended up leaving in pure disgust with no food. It was cold not fresh and the server was completely mean when I told here I wanted it remade. Shes like I can microwave it for you and after she brought it back and I was done wanting to puke I went to the server with the dish and demanded it off my tab and told her all I am paying is the drink. Do not go here unless you like cold food and bad service.
