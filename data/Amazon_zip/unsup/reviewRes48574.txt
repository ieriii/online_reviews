I may have caught the swine flu, but it was worth it. perhaps the greatest waffle I have ever had ever ever. In fact they could have just keep bringing them and i wouldnt have stopped. I also had the wood fired egg dish and a couple of other very tastey things. I've gone and been able to sit in one of the pig pens. It had to be the most comfortable thing since being in my mothers womb. sorry thats actually sounds gross but I'm leaving it. I loved sitting there and getting scones, large pieces of bacon, and waffles placed right in front of me. The bloody mary comes with a choice of beer shooters. These are not Bud light lime shooters by the way. mmmm. I need to get back there.
