I love Grand Lux, but I just can't ever seem to find a good time to go here because it's ALWAYS crowded. However, when I do have enough patience to wait for a table (which isn't often) I'm very happy with the food choices...everything is very good (especially the salads) and the portions are absolutely huge!
