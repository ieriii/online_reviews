So unique, honestly, they really make an effort to make your experience a special one. I wasn't a fan of waiting out in the rain for a table on Friday night, but when you walk in, you realize that you waited for a reason. They aren't trying to make a billion dollars by cramming a ton of people into the place. It's crazy dark in there, I felt like a granny holding a candle up to my menu. I ordered the El Diablo, a tequila and ginger syrup concoction. It was delicious, but I have to say, just a fancied up Margarita. I also tried the Dark and Stormy, which I think was my favorite. The drinks with egg-whites in them are also pretty special...they are frothy and delicious, and hey, extra protein:) Another gripe, or two....our poor dates had to sit on ottomans....what is that about?! That sucks, buy some more high-chairs please, those are cool. And the table next to us were yelling their conversations to eachother....hello, you're ruining the mood!!! If you're not allowed to use your cell-phone in this place, you should tell some of your patrons to use their indoor voices... All in all, this is just a great experience and so much more original than the typical bar scene. Each table is very private, so I imagine it'd be pretty hard to meet new people at this place, but if you have a group and you just want to have a good drink and discuss amongst yourselves, this is the place to be!
