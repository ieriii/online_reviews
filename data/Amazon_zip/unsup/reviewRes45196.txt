Anteprima, is not just a preview of good food, it is the main attraction. I spent my birthday at this Italian food hotspot. I have always loved coming here for the simplicity of the food, the creative pastas, the laid back atmosphere and the dedication to seasonal ingredients. I love Italian food and am not impressed by most places that offer the usual fare of Eggplant parmesan, pasta marinara, or chicken cacciatore. I appreciate the rustic, peasant style food that comes from a long tradition of great Italian culinary history. Italian food is more than just cheese, tomatoes and pasta, it is a culmination of seasonal foods, fresh ingredients and a celebration of simple flavors. Anteprima has achieved the feel of eating at an authentic Italian table with recipes that have a long tradition in an Italian grandmother's kitchen.  My friends and I ordered almost all the appetizers on the menu. I love the Fava bean puree with rapini, the fried smelts, the sweet and sour cippolini onions, the prawns with roasted fennel, the creamy wild mushrooms, the grilled polenta with bitter greens and tomato, cannellini beans with sage, the roasted beats with almonds and arugula, the brussel sprouts with pancetta, and the salumi platter. We also ordered the grilled octopus which was tender and cooked perfectly except the char on the outside was a bit too bitter and overwhelmed the actual flavor of the octopus. We tried 8 different pastas, the strozzapretti, toasted walnut pesto, pecorino was one of our favorites! The pork shoulder was perfection, falling off the bone and melting in our mouths. The whole porgy was delicious and was served with a nice romesco sauce.  All in all, it was a satisfying and a delicious meal! Anteprima can satisfy even the most die hard Italian food fans. Expect excellent simply cooked food without a lot of fanfare. It's just good food, buon appetito!
