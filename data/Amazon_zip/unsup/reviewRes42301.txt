I used to visit The Art (as we affectionately call it in the 'hood) too often when I first moved into the area. Lately I've been on a thin crust kick and sought out pizza from other places. Art of Pizza does a good thin crust, but I like the really, really thin cracker crust. Anyways... I had a friend in town from California and we only had a few hours together. She really wanted some pizza and down the street we went. HOLY COW! I think forgot how good the deep dish pizza is. It's amazing, the crust is SO buttery good. The Art is back into regular rotation. It's a fast, inexpensive, delicious meal! Go grab a slice! P.S. Oscar, Edgar and the rest of the staff are still as sweet as ever!
