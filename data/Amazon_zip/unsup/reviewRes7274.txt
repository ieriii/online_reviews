This is where my boyfriend took me on our first date, so maybe I'm a little bit biased, but hey - we've been dating for over 1.5 years now, so I suppose that says something about how great Sapori Trattoria is! I've never had anything on the menu that I thought was sub-par. Everything from the bread to the salads to the entrees and desserts are delicious. You really can't go wrong. The service is excellent and the staff is really knowledgeable when it comes to their menu. They're really helpful when it comes to wine pairing. I would highly recommend going to Sapori Trattoria on a nice summer night because you can sit outside. The trees along the sidewalk are decorated with white Christmas lights, making the ambiance very romantic. Also, at busy times, it gets you out of the crowded dining room. Sapori Trattoria is great for date night or a special occasion with friends and family. It's fancy without breaking the bank (especially if you sign up for their mailing list). And it might even help you find true love. :-)
