So the first place Aydin and I went post O'Hare was the Hopleaf. I have wanted to go to this place for quite awhile. I absolutely love Belgium beers and I also love bars that cater to the finer brews and those patrons who appreciate their rarity. I started with the Tripel Karmeliat and the Mussels cooked in beer. Aydin ordered the Steak Frites (rare...just how I like it!) and the Duchesse du Bourgogne. My Tripel was light and crisp and matched perfectly with the Mussels and fries. Aydin actually didn't like his Duchesse (too sweet) so I ended up finishing that one too. Instead he went with the De Koninck and it was much more his style...(more on the dry and bitter side). We sat in the back room away from the smoke and lounged the night away. It was so pleasant with the exposed brick and awesome kitchy art. I would say the food however was just mediocre, but the beers make this totally worth it. I am definitely going to be back, but may try something else off the menu. If anyone can steer me in the right direction that would be awesome...(btw...I hate shoestring fries)! Also, all the beers we ordered were off the draft menu and next time I am going for the bottles with some recommendations from the guys who really know their stuff. Cheers!
