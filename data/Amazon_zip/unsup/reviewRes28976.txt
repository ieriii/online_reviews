Ugh *shakes fist* I haven't been here in years and thought I would return to Yelp about it. I was so disappointed with the Penang curry. The chicken and curry were good, but that's pretty much all there was. I've never had a Thai curry so plain, where are all the vegetables? Green beans, mushrooms, bamboo shoots...where were you? I don't count the little pieces of green pepper because I'm not a big fan of those. The BBQ pork Bamee (egg noodle with soup) was a bit sour, like someone had squeezed too much lime in. Besides that, it would have been great. I must say, the Thai custard dessert saved the day. It was so coconutty and delicious, I could have eaten 10 more squares of those!! The Thai ice coffee was also good. With hundreds of Thai restaurants in the city (at least 2 nearby), I won't be coming back anytime soon...well, maybe for dessert.
