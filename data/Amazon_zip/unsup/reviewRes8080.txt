Okay, I'll nudge them up to 3.5. The funny thing is, this was nearly an identical experience as the first time, but since my expectations were lowered, I was more disposed to enjoy the meal. And I did. My sister and I shared two pizzas--the straight-up margherita and one of the daily specials, a porcini-somethingaroni. The latter was a white pizza, which, in my opinion, generally suffer from the lack of tomatoey tang. However, this version had the porcinis, some arthichokes, and shaved parmesan, giving it plenty of flavor. The margherita was very solid but again I ask WHERE IS THE BASIL? Our pizza had two spindly medium-sized pieces and two other tiny shreds. LAME. They were doing a very brisk takeout business, so we actually "had" to wait about fifteen minutes for our pizzas. Not a problem. Later we enjoyed the tartufo dessert. The pizza is good but not great and I still think that they are overpriced. If we hadn't had the A La Card I wouldn't have come. That being said, it was an above-average meal in a warm setting with decent service, so I can't complain. On our way out, the button-cute hostess offered us mini-cannoli--bonus.
