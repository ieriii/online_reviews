A Classic. Booked a suite and it was absolutely beautiful. Tastefully renovated, beautiful white leather chairs, very nice bedroom and bathrooms, and as this was a corner suite, huge living room with and lots of windows.Great service. Ate at one of the restaurants downstairs. Food as ok, nothing special.
