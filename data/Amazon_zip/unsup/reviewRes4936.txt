Honestly, I think this place is a little* over-hyped, BUT I did enjoy the meal. All in all, a SUPER rich meal. I understand now why our waiter raised his eyebrow when we put our order in and wondered if we wanted another dish. What he meant was a vegetable dish. We started of with the Roasted Bone Marrow. Yes, this was good, rich, and super fattiness to spread on slices of baguettes topped with some oil drenched parsley and capers. Next we got the Pig's ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers, and a fried egg on top. I'm not sure if the egg was supposed to be sunnyside up (looked like it), but it was a tad on the over cooked side and wasn't runny at all. The pig's ear was super crunchy and I couldn't really tell it was pig's ear (as I've had it braised before so you can taste the flavor). It tasted like overdone to a crisp fry. The crispy kale was my favorite out of the dish. Go figure. The least favorite was the pickled cherry peppers, which completely took away from the entire dish and overwhelmed all the flavors. Lastly, we had the milk braised pork shoulder. By this time, I was a little pigged out from all the richness. The pork shoulder was nice and tender, but a little bit on the salty side. Even after everything we had, I could still taste the saltiness in the dish. We had a great Syrah from the Corbieres region of France. This medium bodied berry wine went great and held it's own with the rich meal we had. We finished it off with the Sicilian Iris, which was a deep fried brioche (think donut) filled with ricotta and chocolate chip. Very good and it was lightly powdered with cinnamon sugar. Yum! Next time in Chicago we will probably be back as the bf enjoyed this meal a tad more than I did, but will be prepared for the dollar amount spent this time NOT $$ as Yelp as reviewed, but more like $$$ :)
