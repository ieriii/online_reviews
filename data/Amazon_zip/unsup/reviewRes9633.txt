Everything was fantastic with our dinner service on a Saturday night. We went early to avoid the crowd. The restaurant is pretty small and can fit only 30 people or so. Please remember to make a reservation. The tables are small and placed fairly close together. It makes for a cozy atmosphere but be prepared to hear your neighbor's conversation.  I ordered Scallop, Short Ribs, and Chocolate while my wife got the Scallop, Game (special of the night), and Pineapple. Food was amazing and very creative. Best scallops we had ever. Do get the $60 prix fixe option as it comes with little extras between courses. Our waiter was polite, attentive, and accomodating. It was our first time there so he took the time to explain the menu and each course as it came.  We will definitely be back to try the other courses.
