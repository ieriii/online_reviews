I am obsessed with Rick Bayless after how great he was on Top Chef Masters, so I dragged a big group of friends down to try his latest endeavor, XOCO. We showed up around 6:30 on a Saturday, and probably waited for half an hour or so in line...but I made sure to manage everyone's expectations after having read yelp reviews that said likewise.  Rick Bayless, HIMSELF, was working behind the counter, and was kind enough to take a picture with us, even though he looked incredibly busy. I was too starstruck to speak to him, but this definitely made my week.  The guac and chips (amazing guac), choriqueso (if you love chorizo, you will love this torta), churro (sugary and delicious), and hot chocolate (azteca w/ a shot of dolce de leche) were all amazing. Also, the hostess was incredibly nice and worked hard to get our table of 9 to sit close to each other.  The menu had so many great things that I can't wait to go back and try more! However, I think perhaps we'll try to go during the off peak hours. Highly recommended!
