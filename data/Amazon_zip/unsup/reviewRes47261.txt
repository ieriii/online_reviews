I dig the theme of being in a jail cell and the music that goes with it. However, the music is really loud and you can't really talk over it. Call me old, but it could be turned down a little. I've yet to try Kuma's, which everyone is comparing them. But, the burgers are wonderful. Their burger's might even give "The Big Kahuna" burger a run for their money?!?! When you get to themed restaurants, you are being sold on the the theme and not the food. Not this place, I tried a bite of what the others were having it was all good. With a decent beer selection of cheap beer and fancy craft beer, you can't go wrong. Speaking of the menu, each item is cleverly matched to the name of a crime.  Great place, great food...do it.
