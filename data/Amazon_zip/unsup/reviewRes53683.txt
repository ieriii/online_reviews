What can I say - it was an incredible experience.Michael called me 1 month after I left him a message on his voice mail. He was apologetic and was able to accommodate my party of 6 on a Friday night. Which is a big deal for this small space. The decor is not much to write home at but frankly that is not why you go to Schwa. Michael and his crew are truly artists with food as their medium. We ordered the 9 course tasting menu and got more like 12 courses. The presentation was amazing and flavors haunting. Some complain about the music but we loved it and honestly it helped make the atmosphere nice and casual. Bottom line is this: To get a meal like this anywhere in the world(I say this because I just returned from Europe) you would pay three times as much and have to put up with a stuffy atmosphere. Michael and Schwa offer a unique experience - seeing an artist in his element, making masterpiece after masterpiece.
