I can't tell you how many times I've yelped a bar and used the phrase "it's your typical bar ." This is not one of those times. Actually, in my opinion, everything about Hopleaf is quite unique. When I first stepped inside the first thing I thought was "Why do I keep getting told it's tough to get a table here? Looks like your typical bar to me." Then I was taken to the back, as dinner was on the agenda. It's not a fancy dining area, but nonetheless it is nice and one where you can speak with those your out with without having to shout (very important in my book!). The food selection was unique as well. If you're looking for a burger, look elsewhere. There were so many choices that I will definitely have to return so at the very least I can sample all the dishes that caught my eye. On this particular occasion, I had the Tilapia sandwich. It was lovely! Lightly fried on the outside and cooked just perfect on the inside. The server not only helped me choose which entree to get, but also helped with table's beverage selection - which was perfect just as well. When it comes to atmosphere Hopleaf has something for everyone. If you're looking to hang at a bar the front is for you. Looking for a more formal eating area? Try the back. One person mentioned outdoor seating in their Yelp review which I would be totally down for, but didn't ask about because I was concentrating more on my desire for food. However, I look forward to the experience in the future. Last, but certainly not least, the server was friendly and helpful. I appreciated her candid input on the food and beverage selections. Overall, now I understand why people have trouble getting a table for dinner and also why it's worth it.
