One of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Chicago! Came here on a whim with my fiancee a couple months ago and had one of the best "in between" meals we have had in a long time. We were not looking for a full sit down meal, and saw that the Purple Pig had a great wine selection as well as some particularly appetizing tapas. We ended up discovering this great Spanish wine (Naia) that is now one of our favorites and had an assortment of cured meats and Spanish cheeses. As someone who loves his cheese, I was in absolute heaven. We loved it so much we decided to order a couple more plates and all of the sudden our "in between" meal turned into a 90 min culinary voyage that left us wanting more. The ambiance is great, quaint and friendly, and the staff was great. We make a point to come here every time we are back in Chicago and can't wait until we get another chance to visit.
