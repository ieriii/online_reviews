what a comfortable way to start a saturday! we've only tried it for breakfast so far, and arrive at 9 when they open, so the rush and crowds haven't affected our experience. the atmosphere is laid back, but the service is right on, filled cups, friendly wait staff, personal greeting from the owner who looks like he needs more sleep. you can get your french toast made with four different bread options. i get mine with whole grain bread, and fool myself into thinking it's healthier! it's just right, and so are the egg dishes. i've loved the smoked salmon benedict and husb. liked the meat laden canadian scramble. he's esp. fond of the gratis potato pancake, which is crisp outside, creamy inside, a very tasty side. coffee's good as well. have some gift certs to use when we get a chance to try their dinner menu. lots of seafood, including some fish i've never even heard of. can't wait to sample some.
