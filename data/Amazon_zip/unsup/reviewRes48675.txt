First time here. Was recommended by a friend. My friend claimed it was better than girl and the goat! Verdict: Maybeeeeeeee. Haha. They have DELICIOUS publican beer. They melt sugar cane and mix it with Belgian beer that they get straight from the brewery. The oysters were the best I've had in the city thus far (including G&Gs). Mussels were great but nothing special. And the dessert is a must!! The waffle is so soft and doughie (in a 'the best waffle in your life' kind of way). Samurai chai, truly a unique tea, get it. Looking forward to going again. The servers are really nice so just ask them what they recommend. Definitely going back.
