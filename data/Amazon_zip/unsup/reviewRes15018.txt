My boyfriend and I made a trip to Chicago last month and The Violet Hour was top on our list of bars to check out. When we walked through the streets of Wicker Park and saw a line of people waiting patiently outside an unmarked graffiti'ed wall, we knew we had found it. We got waved in pretty quickly, felt awesome to cut in front of bigger groups! We were seated at the bar. It felt like a dark, romantic cave inside with giant ceiling to floor drapes separating tables and booths, candles along the bar, and elegantly chic decor. I've never experienced anything like this. The ambience is wonderful, the craft cocktails are delicious and creative and music choice was awesome. I could enjoy a private conversation without annoying the groups next to us. Another thing that I'll add is that I waited a really long time for my second cocktail and eventually our bartendar noticed, apologized and swifty made it. He took that drink off our bill, which was a nice bonus.
