So somehow I made it to this brazilian steakhouse with a bunch of germans. I usually try to stay away from anything this close to the major kitsch-land that is ESPN Zone, but a fun group of germans I was working with for the week invited me out. At first I laughed at the wine girl who swings around on an elastic cord and harness thing to select wines from the enormous 2 or 3 story high wall that shelves all the bottles but then I was secretly impressed with her flips and tricks. For a second it reminded me of a Casa Bonita type place, but with more seriousness because this is a sophisticated steakhouse, right? Our table started with a round of Caipirinhas which were tasty, then we moved on to many bottles of Malbec, which were all neccessary for me to get comfortable enough to break out my high school and college german phrases and try understand what these people at my table were talking about. The salad bar looks impressive but was just ok. Salad bars just seem dirty to me. This salad bar has everything from sushi rolls to cheeses to roasted veggies and of course, salad. It is really more like an antipasti station. The meats were also ok, but they all sort of tasted the same, just like really salty meat. After being forced to drink more, my german diner-friends made me get dessert too. I got a papaya ice cream dessert, which was basically a glorified McDonald's milkshake. The germans I were with made this dining experience fun but the food was fairly decent, not great, and pretty expensive. I think they rely on gimmicks like the flying wine girl to make up for the average food. I wouldn't make an effort to come back to Texas de Brazil again but would probably relent if a fun group of people wanted to meet up here AND if someone else was paying.
