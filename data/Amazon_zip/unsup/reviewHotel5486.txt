The Sutton Place is fabulous! My husband and I stayed there the day after our wedding and loved it! I have no idea what anyone is taking about with the bathrooms being outdated. The bathroom was very nice. Huge soaking tub and separate shower. In fact, I think the bathroom was bigger than some of the hotel rooms we had on our honeymoon in Italy. Okay, well not really, but it felt like it. My only complaints are that the place was a bit cold and the people at the front desk were less than friendly, but those are two things I am more than willing to deal with.
