This place will make lots of money. Not only because of the fabulous food but because I doubt they pay any electric bills with how dark it is in there. The food is spectacular. We started with a cold appetizer of tuna and avocado dip with wonton crackers that was absolutely superb and exactly the type of inventive dish that you need at a sushi place to make you remember it. Then we moved on to the crown jewels of the place and ordered some rolls, 3 rolls to be exact. The oh la mango roll, the kani chung, and the peter parker. All 3 are completely different, yet all three came out beautifully. They were presented so well you almost couldnt pull yourself to eat them and ruin the art on your plate. But we got over that real quick and dug out. Each of our rolls was flavorful to the point that it was hard to pick which one we wanted to pick at next. A great establishment and I'll be returning soon.
