Moved to Chicago, felt I owed it to myself to try Hot Doug's, now make it a fairly regular occasion. Yes, it is worth the wait. A 2 hour wait? No. 30 minutes or less? Consider such a small line a gift from the gods, get in line and prepare to be amazed. If you are coming here solely to try a Chicago-style hot dog for the first time, I would recommend going someplace else. Doug does make a mighty fine hot dog with all the trimmings (though you must specify if you want sport peppers), but that is not the real draw of this place. I've always had fantastic experiences with his Chicago dogs, Brats, Thuringers, and all the other sausage staples that he offers, but one truly owes it to one's self to order the Game Of The Week. Take a game animal sausage, such as elk, antelope, or rabbit, add a sauce and cheese that are paired specifically to that sausage, and you have a truly magnificent gastronomic experience. The best I've had is the spicy smoked alligator sausage with Cajun Remouillade sauce and St. Pete's blue cheese. It is easily one of the top five meals of my life. It seems preposterous to many that something as simple as sausage could be this delicious, but this isn't yer brudder Bill's Poolish Sahssidge from da Jool's. Doug takes his craft very seriously, and he loves his job. I'm sure he gets tired of the endless droves of people at the counter every day who still can't make up their minds despite ample decision-making time while waiting in line, but he sure hides it well. His great service, friendly wait staff and all-around great atmosphere (plus the mind-blowingly great food) make this an essential Chicago establishment. If I ever find it in myself to open a restaurant, I'm going to have a talk with him. He has obviously done something right. If you're from out of town and you want to try a Chicago-style hot dog, there are certainly quicker and equally satisfying places to do so. But if you're serious about sausage, Hot Doug's is crucial.
