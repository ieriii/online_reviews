A new favorite tapas place!!! Mercat is conveniently located on South Michigan ave at the Blackstone Hotel...I love the atmosphere - dark, chic, modern...reminded me of a NYC bar. I agree with other Yelpers that the menu was a bit overwhelming (you want everything!) but we had a fantastic server who explained the menu and gave some recommendations. We loved all 6 tapas we tried. I loved that they were true "tapas" portions and the flavors were heavenly! I had wished they played Spanish music instead of weird techno...and would have preferred to sit away from the kitchen, but overall a great experience. Great for date night and I'll definitely go back.
