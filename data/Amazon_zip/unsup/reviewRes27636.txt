The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I got a hair in my pizza a few months ago. I called them and they offered to send me out another pizza but my stomach was already turned.  Hairnets guys and girls!!!!!!! They also need a better wine selection.. the last time we went there my wine tasted like old vinegary thick juice... Don't try the thin or handtossed here. Deep dish is their specialty. The crust is burnt and tasty. I love the sauce, juicey goodness! I will be back when I can get that hair experience out of my mind!!
