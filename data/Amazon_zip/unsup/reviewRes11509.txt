I'm kind of surprised by some of the negative reviews, because my boyfriend and I love ordering from here. It might make a difference that 1)we live really close, so our pizza is still hot when it's delivered, and 2) we usually order the white pizza, with fresh basil and tomatoes. Now that I think about it, we've never ordered anything BUT the white pizza... and I don't think we will after reading the reviews. The crust is the perfect balance between chewy and crispy.  It is thin though, so I can see why it wouldn't be so great with a lot of sauce and toppings on it. We would probably order from here a lot more , except that it really is kind of expensive. Last time we ordered a medium pizza and a Caesar salad, and it was almost 35 bucks... kind of pricey for pizza night for two people.
