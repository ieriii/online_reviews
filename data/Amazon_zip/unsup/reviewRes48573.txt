Step inside this restaurant and you will find yourself in a place that feels like a European beer hall. The Publican focuses on pork, oysters, and beer. The beer list is very extensive that at first glance it could look intimidating especially with the excellent myriad of beers made up of local and international microbrews that a lot of people have probably not heard of. But, ask your server anything about beer and he/she will have answers for you. Tell your server what type of beer you like e.g. wheat beer vs. hoppy beer, and they will have recommendations. Or, say that you like Blue Moon, and asked what beers are similar to that. They will have answers for you. The caramelized pork belly is always a pleaser and arguably one of the best we have had. A bite of the pork belly melts in the mouth each time. The aged ham is always a must-have for us. We generally like to do a taste of three hams since each variety has its own characteristics. The little gem salad is also very good and it comes with crispy pig ears! Mmm! Don't be afraid of it. It hardly tastes anything like what it sounds. And of course, get the oysters. And the big pot of mussels.
