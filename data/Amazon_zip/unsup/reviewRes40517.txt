I live in the neighborhood and have been here a few times. Early on, there were some issues that were service related that were a real turn off and kept me from going back for a while. For instance, after stopping in for a late night snack (and plunking down some good $$ to eat and have a cocktail) the staff started yelling at people to get out because they were closing. It was really a lousy way to end a good night and wasn't what I would expect at a place where you just spent some serious cash. It took me a while to get over that and go back and I'm glad I did. With my past experience, you're probably wondering why the 5 stars. The last few times I was there for dinner, it was fabulous from the food to the service to the wine. The last time, in particular, was so much fun. We had a great time. The server was really attentive, friendly and had some great recommendations. We solicited a wine recommendation and he was spot on. The appetizers and entrees were really good, too. I highly recommend the gnocchi and scallop dish. I'm not a vegetarian but I usually get the roasted cauliflower. I'm never disappointed. It was absolutely perfect -- very flavorful and a good size portion. My friend got the cod, I think it was, and he practically licked the plate clean. They've expanded the outdoor seating and it really makes me wish the warm weather would last longer so we could take advantage of it for a few more months!
