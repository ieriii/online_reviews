* This "Revolution" was birthed after the owners sold over 200 Che Guevara T-shirts( at twenty five bucks a piece) in ten minutes at a CUBS Game* Allow me to part the Vanilla Sea of 4 and 5 star reviews( 99% of which include the word "awesome") for a shot of truth.   Like Marx invented the formula to measure the labor content of profits, "Revolution" Brewing Co has invented the way to get rich by giving the NPR elite( and their children) exactly what they desire in "da hood". An escape to the uniformity, tranquility, safety, purity and opulence   of Lincoln Park, minus the social guilt associated with it. Yes this "Revolution" would send Gil Scott Heron fleeing to the most remote Mormon Church in Idaho, which I bet has more "color" in it than Revolution- except for in its kitchen of course. So how do they make the NPR liberals comfortable to "see and be seen in such defacto segregation"? Whelp, they give all their beers and foods names like "Workingman's Burger,( sold for 11 bucks- and no they don't take the Link card-) "Coup D'Etat Salad" and my favorite, "Black Power Ale" . Hipster ironic? You be the judge. But as to the food and drink, the mussels are as measly as an English peasant's earnings.  The too sweet Flemish Beef Stew should have been served as Marie Antoinette's cake was, for desert. But who cares. This huge gleaming shiny ultra-bright spaceship portal to Lincoln Park( that makes Goose Island look and seem as diverse as the U.N) will be the next best thing to Cubs front row seats come this summer, with its full bottom to top surround sound plasma TVs that are so expensive that they must also be 3D!
