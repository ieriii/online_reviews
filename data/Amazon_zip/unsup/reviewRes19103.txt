It was raining and thundering in downtown Chicago around 3pm on a Saturday when we arrived at Xoco, and we waited over 30 minutes for our food. That's a testament to what people are willing to do to eat these mind-blowing tortas! My friend and I shared: *Ahogada - braised pork carnitas, pickled onions served in a spicy tomato broth: I will dream of my first bite, and quite frankly, every single bite that followed, for years to come. Best described as juicy, salty, spicy, hearty, savory, and tangy. The meat was cooked to tender, juicy perfection, and I loved the crunchy bread soaked in the tomato broth. The broth had an underlying smoky flavor, perhaps fire-roasted poblano peppers? Addicting! *Woodland Mushroom - wood-roasted garlic mushrooms, goat cheese and wild arugula: Absolutely delicious, but it gets pretty greasy! So flavorful it doesn't need the 3-chile salsa that's served on the side. Would love to try this dipped in the tomato broth though. I love soggy bread =)  *churros & dipping chocolate - the churros tasted like they were fried in oil that had been used to cook savory food. was really distracting and made the "dessert" rather unappetizing. This place is a MUST TRY!
