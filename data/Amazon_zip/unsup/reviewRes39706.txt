Disappointed... Greater the expectation, greater the disappointment. Honestly, it was one of the worst/mediocre non marinated short ribs I ever tasted. The meat was not tender at all and very tough. But I would suggest everyone to give it a try! On the brighter side, the servers were very nice and there were over 10, I want to say 18 different side dishes :)!! And they were all very, very, very good!
