Probably one of my favorite places in Chicago. Food is consistently great and at really good pricepoint. Standouts are: -Salt roasted beets with whipped goat cheese and pistachio -Pig's ear with crispy kale and fried egg -Milk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatos -Pork liver pate -Pork neck bone gravy with calabro ricotta Lots of people rave about the bone marrow... i've had it, its not bad but i've had better. I prefer the pork neck bone gravy with ricotta. Word of caution, the wait times can be long and they don't take reservations. Don't come here with more than 4 people during peak hours.
