Boom! Boom! Boom! Let's go back to the room, so we can eat it all night, and they can make it taste right! Oh wait, they are only open during the day? In an area of town, Wickerpark, where breakfast and lunch traffic is a bonus and not the rule, why would a restaurant with a beautiful, creative menu and fully stocked bar close at 2:30pm? A travesty this is. Food so fresh and so real is meant to be enjoyed at all hours of the day. The Bongo should not only provide chomping grounds to full-time mothers, home based workers, and weekend brunch goers. Instead, day time work travelers, evening eaters, and happy hour drinkers have the right to relish in the splendors of the Bongo. So please Mr. Bongo, hear my cries. Extend the hours. Leverage the creativity you currently use in providing delightful breakfasts and lunches, to dinners and late night. The masses will love you. I will love you. And for that, the world, or at least the Wickerpark portion of the world, will be a much better place.
