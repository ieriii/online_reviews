Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. One of the best food experiences I have had in a long long time. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything looked so amazing. I can't tell you what a great time we had.  I will absolutely be back. Wait staff was attentive, educated, pleasant and not intrusive to the dining experience.  Drinks/vintage cocktails were phenomenal Food was OUT. OF. CONTROL amazing. Salad to starter to soup to entree (fish was amazing) and the desserts were out of this world. The only downside(s) were a.) didn't get to see Chef Dale Levitsky... would have loved for him to come out and say hello b.) the decor is pretty weird in spots.. lose the plastic plants please.. and the fake brick wall looks really tacky.
