I eat/cook a lot of Italian food, and I have no qualms in saying is Piccolo Sogno one of the best Italian restaurants in this city of many. Most importantly, it is much more reasonably priced than some of its more vaunted brethren. I'm a food guy, but even I can appreciate the decor. The outdoor patio is beautiful as noted, and will definitely score you points on date night. The vibe inside is great as well, just make sure you aren't seated in the front room by the door and maitre'd station. Where they shine is with classic, simple dishes that are just executed very well. I've been really impressed with dishes like the tre colore salad, carpaccio, lamb ragu, salt-crusted branzino; they're not reinventing the wheel, just serving excellent straight-forward Italian. What more do you need?
