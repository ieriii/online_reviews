Yet another restaurant I went to when my family was in town. I started with the tomato and onion salad, the onions were way too potent so just ate the tomatoes and cheese. I had the petite fillet, it was fantastic! cooked very well and the sauce that came with it was fabulous. Had a great bottle of duckhorn which went great with the meal. Great service, nice parent friendly atmosphere. all in all a great steak house.
