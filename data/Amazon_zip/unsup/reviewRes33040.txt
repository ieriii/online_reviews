I LOVED this place! I am Romanian, so I have to admit that I am biased, but eating here was like going back to Romania! Such a unique, but approachable cuisine in a darling bistro. And, my fiance, who is not Romanian, also loved it. Great ambiance, too- they had two adorable musicians serenading us with any requests we could think of. We were so enamored, we even got up to dance to our favorite song. I recommend the ciorba (soup) with beets, the sarmale (stuffed cabbage), ragou, and mititei (little fried meats). Everything was awesome. My fiance said the Romanian beer was a good pills, too.
