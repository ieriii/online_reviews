In the summers, I tend to drink Starbucks iced coffee at work because of the good balance of potency, sweetness and ability to keep me AWAKE. I love it so much that I sip at it till its all gone, the sound of its last drops thru the straw heard by my cube neighbor alerting me via Instant Message "THERE'S NO MORE IN THERE!" to get me to stop.  Well, *she* wasn't with me when I went to Irazu's. And thank goodness because my cousin and I tore up that oatmeal shake. Yes, pitiful we shared ONE. But hey, I'm a nice cousin, and she had chosen the iced horchata coffee, but to my disadvantage, preferred my drink. Can ya blame her?!  "Can I have another sip, I just wanna make sure I'm not allergic to oatmeal" ummm, suuuuureeeeee knock yourself out.... The food here is legit, reasonably priced and well seasoned. They have a variety of empanadas, but unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with the beef empanada we had. Their skirt steak with tender, flavorful and a large serving. Rice and beans weren't my favorite, a tad on the mushy side. No problem, they also have white rice as an alternative, and ya can't mess up white rice right? The coleslaw was a nice side of a vinegar goodness, the plantains carmelized to its upmost potential.  Lauren P. absolutely loved the fried yucca, which can be served fried or boiled, both options with mojo, the garlicky goodness that accompanies it.  On this brisk night, we didn't get to sit out in the patio area, with the heated lamps in place. Instead we were inside the very Costa Rican themed restaurant, which being on the smallish side, I imagine to be packed in the winters. Only one bathroom, unisex available.  Omar and his staff served us fast and efficient, making sure to check up on us often. Omar is such a personal guy and will sit and talk shop about his favorite places within Chicagoland to eat. Ahhh, a way to my heart is thru my Yelp stomach.
