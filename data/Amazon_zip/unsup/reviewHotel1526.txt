Ok, it gets 5 stars for location, value ($129 Groupon price) and the BEST HOTEL BED EVAH!!! I'm really picky particularly about the A/C issue I've read about... our room has afternoon facing sun and Voila, A/C worked perfectly keeping us at 68 degrees even though it was moderately hot and humid outside.. The gym facility was pretty good too... we worked out at 1PM so was empty, but can imagine prime time can get crowded, but it was good for us... No restaurant in hotel per se, kinda a bar style place, but wife is from Chicago so we drove to Andersonville and had great breakfast up there.. I don't know what they are using for their beds, but we slept fabulously and that is so important... comfy and supportive... The room is very spacious and the bathroom is huge with his/her sinks so no bumping into each other a large tub and separate shower. Bathroom beautifully done in beige/peachy colored marble - nice! That said, I think we paid adt'l $20 for the renovated bathroom :-( Location right on the river, between Michigan and Wabash so shopping and restaurants are nearby... easy to get to, near Lakeshore.. Winning!
