First of all, where's the hummus?! So instead of hummus, they've got this treo of hummus- like cold spread that is surprisingly better tasting than in looks. You'd have to purchase the pita bread separate but one order is enough for two people. The combo platter is great for sharing and it's got a little of everything.  Skip the Spanakotiropita. Way too much spinach-- it's sour and runny.
