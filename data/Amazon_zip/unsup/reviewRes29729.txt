I have to say that I am a patient person! After waiting for 1 1/2 hour to get seated, all I can think was this better be worth it. People would come in and get seated right away, I finally had to go and ask, the hostess stated that people coming in had reservations. I had called and tried making reservations, I was told they didn't take reservations. Which is it? Well we had the appetizer plate and they were delicious. I ordered the Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena, parts of the dish came cold. I am not one to complain, so I sat and ate it. I ended the dinner with a hot chocolate with mezcal, it was delicious. Overall, the place was OK. I was disappointed in the service. If I do go back, I will probably sit at the bar and partake in the appetizers.
