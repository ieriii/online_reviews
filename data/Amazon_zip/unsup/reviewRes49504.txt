After briefly glancing at a few Yelp reviews for this place, I remember thinking it was BYOB so I naturally grabbed a few beers before heading here on a Friday night. Turns out its BYOB only Mon-Thurs and it only applies to wine. Derp. We we're going out afterwards and didn't want to carry a plastic bag of loose beers around with us the whole night so I told the waitress to give them to the kitchen (I hope they like Imperial IPAs).  This turned out to be a blessing in disguise because they had some excellent cocktails that went really well with our meal. I got a Brazilian Caipirinha (made with cachaa sugar cane rum) and the wife had a mojito - both were strong and very refreshing. We followed these up with a muddled blackberry mojito and some sort of pineapple martini - also very good. The menu here is pretty straightforward, you can tell that they highly recommend the steak or combination meat platters because on the menu it says "Most highly recommended" in huge letters over the items... We took their word for it and were not disappointed - the skirt steak was cooked perfectly (medium well worked very well for this type of cut) and the sides - potatoe, plaintaines, and yuca - were delicious. Everything was very simple and not smothered with sauces or spices, but this was my favorite part about it. I'm ranking this up there with Tengo Sur since they're both South American steakhouses, but they are different enough that you will not feel like you're comparing apples to apples between the two.
