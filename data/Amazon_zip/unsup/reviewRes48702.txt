I love, love, love the Publican. From the second I walk in the host/hostesses are extremely friendly. Even when it's wall to wall people they greet you with the biggest, friendliest smile. The stand up bar tables are cozy, you are often rubbing elbows with another couple or group out, but that's all part of the "one big communal family" the Publican has. I'm a big fan of the sour beers (Belgian/Flemish Sour Ales, Lambics, etc) and there are always plenty to choose from along with every other style from light ales to heavy porters. The Publican is certainly known as a Palace to Porcine Pleasures and that is very true (entire volumes could be written on the subject of their pork rinds.) Just don't overlook the daily oysters or the crudo. Both have always been tops. The mussels and sardines have also been amazing! Living in the west loop the Publican is only a short walk from my apartment. After all this writing, I think I may have to stroll on over there tonight!
