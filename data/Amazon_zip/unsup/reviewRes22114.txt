This place hardly needs my review, but here goes. From the bottom of my pure beef heart, I love their graphics and the flirty fiberglass (?) dogs making time above the glowing blue roofline. I love it when our timing is right and we show up at the same hour as the guys with the vintage cars and flame shooters. I like the Superdawg, considering it's a non-Vienna dog, and the super-sloppy Whoopski-dawg (trust me that you're best off asking for the sauce on the side if you're eating in your car) is, in Superdawg World, an ok value because it comes with way more fries than the Superdawg.  But for as many Superdawgs as I've consumed, I'm only giving three stars because they've gotten expensive, and the fries are neither abundant nor great. But will I stop going? Of course not. Three stars still means they're A-OK. And I can't entirely fault a business for charging what they can clearly get away with, especially knowing that they've invested a lot of those profits into seating areas, spiffy carhop awnings and expanding their beefy empire.
