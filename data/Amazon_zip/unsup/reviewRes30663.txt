I highly recommend Nana.  The fiance was incredulous. He, being born and raised Bridgeport, could not believe that such an establishment was open and thriving in the land of his people. (For more on this, see Joshua L's review.) I, however, knew that with 300+ reviews and an average of 4 stars, this place was going to be money. And money it was.  Food was awesome (again, see Joshua L's review) and the service was good.  The waitress made a great recommendation for wine pairing with my crab cakes. It was perfect. The only (small) complaints I have were that there was only 1 bartender, resulting in slow delivery of our drinks, and it was a little too loud, disjointing the ambiance. U2 was a little much. This place would do better with something softer, sans words. At a restaurant, music should add to the atmosphere, not dominate it.  But, again, food was awesome. Go, seriously. Go.
