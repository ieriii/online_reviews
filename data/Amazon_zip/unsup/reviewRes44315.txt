I've been here a few times for dinner, and have never been disappointed. The sushi is fresh, delicious, and beautiful! And if you don't try the ginger martini, you're doing yourself a disservice. The bar side has a really swanky dark sort of feel, with great music. Have a ginger martini while you wait for a table. Seriously.
