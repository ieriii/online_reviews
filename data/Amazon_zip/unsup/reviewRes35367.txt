I have been to Shaw's a few times over the years and recently celebrated my Boy Toys Birthday here. It is his favorite restaurant in Chicago. I had only ever eaten in the casual bar area before, and this time we ate in the dining room. On a Tuesday evening, it was noisy and bustling. Perfect for the occasion! The service was absolutely top notch. We had oysters to start and a bottle of wine. I had the salmon, my date had the crab. I don't remember the dessert, because at that point we were finishing off our second bottle of wine. I do remember that overall, my experience was wonderful! This is a great place to go with out-of-towners or business Associates. It is a great place for a Birthday celebration or to celebrate a promotion.
