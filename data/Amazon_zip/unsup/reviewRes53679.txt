I'm glad this Korean restaurant is in my neighborhood. Great Pi Bim Bap , i mean, Buddha Bowls. Great kimchi. I just wish Crisp had more variety of Korean foods like Kim Bap, Kim Ji Jigae, jap chae, chewy potato pizzas, mandu, Dwang Jung Jigae -- use the stone pots for real authenticity, guys! And I'd give my pinky finger for Naengmyeon! (you can skip the bondeggi, i insist. lol)Trust me, Chicago is ready for originality.Nice, clean place, affordable -- the same prices as in South Korea.Thanks for showing some variety to Americans! XD
