Always a wait but the food is very good. I usually go for brunch on Saturdays and eat in the bar because reservations for tables have to be booked weeks in advance (please don't go for sat brunch, I do not want the wait to get any longer). The servers are all really attentive. They have good coffee, nice atmosphere...
