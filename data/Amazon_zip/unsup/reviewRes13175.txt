Went here last night for the All-You-Can-Eat King Crab and it was okay. Firstly, I had reservations for three at a certain time and we were seated 20 minutes after the reservation. Once seated, it took another 15-20 minutes to get our food. Once we got our food, it took 10 minutes for each crab leg to be brought to our table. They give you 2-3 crab legs in the beginning and then they bring one crab leg at a time after that. I understand why they do one crab leg at a time in general but I'm kind of a pro at eating crab legs and they could tell. I would eat a crab leg in 3-5 minutes. Food was great. Service was good. Hostess/reservations/table seating was under par. Would I come in again? Maybe.
