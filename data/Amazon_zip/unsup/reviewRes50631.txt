Wishbone is my favorite place to take vegetarian & vegan friends. They have a great selection on their menu as well as clearly marking their vegetable dishes if they are non vegetarian right on their menu. It makes things so much easier since you don't have to guess or rely on the server to know. Most of the time I end up eating vegetarian dishes. They do have something for everyone on their menu. I love the crab dishes. Their side dishes are always fabulous! I love the cole slaw and the sauteed spinach. I always try to save room for dessert. Their ever changing dessert menu is ALWAYS good. The quality is always consistent and the service has always been good. It just irks me that they close for a while between lunch and dinner and I can never seem to remember that until after I parked. Also I try not to go midday on weekends when families are there. They seem to have a disproportionate amount of ill behaved parents so that the children run wild or scream.
