A real gem! I've never had a bad meal at Sapori Trattoria. On my most recent visit, I tried the fried calamari, which was some of the best calamari I've ever had. The breading was light and crispy, not too heavy, and there were lots of "tentacles." I'm not sure if that's the correct term, but it's my favorite part of calamari. I've come a long way since my dad and my uncle convinced my sister and I that the calamari at Olive Garden were onion rings.  Anyway . . . my friends and I split two specials, both of which were quite tasty. The menu is varied and the wine list is reasonably priced. Also, you can sign up for their mailing list. You get gift certificates in the mail with little handwritten notes from the chef/owner!
