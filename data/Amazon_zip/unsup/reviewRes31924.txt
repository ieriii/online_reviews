I'm rating the Happy Hour. So essentially this review pertains to the appetizers, signature cocktails, and beer / wine list. Happy Hours are 5 - 7pm and there are half-off appetizers. Seriously, sushi rolls for $4 - 7 and this awesome shrimp / egg sauce appetizer for even less. My memory betrays me. I had the Strawberry Delight, an indulgence on my part and it was STRONG and TASTY. Loved it! My friends had gin martinis, cucumber martinis, mai tai's and all were excellent. I also have to admit I like coming here because of the hope that I'll see a celeb with the owner, Billy Dec. Especially now that Shia and the Transformers crew are here in town ;)
