I will change the review once (if) I go back. I have been to Revolution many times. Good beer, usually good food, but I was extremely disappointed in what used to be my favorite fish and chips in the city. I even nominated them for Chicago's Best. I take that back. I ordered the fish and chips last Thursday. I do know it's deep fried, but I also know that it should not be wet with grease. It was so greasy, not drained on paper towels (or anything) before it was piled on the fries, which made at least half of the fries soaking wet and completely inedible too. The fish was soggy. What a disappointment. Please be prepared for people who order fish and chips to actually know that deep fat fried food should not be completely greasy. On a positlve note, the beer was good, as always, and the wild boar meatballs were enjoyable as well.
