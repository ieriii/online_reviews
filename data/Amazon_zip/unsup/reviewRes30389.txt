I have been trying to get my butt to Chicago Diner for months, when my roomie got me a gift certificate to them for Xmas, so I was treated to a feast!!! A feast!!! It's not very often that I go into a restaurant and know, KNOW, that I can eat damn near anything on the menu. This is fantastic. I went with the Thai Tofu, which was ... good, not great, but good, and stinking huge. I did not expect such a large bowl of peanutty tofu goodness.  But the real delight was dessert. Since I had the gift card I was able to splurge on the Tri-level Cheesecake, and amazing confection (three flavors of cheesecake bliss in one delightful slice) which the waitress recommended. Holy Moses and all the Saints, best cheesecake ever! If only I had known, I would have skipped the entree entirely and had three pieces of cake instead.
