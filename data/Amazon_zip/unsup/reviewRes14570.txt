Okay, I feel so compelled to do an updated review on Sabatino's. One of the finest Italian places in the city. Went there with my wife, a friend from Boston and his son who were passing through Chicago and stayed the night. So we decided on Sabatino's for an earley dinner. We got there around 6 and it was starting to get the evening crowd but by the time we left the place was packed and on a Tuesday night to boot. And . . . our waiter was a hoot. I think his name was Antonio and he surely kept uson out toes and had a great sense of home. Anyone who has ever seen Adam Sandlers Mr. Deeds will remember the butler who would just POP UP with some entertaining comment. That was our waiter! The best part is that Enzo who is one of the owners made sure that we ended up having a 7 course meal and much of it was on the house like the pizza bread, fruit and Baked Alaska which was outstanding. I had the Steak Diane which they cook for you table side which was outstanding. My buddy Sully said that it was one of the best meals he has ever had and his son Danny was totally impressed. Having Frank the Violinist and the guitar player whose name escapes me just topped it off. So what are you waiting for, get on over to Sabatino's!!!
