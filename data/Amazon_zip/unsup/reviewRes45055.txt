I'm usually mum on Italian, but I really loved this place. First of all, we showed up really late - around 9:30 or so, but the (handsome) server was incredibly accomodating and attentive the whole time. We started off with the artichoke caponata and grilled octopus. The caponata was light and slightly sweet. Highly recommend it. And, yes, the octopus is just as good as advertised. They're grilled until they're soft but not chewy in the least; a tasty and light kickoff to your meal. For the entrees, we split the asparagus ravioli, which was delicious. Its lightness belied the buttery sauce on top. And we split the Mediterranean whole fish, which came with crisp fingerling potatoes. Again, (you may sense a theme) light and delicious. We capped the whole thing off with the chocolate tart with vanilla creme. As someone that usually isn't a huge chocolate fan (strange, I know), it was perfect with the flaky crust. So yet another great restaurant in Andersonville I wish I could steal for my 'hood.
