I'll give it to you exactly how is is. The food here is very good, however some dishes have room for improvement. The chimichurri sauce is a sad excuse for it, and must be changed to be more authentic ( I understand chimichurri is Argentinean, but when a Cuban restaurant uses it they should not disgrace it). I haven't found a restaurant that screwed it up like this! Avoid the chicken (its flavorless). Honestly, If you go to this place and pay between 6-10 bucks for chicken, you wasted money. It is nothing like Caf La Guardia's Garlic Chicken. It's a a piece of chicken thown on the grille and that's it! I'd advise trying the lechon, or pork products. The steak is ok, but lacks the right spices that a cuban steak needs. Location looks nice, but I believe it is too cluttered. Owner tries to express to many styles of taste (seems torn between the idea of running a Cuban Cafetera, and trying to be a swanky joint, which it hasn't achieved. It's a casual place) Prices are generally fair I will say it may be one of the only Cuban restaurants in Chicago worthy of representing Cuban food, but there are others that are just as worthy of your patronage. (most Miami restaurants would put this place to shame).
