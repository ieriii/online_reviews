Stop #4 on the tour and the best so far! The variety of dogs and sausages is amazing. And I love that you can choose how you want your dog/sausage cooked. Also, for someone who has vegetarians in her family, this is a great option, cuz they can have the veggie dog! My husband and I each had two dogs, one steamed and one char-grilled. Both were great! And even with that and splitting a large fry, I didn't feel overly full. Fries were great, by the way. Granted I was quite hungry. Also, we sat outside (which was in the cleanest alley I have ever seen...great use of space) and when we ordered large drinks, he charged us fro small drinks since they have free refills and figured we wouldn't want to come back in. So nice! Overall, this place is worth the wait. Because as I have learned over the past few weeks, not all Chicago hot dogs are created equal.
