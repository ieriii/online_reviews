Food: This was my first experience with falafel... and I cannot WAIT for my second. Crispy falafel with creamy sauce and flavorful hummus and just the right amount of heat... this sandwich could do no wrong. My carnivorous companion didn't even complain about the lack of animal flesh. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other offerings.  Atmosphere: When it's not busy, it's a nice place to sit, relax and enjoy the authentic food and niche-decor. When it's busy, it's hard to have a conversation from the people standing in line to order next to your table - you might want to save the conversation about your rash for a more private destination. Although it's not in my neighborhood, I think this will primarily be a take-out place for me. Parking: Street parking was plentiful on North Ave on the Saturday afternoon I was there. Price: These prices absolutely cannot be beat - under four bucks for a falafel sandwich that left me comfortably full! Screw McDonalds - this is a much better bargain! PLEASE NOTE - CASH ONLY. Service: It's best to have an idea of what you want as you're on the spot when it's your turn. There's not a lot of time for "What's xxxxxx?" The preparers know their stuff, though, so as long as you know what you want and whether you want it for here or to-go, you're golden. Oh falafels... so tasty...
