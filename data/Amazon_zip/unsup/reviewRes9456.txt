I am a believer! Best fries I have ever had, an owner who truly cares about his food and his customers....just absolute heaven. When I think of Chicago "institutions" I think of Hot Doug's. Sure it has "exoctic" dogs....but the owner never looses sight of flavors. The menu could be limited to plain pheasant and alligator hot dogs and stay in business, but Doug goes the extra mile and makes combinations of meats, sauces, and spices that actually work with each other. If you're sick of the 34,000 restaurants in this city that remind you of TGI Friday's, Hot Dougs is for you.
