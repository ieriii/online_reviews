Great Chicago hotel on Michigan avenue. We had a really great stay here in a 15th floor corner room overlooking Michigan avenue. The room was really big but I can't recall if we had something up from a standard room. We had 4 windows on Michigan Ave, 1 window facing north and two facing south. The views at night were just amazing and really made for a sublime weekend. The bathroom was quite nice with an oversized bathtub and glass enclosed shower. The bed and pillows were excellent. One of the better beds I've had at a hotel. The hotel bar is really cool and fun. It's open on two sides so it makes you feel in the center of things. It opens and extends into the lobby. There is also a restaurant in the hotel called Eno on Michigan Ave. This is probably the best wine bar I've been to, or at least the one I most enjoyed myself at. It has very subdued lighting and a somewhat dark and rustic decor making it very romantic. They have 700 varieties of wine and killer cheese plates and hand/home made chocolate truffles. Another great thing about this hotel is it's unconventional layout. The first few floors of the hotel are a twisting and winding maze of mixed levels, mysterious statues, large doors to ballrooms, chandeliers, and places to peep out over the lobby. All this and it's actually reasonably priced.
