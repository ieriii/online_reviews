My hubby and I went in on Saturday night to celebrate a late Valentine's Day. We actually got a pretty great table for the 2 of us and our baby daughter in the back corner (we were out of the way). I do think this restaurant's food is more authentic than most of the Chicago Italian scene but it was still just ok. The best thing by far was the vase with honey and ricotta, this really was delicious. We also had the mushroom pizza which was not great, the mushrooms were rather overwhelming and the other flavors didn't really hold up to that. We had the giant rigatoni with sausage which was not at all what I expected and it only had like 1.5 Tbsp of Sausage. Lastly, we had the carrot cake for dessert which again was ok, but not memorable. Our server was ok, she should have perhaps checked in on us a little more but she was adequate. Overall, I don't know if I'll be back, there are so many great places in Chicago to eat.
