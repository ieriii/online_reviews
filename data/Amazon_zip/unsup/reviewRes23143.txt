The food here is phenomenal! I ordered empanadas and their gallo pinto rice. Everything was packed with flavor and cooked so well. The service was great too. My friend had a masquerade themed dinner here and we were allowed to decorate, the waiter took very good care of us. Someone was able to drop off a cake and everything before the event. Our waiter even gave us to go cups for our leftover alcohol, haha. I love that is BYOB. It's tough that it's cash-only, but so worth it. I can't wait to come here in the summer. Definitely coming back to this place, so glad I live nearby!
