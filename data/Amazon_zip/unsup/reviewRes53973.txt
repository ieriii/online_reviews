Go immediately and get the Guajirito: steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on flattened green plaintains (instead of bread). I'm a veg, and they were happy to substitute grilled portobello mushroom for steak, but I've no doubt it's amazing with the steak. The soup was no hot enough, but was very good. Wife had the tofu sandwich, which also had grilled red peppers and black beans, and a cheese empanada, which I tried and was excellent. Very cool space that has been decorated very well. Also recommend the hot sauce. They serve several types of coffee drinks, too, with a cuban twist. Didn't try those today, but will asap. Also great cuban music playing.
