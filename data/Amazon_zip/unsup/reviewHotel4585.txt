the lobby is cute and the rooms are decent size for a boutique hotel, but this is where the compliments stop... drill buzz, drill buzz, drill buzz. scrape, scrape, scrape. hammer, hammer, hammer. this is the noise going on right outside my window as i write this review (literally, *right* outside on scaffolding. the construction worker can probably read this over my shoulder as i type it on my hotel bed). i understand that construction has to happen, but not once was i warned about the loud, dentist-esque noises i would be waking up to during my stay. the service has been completely lackluster. i called to give them a heads up that my airline had messed up my connecting flight to chicago and that i might miss my first night's stay at the hotel, but not to cancel my room. the woman i spoke to a) seemed confused, b) didn't seem to care, c) took 5 mins for me to convince to add a note to my reservation simply stating that i would still be arriving the next day. the room service experience is also a mess. i was really looking forward to a quick bite in my room before i had to leave for work events. i called to order from the menu in my room, but apparently it was out-of-date, so i had to have the room service attendant read me the current menu over the phone. 20 mins later, my meh romaine salad with chicken arrived, sans my iced tea or the bill that i was supposed to sign upon delivery. i asked the delivery guy where they were and he mumbled something, then had to run back down and get them. i ordered an oatmeal for breakfast this a.m. and it tastes like the knife that was used to cut the bananas was also used recently to cut an onion or garlic -- not a taste that i want mixed in with my steal cut oats and brown sugar... i'm sure the hotel felix either was at some point, or is under construction in order to become a great, centrally located boutique hotel, but something's not right right now.
