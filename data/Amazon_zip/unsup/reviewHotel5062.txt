One of Chicago's ritziest hotels; definitely wouldn't mind staying here again. The place has everything you need - bar, restaurant, ect. The room service is excellent. The rooms are immaculate, no bed bugs here. :) The staff is also very professional and polite. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a clean and affordable hotel.
