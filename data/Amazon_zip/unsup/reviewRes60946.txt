Delicious food, great wine, need I say more? Service was good, but a little slow. The highlight was definitely the descriptions that you receive with each glass of wine. Who would have thought that a wine that had notes of gloveleather and wet hay would be yummy?The three dinners we had were all tasty and beautifully presented. The cheese flight was also good, but a little smaller than we were expecting, given the price.
