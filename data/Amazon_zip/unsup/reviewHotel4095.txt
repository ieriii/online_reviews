Absolutely one of the BEST hotels I've ever stayed in!! I won't talk about rates since I obtained my room through Hotwire's "take a gamble and see where you end up" service. (By the way, I HIGHLY recommend that service! I ended up here and OH was it worth it!) After scoring a free upgrade to a junior suite courtesy of who my uncle knows in the hotel, I proceeded to be completely wowed at every turn. First I was put into the newly renovated West Tower. My suite was impeccably clean with a massive comfortable king size bed, a cozy little living room area, and a bathroom with a shower to die for. They even have HD TV's in all the rooms (not just the suite) and iHome's for your iPod!! Let me tell you, when I dropped my bags on the ground and plugged my ipod in.... Let's just say I danced like no one was watching! There was plenty of room to do so!!! As an added bonus, while I was out and about exploring the fine city, someone brought me a complimentary bucket of ice cold beer and a bag of Chicago's best caramel popcorn! Complete with a hand written note welcoming me to the city!! WIN!! The guest service from check-in to concierge to check-out was incredible. Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The gym was just perfect. It had everything I possibly could ask for (except a pool...). To top it off, I had just run 5 miles along Lake Michigan and ended it at the gym with some weights. I discovered their little wine cooler device with moist eucalyptus infused towels, which did wonders to cooling me down! I will say though that it was annoying not having a restroom within the gym. You had to go back to the lobby to use that. To top it all off, this hotel is so massive they have kiosks set up so you can punch in your destination and it will give you a print out map of how to get there! Wow!!
