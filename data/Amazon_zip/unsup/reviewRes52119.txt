Pizza taste is very subjective. I get it. Gino's thin crust spinach pie is my 2nd favorite pizza ever. Well, maybe 3rd or 4th. Okay, it goes like this... 1.) Anna Maria's-Brooklyn, NY 2.) Ben's Pizza- NY 3.) Famous Rays (THE REAL ONE on 6th ave. and 11th st.) NYC 4.) Gino's East My brother got deep dish and he prefers Giordano's. I found Giordano's to be quite bland. Our waitress, Angela was top notch!
