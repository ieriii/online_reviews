I have never eaten inside the restaurant, but I get take out from here about once a week. Here are the basic all you need to know points: The Lamb Shank (and dill rice) is the best thing you will ever eat in your LIFE The owners are very sweet, personable men (father & son) It's in a great location with plenty of parking, and right next to the Kedzie brown line stop They are a little bit overpriced, and have just raised their prices again (I'm assuming due to the amazing renovations taking place). Lamb shank was $11.95 before, and last time I ordered, it came to about $15. I won''t stop going there though. I'm too addicted. UPDATE: Went in to eat yesterday. WHAT an experience. Had the hummus, and soup, and had 2 apps comped for no reason (maybe cause I was there w/ my sis, and our waiter was a guy?? dunno). Had the Lamb Shank(10.95) and the Beef choice Rib eye Kabob Lunch special(6.95). We also had a 2 pomegranate Martinis ($7.95, and WELL worth it!), and a glass of Pino Grigio (5.95) Our experience was long, and enjoyable, and with a $12 tip came to about $60. I'm very please now!
