I used to live near Cafe Icosium and would think about eating there as I passed by everyday. Finally my father in law came to visit and we wanted to go somewhere close to our apartment. What a perfect opportunity to try Icosium Cafe...I was very excited. This place was very cute inside and welcoming. Our server was very nice although she did not offer a refill for our coffees. We had to "hunt down" a busser. That was not a big deal for us at all. Our food looked pretty good...until I took my first bite. My food was warm, not hot, and bland. So much spinach inside...I could not taste anything else. I felt like I was eating cooked spinach without salt. I was disappointed.  My husband loved the sausage in his crepe though. Maybe their sweet crepes are better, and looking at the photos here they look really good, but I am from Europe and crepes for desert are very common. I was 13 y.o. when I started making them, and I host crepe parties at my house every year with my friends. I think my score is primarily based on the fact that I grew up with crepes and still make them at home. I just don't think what Icosium Cafe makes is worth the price.
