Chicago Diner is definitely a veggie Chicago landmark. That said I think it is a bit pricey for what they serve. You can make or find pretty much anything on the menu for elsewhere for cheaper. (Shouts to Earwax's Reuben) I dig the Diner and will eat there if I'm in the area, but it's no longer a place I would seek out to eat at.
