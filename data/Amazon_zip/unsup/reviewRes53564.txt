This place is great for encased meats/sausages/whatever.. The line's a little bit ridiculous and I won't go as far as to say that this place is overrated, but waiting an hour for sausage and luke-warm fries didn't exactly live up to my expectations when standing outside for an hour on my bday. I'd still go back, no doubt about it, I'm just saying, the line's a bit much..
