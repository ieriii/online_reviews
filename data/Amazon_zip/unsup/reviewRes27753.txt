I was on my way to another restaurant in the area when I thought to ask a person that resides in the neighborhood where I could find the best Mexican food. My date and I made our way to Nuevo Leon and it is definitely a no frills neighborhood spot but oh so DELISH! I had chicken enchiladas and my date had steak fajitas.....very tasty! I am happy that I had cash on me considering I don't usually carry cash because they don't accept credit. It is great to know they are BYOB however I wasn't prepared at the time and wanted a margarita. Oh well, that is a small negative for such a great unexpected treat!
