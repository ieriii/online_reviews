I have no idea why anyone would eat this pizza more than once. Being a new visitor to Chicago, I knew I HAD to try the deep dish pizza, even though I prefer thin crust. We went to Giordano's more out of convenience than recommendation. Even at 2:30 on a Saturday, we had to wait 15 min for a table, but they let you put in the order for your pizza while you're waiting since it takes about 40m per pie.  After being seated, the waitress (who was less than enthusiastic) took our order for appetizers and drinks. The water came and shortly after, the appetizers, but our wine/beer never did. Apparently (we found out 20 minutes later as our pizza came out), she went on a break and forgot. Nice. I guess that's why she's still a waitress at a pizza joint. Now all of this would be tolerable if the pizza was awesome, but it just wasn't. It was thick and meaty and cheesy (VERY cheesy) but it just wasn't TASTY. The crust was nothing special and the whole thing quite frankly, was BLAND. In addition, it arrived lukewarm, which was weird because steam was coming off the top, but the inside wasn't pipping hot. The table next to us actually told the waitress their pizza was "cold" and she explained that's how it is supposed to be. Go figure. I can't recommend another place since I only went here, but at least I can NOT recommend here.
