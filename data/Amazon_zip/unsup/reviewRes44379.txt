I needed to buy a box of cookies to give to my landlord for making a complete ass out of myself (Shocker!) whilst being wasted the night before. I got locked out and had to wake them up at 5 am to let me into my house. Or so I deduced the next morning since I don't actually remember it. So the cookies had to be pretty damn good. And they were. I also got a mocha to get rid of that strange throbbing pain in my head (wonder what that was about?!) and don't tell anyone but I sneaked in a couple of cookies from the box. I really liked the ginger one. And no, that's not the cute redhead sitting across from me in the lounge. But I really liked her too.
