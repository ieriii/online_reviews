Basically, the Bongo Room does a good job at that which they set out to do, which seems to me to be disguising cakes as pancakes and hiding eggs under hollandaise sauce. I've had Blueberry Cheesecake Pancakes, that, with the help of graham cracker crumbs and cream cheese sauce, and pancake batter that tasted a little more like cake than pancake, seriously tasted like blueberry cheesecake. Banana Creme Brulee French Toast that was banana-y and caramel-y and sugary and delicious. Lemon hotcakes with divine gingersnap butter. It is seriously an overload, but expect it, order a bunch of stuff and share it with everyone at the table, and include a breakfast burrito to help balance everything out. Like every brunch spot in Chicago, there's no place to wait for your table. In the summer, the location is perfect, because you can go shopping while you wait, but in the winter, you have to crowd around the bar and make the whole world feel uncomfortable. On the flip side, they're awfully rude about trying to clear you out when you're done eating, so don't expect that last refill on coffee.
