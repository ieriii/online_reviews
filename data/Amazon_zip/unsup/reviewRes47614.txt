I have only ever been there for dinner. 3 times so far and can't wait for the next time! My last visit recently I experienced an extremely high level of cusotmer service by the staff as well as amazingly delicious food. Love the charcuterie table to start ! We had prompt service with various meats once we turned our stones over. We casually mentioned we'd prefer a certain meat more well done and within minutes they arranged for a plate of a variety of meats all cooked medium0-well specifrically for our table. All of the meat servers were friendly and helpful getting the meats onto our table. I usually avoid bread when dining out but the cheddar biscuits with tangerine butter were SO good I have two of them. I also likethe atmosphere inside the restaurant. Before dinner we had drinks on the roof and not only had excellent drinks but top notch service there as well. I can't wait for my 4th visit back to Zed451.
