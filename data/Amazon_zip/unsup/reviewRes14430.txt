Must have been there on an off day. My fish which was described as being moist and served with a house pineapple sauce was really rather dry. And the chowder - it was good, but coming from Boston I really know New England Clam Chowder. Glenn's had plenty of clams, don't get me wrong. But very busy with other flavors and veggies. Good, but not a "New England" chowder. Then there's the credit card story. They only take MC & Visa - so no amex miles or discover cash back. And, you may get the story of how the wait staff have to pay the credit card processing fee out of their tips; the diner doesn't pay that fee itself. Don't know if that's true or a try at getting you to tip more. I've never heard of that before, but if it is true, then shame on Glenn! Oh - Wheelchair Accessible? Well, sort of. Everything is on street level, but it is so cramped that it would be very difficult to seat a person with needs, and I don't know how they could ever navigate to the facilites if needed.
