I've been going here for years now and just can't say enough about the place but I'll boil it down for you.  First, Frozen Mango Margarita... the best I've ever had. The are perfectly tasty and potent as well!! You should have one right now... seriously. As for food, my staple is the fish tacos, but the steak tacos and suiza chimichanga is quite good. On top of it all the staff is great and always remembers us and our friends. Go... you won't be disappointed
