I've been wanting to try this place for awhile but avoided it because it was an unknown. I mean, really, crepes? Now, I mean REALLY, CREPES! The atmosphere feels like I imagine a small cafe in Algeria would. It's demure and quiet and exotic in a subtle way. Ok.. but crepes... Algeria... I don't get it. Well, Algeria was ruled by France for many years. It's still their second language and it's influence is seen in their music and food.... hence... crepes. Their crepes are light, fluffy and delicately brown. Not sweet, not savory... perfect. The filling combinations are endless. If you don't like your filling it's completely your fault because they let you change anything and encourage you to design your own. One savory, especially anything with vegetables, is filling. If you're starving get a sweet one too and you'll be full. Great alternative to Starbucks with the Turkish coffee and sweet crepes. Gotta love non-bitter coffee that needs a fork! Try it! There is nothing here you haven't had (or at least been offered) before. No monkey brains or cat tongue. It's the combinations and their flair for presentation and service that makes them different. This is now one of my favorite places for a quick brunch or lunch. Read up on Algeria http://en.wikipedia.org/ and then head out for a relaxing, fun and unique meal.
