This place is a great bizarro world.  They seem to serve a great breakfast and brunch and really focus on homey diner food.  On the other hand they serve the quality and preparation of fish and seafood that you would find in a swanky place.  We had the catfish, clam chowder, potato pancake and salads.  All were really good and incredibly reasonable.  I loved the cereal bar but even with the 25 cereals they had, I would have liked some wow.....Boo Berry, Quisp, Count Chocula, something different.  These were all very run of the mill and at 4.50 a bowl....hmmmm, I will stay home for cereal but I will be back for the fish
