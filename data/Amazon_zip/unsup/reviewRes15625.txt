After walking aimlessly up and down Andersonville not sure about where to go or what to eat, we settled on Calo's for lunch. Looking forward to the table bread we're been served at dinner before which usually arrives exquisitely baked with flavors, we were a little disappointed to be served slices of regular white Italian bread. As an opener I ordered traditional bruschetta followed by a Mediterranean salad with feta cheese for an entre. Le bf went with the incredibly priced lunch special they were offering for $13 of a full rack of baby back ribs, baked potato, and soup.  The bruschetta was delicious served on perfectly toasted pieces of Italian bread and the Mediterranean salad with feta cheese was so fresh, they must have hand picked all the ingredients from their garden out back! As for the baby back ribs, potato, and soup, the bf was too busy licking the bbq sauce from his fingers to take the time out to give his opinion, but by the looks of his well-cleaned plate, I'd say he was a happy camper.
