Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a bad review. I just have extremely picky standards when it comes to pizza. We ordered delivery from Lavilla's the other night and the overall experience was great. The delivery was fast and the pizza piping hot when we ripped open the bag it came in. The three star rating is only there because I have a favorite pizza in the city that I hold all others too. Lavilla pizza, while very good, didn't reach my personal level of perfection. I like a very think crust. Lavilla's was a tad on the thick side for me. I like super crispy crust, Lavilla's crust was crispy only around the outside. I like a thinner layer of cheese and sauce, Lavilla's was a hearty layer. For the price and quality I do recommend this pizza. Once I try out some of the other menu items I will re-rate this place. Don't let three stars fool you, Lavilla was a very good pizza with great service. I'm just a picky-sumabtch.
