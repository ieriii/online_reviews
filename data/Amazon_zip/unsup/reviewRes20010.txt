A place situated close to the river and right across from the park. The Gage is a hip, cool place with a nice ambiance and chic decor. The maitre d's were pretty good looking which is always nice. The bar was bustling and the restaurant was relatively full. The menu is divided into four courses with the first course being more a snack that people share. The fourth course is the entree and the second and third are appetizers. I ordered the Three River Greens salad which had too much dressing. It was like eating dressing instead of eating a salad. For entree, I ordered the Gage burger which is bigger than the regular burger. The bun was nice and soft and the meat was relatively large however because they used a specific cheese which was like brie (don't think it was) that over powered the flavor of the burger. The fries were crunchy but average. The service was good from the bus boys and the manager yet the waiter was not so great. He was kind enough to tell me about the menu yet didn't tell me about any of the specials. He never came by and asked if I needed more water, how my food was, and etc. Maybe it was because I ate by myself, maybe I didn't order the pricey dishes, but the manager or who seemed to be the manager did come over and check up on me. All in all, I would give the place another try because there were other items on the menu that were enticing and from hearing other diners talk, they were happy with what they chose.
