In the past 5 years, I have attended Kinzie Chophouse for a wide variety of reasons and celebrations, including a business lunch with a client, after work happy hour with friends and even celebrating my 30th birthday with all of my out-of-town family members. The main ingredient that each and every visit to Kinzie Chophouse consistently incorporates is a supreme dining experience through quality food and exceptional service. From the minute the Kinzie guest is seated at a table to the moment of exit, the service is impeccable. My absolute favorite menu option is the calamari. My fiancee and I order fried calamari every time we see it on a menu, and we both agree that Kinzie Chophouse offers the finest calamari in the city. Kinzie's recipe incorporates a perfect balance with a hearty portion and a light coating, paired with your choice of equally delicious sauces. The herbed baked goat cheese salad with chicken is a wonderful lunch option (one will long for the goat cheese medallions for the remainder of the afternoon). However, Kinzie is not just a lunch and dinner destination hot spot. Happy Hour specials offer unbelievable deals including caprese bites and to-die-for mac and cheese! Every time I request to see a wine list, I am pleasantly surprised to see different options on the menu. If I am unsure as to what I am in the mood for, the servers and bartenders consistently steer me in the right direction. Finally, as a chophouse, Kinzie does not disappoint. My personal recommendation is the 16 oz. bone-In filet, oscar style with drawn butter. Amazing! One of the most important qualities in a restaurant is consistency. I know that each and every time I enter the door at Kinzie Chophouse, regardless of the occasion, I am going receive an exceptional meal paired with with first-class service. Keep up the good work!
