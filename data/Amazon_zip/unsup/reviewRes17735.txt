I was taken here by friends when visiting Chicago, otherwise I would never have found this place, which has an unmarked door that I almost walked past. We got here early and still had to wait around 15 minutes, but they take your phone number so you can wonder around if you want. The drinks were all fantastic and creative, and the decor was magical feeling. Will be back next time I'm in Chicago!
