Superdawg...what an amazing piece of Americana. I first heard about Superdawg from watching The Food Network. The boyfriend was skeptical of my request to drive all the way out to just get a hot dog but he obliged and I was in polish, kitsch, drive-in heaven.I'm not a Chicago-style hot dog fan so I get the polish whoopski (sp) dog every time. I also like the fried onions and the chocolate malt. The polish comes on an onion bun and I recommend just grilled onions and mustard. The dog is charred, fat, and oh so tasty.I didn't go for the full five stars because it's not THE BEST hot dog ever but it's definitely up there, up there.
