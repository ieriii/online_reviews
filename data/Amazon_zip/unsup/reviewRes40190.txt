overall the best korean bbq i have had in my life so far. amazing banchan. crazy good portions. i have heard of others complaining about the servers being rude but I have never experienced this. in fact, its always been the opposite. this may be a bit more expensive than other korean restaurants, but its totally worth it. also: this place is 24 hours which is totally insane.
