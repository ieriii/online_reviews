One of the best meals of my life. Everything is made with the kind of love of cooking you read about in cookbooks. At Schwa, you feel it in the food, in the way they talk to you about each dish, in the way they even comment on your wine and beer choices.  These are the coolest dudes making food in Chicago right now, and they're also extremely nice. They went above and beyond expectations in making up for two reservations they had to cancel. Everyone should go to this restaurant. Everyone. Vegetarian, carnivore, and so on.
