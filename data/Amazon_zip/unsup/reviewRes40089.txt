This is some good ass Korean food... and to be honest.. their sushi is some of the best in the city. If you plan on dining in at this place...prepare yourself for the probability of smelling like Korean BBQ for the rest of the night....not a bad thing... I had a pack of wild dogs chasing me down the street afterwords..
