My friends and I love this place! It is relatively cheap (around 6 dollars for a baby buddha bowl which is korean style bibimbap- assortment of prepared veggies over rice with a fried egg and gochujang- spicy red pepper sauce.) I usually add beef (marinated korean style chopped up bulgogi flavored) which is $1 and exchange for a healthier brown rice ($1.50 additional). The portions are huge for the buddha bowls. I'm Korean and lived in LA for a few years, but this place is really good and fresh even though it's not traditional! I love bibimbap and all my non-Korean friends love this place too. The seoul sassy wings are excellent too. Very Crisp-y. They also have the delicious korean drinks that I grew up with like the green grape drink or the asian pear drink. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love bibimbap! (It's a very Vegetarian friendly dish.) This place is good for groups since they are huge tables even though it is kinda small inside. Definitely a fun, fresh place to try :)
