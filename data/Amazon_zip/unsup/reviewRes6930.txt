Had their specialty dish, the thing mentioned over and over in reviews, the Lobster Ravioli. Think the name is a little fancier than that, but that's what it is. A bright orange sauce and homemade ravioli, stuffed with a lobster puree or some such thing. Quite tasty, but not super lobster-y. Could've used a bit more lobster in the filling, instead of whatever the filler material was. My wife had the same thing, and she wasn't too crazy about it. Still, that said, I enjoyed its freshness and homemade-ness. Also had the Crostini di Avocado. Basically Italian guacamole on toast. Doesn't sound too special, but its very tasty. If you like avocados (my wife doesn't - I ordered it just to spite her!) this is a wise choice Additionally, props to them for seating us Friday night with no reservation. Perhaps it was just our lucky night. We rolled in there when we couldn't find parking near the Duke of Perth. Bit pricier at Sapori; I might rate them higher if they cut the prices a bit. Anyways, 4 stars, well-earned, even if I'm bringing their average DOWN with a positive review.
