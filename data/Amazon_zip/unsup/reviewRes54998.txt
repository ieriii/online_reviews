Outstanding !! Fine dining in a casual setting . My husband and I went to a underground dining night which is by invitation only and we were blown away . The Chef greeted us at the door and we were seated right away . The server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the food and the wine we brought in with us . They are BYOB and will kindly pair your wine with your courses as they come out . You can find the nights menu online so you can choose your wine accordingly. We had a five course meal that was truly spectacular from start to finish . The restaurant is very small but very cozy and relaxing . They do need a credit card to hold your reservation which is understandable since seating is limited . Bonsoiree is a wonderful and welcomed addition to the neighborhood. We will certainly be back .
