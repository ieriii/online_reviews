Tru ranks as my #1 meal ever eaten at a restaurant. No joke. I had a friend coming in from out of town and we both agreed to splurge on at least one dinner. She wanted something French and my boss the foodie recommended Tru. I loved the fact that they asked from the very beginning if there were food allergies. My friend has several allergies, one so severe that simply preparing other food with her allergic food could be bad. From the time we sat down at the table they offered a small palate cleanser and the dinner took off from there. Almost every portion of our meal had my friend commenting that it reminded her of her mother. When you think your mom is the best cook in the world and a restaurant meets and/or exceeds that standard, it can only mean something good. I tried their foie gras as I had never tasted it before. While I thought the chef did a great job preparing it, I discovered that I just wasn't a fan of organ meats. I loved that you are offered a palate cleanser between every portion of the meal. At one point none of the dessert options sounded adventurous enough and the waiter offered me something that wasn't on the menu. It was some type of mint sorbet with these DELICIOUS melted white chocolate crumbles. The sorbet was so crisp and fresh that I would have licked the bowl if society permitted me to do so. The next step was for them to bring around the dessert cart with homemade treats. I love the fact that they allow you to try as many of them as your little heart desires. Don't get me wrong, Tru is definitely an expensive meal but I personally left feeling as though I had spent my money well. Not only was the food good, it was also a wonderful dining experience. It was a loooong dining experience that clocked in at three hours, but it was worth it in the end.
