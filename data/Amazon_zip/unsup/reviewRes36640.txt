I'd like to give this place a 2nd chance to wow me because I wasn't super impressed today, but I've heard great reviews. They offered quite an extensive menu, so maybe I went wrong with the skillet I ordered. I did enjoy the quality of the food though. Our server was just ok, as it was obvious she just wanted to turn tables.
