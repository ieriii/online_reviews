How do YOU spell overrated? I knew things would get rough when I walked in the front room of this place and the oracle/divine shaman inside my head intoned, "This place is too crowded and IT STANK!"  We headed into the back room in which we found relief from both of the prior conditions, but we then ordered all kinds of BLAND, TASTELESS, IMPROPERLY SEASONED FOOD. The mussels (their specialty) were so devoid of flavor that I just didn't eat them - and I was starving - and I'm a greedy motherforya even when I'm not hungry so you know this stuff was plain! The fries were little crinkly tasteless things, the onion rings were slightly more flavorful, the battered squash blossoms were fairly tasty but, really, were nothing more than glorified pieces of crab rangoon, and the beans with pancetta just formed a plate of oversalted nastiness. And the beer? I felt like being a girlyman so I tried the "Bier du Miele" and it turned out to be "Bier du Merde". Didn't think I knew French, didja?
