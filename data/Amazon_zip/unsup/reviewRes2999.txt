After much anticipation after reading countless reviews and hearing all of the accolades we finally made it to Tru. What a disappointment. We both did the 9 course tasting menu. The lobster dish was chewy (a very rookie move) and the sauce was salty and fishy, it was inedible. The beef reduction sauce was great on the first bite but it also was too salty and too rich to eat. Several of the other dishes were ho-hum and nothing stellar. The best course was the fake "caviar" pearls. Besides the food being average the atmosphere was stuffy and the room was freezing the entire night. Overall I would NOT recommend this restaurant, especially at the price. When I complained about the food the reply was "come back and we will give you a bottle of champagne". NOT LIKELY I would spend another 600$ on a meal that was worth 200! FWIW: L20 was a much better dining experience. Don't waste your money on Tru.
