I have to admit that I was totally disappointed. Maybe I expected too much.  Our appetizer seemed to have too much topping and not enough seafood, the salad wasn't great, and my scallops were sitting in an inch of lemon/butter sauce that was just a little too much. I do have to say their mashed potatoes are AMAZING!!! Other than that--average.
