I do not drink beer so this is review is based on the food alone.  I've eaten here many times.... I live in the area and really never think about eating here as the wait can be over 3 hours at times to get a seat in the dining area. The food is not worth a 3 hour wait.... not even an hour wait. However, the mussels are really amazing as are the frites. I had a steak here last week that I asked to have served medium rare... it was med well to well done.... not so good. I've had the brisket on another visit and its not very good.... almost horrible. Stick with the mussels and frites and you will have a great meal. Service is ok.... the waitress had no clue about any of the wines on the menu. Again, stick with the mussels and all will be well.
