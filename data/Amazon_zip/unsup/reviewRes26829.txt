The food was great!! You can tell when a place has good food. You will see people from all walks of life enjoying it! They served an appetizer item and then the food. I gulped it all down. I wanted to eat more, but there was no place to put it. I will go back over and over again. Makes me wish I was born Mexican. Bueno!!
