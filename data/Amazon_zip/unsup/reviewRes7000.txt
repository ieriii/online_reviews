The emphasis that I want to make here is that, at Sapori I had experienced really good food, and good hospitality. I came with a large party of 10 and we had a reservation. The smorgasbord of food brought out was amazing and delicious. My friends and I could not stop raving about the butternut squash and pumpkin ravioli FOR WEEKS... Actually my mouth still waters when I think about it today Other things on our table.. the linguini with clams, the spaghetti with veal meatballs (oh yum), calamari, soup, and a sampler of their desserts (panna cotta, bread pudding, tiramisu) The price is really affordable for some really good food. I was especially wowed that the owner and staff are really friendly and didn't try to rush us or anything. Too bad I don't live in the neighborhood, I hear that they sometimes mail out promotions and specials.
