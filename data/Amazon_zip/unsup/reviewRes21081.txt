Its good but I don't understand the pricing!! I had a great evening here. I really did. Cozy little place, nice atmosphere. I was asking my friend if we should get a pitcher of their house margarita... and was totally stunned to hear that its $39 (5 glasses) for their cheapest option for a large pitcher while its $23 for a small one (3 glasses). Then I actually started to look at the menu and everything seemed so over-priced. Unhindered, we ordered a combo of enchilada, chile relleno n taco; Veggie enchilada and 4 tacos. The food was delicious, don't get me wrong but I just don't get the pricing.
