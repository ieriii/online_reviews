Since its opening, we have eaten at Sprout often and have been loyal supporters as we live in the neighborhood and have always enjoyed the food. We just had an experience that will cause us never to go back. Having made New Year's Eve reservations in October, we got a call today (a week before New Year's Eve) asking if either of us had any dietary restrictions. My wife said she was a vegetarian and would simply need fish or vegetables substituted for the meat entree. She was told "too bad", that is not possible, and that we should find another place for New Year's Eve if she couldn't deal with eating meat. We have never been to an "upscale" restaurant that couldn't accommodate a simple desire to substitute something for the meat entree. Also, why waste the time even calling people in advance if the answer is just going to be "no", we don't accommodate anything.  Now, we will have to hope we can find another place for New Year's Eve at this late date. Perhaps another restaurant will be able to accept a substitution request in return for the $400 Sprout was charging the two of us for dinner. As I said, we have always enjoyed the food at Sprout but this attitude is simply unacceptable. Perhaps this explains why the restaurants Chef Levitski has been associated with, despite great cooking, always seem to fail. It is apparent that he cares very little about his customers, but quite a lot about himself. I would strongly consider whether the quality of the food outweighs the haughtiness of the chef and the attitude of the restaurant. We will not be back.
