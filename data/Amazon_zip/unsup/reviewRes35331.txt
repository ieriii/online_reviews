Man, for 50 bucks and what you call it a seasonal crab combination for two , u only get four crab legs and one crab cakes. WTF? Was it happy meal at Shaw's Crabhouse? I would pay good money for small quantity good food, this, was a big rip-off. We also got the oysters. Overall, the seafood was pretty fresh, but definitely not the best crab that I 've tried. The French white wine that we got was pretty good, forgot the name though.   Anyway, for my second dining experience in Chicago, this was totally overrated.
