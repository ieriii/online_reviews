I became acquainted with Xoco during breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning in October. I felt a spark. I knew this was something special. Now that I am back in Boston, I can't stop thinking about Xoco. My waking thoughts are consumed by the memories of the deliciously crispy, sugary, heavenly churros. My dreams are haunted by ghost of the gloriously rich almendrado hot chocolate. The empanadas, the fresh yogurt with it's crackly mantel of granola, the fluffy cherry-lime scone. And oh lord, the enchantingly sweet dulce de leche!  I don't normally do long distance relationships, but I just may have to make an exception for Xoco. I'm in love.
