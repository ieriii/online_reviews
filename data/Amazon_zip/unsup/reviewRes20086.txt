Solid place to eat sushi in the city, went with my brother and his wife for a belated birthday dinner. Was a little disappointed by the white dragon roll, didn't seem worth the money for 4 pieces of mediocre sushi. However, the fresh philly, california, crunchy spicy tuna, and salmon/jalapeno rolls were all delicious. The highlight is the lack of fee for BYOB, which isn't always the case. Who doesn't like to get drunk and eat sushi while wondering why I only saw a single Asian employee? She must have been ronery and sadry arone! Recommend for a try.
