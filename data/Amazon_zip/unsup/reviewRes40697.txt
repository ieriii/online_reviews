Breakfast here was awesome - the only bad part was deciding which item to get as everything looked amazing. I think I was there for their first ever breakfast service. I got biscuits + gravy w/1 hour eggs. 1 hour eggs are magical...just when you thought there wasn't anything new to do to an egg, voila! It's like the best elements of custard + poached egg + soft boiled egg. I'll be back next weekend for sure.
