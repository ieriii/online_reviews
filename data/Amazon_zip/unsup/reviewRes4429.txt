One day, when I stop feeling pissed at the a-hole door guy, I'll give it another chance. It's in my neighborhood and a legend, and I sure would like to experience it. But being barked at as soon as we walked in the door ($20! Ids! Get out of the way! $20! Ids!) made us walk right back out. Since we were pulling out our wallets to provide both cover and ids, we didn't feel like the repeated barking orders for cash and ids was necessary, since there was no line. The door guy looks like a lifer, unfortunately. Maybe we should try a week night.
