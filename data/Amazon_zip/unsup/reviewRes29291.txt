I have loved the Pasta Bowl since I came here on my first trip to Chicago years ago. The food is fresh, tasty, and you can even watch them make it if you so choose. I am a big fan of the rigatoni bolognese, but have tried other things as well and enjoyed them all. The portions are huge, but that just means I have lunch for the next day. And, the prices can't be beat.
