Party in my mouth. After reading the reviews, I couldn't leave Chicago without checking this place out. We were graciously met by the hostess who offered us seats at the bar while we waited for our table. We ordered a glass of wine from the awesome wine list. After peeking at the menu, we couldn't wait any longer and decided to eat the bar. The servers were great and quickly answered all of our questions. I was surprised to see extensive number of vegetarian options offered on the menu. We first started off with the bruschetta. It was a unique dish topped with butternut squash, seasoned with capers olives and onions. Delicious. The second dish was the cauliflower steak with garbanzo beans on bed of olive tapenade. Amazing. The dish was perfectly seasoned, light yet bursting with flavors. I didn't think it could get better than this. Oh, but it did. The third dish was the Pizza della Terra mushrooms, leeks, taleggio, and truffle oil. Amazing. I couldn't ask for a better meal. And I was pleasantly surprised by the total on the bill. If I could, I would eat here every day. WOULD RETURN IN A HEART BEAT.
