This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago for dinner. Of the numerous times I've been here each one was a 5 star experience, however once was a 4 star. First I really appreciate a knowledgeable and attentive staff. I find this elevates the experience no matter where you are. The servers here are very good without being pretentious (that would be a deal breaker), they know their stuff. Whether it be from the impressive beer list or from the great fare. Now I don't just mean they know what it is, but how it's prepared, where it comes from, the pig's name (OK maybe not the pig's name.) Food aside, this is one of the things I really appreciate about the Publican. The food is of course great too, the menu is pork centered with some seafood splashed in. Lots of in-house produced items, haven't had a chance to hit the new butcher shop over there.  I've always had fantastic, well prepared food here, again with the exception of that one 4 star experience. That particular time the food was not as consistently up to Publican par as it had been prior to and since. I'm going with this as an off-day. Typically the food is fantastic. One review I read complained of too much salt, I haven't found this to be the norm there, even when eating pork, et al where you can start to get too salty quickly. Bring a big group (or small and hungry,) and order lots of plates to share. This is probably the best way to experience what the Publican has to offer. Be a bit of a glutton.  I'd definitely recommend the Publican and will be going there for my last restaurant meal in Chicago before I move. Also if you go during peak days/times, I'd recommend a reservation as the place gets packed.
