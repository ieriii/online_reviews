I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, because although it's my fav northside restaurant (more choices than any restaurant anywhere), I like Soul Veg's food more.  Anyway I've had a few of their cooked meals (gyros stands out as my favorite) and all of them I've enjoyed, though the meals are sometimes a little bland (loved their green goddess dressing, however). Their brownies are awesome and taste just like non-vegan ones, I promise you! The cheesecake is not exactly like the non-vegan version but still good and close enough. However, they seem to have a thing for flavoring their desserts with maple syrup (I guess instead of sugar?). It was fine in the cheesecake but I wasn't crazy about it with the cake. I don't eat yellow cake expecting to taste maple. Their carrot cake isn't as sweet as I like either, but it eventually grew on me. Again, it's good enough for a Vegan but might be bland to someone who grew up on high fructose corn syrup delights (like me, actually). After I had Soul Veg's caramel cake, Chicago Diner can't really compete. So I guess, for me, Chicago Diner is best for desserts because, as a Vegan, dessert is usually the most difficult course for me to get at a restaurant.  Just pass on the cake, unless you can't get to the southside to Soul Veg, in which case, ok get the cake.
