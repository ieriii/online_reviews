San Soo Gab San has come a long way in the years it's been around. I live down the street, and as a result cannot award this place more than 3 stars simply for the parking headache all you raving yelpers have caused me... However, the food is pretty spectacular, and unlike when they first opened, the service is not too bad. I used to be afraid to come in here unless one of my Korean friends was in tow. I know that sounds bad, but back in the day, we used to honestly make a game out of rating the service in here with versus without a korean in the dinner party. The results were needless to say, a little lopsided. I guess they eventually realized what business the yuppie invasion could bring them and started being nice to everyone.I would certainly recommend them for Korean BBQ, and chances re, if you do not live on my block, your rating will probably be more in the 4 to 5 star range... just don't go and park like an asshole!
