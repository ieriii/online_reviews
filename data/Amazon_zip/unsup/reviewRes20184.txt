I was craving sushi after all the Italian beef sandwiches I've been having. Since Coast Sushi is the most reviewed, I figured it must be decent. The sushi was very good indeed. What sucked was the party of three sitting beside me. Bring your ear plugs folks, because otherwise you will have to listen to some pretty superficial people having superficial conversations. Chicago's Valley Girls dine here.
