Piece is one of many good pizza places in this city, however it is one of the few who don't specialize in either the classic Chicago deep dish of thin crust pizza. Piece does its own thing and put out New Haven Style Thin Crust Pizza. The pizza is cooked in rectangular pan and is very thin and loaded with different cheeses and toppings. The result is not as tasty as true Chicago thin crust of the classic deep dish, however, Piece gets the job done. What really helps to separate Piece from other pizza joint are its great micro brews. I don't remember which ones I've tasted but the servers and bartenders were always helpful when choosing which micro brew to try.
