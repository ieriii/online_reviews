They are definitely an A+ on creativity and their execution is really good ( although the famed foie gras dog was not that great) However, there are hardly any instances where I can think of, that the wait would be worth it. There is no dog worth an hour wait. Plus the duck fat fries are just really good. Frying them in duck fat does make them THAT much better.
