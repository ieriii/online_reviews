I ordered for delivery the other night. The gal who answered the phone was not only patient, and friendly (first time ordering, asked several questions) she was also very cheerful and I could tell it was authentic, not cause it was her job. The delivery guy was prompt, and also very courteous. Pizza was EXCELLENT, exactly as I ordered, and HOT, which is unusual most times for delivery. I will order again.
