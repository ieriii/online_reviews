Good korean BBQ that you can cook at your own table. This place is open till 5am and has a parking lot !! cool. They also come out with about 20 plates for each diner to eat with the protein you cook on your grill. Its not cheap, but not expensive... Its so worth the experience... Just be prepared to walk out smelling like you work in a kitchen and the waitresses dont smile too much--- doesnt matter to me though. Its clean and fast service i enjoy..... good to go with 2 -4 people...anymore can be crowded and annoying.
