LOVE. First, the decor is so bright and colorful it definitely sets the mood for the place. Second, everything else is amazing, so you need to go here. I had sangria that night, which was great, and my friends tried their mojitos which they loved as well. We had the ropa vieja, guac, and some sort of goat cheese dish to start off...and all were amazing. For the main course I had the chuleta pork chop dish and it was SO good. My friends all had the beef tenderloin dish and that was incredible as well. To end the night we shared the brownies, which there were like 6 of (and they were gigantic) as well as some caramel apple dish and flan. I'm not really sure how we made it out of there after eating and drinking as much as we did, but it was all amazing, and I would definitely come back for another night of Carnivale bliss.
