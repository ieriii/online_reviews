I Went to Glens for the first time a couple weeks ago for lunch and I was blown away . The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic! OMG the clam chowder was wonderful and the Lobster Roll was to die for . If you are looking for a nice little place to get fresh seafood for a reasonable price look no further that GLEN's !
