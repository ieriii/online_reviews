It took me years to get down to this place for a meal. When I finally did, I was almost angry at every friend I had who'd been there regularly. Why didn't they hogtie me and force me to this place sooner??? It is, by far, one of the best vegetarian diners in Chicago...if not THE best. No, it isn't as if they strive to prepare melange of tofu with a bouffant sprig of parsley in fantastique reduction. It's just food, sometimes with a creative twist on and old theme to welcome those who simply must have a reminder of meat (as one who's been vegetarian or vegan since the age of 12, that would not be me). It's tasty, served up with a wink of shared pleasure, in an environment where everyone has an immediate bond...similar to motoryclists round the world who honk and nod. There is also an outdoor section in the back. Whether or not you are vegetarian, give this place a visit.
