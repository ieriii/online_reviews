Oh, Violet Hour, how I love thee. Prior to my checking it out for myself, VH had become a subject of debate among my friends. Why get one $10 cocktail when you could get five $2 beers at the local dive? While I love my dives, VH is an entirely different animal, and for me, an animal well worth a $20 bill. Everything about VH is class and style, from the velvety curtains to the high-backed chairs; from the drinks teeming with theatrics (flaming beverages, anyone?) to the top notch service. Drinks are, indeed, pricey, but they are delicious, and the care that goes into each drink by the expertly-trained bartenders is evident. When I first read about the Lady Grey, with egg whites blended in, I balked, but my oh my, if that's not the most delicious cocktail I have ever had I don't know what is. In the end, it's an expensive night out, especially for Chicago standards. But when you're treated so well, in a place so posh, with drinks so divine, you won't find me complaining.
