This was probably one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to. The sake cocktail was amazing! I had the duck, it was fantastic. I do have to complain about how intensely loud it is in there. I mean, damn, are we in a club or a restaurant? From what I hear you're supposed to make a reservation, I recommend that. I had no problem getting seated, but I'm special. I would go here again in a second. They can be a little pricy though.
