I needed a cake for a birthday party so I called Alliance since I'd enjoyed their cupcakes and other desserts before. The first time I called the woman on the phone was super helpful. She went through the different sizes for me and the prices and the prices of the add-ons, etc. I thought about it and decided on a cake and called back to double-check on prices. This person on the phone wasn't as helpful. One word answers and had to keep looking things up. Whatever, it's all good. I ordered my cake online (speaking of, ordering would be a heck of a lot easier if they'd just list base prices of cakes online!).  Picked it up and it was beautiful. They went above and beyond with the design. Plus it was delicious. So very very tasty. The only downside (if this can even be a down side when it comes to a tasty cake) it was HUGE. So let that be my tip to you---if you're ordering a cake and are wondering "Should I go up a size or down a size?" go down a size! I think I have 1/2 a cake left over.
