YOU CAN GET PIECE DELIVERED TO HAPPY VILLAGE. As in, you can be lounging in the grass of the back patio, relaxing after a long (or short, no judgement if it's Tuesday) week with a $2 Hamm's, decide you need pizza, and then 30 minutes later, pizza will arrive. I mean, life does not get much better than this, people. Welcome to the best summer ever.
