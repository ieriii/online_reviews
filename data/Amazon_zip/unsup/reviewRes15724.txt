Great food- get the plantain appetizer (one of my favorite foods in the city). Good atmosphere. It is loud and has loud decor and loud music but you should be aware of this when you go there. they have great themed nights throughout the month and just overall great service, food, $5 valet - great place for dinner before going out in the city.
