Was in town for the night and needed place to crash, got a great deal through priceline. For the price i paid, the hotel was outstanding, and i really liked the self-checkin kiosks.  The only thing that I didn't like was that it was a bit out of the way, which is probably nice if you are doing something at McCormick Pl. I was using public transit and the 21 bus was spotty, it also doesnt run until 6am on Sundays, so if you have an early flight you're taking a cab.  A courtesy shuttle to/from the Cermak red-line stop would be a GREAT addition and give alot of added value to this hotel.
