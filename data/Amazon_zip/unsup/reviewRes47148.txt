I haven't been to the other place, just the one on Devon. This place definitely has a corner on the market as it's the only place like in the area, I guess that's why they can get away with charging what they do. The food was good, but overpriced, $14 bucks for a chopped salad with chicken? Maybe downtown, but in Roger's Park?
