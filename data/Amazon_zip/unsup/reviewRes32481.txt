My first Ethiopian dining experience was great! We used a Yelp coupon to save some $$$ and it was totally worth it. Parking was easy and readily available next to the restaurant. Service was very attentive and kind. Food was wonderful.  Wine was decent. Again, food was great - it was really fun to pick and choose, I'd recommend a combo platter with both meat and veggies so you can sample all the goods. Go to this place.
