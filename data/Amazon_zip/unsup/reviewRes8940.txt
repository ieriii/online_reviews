This place was great! The food is top notch, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is serene. The moment you enter, you're sat down at a table and the beautiful murals and scenery that are on the walls make you feel like you really are in the middle east. Side note, the bathrooms are also clean, which is nice.
