Went to Sunda with friends while visiting Chicago this weekend. It is a beautiful restaurant with a trendy atmosphere. We had a bad experience with a hostess, which left me in a bad mood, so I could not enjoy my food as much as I would have liked.  We were not seated until 30 minutes after our 8:30 reservation. As we waited, one of the hostesses was rude, which almost made me want to leave. Once we were seated, our server was great and offered us a gratis sushi roll for waiting so long. We tried several cocktails. My favorite was the Lychee cocktail, which was very refreshing. My friend had the Blushing Geisha, which was really good. I did not like some of the other cocktails that we ordered. We had the chicken/mushroom potstickers, which were not as special as I thought they would be. Then we moved on to the rolls. The favorite was the Lobster Wagyu roll, which everyone at my table loved. The spicy tuna roll was also good. I can't remember the last roll that we tried, but it had pancetta or bacon bits on top and was also good. I was looking forward to trying the beef lollipops, but the beef was tough, so that was a miss. Finally, for dessert, we had the "ridiculous" and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, it was OK, just not "Wow".
