I'm amazed that New Haven has their own style of pizza and even more surprised that you can get it in Chicago. At Piece Brewery and Pizzeria, New Haven style pizza meets microbrews in Wicker Park. How does Piece do so well when there isn't a deep dish slice anywhere to be found? We avoided the wait and loud atmosphere by ordering take out next door through Piece Out. It's a great idea if you are here just for the food. The cheese was chewy and oily and the crust lacked substance. The pizza almost sagged when you lifted it up. As a pizzeria, I wasn't that impressed. I'll have to try their more creative pizzas next time. With over 1000 reviews on Yelp and a consist crowd of devotees, Piece has to offer more than this. Maybe they are known more for their beers since brewery is listed first in their name. That appears to be the case since they received awards for their microbrews. If that's the case, I can see why their bar atmosphere and late night karaoke does well in Wicker Park. Next time, I'll come for a beer or two and maybe even sing some 80's love ballads for the full experience. Piece out.
