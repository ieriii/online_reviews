I try to stick with the tried and true classics. So asian fusion-- not really my thing, but holy toledo, Batman! Everything we ordered was oh-so scrumptious! We started off with shishito peppers, toast and jam, and rock shrimp tempura. Followed by a variety of sushi. The one that stood out was the "Golden Child". Ever consider the sweet subtleties of mango, elegantly showcased in a sushi roll? Needless to say, dinner was a resounding success. Even more so paired with a refreshing "Divine Lychee" cocktail. The decor and its patrons were all absolutively chic. I felt a little under dressed amidst the crowd, but I loved taking in the scene and was equally impressed that the menu lived up to the ambiance.
