Staying in a high rise downtown tends to distort your understanding of a city. Sure, the Magnificent Mile is awesome, but if that's all you get, you're not really getting Chicago. I'm glad I grew up in nearby Indiana, and I think my dinner companions were, too. It's hard to impress two people as well traveled as my conference buddies, but I think Mia Francesca did the trick. The menu was so solid that we decided to share. We had a pizza, pasta with mussels, and chicken. Every dish was great, and the bottle of sangiovese we got was a good one. The atmosphere and the service were money, and we got out for around $100. Not bad at all. I would definitely put this in your rotation if you've never been before. It's definitely worth it.
