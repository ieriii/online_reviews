Mexican joints are a beautiful aspect of Chicago. Living in uptown, I was 0.5 miles away from five different restaurants, three of which were open 24 hours. However, moving west a mere 1.5 miles, Garcia's is now the easiest to get to, and open latest. And yet, every time I hang up the phone after ordering, I always regret it. The food is not very good quality, with the carne asada very well done to cover up the poor quality, and the guacamole is indeed quite pathetic. The price would have you assume otherwise, though, as a simple torta costs over $6 (unless you want sour cream on that, for which they charge extra!). The staff makes you feel as though your patronage is inconveniencing them. I suppose there are some perks. They are open late, they do have a huge dining area, and.. well, that's probably about it. Honestly, don't bother; take the one mile trip east for a better all-night option. And leave Garcia's alone; your purchase would only bother them.
