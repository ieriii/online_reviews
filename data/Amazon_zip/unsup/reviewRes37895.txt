Oh, Hopleaf, how I love thee. Let me count the ways: 1. Beer. My, oh my. It's very hard to find a better selection of amazing brews in the entire city. They do their name proud. Delirium Tremens on tap? Enough said. "I'll just have one..." I tell myself far too many times. 2. Mussels. A-mazing. Frites? Ditto. Overall, just great food. One of the first 'gastropubs' on the scene and putting the following poseurs to shame. 3. Ambiance. Overall, you couldn't find a cooler spot on the old Andersonville strip if your name was Lars Hunterlaarickson (ok, maybe, but only then). I love sneaking past the downstairs crowds to go upstairs and hang out. The old French beer ads are a particular fancy of mine. Guten stuffen! 4. Drawbacks? Very very few. The scene can get, well, crowded. The bartenders can be a bit snooty (can you blame them with all that beer?). Small prices to pay for an outstanding spot. 5. Beer. Wait, I said that? Scheisse. Oh, well. Worth mentioning twice. Speaking of which... ...running down the hall, door slams. Le Fin.
