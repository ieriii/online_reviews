I love this place. The value can't be beat. I've eaten in the restaurant and have also ordered their food for events off site. If you are looking for a place to order food for a party, you can't beat Sapori. I always get rave reviews and the food is fantastic even though it's made in large quantities. The homemade Rigatoni is wonderful as I have a lot of vegetarian friends. I don't know if they deliver. I always pick it up and have never asked about delivery.
