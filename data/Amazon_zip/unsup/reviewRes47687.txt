Came here for a work happy hour and was immediately impressed with the ambience and the rooftop lounge. Staff was pretty friendly (*except one, see below) and appetizers were delicious...my favorite was the bacon wrapped dates. If you have a date you want to impress, definitely come here early to stake out a claim on the rooftop. They were monitoring the number of people coming/going and were turning away folks for majority of the evening because they reached capacity.  My only bad experience here: One of the staff was a bit rude to us since we had left Zed451 for an hour and came back...and wanted to go back on the rooftop to meet up with our co-workers. We walked through what apparantly was the "service entrance" (but this was the same entrance we were able to walk through before), and the staff came to stalk us down on the rooftop about 10 minutes later and gave my boss a "talking to" about how he thought it was rude we walked past him when he was trying to stop us. He completely made a scene and it was so embarrassing. We spent quite a bit of money on this place for the event so was a bit appalled at this staff's behavior.
