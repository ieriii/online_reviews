I had the pleasure of dining at Graham Elliot as part of a private event -- for what I believe was only the 2nd time in the restaurant's history. As part of Kellogg's MBA program, we had the restaurant to ourselves and used it as an opportunity to learn more about what goes into running a small business, starting a restaurant, developing your brand, etc. After indulging in five amazing fall-themed courses -- including a tribute to Wisconsin: cheese, PBRs, sausages -- we were given a mini-tour through the kitchen. All very cool for foodie b-school kids.
