Myself and 2 business associates had dinner a few nights ago. We sat in the bar because we didn't have a reservation. The service was terrible. It took 15 minutes to serve our drinks. I even made the comment I would help them smash the grapes. The service did not get better throughout the night. We saw our waiter three times the entire night. I ordered blue crab stuffed lobster. I couldn't stick my fork in the lobster it was so overcooked. They probably had a bad night, but when you want to charge top shelf prices, they should give top shelf service and food.
