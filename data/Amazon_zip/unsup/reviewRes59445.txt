I had just moved into a downtown high rise and asked the front desk who would they recommend for a good pizza.? I called Giordano's on Rush street and ordered a medium pizza with Italian sausage toppings and mushrooms. I waited for almost an hour and a half famished, just to receive an Italian sausage sandwich and a cheese pizza. I was very dissapointed as I do not like either one and do not eat Itallian sausage sandwiches. I called and the manager assured me that he would give me a credit for my next pizza. I called tonight and at first was delighted to hear the operator say, yes we owe you a pizza. I suppose his boss snatched him off the phone as another voice came on saying we do not show youe credit in the system. This was the boldest face lie I had heard all day, I reminded him that the precious manager gave me the credit and the previous order take did see a credit. He hollered at me, "I CAN'T GIVE YOU A CREDIT LADY!" i hung up and found myself so upset I was almost in tears,,,,it certainly wasn't about the credit, it was the HORRIBLEservice I had just received after everyone else was trying to do the right thind, So, I called Pizzera Ora and am enjoying a great pizza, I can honestly say it taste better and the service was awesome! I love good service...better then sex so to me BAD SERVICE should put people out of business! ALSO, i heard them laughing in the back ground saying no credit today! What kind of idiotsdo things like this. Now I had the front desk POST a sign in the room where thousands of people pass saying IF YOU LIKE AWFUL SERVICE GO TO GIORDANO'S!!!! so please don't go there, they do not care about the customer.
