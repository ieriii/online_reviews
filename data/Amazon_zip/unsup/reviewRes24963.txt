Go to one of the other Greek restaurants if you want a full intensely Greek experience. Artopolis is great for a light meal, or dessert, or just for a cup of coffee and a chat. I love the atmosphere, it's cheery and beautiful. I have loved everything I've had here - pizza, cheese pies, pastries, greek coffee, frappe, ... mmmm. It's one of those places that I can go back to repeatedly.
