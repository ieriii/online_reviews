I'm moving to Costa Rica, f'real! Tried Irazu this past week & cannot believe how much I've been missing out on these past few years in Chicago. We went a little after lunch time & it was still PACKED. I mean so packed I had to crawl over and almost fall mind you!) a bench to get to the little table available. We were immediately served their delicious homemade chips & super spicy salsa. Not a fan of the two salsas being served in plastic ketchup & mustard-like bottles, but I got over that real quick. After eating some cheese empanadas (in my opinion, pass on these & focus on the meal ahead of you), I decided on the steak burrito with added sour cream & avocado. I got the hot peppers on the side & am so glad I did. The burrito was so tasty that I think the hot peppers would have taken away from the complete & utter euphoria I was in. I mean seriously on the cold, windy day I felt as if I was sitting on a beach in Costa Rica enjoying a delicious, mom & pop made burrito. Yowzers! I didn't try my dining mates dish, but he finished it all & was totally sweating-shhh, don't tell him I told you. It was spicy, but the addicting kind of spicy. The food is inexpensive, but there is so much flavor. I can't wait until it gets warm again & will frequent Irazu just to try all the dishes on the menu. Word to the wise: Don't go in big groups. It was just the two of us & we were able to skip ahead of all the families & groups of friends (sorry, sorry!) since there was a table for two in back open.
