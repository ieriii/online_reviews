Best Indian Buffet I've been to and the only reason I go here, as I am way too broke to pay $18 a dish when i know I'd want like 5 . ( That was long winded) . Anyhoo, I can't say that any particular dish sticks out in my mind, but I've loved most things I've eating. The only meh dish was the fish curry...it was a twee bit fishy. They also give you tandoori chicken and naan with your buffet. Add a mango lassi and I'm in heaven!
