Came here for some pre-dinner wine and cheese. Perfect location--walking distance from the theater! Love the wine flights...I am a big fan of variety. Loved the cheese! Got the Bin 36 sampler. I will be back to try more wine and cheese types for sure! Service definitely left something to be desired. I had to flag down my server on several different occasions.
