Incredible organic food, and an adorable, quaint ambiance. I had the chick pea fries, veggie pot pie, and vanilla macaroon when I was here, and all of it was outstanding. I am a vegetarian, so I'm always thrilled when restaurants have more than one vegetarian option. I'm pleased to say that Nana had a lot for me to choose from, so I can't wait to go back and try everything else. Aside from that, the food is fresh, organic, and healthy so you really feel like you can indulge a little. We went on a Saturday night, and didn't have to wait for a table either. Outstanding all around!!!
