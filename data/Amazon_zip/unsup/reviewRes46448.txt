I have to say the Grand Lux is my favorite restaurant. Their drinks are creative, and the food is sooooo tasty! The waiters are really friendly and the food comes out fast. Recently, my fiance and i got engaged there on valentines day:) You may be wondering why i am only giving it four stars... on that very same night, we got charged for our meal 3 times! I think something went wrong with the system but we discovered it the next day. We called the restaurant right away, and we were told the right person to handle it was not working for another two days, and we were assured that we would get a call first thing on monday morning. Of course, by tuesday we heard nothing. We called back only to hear that once again, the business manager was out for the day, and we were promised that we would get a call the next morning. We got no call. Finally friday, (at this point we were still 250 dollars short in our account because of the charge), we called, and angerly requested that the situation be handled. The man on the other line said that it would be taken care of that day, and that our meal would be "taken care of" We assumed that for the inconvenience we wouldn't be charged for our meal. Two days later, all the charges were removed. The next day we were charged for our meal. All a little annoying and sad because we are frequent visitors, and i feel we should have recieved some sort of discount. Oh well, still great food
