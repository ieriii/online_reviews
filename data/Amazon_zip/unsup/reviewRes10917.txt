Who runs out of iced tea "for the season"? The Bongo Room does! I don't understand how this is even possible. As someone who rarely orders a drink drink and avoids most soda (except my favorite of grapefruit La Croix with a splash of organic grapefruit juice), I always order iced tea. Sometimes they run out and I have to wait a while for them to brew more, sometimes they are out because I come in to eat super late and there is no more... but for the season?! What does that even mean? Like, for the rest of winter you will not have iced tea at your restaurant? Was this some magical iced tea? Are there not tea shops all over the city? Or, maybe even buy a few tea bags from the store and brew some more tea? I just don't understand. Anyway, after an odd start to the meal... which I still don't understand. We ordered lunch as their breakfast items are predominantly super sugary. (Come here if you want some crazy pretzel white chocolate crusted pancakes or something or, go to M Henry for the blisscakes). I had the duck confit salad and JN had some kind of pork sandwich. Both of these were okay. Nothing to rave about in my opinion. We went during the week and didn't have to wait for a table. I hear it gets pretty crazy on weekends. I'm pretty impatient when it comes to waiting to eat but there are a few places I would be willing to wait (Victory's Banner, M Henry), not here though. I just wasn't very impressed. Sometimes too much hype is a bad thing. I hope for the sake of other iced tea drinkers that they make a lot of iced tea next "season".
