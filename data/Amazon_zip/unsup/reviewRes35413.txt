Headline: Underwhelmed. Service: Very good. Pleasant, professional staff that were informative and attentive without hovering. We walked into a ridiculous 3.5 hour wait (no reservations for us), but then easily sat at a full size booth in their lounge/bar area. Perfect. Food: I really enjoyed their lobster bisque, but then my main course of Florida stone crab claws was pretty average. To be fair, I am in Chicago, not in Florida. I've had amazing stone crab in Miami, at Joe's (not to be confused with the national chain). Shaw's rendition was good, but a bit mealy as if it had been recently de-thawed. Not worth the nearly $60 price tag for that entre. I tried the Alaskan King Crab which was better, but also not wuite worth the price. Portions=good, Quality=eh. There is better seafood to be had in the city! And for these prices at a normal enough 'nice' restaurant, hop in the car and head to Bob Chinn's... was more impressed there.
