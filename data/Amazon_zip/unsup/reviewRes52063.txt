I don't get the whole "snarky service is part of the charm" mentality. We had no idea Gino's was "legendary" when we went in - had never heard of it. First, it took no less than 10 minutes for anyone to even come by and take our drink orders. Obviously, we got the "too cool for school" treatment, but again, because I wasn't aware of the culture, I thought it was just rude. I think being rude is just being rude - not cool or charming. Anyway, after we did order, we waited at least an hour before we got our pizza (which I now understand is the norm for a true deep dish), but I thought it was strange that several people who arrived after us kept getting their pizzas long before we did. When we finally did ask about our order, we were told it would just be a few minutes. Then, they came back with what must have been the first thing to fall off the conveyor - because it certainly wasn't at all what we ordered. All things considered, it sounds like they just forgot to put in our order. We ordered half pepperoni and half veggie, but what we got was all pepperoni - which really sucked because I wasn't eating meat at the time. Not wanting to wait another hour for food, I just picked the meat off. I'm a big deep dish pizza fan and this was just not good. So sad that my first authentic Chicago pizza experience was so disappointing! When we checked out, I noticed I was charged individually for each refill of the dinky-sized sodas I'd ordered - while we waited for a pizza that wasn't even ours. Not a good time at all!
