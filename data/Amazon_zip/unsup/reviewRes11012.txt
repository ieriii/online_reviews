So, after several attempts over the last 9 years (not an exaggeration), I finally got into Piece. All the previous times have been evenings where the place was packed and I didn't want to wait the 2-3 hours for a seat. I went here for a meetup with a bunch of people, so the pit area had been reserved for us. I've had Piece beers before, which is mostly why I was there. The beers were great, as usual. Not a huge fan of thin crust pizza unless it's Neopolitan style pizza, but this stuff wasn't bad. Nothing to write home about but they did have a nice selection of toppings. The owner was friendly and the karaoke was super funny. I'll come back if there's ever a chance I'll get a seat in the future. :)
