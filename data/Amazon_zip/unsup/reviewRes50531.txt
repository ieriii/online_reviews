Ok. I have to preface this review with the fact that I am making comparisons to the foods I grew up; so don't get up in arms since it's only a 3 star review. Big Jones is a nice brunch and dinner spot in the Andersonville neighborhood serving up Canjun/Creol food in a bright and airy space with lots of beautiful atmospheric touches. Things that are always consistent, the few times I've been in the last month: the coffee has always been spectacular, the beignets always warm, airy, and melty on the tongue, the staff always friendly and efficent. There are some dishes on the menu that I find to be real winners. Both my boyfriend and I loved the Carolina Pulled Pork Benedicts but thought the standard Benedict, was a little heavy on the ham and a bit dry. My ham and pimento cheese sandwich was a little overwhelming; the sandwich was so big that after a while the flavors were no longer appetizing a quarter through. (I boxed it up and too it home for left overs). I thought the Andouille & Sweet Potato Biscuits were a real standout; covered in holy trinity gravy (celery, onion, bell pepper) the savory and the mild sweetness came together very well. I think it's a pretty credible attempt at Creole food and will certainly go back if only for the beignets, which my boyfriend can't get enough of and now asks if I can make every few days.
