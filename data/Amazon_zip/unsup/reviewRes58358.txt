We went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. We arrived pretty early (around 6:30) to avoid the rush, but still had to wait a little bit for a table. The tables are fairly close together, so luckily the couple at the table next to us weren't loud-talkers. For our first drinks, my boyfriend got a Manhattan and I had some kind of pomegranate cocktail; both were good. We got beers after that, of which they have a good selection. We ordered the frogs legs as our first course. They were cooked exactly like buffalo chicken wings, complete with blue cheese sauce, and were kind of disappointing, though they were on the bar bites section of the menu so maybe we should have known better.  We also ordered the gnuddi and scallops small plates. The gnuddi didn't blow me away, but came with an interesting sauce. The scallops were great, perfectly looked, and the wild mushrooms that came with them were really tasty as well. We also split the venison, which was served with a delicious berry sauce. We finished up the meal with the chestnut custard, which was unusual but good.
