As I was wandering about Michigan waiting for my poor husband to finish up work on a Saturday I happened to see the giant arch proclaiming "Purple Pig - Cheese, Swine, and Wine". How could I resist? So later in the evening the two of us headed over there. It was cute, small and cozy. But being that it was pretty late at night (11pm ish?) it was not too crowded. We opted for a small table rather than communal table and immediately began perusing the menu. Just gotta say, we like our pork...We ordered the following: Braised pork + mashed potatoes : so tender, melted in your mouth. absolutely delicious. All i've got to say Endive salad : definitely interesting, like a more anchovy cesear salad with roasted endive. Not usually a huge fan of cooked salad greens or even endives in general, but this was pretty good. A bit bitter and acidic for me, but refreshing. Cheese platter: Goat cheese = delicious butteryness (sp?) that went perfectly with the bread. Very mild goat flavor. Blue cheese = nice salty, savory taste without too much pungent flavor. Went well with the qunice paste, which my husband had to move away from him to keep from inhaling the whole dish. Manchego = solid, good cheese, but not as impressive. Fried pig ears w/ egg and greens = crunchy chewy delicious. I'm not a stranger to pig ears, but have not had them fried. And now I wonder why I don't have it this way more often (other than the potential health impact). Dessert: I believe it was the Iris(?). It was a fried brioche filled with ricotta and chocolate. soooooooooo yummy. We also had wine, a Syrah & a the sparkling spanish wine..both of which names have totally escaped me...but they were great accompaniments to the food & nice to have as a 1/3 bottle. Overall, definitely will be heading back that way.
