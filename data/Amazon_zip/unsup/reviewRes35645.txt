This place is well-known for their roast duck, roast duck, & roast duck... Did I say roast duck too many times? I can't emphasize enough that the roast duck is definitely a must order. The roast duck is just made right! Each piece is juicy & tender enough to eat, while the skin is just crispy and tasteful. The past 4 times I've been here, their duck definitely hasn't disappointed me yet. Their other dishes are quite good as well, typical to what you would expect in a Chinese restaurant. Definitely more on the inexpensive side and quite flavorful, especially considering the price. They range from fried rice, noodle soups, seafood, poultry, etc... Really a mute point, you're going to this place for the duck, right? They even serve a wide array of alcoholic beverages (what is a duck dinner without some Goose Island Matilda to wash it down?). Wines & Beers, both local & foreign (Tsing Tao beer). Even though this place is BYOB friendly, beware of the corkage fee... Yes, $5 per wine bottle & $2 per beer bottle... A ripoff in my opinion. But hey their drinks are reasonable priced though ($6.50 for the 22 oz bottle of Goose Island Matilda), so don't bother bringing your own alcohol unless you really wanna open your $500 wine during dinner. So what are you waiting for, go and feast away on some duck. And remember, get the Goose Island Matilda to wash it down!!
