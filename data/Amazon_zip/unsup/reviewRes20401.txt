Went there around 9:30PM on a Thursday evening without a reservation and had to wait about 30-40 min to get a table. We had brought a bottle of champagne and the staff was very kind to chill it for us in the mean time. In the waiting area we chatted with another couple that frequents the place and they gave us recommendations on what's a must to try. Not sure if table reservations are very helpful because people waited a while even though they had one. We got seated at the bar and I felt the hostess had an attitude issue or was rushed too much to bother with my request to move us to one of the open tables. Luckily, our waitress was kind enough to set us up once another table freed up. I can echo the comments from other yelpers that the service is somewhat slow, mainly because there are too many tables per waitress. Other than that I was left with only good impressions from the place. The decor is modern and cozy, the light are dim and the music is subtle, all making for a hip yet romantic ambiance. The sushi was really good, and although Sushi Samba Rio is still the best on my list, this is by far superior for its price. We really enjoyed the crunchy spicy tuna and the white dragon, and the fatty hamachi and fatty salmon simply melted over our taste buds. We are definitely coming back and highly recommending Coast Sushi to anyone looking for a moderately priced indulgence in some excellent sushi. Just don't forget to bring a nice bottle of your favorite Sake/wine to complement the experience.
