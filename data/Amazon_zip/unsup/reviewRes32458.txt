First of all: the food there is absolutely delicious! I'm a fan of Ethiopian cuisine, and after enjoying multiple eateries in DC's Ethiopian neighborhood in Adams Morgan it was hard to find an adequately good place in Chicago. Addis Ababa in Evanston is also great, by the way. We ordered messob for 1 -- and amazingly it was enough food for 2 semi-hungry adults. Had we ordered for 2 -- we would've definitely overeaten. Kitfo was especially spectacular -- I always order it "very rare" (lebleb). Honey wine was a seamless accompaniment to the food. Parking on a Friday night was surprisingly easy -- we found a spot right in the front. In the service department things were not as smooth. All went well until we got our check -- where we were charged for some appetizer we never ordered; however when I pointed it out our server apologized and quickly took care of the situation. We split the bill to the 2 credit cards and after we both signed our bills, the waitress appeared again and said she had to re-run my friend's card as it did not go through. Other than that, all was well. Definitely recommend this place -- and will go back myself.
