sigh. my favorite place in chicago. I didn't think delicious crafted cocktails existed outside of new york, but boy was i wrong! i love love love this place. sitting at the bar here is pure happiness. the mixologists are so great, engaging, they are always happy to answer questions and make recommendations as any quality establishment would have. Every cocktail i've ever had there does not disappoint! the last time I left my gin comfort zone and tried tequila and whiskey cocktails and they too were fantastic! special shout out to robert, who always does us right! Can't wait to go back.
