Oh my word!! So delicious! Never had steak that tasted like that; of course, it was because of all that butter! I was smiling the entire time I ate my steak. We had to come here for Restaurant Week. Why wouldn't you pay $32/pp for a 3-course meal here?! We tried the seafood gumbo (chunks of seafood and on the runny side, not thick), steak house salad (good), 8-oz filet (so tender!), 12-oz ribeye (so much flavor!), creamed spinach (not hot enough, nothing spectacular; tasted "homemade"), mushrooms (in a bath of melted butter; again, nothing special), chocolate mousse cheesecake (whipped to perfection with a thin cookie crumb crust - delicious!), and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce (for a sophisticated palett - contained raisins, and the whiskey was strong). All in all, a fine meal with excellent service too!
