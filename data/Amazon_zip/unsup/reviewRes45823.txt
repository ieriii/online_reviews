Almost every review here mentions that the Grand Lux Cafe is a subsidiary of the Cheesecake Factory, and how it's almost exactly the same. You don't realize how seriously you should take that to heart until you come. 7 pm on a Monday, 10-15 minute wait for three people. We had time to check out the building, which looks exactly like a Cheesecake Factory. They have this weird system where they call you upstairs with a pager, then make you wait in a crowded hallway until your name is called, which may not be that soon after, necessarily. We had a really nice table overlooking Michigan Ave., which was nice even being locals. The fresh bread was good, hot sourdough and a wheaty bread, and they brought us an extra basket without us even asking. I ordered the Mushroom Veggie Burger (not to be confused with their OTHER veggie burger-- that's right, they have two!), and it was really, really tasty. I was also really, really, hungry, but I think it would have been good even if I wasn't! The burger part you could tell was fresh-made, falling apart in the best kind of ways. And it came with a garlicky mayo that absolutely completed the savory flavors. I love that you can get a salad instead of fries, and the salad was fine... some mixed greens and cherry tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing. My parents, both meativores, thought their dishes were only so-so. My mom got the scampi-chicken parmesan combo, and really enjoyed the shrimp scampi, but left half of the chicken parm. My dad got the Indo-chine something-or-other, and thought it was overpowered by ginger and lacking in flavor overall. Sometimes being a vegetarian pays off, since Yelp! says vegetarians "love" this place. I wouldn't go that far, but I'd high-five whoever designed the menu, and I'd high-five them good.
