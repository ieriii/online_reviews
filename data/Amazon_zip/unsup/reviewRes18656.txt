Tiny place, Gianormous portions! My first review! This restaurant has got some really great things going for it and some underachievements. First, a little about the place...it's all of fifty seats in a space the size of an average living room. Also its byob so bring a nice barolo. The place almost deserves four stars just for the hand made pastas but the reason I decided to give this place three instead of four was because the sauces on the pastas were uninspired and at times even a bit off. It's hard to mess up a pomodoro but this place seems content to serve sweet tomato soup-esque pomodoro. For those looking for TRUE authentic italian this is not quite there but that being said it is very satisfying. I really enjoyed the house made cheese stuffed gnocci with chicken. They were little pillows of heaven. My mom had the chicken parmesean which was a dish on steroids...i mean not only was it like ten ounces of chicken but it was over massive house made rigatoni in a bolognese. The dish would have been a huge success if it weren't for that saccharin sweet tomato sauce. My sister had simple meat ravioli in alfredo which was like paste it was sooo creamy...again, insane portion. The calamari was brilliant. My suggestion. Go with a date, order two apps, split an entree and bring a nice bottle or two. All in all a really nice affordable meal...just wish those sauces were a little less sweet and creamy.
