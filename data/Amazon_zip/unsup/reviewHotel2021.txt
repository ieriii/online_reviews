I was prepared to hate this hotel. Previous one-star ratings had me terrified (particularly the bed bug review). I searched immediately when I arrived - no bed bugs, nice room, great view, friendly staff. I would stay here again and be happy. Not sure why the bad reviews. Bottom line: nice hotel in a great location.
