I've eaten at the India House in Oak Brooke for brunch, but this had the best indian food I've had around. We had the butter chicken and garlic naan and the veggie samosas and i really liked the sauces that came with the samosas as well as the naan and dip that came in the beginning. Food was great, service very attentive, good location, nice atmosphere.. I would definitely come back again.
