I've been coming to this place since it was in its old location and not clogged with hipsters lined around the building.  My brother used to live in the neighborhood and how he didn't end up weighing 500 pounds, I'll never know. I think his old room-mate still works there. I've had so many of the offerings, it's hard to pick my favorite. The basics are amazing, just a plain Chicago-style dog, polish sausage or corn dog - they are all perfect. And the fries are always spot-on. When it comes to the more exotic dogs, I've had antelope, duck, rabbit, dogs topped with foie gras, corned beef dogs, the list goes on and on. Always with amazing and inventive toppings. Doug himself is as much a part of the institution as the food. Always quick to quip and keep the rabble in line, he clearly knows how he wants things to run and is in control of the situation. I made the mistake of ordering two orders of duck fries on my first visit and he told me 'no'. I thought he was kidding. He was not. My brother then explained that each order took like 20 minutes to cook, so I was being a tool and screwing over everyone else. Best damn frites I've ever had.  Also, cash only.
