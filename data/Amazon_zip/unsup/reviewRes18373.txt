Close quarters in this neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it does not lose it's intimacy. It did reminded me of the small restaurants in Italy. BYOB is a plus. I've been here numerous times, but this is the first time we started off with stale bread.  The fresh, soft Mozzerella slices on top of the crispy bruschetta bread definitly made up for it. A MUST have when you go. Had the mushroom rissoto: creamy and fufilling. Large portions, but is perfect for next day left overs.  This is definitly a must try while in the neighborhood...it should not disappointment.
