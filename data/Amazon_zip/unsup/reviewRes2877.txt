I had a pretty good experience at Tru. 5 Stars for the service... 3.5-4 stars for the food. I was not THAT wowed with my beet apple goat cheese salad app (too predictable) and seared tuna entree (weird flavor combos) I did love the de-constructed chocolate bar for dessert. & The "dessert cart" of goodies at the end of the meal was lovely. As were the exploding truffles at the end... and by this time I was ready to explode with FOOD! If I had my pick for the evening I would go to L20 instead.
