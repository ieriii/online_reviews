I was so stoked about the fact that another Cuban restaurant was opening nearby my house that I feared I would be disappointed. I had heard such great things about 90 miles numero uno! They did not let me down. My boyfriend and I went one evening in early September. It was still warm out so we got to enjoy the patio while it was still uncovered, which was lovely. We didn't know this place was BYOB (it is) so we didn't bring a bottle of wine, or we totally would have! The food was tasty, the portions were great and the prices were decent. We ordered Ropa Vieja and Bistec Empanizado (the dinners), and they were both amaaazing. Just like the food I get back home! Actually, our one complaint about the dinner was that both my boyfriend and I found that the platanos (sweet plantains) were extremely dry... and had a strange texture. That was the only part of our dinner we didn't enjoy. At the end of our meal, the owner came up and asked us about our dinner and was extremely friendly! It was nice, especially because I found out he's a Miami Cuban (like myself) and it just warms my heart to know that there are more of us up here. Since then, I've been back a few times, and my only real problem (and the reason they are getting 4 stars) is that the cafe con leche is just... not good. I mean, being Cuban, I have extremely high standards for good cafe con leche, but it wasn't even average, just bad. In fact, the best cafe con leche around here can be found at a Puerto Rican place! Come on 90 miles, put up a fight!! EDIT: They just started delivering and I have never been so excited in my life! We got some tonight and it came so quickly (granted we live down the street, but lots of places nearby take over 45 mins to get here) and it was all warm and delicious. And cheap! A++++++
