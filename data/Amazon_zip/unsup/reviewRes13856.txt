The owner, Glenn, and a female manager were quite rude here. My girlfriend and I asked to close an outdoor umbrella and were denied. Then, we asked for a couple of Bloody Mary's and were not served since we already had drinks at our table - apparently some odd rule of no more than one drink per person as told by the mgr. What?! Any other restaurant would gladly serve you more and be accommodating. At one point the owner said he wouldn't close the outdoor umbrella because that's the way he wanted and compared it to someone coming to your apartment and moving around the furniture. Get real Glenn! We will not be back and neither should you. Pass this place up after getting off the Brown Line and continue to Lincoln Square, where there are much better places than this one. So they serve cereal and are rude, ha! Just do yourself a favor and stay home instead.
