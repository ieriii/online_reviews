The worst Mexican food I've had in Chicago and the service to match. I work in the industry and am sympathetic to busy Saturday nights, but OMFG! Food = awful. Drinks = awful. Service = well you get the point. I am longing looking out the window of this place right now, wishing me and my party of 15 had opted for the Greek food across the street. Avoid this place.
