Updating my review for Sunda! I went here this weekend for Easter brunch and I think the verdict is that I like this place much better in the daytime than at night. Made reservations for brunch here for the fambam to celebrate Easter. (I highly recommend using Open Table to make reservations, plus you can score the points too! woot woot!) It was pretty cool because they sat us at the "Chef's Table" even though we didn't put any special request for it. The starters were really tasty, as a special they had Roasted Pork Bao and it was super tasty..I didn't care too much for the dipping sauces they offered with the bao but when we asked for hoisin sauce it was super delish. We also ordered the Pancit Canton which is a great dish to serve family style. I was really happy with what I ordered...it was so damn tasty. I ordered the pork belly on crispy rice patties. The meat was so succulent and the crispy rice added a nice crunch to it..but once you break into the yolk of the perfectly poached egg that sits on top of the dish...it's over...it just melts in your mouth. Another great brunch dish I'd recommend is the Loco Moco..it's one of my favorite Hawaiian plate lunch meals, but it's perfect for brunch..it's kind of like an islander version of steak & eggs...but better because it comes with rice and is ladled with gravy aka fatty yummy goodness. Another plus for brunch is that they have a bloody mary bar where you have the choice of vodka or soju, they bring the glass to your table & then you head over to the bar to add in any garnishes of your liking (I say bring your glass plus your appetizer plate because they even had kimchi, sausage, tofu, asparagus, and other veggies/items you wouldn't find on a typical bloody mary bar). Sunda is also great for lunch, if you're coming with a group GDine is also a great way to make reservations, they have great prices ($15/person for lunch with a prix fixe menu).
