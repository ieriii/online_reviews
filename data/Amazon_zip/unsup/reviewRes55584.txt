Mmm, I had the white chocolate pretzel pancakes - I can still taste them in my mind. My friend got the chorizo burrito, it was average. It's a great place for brunch, good atmosphere, lots of typical white people who go to brunch. Prices were typical for Wicker Park, but I keep thinking about the syrup of white chocolate - addicting!
