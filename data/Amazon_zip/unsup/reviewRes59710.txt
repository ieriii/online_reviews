So, it's nearly impossible for me to write a completely terrible review of Ruth's Chris, considering how delicious the food is. However, I want to say that on one occasion I was there with a few friends, we had ordered some appetizers. Upon taking my first bite I bit down on something hard... it was a piece of glass! As I took the piece of glass out of my mouth I noticed blood coming from the roof of my mouth. I showed the manager (who could clearly see blood on my hand) and showed him the chip of glass. He went on and apologized uncontrollably and took care of my table's service the rest of the night. When we were finished with our steaks (which were perfect) we received a bill which had ZERO dollars taken off of it. I'm not one to try and get free meals, but this was just ridiculous.  I will be going back there because the food is so amazing, but I just wanted to make mention of this terrible incident.
