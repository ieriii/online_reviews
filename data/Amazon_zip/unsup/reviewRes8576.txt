I do love brazilian steakhouses and I do have to admit I do love the food here but for the price I expect a little more. Brazzas and Fogo de Chao are so similar but Brazzas has a little more like grilled shrimp and pineapple. Fogo in my opinion has better service. One thing that turned me off was the cardboard in my mushroom salad. The cardboard looked liked the mushroom as I started eating it. The server apologized and comp my dessert. Hopefully it was a 1 time thing. Would I go there again? Only if someone else pays.
