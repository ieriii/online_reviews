Everytime we go here, we wait in line. But it's worth it. The service is fun and the food is great. I like the range of fresh seafood to burgers to breakfast served all day...its a place I can take my parents when they visit and we can ALL find something great to eat. French Onion soup is to die for. Only if you dine in though...carry out french onion is not remotely the same.
