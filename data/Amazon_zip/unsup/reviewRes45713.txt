Wilde is an exciting and fast-paced restaurant with a friendly and eager waitstaff, delicious food, and a welcoming atmosphere. I particularly enjoy the macaroni and cheese, the burger selection, and the chicken pot pie. The food tends to be very filling and satisfying. In addition, the dessert selection is out of this world with homemade ice cream and decadent cakes.
