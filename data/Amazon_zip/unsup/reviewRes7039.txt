The chips and pickles are an awesome substitute for pre-dinner bread, but I was almost too full to eat. Got the BBQ sampler as an app, and the pulled chicken sandwich as my entree. The sandwich was pretty good, until a waiter walked behind me, bumped into my elbow, and my water spilled all over my sandwich. I was pretty full already anyway, so I didn't make a fuss about it, but the waitress didn't say a word when she came by and saw a plate full of water. Not what I expect in terms of service. Food=4 stars, service= 2 stars.
