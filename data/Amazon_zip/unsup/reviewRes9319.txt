Service is fantastic and food is high quality. Beautiful atmosphere inside and portions are big so you can share easily. Flavors are great but at times it may seem as if too much sauce is used on certain dishes. Overall, great restaurant for a night out. Location works for going somewhere afterwards too (bars close by).
