I had been hearing about this place for quite some time. Finally, one evening, my boyfriend and I decided to go there for dinner before a movie. We got a cheese pizza with black olives and jalapeno and extra sauce. Boy when that pizza arrived my mouth dropped. It was a typical juicy Chicago style pizza. When a pizza is so messy that it falls apart in your hand you know its delicious pizza. I was very impressed. I also noticed it's environment is sporty. Would be fun to watch a hockey game or baseball game here one night. The staff were mutual. Nothing special there. But, great pizza!
