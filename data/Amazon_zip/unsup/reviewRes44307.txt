Beautifully designed to make you feel like you're eating in a small corner of Japan...and, it's an incredibly good price for quality sushi. It is worth the wait, and to pass the time you can hang out in the Chinese bar room, which looks like a still from "Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love" film. The only complaint is that while the staff is helpful, they can rush you through dinner.
