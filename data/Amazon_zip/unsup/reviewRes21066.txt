While not really a gluten-free location, I did enjoy my meal here. The food was delicious and ample, and the service was friendly and quick. The atmosphere is upscale bar, with lots of glass and wood. it is a loud location as there are very few soft surfaces to absorb the sound, but it is still a great place to go for lunch or dinner.
