It's not the cheapest sushi in the world but it sure is good. Every year on my birthday I go out for sushi and one year I went here. I was not disappointed. I tried the mango roll (forget the actual name) and the El Pollo Loco roll. Both were really good and that Loco roll was SPICY! The atmosphere is really cool and modern and it's near some fun night clubs like Sonotheque. It's BYOB and that's the only negative. (And that I now live so far from it). Also, and I know this is weird, but the little hard candies they give you at the end of the meal are delicious. I'm not much of a hardy candy person but I liked them so much I asked the waitress where they buy them from.
