Saw this place first on Check Please. We drive 30 minutes most Sunday's for brunch. It's our favorite. The line sometimes seems long, but it moves. Contrary to the main post - my kids love it. Salmon Bagel, Pancakes - a must!!! Everything is great down to the mochas. Try the baked goods or a strata - the more adventurous your choices, the more pleased you'll be.
