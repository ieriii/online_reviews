Calo is quite the enigma. Boasting one of Chicago's finest thin crust pizzas is quite an acomplishment. Delivering beer and wine until 3 AM a save a Pambo's ass quite often, not to mention the cost of a DUI, thank you Calo. The enigma part is that the rest of the menu is medicore. You guys nail the pizza and ribs, but seem to just phone the rest of the menu in, what gives? You obviously have the skill sets, this is a very good restaurant on the verge of GREATNESS. You are almost there. One down note Pambo was ignored by the bartender (Miss Bucharest 1923) for 10 minutes and ended up leaving before thirsty.
