Stephen was our server and he was knowledgeable and prompt. We don't drink, so we couldn't put his knowledge of the wine and beer list to the test but other diners really seemed to enjoy his recommendations.For my pocketbook, this was a bit of a splurge for us. My husband had the escargot soup which was very rich and tasty and the veal breast. The veal was a rather large portion. I had two items from the 3rd course menu: new bedford scallops and carmalized lobster. Both of my seafood dishes were delicious.Our total tab for 3 appetizers and 1 entree, and one cocktail (kir royale $12) was about $90 before tip.Restrooms very clean. We sat in the quieter back dining area, the bar area was loud but not obnoxious. I really enjoyed the decor, handsome dark brown booths, white linen with butcher paper on top, plenty of candlight, and lots of green tile. We stopped in at 7:30 pm on Monday night and had no problem getting a table.
