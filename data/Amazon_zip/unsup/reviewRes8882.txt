Love ordering delivery from here. Always enough food to have a yummy lunch the next day, which is what I like from my delivery places.  Started off with the Persian salad, which is tasty, crunchy and soo aromatic! My entree was the always delicious Adass Polo with Koubideh, which is an amazing combination of lentils, raisins and carmelized onion on rice with two beef skewers.  I honestly haven't had a bad meal delivered to me from Noon. Delivery can take a bit of time, but your patience will be rewarded.
