Kind of annoyingly crowded crowd. I mean there are only a handful of pizza places in Chi, so that's* understandable (c'mon people)... I will say this, the pizza is better than I remembered, but it should be. Their deep dish gets burned on the top (on purpose, yuck). The thin crust is pretty delish as well as the deep dish w the burnt parts... They have Sausage. I mean sausage, and it's gooood. This from a boring old cheese person. It's cheap as hell, good service considering the amount of ppl., upstairs, allows kids, parking is a sinch. I will be back on a weekday. Yum!
