Damn good dogs!!!!! unbelievable service. I'm in on this band wagon! The Duck fat french fries yum but this place is definitely about the meat! The most creative dogs on the planet.  The Tuben, think Ruben in a hot dog form. The duck meat dog with foie gras on top and black truffle mustard. They will prepare a regular old hot dog any way you like it.  This place has so many choices you will have to go back a few times to try everything and then realize they've created a new dog.... I just wish they were open longer and on Sundays. closing at 4 pm hurts....especially when the craving hits you. Best place for creative and extremely delicious hot dogs.
