Brunch at Sprout was a surprise meal from the BF. Sunday is the only day they offer their brunch menu, and that might've had a lot to do with the experience. Sprout is beautiful inside, with their enclosed patio and funky light fixtures throughout the restaurant. It feels good to be in there. Reservations were made, but there was only two other tables occupied when we got in and a couple of people at the bar. Being that there were dozens of empty and ready tables, it was a bit disconcerting that we still waited 8-10 minutes for a table to be cleared and cleaned. We saw it ready, but we couldn't sit down until three men had walked by it and decided it was time to sit down. But, hey, maybe they all hate working the brunch shift or something. We got the Bacon Buns for an app and they were just ok. I wouldn't get them again. For an entree, I got the Eggs Benedict which were great! The shredded pork was delicious and the sauce great. I didn't even mind the undercooked lima beans since the rest was good. The BF got the steak and crab entree and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff, although moving slow, was attentive and pleasant. They brought out the wrong beer and presented it as the right beer, and my cocktail took a bit too long (knowing the other staff wasn't doing much with other customers) to come out, but otherwise it was a pleasant experience. Also, they ran out of toothpicks which is no big deal, but just kind of reinforced that they didn't really know what was going on or wanted to be there on a Sunday afternoon.
