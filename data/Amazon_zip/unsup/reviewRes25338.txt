Yellowfin Tuna with artichoke and almond pine nuts at Mercat in light of restaurant week. I could have eaten my entire meal (not just entree) with one bite. Thumbs down. See attached picture. Although I had an appetizer and dessert, they were both smaller than my entree. One bite and you're done. My meal was $22 plus tax and tip. Too much for lunch. Do I need to tap into my savings if I want to get full? No, thanks.
