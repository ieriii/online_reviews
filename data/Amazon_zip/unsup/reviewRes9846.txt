Very delightful italian restaurant. I didn't like the location very much, but once I went inside, it gave me a completely different view of it. The place is cozy, they have private outside seatings. The food was deliscious, exept for one thing, one of my friends ordered a salad and it was more like a snack (2 pieces of tomatoes and 2 pieces of cheese? Not what anyone expected with that salad but all is good
