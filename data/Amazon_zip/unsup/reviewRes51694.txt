When I want to get a quick fix on decent Mexican food, I visit Garcias. It's in Lincoln Square. They newly renovated the place and it looks SO much nicer than before. The spanish rice and the burritos here are yummy. Not the best but definitely not the worse you can get. Plus the prices are very affordable.
