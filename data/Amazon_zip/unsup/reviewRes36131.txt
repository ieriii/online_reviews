i've passed up this place plenty of times, and it's always intrigued me. finally got the chance to get some foods from there last week. i ordered take out, and went with the fried pig intestines (yeah that's right), and the roast pork and roast duck on rice. my bf got the bbq pork and bbq duck on rice. his was tastier, but i enjoyed my plate as well. for $4.50 a plate, you can't go wrong with that. the pig intestines only came in one size, and it was $7.50, if i remember right, which still isn't bad. i was enjoying my pig intestines until my bf smelled it, said it smelled like shit, and told me i was eating a shit canal. that kinddd of ruined it for me, but if he hadn't said that, i would have enjoyed it even more. i definitely wanna go and eat there for their duck dinner. the price is definitely right.
