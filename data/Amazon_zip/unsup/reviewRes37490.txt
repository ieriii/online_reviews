Huge beer list (plus, as a bonus, a nice selection of scotches -- I'm told the wines are pretty decent, too) that is put together by someone who knows and cares about fine beers. The specialty is Belgian stuff, but they're not at all snobby about American craft brews. Haven't tried the food, but I've heard good things. The major demerit is that it really does get cheek-to-jowl crowded, especially on weekend nights, which is a shame, especially because it's such a great place to while away an hour drinking and talking with friends. But you really can't blame the 'Leaf for being popular. It's popular because it's good. I've seen complaints, but I for one have never encountered rudeness or attitude from the servers -- not even when a poor lost soul asked for Coors Light, which is not unlike wandering into Charlie Trotter's and being amazed at the absence of jalapeno poppers.
