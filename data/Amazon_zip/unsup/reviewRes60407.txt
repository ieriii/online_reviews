Had to wait FOREVER for a table here at 3pm on a weekday. The pizza's pretty good, but not the best. I would use the pre-order service if I were you. When you put your name on the list, you can order your pizza. Then once you actually get seated, it doesn't take too long. I would hit it if I were a tourist but there's better around if you live here...
