Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to Irazu so it can be put into its Casado de Pollo (enter laughter here)... I actually really enjoyed this place for its homemade taste. Even though I'm not part Costa Rican by any means (though sometimes when I'm in a bar I pretend to be at times), the food reminded me of a homecooked meal.  The restaurant was small so you're sitting very close to other tables, but isn't family about touching those around you and listening in to their conversations...hmmm... I did try their oatmeal shake, but with soy...darn it, what was wrong with me?? It completely changed the taste. Next time, it's original milk for me baby! The flan was not the best flan I've had and neither was the bread pudding, but they were good enough...good enough that I forced my stomach to keep accepting each new bite. Oh, oh, and the prices were very decent (no indecency allowed)... If I were a dog, my tail would be wagging for the home cooked taste of Irazu!!!! I'll be panting on my way there again very soon...
