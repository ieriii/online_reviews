i just moved to Bridgeport, and was looking for a place to get brunch a few days ago. Nana looked adorable, so i decided to check it out. it was a good decision. i ended up going there for brunch two straight days. the first day i got the Nanadict...an eggs benedict on top of corn cakes instead of english muffins. the poblano pepper sauce was delicious...not overly spicy, but had a good pepper flavour that went well with the eggs. the next day, i had the smoked salmon scramble...i swear, there was about as much salmon in there as there was egg. both dishes came with hash browns. the hash browns were the large cubed kind...which i normally dislike because they are undercooked. not here! the outsides of the cubes were a nice golden colour, and they were cooked all the way through. yay! and...the chocolate pudding is my crack. i wasn't going to get dessert (who eats dessert after brunch?), but my companion decided to get some dessert on that second visit, and i did think some chocolate pudding sounded good...so i gave in and tried it. wow. it was rich and dark, and the fresh whipped cream set it off perfectly. all in all, i'm really glad i live less than a mile from Nana. i will be eating here often.
