We had a group of eight on a Saturday night and they accommodated us nicely. The server was attentive but the plates always ended up in front of the wrong people. Not a big deal, just something to note. I had the watermelon and rabbit salad which was balanced perfectly and probably my favorite dish of this entire summer. I tried someone's pork chop which was perfectly grilled, but still very juicy and tender. We did something strange, at the end of the night we ordered every dessert and shared around. I tried all eight on the menu. The home made ice creams and sorbets were the best, followed closely by the french toast (although I was the only one who seemed to like this) and the chocolate and beet souffle. Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner and try some pub food as well.
