I have to give this place a 5 star rating for the delicious bars that they make. I have tried many bakeries in chicago hoping to find good pasteries that are not too sweet nor too creamy. so far I loved everything I and tried at Alliance, expecially the cranberry, coconut, and lemon bars. the reason why I am not giving it a 5 star is because of their chai masala tea that tasted NOTHING like the name! and the waitress insisted that this is what a chai masala taste like.. and she kinda rolled her eyes. I didn't insist too much and just ignored it, but I would have loved to ask for my money back. Anyway.. I will keep on going there for more cranberry bars!
