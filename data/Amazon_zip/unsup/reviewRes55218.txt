I am a vegetarian and still had a great time at this Brazilian churrascaria restaurant. I only partook in the salad bar and ordered the grilled vegetables, no meat. But the food was fresh and delicious. My mom and brother tried every cut of meat on offer and said the food was impossibly delectable. The service was excellent; I have not one complaint. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience. We will be back!
