This is the perfect place for a date or a romantic outing with your loved one. The ambiance is romantic and sophisticated. With the overly accommodating service, you'll feel like royalty! The food is definitely delicious, yet pricey. Expect to pay over $40/person for a decent meal with an inexpensive bottle of wine. Most of the bottles were around $100. My two dining companions and are happily split: - insalata di pere: roasted pears, baby arugula, lemon oil, Capriole Farm goat cheese (nothing spectacular) - insalata di barbabietole: mixed beets, shaved fennel, imported buffalo ricotta, local greens, citrus oil - Spinach and potato gnocchi, mushrooms, local squash, toasted garlic and herbs cappellacci di zucca (I found these to be a little overcooked) - Local pumpkin and amaretto cookie stuffed pasta with brown butter, walnuts and sage (I highly recommend this dish) - Hazelnut gelato chocolate cake for dessert (I recommend this one, too!) - $30 bottle of red wine I suggest you make reservations and dress formally. Piccolo Sogno has a $10 gift card from  la card. Well worth it if you're looking for a formal and elegant dining experience.
