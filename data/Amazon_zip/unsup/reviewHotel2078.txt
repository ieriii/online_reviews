My husband and I are were looking for an economical place to stay in a great location. This hotel fit the bill. I'll have to say that the view was wonderful and for the price we paid through http://priceline.com, really a steal. The rooms are a tad dated, but again for the price, you can't beat it. The bedding and pillows were comfortable. The hotel needs to overhaul the 80's wallpaper and get fresh, fluffy towels for the bathrooms to compete with other business downtown. We will both stay again as it's centrally located and priced so well.
