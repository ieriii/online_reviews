as far as the food goes, quality and consistency can be piss poor here but the service never seems to be. they are always pleasant, never pushy or rushed (though i know in truth they are busy and stressed...zen masters i suppose), and very timely. I've stopped exploring the menu or getting my hopes up about a daily special and just go with my trusty Dagwood (crossing my fingers that the bun isn't burned black) because it's one of the menu items i know i can't make just as easily at home...oh that spicy sauce! so good! ask for extra! deserts are usually really good and don't disappoint. I'd say the vegan mac and cheese is actually passable for the real deal, leading me to suggest that it's a good place to ease a meat loyalist into veg alternatives. do not drive here! the parking lot is nightmarish and street parking can be slim.
