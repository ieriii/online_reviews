This place is cheesy, impersonal and trying too hard to be some corporate interpretation of hip. It's what you would expect if Donald Trump opened a Chiles franchise. Probably good for tourists and suburbanites. I hate sugary cocktails, but they have loads if you are into that sort of thing. The food was good, but not great. Service was excellent.
