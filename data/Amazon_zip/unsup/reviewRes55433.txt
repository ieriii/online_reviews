This is the right way to do modern cooking -- the food is delicious - and the new combinations of ingredients all feel perfectly thought through - textures and tastes that resonate even though you would not have ever had them together before. the waitstaff is gracious and knowledgable - the prices quite reasonable considering the quality of the food. The ambiance in the room adds to the feeling of comfort - and the bar is lovely.
