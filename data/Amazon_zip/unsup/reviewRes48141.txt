The food here is so good!!! Our waitress was a bit of an airhead and barely paid any attention to us, so that was annoying, but the food more than made up for it. Between 4 people we split the chef's choice oysters, the pork rinds, the asparagus, the 2 tastes of ham, the fried perch, and the half chicken. We were full to the brim!! None of us had drinks and our bill was $103! The fried perch was easily my favorite dish, but everything else was also really tasty. Make a reservation, request a booth if you don't like community tables and go here, it's great!!
