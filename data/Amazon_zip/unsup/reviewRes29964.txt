Yum, Yum, Yum. Opart has been one of my favorite restaurants since I moved to the neighborhood in 2000. They have since remodeled...no more crazy floor and orange paint...the food is pretty consistent only sometimes you get it too spicy! Now I always ask for mild, because you just don't know who is in the kitchen throwing in the hotness.
