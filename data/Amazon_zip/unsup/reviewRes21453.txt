LOVE Rick Bayless so no hesitation to stopping by this location. Only ran in to grab a cup of hot chocolate. The flavor and taste were unbelievable but the texture reminded me of melted chocolate with just enough liquid to get it flowing smoothly. Perhaps I'm a traditionalist and didn't know it but couldn't stop thinking I was drinking fabulous-tasting chocolate that had just been melted for "dipping" only to discover there was nothing to dip, consequently, it got poured it in a cup and called "hot chocolate". Will come back for the food but will get an ice-water instead....
