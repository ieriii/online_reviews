I dined at Sunda twice before deciding to write a review. My husband and I decided to visit on our "date" night. While this is a trendy spot where you see a lot of beautiful people. It's extremely loud, you can not hear yourself talk. We weren't looking for peace and quiet, but we were looking to have a conversation. The food was okay, I've had better. I had some sort of fish that was sooo oily that the manager had to apologize without me making a complaint. I really appreciated that! They did offer to give us a dessert, but everything we wanted they were out of.  I think this would be a cool place for a group, or just to grab a drink. However, if you are looking for something a bit more intimate, this is not the spot.  I will try it again in the summer with a group of friends.
