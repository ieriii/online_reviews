My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located right off of Michigan Avenue, which is really convenient for touring downtown Chicago. During the day we just roamed the city and were within walking distance of everything we needed. The room was extremely clean and spacious. The decor was up-to-date and modern. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The main problem I had with this hotel was the parking. I know it is Chicago, and that I should expect it, but it was over $50 a day!! Totally outrageous when you're spending a decent amount of money on the room. If we stay here again, we will obviously plan accordingly and find different transportation.
