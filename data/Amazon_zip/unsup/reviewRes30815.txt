Ok, so Sunda. I was excited to go here, but I gotta say....WAAAYYY over priced for what you get. Now, I knew going in to it it was expensive, and if the food was outstanding I would be fine with that. But it wasn't. It was ok. First, I was annoyed because we were seated at 7:30 for our 7:00 reservation. Jerry Seinfeld knows how annoying this is.....HOLDING the reservation is the most important part. Anyways, we sit down, our server is nice, but slow. We get a sushi roll and pork belly bao buns and both were delish. I got a Vietnamese noodle dish for my main course and it left something to be desired. My boyfriend's short ribs were very tender, but also bland. It cost me $35 for two drinks. After all is said and done, I will not be returning. You are paying for the hype, and that's about it.
