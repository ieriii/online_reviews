one time i drove by RJ's with a car full of softball team members and i exclaimed "i have never been to RJ Grunts actually." everyone was so confused. what? a chicago staple...that i have never even tried... this is not a staple in my book. the food was worse and greasier than Max & Erma's (in Michigan or Ohio), family style, dirty plates, glasses and bowls and a really nasty salad bar. i was actually excited about the salad bar and then i walked up and was scared - thank god their were chic peas...but everything else, including some white jello mold from the 70s scared the crap out of me! it didn't look clean and i wasn't coming back for seconds. the grilled cheese i ordered was so greasy, my hung-over ass couldn't even stomach the whole thing. the one + about the food was the homemade chips or fries they give you with your sandwiches and burgers, those were bomb. apparently the burgers are suppose to be good, but i didn't hear a rave review from my bud who ordered a turkey one. dirty, too greasy and just not my thang...sorry RJ...grunt, grunt...ahhh
