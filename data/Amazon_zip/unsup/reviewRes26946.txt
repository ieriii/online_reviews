So some friends of mine were in town from D.C. and were all "OM NOM DEEP DISH," and I wanted to go to Giordano's, but a bartender at a miscellaneous Milwaukee Street bar was like "go to Pequod's instead." After some finagling, we got there and hoo boy was it worth it. We had the spinach deep dish and I discovered that I would never go to Giordano's for a full deep dish pizza again. The sauce, the cheese, the caramelized crust -- everything was perfect. It particularly impressed my D.C. friends, since deep dish pizza apparently does not exist on the east coast. One thing we learned, though: don't come here and order mixed drinks. They do indeed have a full bar, but when asked what vodka they had, the waitress said "uh, you know, like, normal vodka." I certainly wasn't expecting a panoply of vodkas, but at least a "rail, stoli, and something fancier than stoli" would have been helpful.
