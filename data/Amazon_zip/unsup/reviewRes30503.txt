Although I almost never post reviews on Yelp, I had to make an exception for Nana. My husband and I went here for dinner last night and every single thing we ate was outstanding. We sat outside and had a wonderful evening. We started with the trio of dips and spreads. We definitely liked the spinach and kale the best, but the hummus (which had a bit of a kick to it) was a close second. Then we had one of the salads from the specials menu -- the green beans and heirloom tomatoes with grainy dijon mustard and blue cheese. I couldn't taste the blue cheese at all, but that was perfectly fine by me. For entrees, we shared the hanger steak chimichurri and the chicken special, which was a pistachio chicken dish. Both were phenomenal. The steak was tender and very flavorful, and it came with a cauliflower puree, grilled green onions, and super crispy, thinly sliced potatoes/chips. The chicken was a half chicken that came with the most delicious apple salad with corn -- I couldn't get enough of that! We finished it off with a chocolate chip cookie and vanilla gelato "ice cream sandwich." It was so good hat we actually scraped the plate clean. And it was so cheap! (Note to Nana -- you could definitely charge a couple dollars more for that!) The entire time we were there, I kept asking my husband when we can come back again! Thank you for such a delicious meal from start to finish!!!
