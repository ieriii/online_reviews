So much for 30 days of Yelping. If I do three today though, it'll bring my average back up! Onwards! Nice place (seemed to be under renovation), but our room was weird. The toilet kept making noise and the shower wasn't working all that great. It seems like the water pressure was totally off. Usually that's not a big deal, if it's a $75 a night room...not a $275 a night room. Side note, Yelp! - I think the 'business tips' should be adjusted to reflect a hotel, not a restaurant ;-)
