I use to eat here all the time and Loved it! I think this place is getting so popular that now they don't care about good customer service anymore. Long story short, I ordered a spinach and tomato omelet and there was a large piece of sausage mixed in my omelet. I notified the waitress and the manager about it because when I consume pork it makes me really sick and I specifically ordered a vegetarian omelet and they apologized and the manager said it was not like they did it on purpose these types of things happen because the cooks cook all the food next to each other? . ( In other words Oh well!) I will never eat here again. And if you don't eat pork or meat, you might want to think twice about eating here.
