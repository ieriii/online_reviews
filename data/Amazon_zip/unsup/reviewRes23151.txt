Irazu has been bookmarked on my Yelp page for a very long time, and I FINALLY had dinner there (take-out) the other night. I was surprised by how small it was, and the waiting area was very crowded, but the staff was friendly and helpful and we didn't have to wait long for our food to be ready to go. I had been fantasizing about their oatmeal shakes after reading all the Yelp reviews, but I decided we also had to try a cornmeal shake. The very helpful person who took our order recommended we add chocolate to the oatmeal shake and banana to the cornmeal one. When all was said and done, I liked the cornmeal one better. They were both really good, but I think my expectations for the oatmeal shake were just too high. I enjoyed the "gritty" texture of both of them, but the oatmeal one was too... icy, or something. Hard to put a finger on exactly what it was. I'd give the oatmeal shake 4 stars and the cornmeal shake 5. I had the potato tacos, and they were also really good. They weren't quite as "involved" as I thought they'd be -- literally just mashed potatoes in a taquito-like setting -- but simplicity is the way to go when it comes to these things, as far as I'm concerned. All in all? I'd definitely go back again. A bunch of us ate there that night and all the food looked (and SMELLED) really good, and everyone gave it a thumbs up.
