Shaw's is a great place to eat. The restaurant has a very classy atmosphere, and the service is great.  I started off with the clam chowder (as per the recommendation of my server). It was delicious. The clam was perfectly tender, and the consistency of the chowder was perfect, not too dry or mushy.  For my main course, I had to go with the king crab (they don't call it a crab house for nothing). My server was kind enough to butterfly the crab for me, which saved me a lot of work to open up the claws. The meat was perfectly tender, and it had a sweet aftertaste that went perfectly with the butter (which was melted over a candle on the dinner table!) Finally, for dessert, I had the sampler, which included the key lime pie (to die for!), as well as cherry and pecan pie.  Everything was washed down with a fantastic bottle of wine from Sonoma.  Overall, a great restaurant with fantastic food, a great selection of wines, and fantastic service. I'm looking forward to going again.
