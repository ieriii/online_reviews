My second meal at Schwa was unfortunately a bit of a letdown. No drama in terms of cancellations or what not and the food was still very good - but was overly tame of an experience. Part of the allure of Schwa is having some drama and an out of the box experience. Chef Carlson tonight never left the kitchen area and other than some racy lyrics on the soundtrack, the experience tonight was very PG-13. Just days earlier Chef Carlson had been arrested for launching fireworks in back of the restaurant, so perhaps he was in a somber mood because of this incident; whatever the case he did not appear to be himself. It was nice that the menu had significant changes from my last meal there this past winter (only about a third of the dishes were the same), but the ambiance was just meh. Chef Carlson's brother has left Schwa for Next and the servers we had tonight were friendly enough, but it was not the traditional Schwa experience - it seemed rather sterile. Apparently Chef Achatz was in house the night before, but tonight they were not even at capacity and was not anywhere near the high energy experience I received several months ago. As Chef Carlson is so incredibly talented I probably will return in 2013, but tonight's toned down Schwa experience was disappointing. My first dinner at Schwa I will always remember (and still is one of the top ten dinners I have ever had), but after a lackluster encore I have to drop my rating to four stars. When at the top of it's game Schwa is among the very best restaurants in Chicago, but the issue here is consistency; too often Schwa fails to live up to it's potential. Hopefully Schwa will be able to commence delivering a more consistent product during the coming year, but without losing it's racy, edgy ambiance.
