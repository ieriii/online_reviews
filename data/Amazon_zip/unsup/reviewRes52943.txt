SUBSCRIBE! Awesome food, great prices, great ambiance. Cheaper than Cafe Bolero & Sabor a Cuba. Dare I say better? Probably. Yeah, definitely. My dining partner and I ordered a lot of things - Yuca Frita (with fresh minced garlic - frakkin' awesome), Goat Cheese Empanada, Guava Empanada (reminds me of a bread I used to get as a kid at the Artemio's Panaderia on Sheridan - except fried instead of baked here), the Ropa Vieja dinner, the Lechon dinner and a Trigo & Papaya Liquado. My Ropa Vieja was served lukewarm which is a bit odd to me but that didn't take away from how great the dish is. It is served with black beans, white rice and plantains. Very generous portion - delicious! My dining partner's Lechon dinner was also fantastic. ONIONS! Mmm! It was served with the same sides. The Goat Cheese Empanada was rich and delicious. The Guava Empanada can be a dessert empanada :P Both of our liquados were great. They are more on the milky side than a shake consistency. My dining partner had an issue in the way our order was served - our dinner came out before our appetizers and shakes. This wasn't a big deal to me but I can understand how people would think that is ass backwards. Could have been a one time thing. I like food, it's all going in the same place anyway, no matter in what order I eat it... We sat in the back area which is pretty chill. Enjoy it now before winter rears its ugly head! The inside seating doesn't accommodate a lot of people - probably 20 at most. Casual spot. Great for families, friends, frienemies... Very small parking lot which can fit about 4 cars. Plenty of street parking. I really hope they update their website. It's pretty annoying.
