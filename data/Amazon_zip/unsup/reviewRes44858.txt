Yes, Yes, Yes.... This location is the place to go.... Went there for a lunch outing with the coworkers and from the appetizers to the pizza, everything taste sooo yummy, fresh and good! Nothing was over cooked and that to me is the most important aspect when dinning in a pizza restaurant! Our service was good to. I was really impressed!
