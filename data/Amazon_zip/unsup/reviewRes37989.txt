My first legit (i.e. in Chicago) deep dish/"stuffed" pizza. Much like some other reviewers, I am clearly no deep dish pie expert, but I know a good pizza when I meet one and Giordano's fits the bill. I should preface this by saying we had the pizza delivered, so I can't speak for the service or ambiance of the establishment. That being said, the pie lived up to the nickname and I almost feel like eating something so glutinous should be eaten in private. The crust was tasty, the marinara laid on heavy, and the cheese thick enough to send Wil E. Coyote backwards as if shot out by a cannon. Me likey. I come from San Diego where far too many people would call pizza like this "too much". Whatever, you marathon running, carb counting numpties. Enjoy your belly 'six pack' while I drink mine over your coffin. If you don't want to indulge, DON'T EAT PIZZA. If you do want to indulge, give Giordano's a try. And leave the spandex at home.
