Honestly, I've never eaten at Sultan's Market. One of my coworkers orders delivery fairly frequently, though. It's usually good enough that he's willing to order again. Saturday evening, three of my coworkers ordered delivery; each had a slightly different sandwich. All three got pretty violent food poisoning. One of the guys had falafel, while the other two had lamb (one spicy, one not)... so it wasn't the meat. It was likely whatever veggies were on all three or the hummus they shared. Not sure what it was, but we certainly won't be ordering any more Sultan's Market. (Two stars because the food was always good before and this is the first time they've gotten food poisoning from it.)
