OK, the service I have received here has been so bad it caused me to join yelp to bitch about it! I really, really really wanted to like this place. It had all this cool shit going for it, such as underground tunnels, an old gangster hang out, it was in High Fidelity (you know, all that shit that EVERYONE knows and has to talk about while their there)... But no, I will not be back. Ever. On many different occasions I have been treated like shit. I don't know if it's that I'm young, or don't look like I have tons of money or somehow they found out I listen to slayer. Doesn't matter. Sorry, you have PBR on tap, I'm going to order it. I have been served wine that has gone bad and even had a different cork than the bottle! When I brought this to their attention to try and get another, they told me that's what I get for ordering wine at a gin bar.... What The Fuck! Take it off the menu then, Jerk-asses. Contact me for more stories, but i don't want to go on here all day... thinking about this place, their weired door men, their jackass ego-fueled bartenders, their shitty drinks makes me want to stick sharp things in my eyes...
