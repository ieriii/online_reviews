For the longest time, my favorite Indian Buffet was up on Belmont...Standard India ( which I do still love )... But, my work schedule has changed, so I'm downtown during the day again... So, one day, my co-worker and I decided to venture out and try this place. And boy were we HAPPY! I think we go about once a week now...very tasty, always fresh, and new items EVERY DAY! It's just fantastic, and the staff is fairly friendly too. And even in the middle of lunch "rush" you can still usually get a table fairly quick. Enjoy this place!
