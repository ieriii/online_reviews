The lunch buffet here is awesome. The naan is fantastic and they have a huge aray of meat or vegetarian dishes to choose from. There is a big old bowl of tandoori chicken on the table in lieu of a bread basket. That's usually wasted on me, which makes me feel bad, but I know some people tear it up and enjoy that it's there. The service is extremely attentive and it's always bustling at lunch time, but I've never had to wait too long for a table.
