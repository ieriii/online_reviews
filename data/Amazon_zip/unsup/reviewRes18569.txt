OMG Delicious! Got here on a Sunday afternoon. The line was long and the hostess told us the wait for a table would be 30-40 minutes. We were expecting this already so we shook our heads and stood in line. 40 minutes later, we were seated in a cramped corner of the restaurant. I ordered the Mexican Hot Chocolate, the Milanesa Torta sandwich and the Choco-Flan for dessert. YES! I was hungry! The Mexican hot chocolate was extremely thick and it was like sipping chocolate cream. Very indulgent. The torta was so good! Lots of flavor. The choco-flan was heavenly. It was lighter than i expected but absolutely delicious. I love that they have a choice of still and sparkling water with lemon slices on the side. Nice touch! If not for the wait, I'd go here every weekend! UPDATE: Went here 2 more times on weekdays and the wait was not bad at all. We waited for less than 10 minutes for a table both times and the food was always outstanding! Its definitely my favorite restaurant for a quick bite.
