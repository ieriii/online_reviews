GET THE CHURROS. GET THEM. I was going to update the review with Oh, the pork belly caldos was very good, but rich, so don't eat it after practically chugging half a big bottle of hard cider, or you might feel like puking.  (The cider there, VERY good, by the way. Just don't suck down a ton because you are thirsty.) But, then the churros arrived. And despite feeling queasy, I tried one. And then, I almost died. They are so good. Words cannot describe the hot, crispy, sugary goodness of them. I thought about stabbing my husband so I could eat all three. But, before I could find a knife, he had already eaten one of them, so I decided I might as well keep him around. Plus, he had the room cards for the hotel.
