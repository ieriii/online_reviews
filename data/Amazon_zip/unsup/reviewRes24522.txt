I'd just gotten off the Blue Line from the airport on my way home after a long week of business travel. Knowing I had no food in the house, I wanted a quick, easy dinner that was tasty but totally devoid of fuss...Artopolis was perfect! The vibe is friendly, bright, and welcoming with just enough going on to make you feel transported out of the mundane. It reminded me of a cafe in Southern Italy. I felt a little rushed by the waitress to order, but the sandwich I chose, Briammi Kefte, ended up being exactly what I wanted. Oven-baked lamb and beef kefte, briammi (vegetable ratatouille) and crumbled feta on 'old world' bread. It was delicious.  I will definitely go back when I'm in the neighborhood, looking for a simple meal.
