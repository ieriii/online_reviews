Actually went to the Sheraton Hotel and Towers for a conferance for work. My rating is for the conferance rooms and not the hotel rooms sense I didn't actually stay at the hotel. While I really enjoyed the location of the hotel I felt the conferance rooms were poorly laid out. Some are upstairs some were down stairs. Also the temperature in the conferance rooms was freezing. I mean I had to take a few breaks and go outside because my hands were ready to fall off. The location is very nice however and the guest rooms look like they would have great views. Access to public transportation is also good from here.
