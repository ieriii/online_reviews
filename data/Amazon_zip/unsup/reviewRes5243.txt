In the words of one of my dining mates, "their motto includes swine, we HAVE to order pig!" There are several reasons why I was impressed with this place; here are a few: -variety and quality of food - the milk braised pork shoulder was akin to the texture of melt in your mouth pot roast atop salty, buttery mashed potatoes, the chicken kabobs in tzaziki were topped off by the BEST fried potato slivers, and the beets with pistachio and goat cheese were rich, flavorful, and fresh tasting.  -location, central to downtown and perfect for a chill dinner spot with clients/colleagues -wine recommendations - the server we had gave great recommendations on wine that did not include the most $$$ bottles available. ours was from italy, $38/bottle called labrandi - fruity, smooth, and went down easy -the small plate, communal seating style - promoted an incredibly social, casual, fun vibe totally surprised that this restaurant was not in a neighborhood like wicker park; it felt totally homey in the middle of the very corporate loop.
