This is the first time my family has stayed at this facility. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. However, even though we booked the room weeks in advance, my wife and I were given a handicapped accessible room even though neither if us is handicapped. I commend Marriott for having these rooms available for those who require such accommodations however the room was very "user unfriendly" for both my wife and I. The coat hooks on the back of the bathroom door made our clothes drag on the floor, the shower had no shower curtain which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor during my shower (my wife refused to use the shower). The pillows on the bed were not the traditional rectangle pillows as they were square and not nearly big enough. Also, given the price we paid for the room we were amazed that Internet access was $14.95 and not included in the room price. Given the above I would not recommend this hotel and we will not be booking a reservation at this Marriott location in the future.
