I've been to the Portage Park location once so this would make it my second time at Las Tablas. I was here with a large group of 14-15 people and with our reservations, we got seated with no problems. Dinner was good and most of us ordered the entrana-- charbroiled skirt steak since it was highly recommended and I love a good steak! I ordered it medium and it was cooked just right... in fact I didn't have much of an appetite that night so I had 2/3 of my steak leftover... if it still tastes fantastic 4 days later, it certainly says something! I even thought it tasted better... wow- that just proves I really was not in the mood to eat that night. I'm not a fan of the sides though... plantains, pan-fried potatoes, and yuca. The potatoes and yuca were too dry. We shared a few pitchers of Sangria. It was average-- too sweet for my taste so I liked the mojitos better. I will definitely go back for the entrana! I choose this location over Portage Park because of the better ambiance. Wish they had BYOB everyday and not just weekdays... that would be nice!
