Went here on a night out with a bunch of friends. There were about 7 of us in my party. One of my friends saw Mercat on Check please and decided that we all needed to go and try it out. When we went in the menu had so many different items on it that we were a bit overwhelmed Our waiter was very helpful though and told us if we got the chefs selection he would let us know what was on it and let us substitute. That is what we ended up doing. We also ordered the Sangrea and it was amazing. The Chefs special was also amazing and we got so much food. The bacon covered dates were amazing. The Kobe stake was also very good. The spanish meats we got were great also. So many great things. While the food here is pricey it was also very good and worth every cent. If you are out for a special night this is a great place to go you will not be disappointed.
