I went here with a group of friends for drinks and apps on a recent Friday night. I love the decor of this restaurant -- so fun! We ended up eating at a table in the bar/lounge area which was fine, but I did get a chance to check out the main dining room which was so bright and colorful. Our drinks were fabulous. Everyone enjoyed their specialty cocktails. I ordered a wine flight and let the waiter pick the wines. He did a fabulous job, and the three glasses were generous pours -- around half a glass each. We ordered a three ceviche sampler, and all three were delicious. My favorite was the tuna ceviche -- so fresh and delicous. We also orderd the chips and homemade guacamole which was really yummy with big chunks of avocado. All in all, service was excellent, and we found the prices to be reasonable for the quality of food and drinks and for the scene that accompanies it. I definitely can't wait to return for a full meal.
