I waited a few months for the first cold snowy day of the year knowing I would appreciate a big ass bowl of Pho even more. Wasn't the best I've had but cheap prices + huge portions = a happy me. This place is BYOB so I highly recommend taking beer with you. Next time I might take another friend who doesn't imitate kim jong il from Team America World Police since the clientele is primarily Asian and tables are sometimes shared with several other people. I apologize to all those who were offended.
