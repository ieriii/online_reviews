two words. mashed potatoes. a heavenly mound of potatoes, butter, and garlic. possibly the creamiest mash i've ever had. i came here for the extended restaurant week with a friend for lunch. choice of app, entree, side, and dessert, all for the low, low price of $22! also the service there is EXCELLENT. first course: salad. i seriously enjoyed their salad. it had arugula and cheesy croutons and a savory vinaigrette, what's not to like? second course: 12 oz. ribeye. ruth chris' signature is to serve their steak atop a sizzling hot plate covered in butter. the butter sizzles and pops as it is served to you and i was fearful of the safety of my eyes. luckily i came out unscathed. the steak itself was serviceable (i definitely would not pay the $40 or whatever it is usually). it was cooked to my liking and had all the delicious meaty tastes that a ribeye cut is supposed to have. the butter was too much for me though. i had to stop eating at one point, and my friend (who ordered the filet) claimed that her throat felt like it was coated with butter and needed to soak it up by eating more bread. i prefer some nice steak juices vs. the butter puddle. lovell's in lake forest has wonderful steak. side: mashed potatoes. see above. third course: chocolate mousse cheesecake. the other choice was bread pudding which my friend got. both desserts were average. the cheesecake had a more mousse-y texture than cheesecake, which i actually enjoyed, but the taste was off a bit. but i did enjoy the whipped cream. it was fluffy and not too sweet, like homemade whipped creams usually are. all in all, well worth the $22 + tax/tip we paid. however i would not pay full price. and that's why i love restaurant week.
