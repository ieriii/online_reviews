I've stayed at both lake and loop. lake was bad: crazy masseuse banged on our door at obscene hour telling us it was time for our massages. giant amounts of high school cheerleaders where staying here at the same time which i guess is not the fault of w, but i still hated being around their noise. we did get massive breakfast in bed to make up for the crazy masseuse mishap but that was only after i did massive complaining. loop was better but again, the crowds this chain attracts are just plain questionable. it almost feels like shopping at water tower place. the rooms are the same no matter what W you are in anywhere, good enough but i think i'm getting too old for all the purple velvet. i guess this is why starwood offers the westin.
