Q has not gotten enough Yelp hype. This place is fantastic.  Most restaurants who participate in restaurant week forget that those people who are savvy enough to get key reservation times at their relatively good restaurant, probably are on top of things because food is their thing and they could, on a normal day, absolutely afford the regular menu. Once restaurants forget this small tidbit, they usually skimp on portions, serve up cheap cuts and put out service that is decidedly more at home in a Denny's. Thus, they generally don't reap the return on their investment and blame us.  Q is a huge exception to the general crapiness of Chicago restaurant week. From the time we walked in to the restaurant the service was phenomenal, the host, the waitress, the busboys-- token steakhouse quality service, above and beyond. We ordered one restaurant week menu and some favorites we'd heard about (hushpuppies and macaroni), as well as a bottle of white wine, between 3 small girls. The portions were perfect and the complimentary pickles and chips a welcome addition. THE BRISKET, oh the brisket, it was like I always imagined it could be. I won't pretend that I can speak to the majority of the menu, but I do know there were no low points of our meal-- everything was absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to drag everyone I know back to Q, for bbq worth the gold coast price. The space itself is homey and upscale at the same time, the restaurant could just as easily serve as a casual weekday dinner as it could a hard partiers' birthday. Thank you Q, for the best restaurant week experience in recent memory (3 years). I cannot WAIT to come back.
