AWESOME. First time there, and we'll definitely be back. I ordered the braised pork belly vermicelli and it was divine. The broth was so complex, with all the flavors of avocado, arugula and zucchini masterfully mixed to complement each aspect of the dish. Churros, a must have. I tried the Aztec hot chocolate too, not used to the bitter sweet chocolate but if you like that type of thing, you'll love it. Only critique I have is that the "host stand" seemed to be too busy socializing when we walked in and we missed the process of getting a table before ordering. It wasn't a big deal since we went when they were dead but just a heads up there.
