Alliance Bakery did my wedding cake this summer in June. It was so beautiful as well as delicious. They gave us a free tasting with several combinations of cakes and frosting and worked with us on design. Even when we made changes a few weeks later, they had no problem making adjustments. They worked directly with my florist for the fresh flowers I wanted on each layer of the 4 layer cake! Love them and cannot wait to go back for my free anniversary cake made to order next June. Thanks Lindsay.
