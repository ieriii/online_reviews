I've never eaten inside of Wakamono, usually get take out or delivery. I love the Godzilla roll. One of my faves, and the sunomo is great too. The reviews regarding the music are true. When I pick up my order, it hard to even communicate just my name. But the place is almost always packed. This summer I will be eating outside. It's a great people watching area!!!
