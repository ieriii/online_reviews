This was my third stop today. Went to Kitschn on Roscoe for Breakfast, Glenn's diner for cocktails and Hop Leaf bar was our last stop. Interesting place. They had many beers to choose from. I can't remember the names of the beers I had but was surprised to know that Delirium is a beer made by monks. I really wanted one after I heard that. I had two other beers which I can't remember the names but one was a berry beer. It was reddish purple. Good stuff. This is a great place for beer lover's. I will definitely go back. I want to take my brother there. He would love it.
