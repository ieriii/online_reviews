I wasn't sure what to expect with this hotel...great location, but the outside didn't look very updated. However, they have renovated inside and the hotel boasts all of the wonderful amenities I associate the Westin with...heavenly beds, showers and club lounge. The room was comfortable and the staff was extremely polite and professional. I will definitely be back!
