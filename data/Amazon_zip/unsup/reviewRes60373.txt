Please understand that this review is coming from a die-hard thin crust, New York style, brick oven pizza lover. I think deep dish is, "not my bag baby!" There is an incredibly large amount of cheese in each pie. The sauce and toppings were good and the crust was fine, but Oh my gosh the Cheese!! The restaurant itself was nice and you could pre-order while you waited which was also a bonus. If you like deep dish I"m sure Giordano's is fine. If you like thin crust but think, "I should try Chicago style deep dish," run don't walk from Girodano's. Your stomach will thank me later.
