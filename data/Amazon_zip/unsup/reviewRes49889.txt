this place is all about the timing. off days are better days as weekends turn the place into another street fest circus with loud music, loud , loud conversations, high cockage fees, and diminished elbow room as people try to squeeze in to taste the marinated meats. its good, chimichurri is okays, not spectacular or heavily spiced, but doesn't get in the way of the meat which is key. come hungry, bring friends and get your meat on. plenty of paybox street parking, lots of cab activity and a short walk to the sopo cta and bars.
