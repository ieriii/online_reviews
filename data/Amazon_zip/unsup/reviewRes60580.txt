Just left the Grand lux.It was arguably the best restaurant we've ever eaten in. You DO need to pace yourself though. I had the potato wraps, my wife the appetizer blue cheese salad. The presentation was awesome, and the love put into this food shows. I followed with the chicken piccata. Best ever! My wife had the grilled Mahi. They were both awesome. You should know that I've caught and cooked fresh Mahi for her, so when she says awesome, you should run down there. Can't say enough... Great experience..
