you'll come here once, and as long as your expectations are in line with reality (and you have a groupon), you'll have a great time. don't let them trick you into signing up for a mailing list with the enticement of a $25 gift certification on your birthday -- it will only buy you approximately half of a dinner anyway... come here, hold hands with someone you really, really like, and have a grand old time eating cheese and chocolate and lobster. if you think about it, the amount/quality/quantity of food you are getting is a bit laughable. a few oz. of chicken for how much? how big is my lobster portion? a deal, this place is not. my suggestion? one premiere dinner to share, and then something extra -- i chose a cheese plate, but you may just opt for a couple of tacos after the fact.  oh yeah, and we finished a bottle of wine. that part was definitely worth it. at the end of the meal, i was full of dairy and a bit tipsy off of love/life. such a great feeling -- almost worth three stars! if only it weren't for the two marshmallows we were served at the end. ONLY TWO?!
