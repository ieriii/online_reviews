Got here right at 10am on a Saturday morning and there were already a string of people waiting outside for the doors to open! (so make sure you get there at opening time on the weekends!) Service was great - water and coffee always filled. Our waitress was new but was as sweet as can be. Food - the biscuits and gravy are to die for. Sooooo creamy (so you know it's bad for you but in a good way). Husband got some sort of scramble with vegetables and a side of sausage. He couldn't finish his plate because there was so much. They definitely do not skimp out on portion. I'm really giving it 3.5 stars. Hoping to get back here for dinner sometime. I read somewhere this place got a Michelin star - the dinner menu sounds great.
