I was in town for a conference, and they suggested the Whitehall. First, the hotel is in a prime location near Rush Street and The Lake...Perfect for eating, drinking and jogging. This is a really different hotel. Instead of a grand lobby like The Drake, it is rather small almost befitting a B&B. The rooms, however, are spacious and lovely. Did I mention the rooms?
