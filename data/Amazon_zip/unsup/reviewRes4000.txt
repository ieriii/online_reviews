I've been to Schwa and it is definitely a unique dining experience, but... if you make a reservation (good luck with that) you STILL might not eat there. We had reservations for Saturday night, and they called 2 hours prior to cancel on us! My fianc had already decanted wine worth more than $100. It was our last bottle from our trip to Portland OR wine country. This is the second Schwa reservation that was cancelled on me at short notice. There are many, MANY excellent restaurants in Chicago. Yes, Schwa is unique, but why reward a$$hole behavior with your hard-earned money?
