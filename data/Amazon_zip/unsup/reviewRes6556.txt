I want to jump on the bandwagon for this great Italian place on Taylor. My girfriend and I came about 6:15pm on a Saturday night. Knowing that they do not take reservations, we were prepared to hunker down at another bar (the one in D.E. is way too small and it was packed). We were told 1-1.5 hours waiting time and they took my cell phone number and said they would call. Across the street is a wine bar (with average wines and less than average cocktails, but that's another review!) that is cozy and warm. By the way, you can valet your car at Francesca's across the street. Only 45 minutes later, we got the call and I had to bring along my half glass of wine with me. Our waitress took my glass after I finished and said they would return as it happens all the time! The ambiance was great with the back brick walls resembling a wine cellar. With our wine, we ordered the olives mediterranea which came out warm and for only $4, a great deal to munch on as we looked through the menu. We shared the roasted squash+farro+whipped goat cheese+hazelnuts+watercress salad and it was to die for. We wished we were not sharing! We both said we are coming back just for this salad. We also ordered from the cheese and salami menu as we were not sure we wanted to go with big entres. This was ok, but I soon forgot about it as the macarpone polenta and ragu of the day came. This was so good!! Absolutely amazing! We both loved this place and will be coming back again. Well worth the wait. I would recommend coming with a larger party so you can taste more of the menu.
