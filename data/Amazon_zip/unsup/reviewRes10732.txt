Piece, I give your homebrews 5 stars (worryin' ale is my favorite) your white pizza 5 stars (much better than the red) and the atmosphere 3 stars. My biggest complaint with the atmosphere are all the generic wicker park people I see drinking miller lite, how can you go here and not drink their beer? Also, I know I'm in the minority here but it would be really cool to see premier league (soccer) coverage on one of their twenty TV's instead of four different baseball games.  Karaoke-- I have been there on Thursday night a few times and I swear the same five people are there every time doing the same songs, usually we have to clear out after someone starts doing don't stop believin'. Finally, it's hard to get served at the bar when it's crowded but the servers are all nice without attitude. They once screwed up an order and after we pointed it out the manager came out to apologize for the error and gave us a free pizza. ps- Almost all of the appetizers are good, but the goat cheese is the best.
