My fianc and I used to go to Hot Doug's when it was on the other side of the river on Roscoe and Western. We would go 3X a week for lunch when we were in high school. After the fire, we were incredibly disappointed because Hot Doug's seriously has some amazing dogs! A few years ago however, I was back on break and randomly driving down California when I had discovered that Hot Doug's had risen from the ashes! Whenever i'm in the area I always try to stop in, especially for the duck fat fries--YUM! The only bummer: be prepared to wait in uber-long lines. Hot Doug's has become quite the celebrity among chicago hot dog places. Not entirely worth the wait if you're just getting a chicago dog, but definitely worth it if you're going to try one of the specialty sausages and meats.
