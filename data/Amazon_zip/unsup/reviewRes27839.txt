Never had a bad meal here. This is one of the few restaurants on GNR's in the near north and it is for a reason.  Careful, the topolo margarita will knock you on your butt. I had a couple of those puppies last night on an empty stomach and I was wrecked. They just taste so delicious and go down so easy. What I would do to be able to make mine exactly like that. Unfortunately it takes more than just throwing some Sauza Conmemorativo in a glass. Tequilla is slowing becoming my new best friend.
