Pros: Great location across from Grant Park, easy to get a cab, starbucks across the street under the Blackstone, good food/bar options in the hotel, easily top 5 hotel gyms in the country (huge gym w/ free weights/machines, track around it all, full pool, etc...) Cons: None really, can be pricey, rooms are a little more dated than the rooms across the street at the Blackstone.
