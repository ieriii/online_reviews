cheap, tasty sandwiches. I can't comment on authenticity, since I am not qualified. But l live not far from here and this place is always crowded because the food is just simply so fresh and so well seasoned. during summer, sitting at the tables outside and listening to cuban music will add to your typical meal this latina relaxing feel ... it makes you forget about the busy city you are living in ...
