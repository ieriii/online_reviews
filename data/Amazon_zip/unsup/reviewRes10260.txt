You can't go wrong with their pizza paired with their microbrewed beer. I've been here several times and it was always good. Expect a wait during peak hours. Their Top Heavy Hefeweizen is amazing. Full of flavor and my favorite The Dark-n-Curvy Dunkelweizen is a dark beer with a very smooth finish. I had a white clam pizza which was a bit on the salty side and a sausage, basil and ricotta red pizza which was great. 4 stars for the pizza 5 stars for the beer
