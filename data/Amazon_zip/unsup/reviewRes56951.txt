Save your money, overpriced and not worth it. While salad bar had lots of items, they were low quality. Sushi was ridiculous - only CA rolls, lobster bisque was thin/watery, meat was too salty and dried out. Server was ok but they guys that bring the meat were over even when our card was red and then when we wanted more, nowhere to be found! Even the famed acrobat disappointed. She sat more than she flew. They didn't clear plates, used plate sat there entire time. Also tried to call to change the number of people in my party and to ask about parking and menu options. No answer, no call back, goes right to vm. What a bad experience!
