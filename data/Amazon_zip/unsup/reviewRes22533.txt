Yum! I am moving to this hood next month, so in my excitement I started checking out the local restaurants. Score! This place is cheap, delicious, BYOB, and has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating! Menu items range from $2 al a carte tacos and $4 sandwiches, to larger platters and dinners in the teens. So there's definitely something for everyone. We had the empanadas and fried plantains with garlic sauce for apps. The plantains were good, I would have liked them a little thinner and crispier, though. The empanadas were delicious. We ordered 3 and our fave was the spinach and cheese. For entrees I had the veggie burrito ($4.95!?!, so reasonable!) and my bf had a mix of al a carte items - a taco, a tostada, and a toquito. His favorite preparation was the taco, and his favorite meat was the chicken. We will definitely be back here many times once we move, and I will definitely be enjoying the other half of my burrito for lunch today!
