Plain and simple... My roomate loves it. I don't know if he is hooking up with the owner, an employee, or maybe just someone that goes there a lot, but he is the most loyal Art of Pizza customer out there. Its also right down the street.. I think its OK. Its not the best pizza I've ever had, but its about a 7 out of 10. Its a little pricey so I don't eat there that often.
