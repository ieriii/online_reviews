I'm going to tell you about some of the harsh realities of the dining experience at Geja's, so brace yourself, you might not be prepared for what you're about to hear in regards to this superior dining establishment. Geja's is a dark, cozy love dungeon where people take turns feeding each other. Live mandolin music trickles into your ears from an unknown corner, and you can scoop giant lumps of cheese onto crackers at the bar while you sip wine and wait for your table. All around you hot tubs of scalding oil bubble and pop while people laugh, giggle, and satiate themselves into oblivion. It's the ultimate in romantic, which means this: if you are not going with a date, you better be prepared to fall in love with somebody regardless because that kind of thing happens here. If you are going on a date, you better have a ring ready, or at least a really good love speech. Dig deep. You will be dipping super tasty vegetables and choice cuts of meat into hot oil, all night long. You might end up smelling like oil. You might even get permanent oil spatters on your new $150 designer shirt you just bought from Nordstrom, but will realize that the sacrifice for that one moment -- that look on her face -- was worth it 100%, so next time be careful. For desert you roast marshmallows in flaming chocolate. Flaming chocolate is chocolate that has a thin layer of brandy that has been SET AFLAME. Flaming chocolate deserves a 6-star rating on Yelp which I don't see as an option, so I'm contacting the developers. Geja's is great, if only because there is no other place like it in Chicago. It's definitely a special event and/or hot date kind of place, and I urge you to try it at least once.
