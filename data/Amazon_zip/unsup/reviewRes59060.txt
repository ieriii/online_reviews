Yolk used to be good, maybe about two years ago when I first visited. Now it is just way too much of a crowded s**t show to even bother with it. If you feel like you need to visit, go only on a weekday--or very early on the weekends. If you do not, you will wait probably at least 40 minutes for a table which is way too long to wait for breakfast. There are other reasons to stay in and cook breakfast/go to Pilsen for Huevos Rancheros as well:First off, their coffee sucks. For a breakfast/brunch place, this is inexcusable. Secondly, it's expensive--I think they recently rolled out a new menu with higher prices, naturally. Thirdly the service is really spotty. Sometimes it's great, other times it's non-existent. I've actually walked out after being seated when no server even bothered to come by the table in the first 7 or 8 minutes. Another thing that may or may not annoy you is that you have to bring your check up to the register to pay upon leaving. I generally like doing this, because I can leave when I want and some forgetful servers take forever to pick it up, but as my friend recently commented--"When you charge $10 for eggs, they should probably take the check up the register for you."
