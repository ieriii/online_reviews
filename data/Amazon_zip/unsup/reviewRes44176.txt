Went there for dinner recently and was underwhelmed. They had some really interesting rolls on their menu but the finished product just didn't live up to how good it sounded on the page. I know in ordering rolls you run the risk of getting more fluff than fish - this is definitely true at Wakamono. The mayo concoctions and other adds on where just too much on the rolls we ordered so the consensus around the table was 'meh'. I will say their Rainbow and Dragon rolls were my favorites of the evening. The Rainbow was the better of the two and I would definitely order it again in a heartbeat. Corkage fee was $8 which was equivalent to getting one glass of wine from them. I felt that was reasonable. Specialty rolls were all that we ordered and they ranged between $10 - $16, again reasonable prices in my opinion. Four people shared 6 rolls and edamame for a total tab of $80.
