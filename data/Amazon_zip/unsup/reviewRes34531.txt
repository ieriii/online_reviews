Went here for the first time. Definitely would recommend it. Had the Mexican omelette with pancakes and coffee. Was amazing and a ton of food (could have fed 2, had to throw a good chunk of it out). The place was packed but since there was only two of us, we got to sit at the bar within 2 minutes. Definitely would try it.
