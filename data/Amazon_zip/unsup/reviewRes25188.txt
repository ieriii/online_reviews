This Chicago staple has been around for at least a century. Not good for large groups, since they do not take reservations, but for a couple's night out, you can't beat it. The inside looks like something from the 60s low ceilings, hidden booths, dark lighting and evervescent smell of oil cooking various pieces of meat and fish. Make sure to not wear your sunday best here, it is hard to get that signature smell off your clothes.  It is expensive, but worth it. Since they serve your food raw, it has to be clean and super fresh, and the ambiance is romantic. Try the Prince's platter.
