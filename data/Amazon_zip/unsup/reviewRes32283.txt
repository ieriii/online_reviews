This place has great food and friendly service. Their Chai tea is delicious! The menu is extensive and the food is flavorful. I also came here for their Thanksgiving dinner menu. The food was REALLY good. I never expected to have tofuturkey on Thanksgiving but I did and I liked it!!! I even liked the chocolate mousse cake for dessert and their pumpkin apple puree soup and house salad before the entree was excellent! If I could do this next year I definitely would. Oh, and for the record, I am not a vegetarian at all! Just a foodie that loves good food.
