After yet another failed attempt at a Sunday afternoon Kuma's trip (by the way, Kuma's, I think we're broken up. Offish), my gays and I ended up at Revolution. There were fat hipsters having a fat hipster snowball fight outside. Yes. I've heard nothing but great things about the food, atmosphere and drink selection here. And all horrible things about the wait. But at 2:30 p.m. on Superbowl Sunday, we were good to go. Got right in. Yes, I'll have a Diet Coke with lime (I'm more of an, I'd rather eat my calories than drink them, kinda gal) and looked over the menu. While it's not extensive, there were a few great items that looked tasty. I had a difficult time choosing between Fish 'n Chips and a burger, but since I had my heart set, I got the burger. Oh...and you can choose a side? Mashed Potatoes? Fries? Fried something else? A Caesar salad? Uhhh, I want the fries but just give me the Caesar salad. I need some roughage. Also, we got the soft pretzel to start. UH MUH GUH, that shizz was so good. Gimme more! I could've just eaten that and been good. Why are carbs so mean? So, I get the burger, I get the salad. Ew, anchovies? It didn't say that on the menu! Ew! So, I pick those things off and start eating it, but everything about the Caesar tastes like sick ass slimy fish. And this is coming from a fish person. So, I sent it back for the mashed potatoes. And I really wished I could send those back, because I'm not sure there were any potatoes involved in that dish. It was a bowl of a substance that had the look and consistency of straight up sour cream. Or Yogurt. I mean, I knew what I was getting into but this was straight up fat in a bowl. For cereal. The burger was ok, but not the best I've had. I wouldn't crave it. Everything was just ok to me. i'd come back if the group I was with would want to.
