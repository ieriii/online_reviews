Didn't do dinner but was visiting Chicago and walked by zed and had to stop in for drinks. Bar alone is worth trip. Britt's cranberry spiced old fashioned is one of the best cocktails ever had. Staff is amazing. Felt like I'd been going there for years. Made reservations for a couple days later and they called to confirm remembering all details of conversation before. I kept voicemail because we were so impressed. Great work putting this joint together!
