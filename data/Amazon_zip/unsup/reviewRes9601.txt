The restaurant itself is comfortable - high ceilings, thoughtful lighting, not too loud but not too quiet. Seating arrangement is a bit tight, I think, looking back on it. That wasn't an issue though at the time. What we really came for was Levitski's menu, to see if it would live up to the hype. And it did. The food at Sprout is totally inspiring. We chose the prix fix menu, which is the way to go I think. Our picks included an Egg/Pork Belly/Potato salad, Lamb/WhiteBean/Anchovy/Sausage entree (so money) & Banana/Choc/Cashew/Coconut for dessert. Of course there were other dishes we had - all worthy of mention - each one distinctly different than the next. So many tastes on his menu, which made it a unique experience.  By the end of the night the two of us left full, not stuffed. It's important to not be the latter of the two.  Sprout - you nailed it, Bravo!
