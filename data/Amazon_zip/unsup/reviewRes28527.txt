The manager's response to my updated review is all you need to know about this place. I hadn't planned on writing my original updated review, but I saw the manager's other obnoxious responses to other customers who had the gall of giving negative reviews, and, frankly, I wanted to draw him out and expose what an unmitigated loser he is. Obviously, it worked.  It amazes me that he doesn't realize that providing obnoxious, sarcastic responses to his customers on Yelp actually does his restaurant far more harm than good. I wonder if the owners know what he is up to.  Anyway, you can decide for yourself if you want to patronize a restaurant run by someone like Justin R. Obviously, I recommend that you don't.
