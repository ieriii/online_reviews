Everything on the menu is amazing but if I had to pick just two, it would be the Sturgeon or the Arctic Char. Driving by you wouldn't expect this place to have such amazing sea food items, especially with about 30 cereal boxes on display. But the fish is brought in fresh daily and its unbelievable!!!
