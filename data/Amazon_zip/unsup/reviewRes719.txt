My husband and I are self-proclaimed "foodies" but this place takes food to a new level. We had the 12 course tasting menu along with the wine pairings (which if you are questioning...is definately worth it) The layers of flavors in each bite are so harmonious...favorites are duck with thai flavors, wagu beef and a black truffle ravioli. Desserts were good, but definately not the stars of the menu.
