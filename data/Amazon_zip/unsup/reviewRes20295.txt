Went to The Gage last night after a work function - I was previously unfamiliar with the place and therefore had no expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised! We didn't eat a ton of food and instead shared a bunch of starters. We ordered the chips and curry gravy, the speck salad, the N-17 Fondue and the fried zuchini and olives - all of it was delicious. The service was great, especially considering we were a big group of rowdy coworkers and were already a little toasted. I can't wait to go back and have a proper meal here.
