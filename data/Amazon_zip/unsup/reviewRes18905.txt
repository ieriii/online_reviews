I actually think Bad Apple is decent, but I don't plan on going back any time soon because they seriously have the WORST. KETCHUP. EVER. The crazy burgers and good beer list can't make up for the awful ketchup. And the fact that there are like 100 reviews on here complaining about the ketchup, and yet they still have the crappy ketchup? That means that they probably don't want us there anyway.
