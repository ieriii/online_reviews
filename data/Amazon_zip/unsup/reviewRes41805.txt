First thing that comes to mind is fireflies. Ok, that's probably totally unrealistic, but I love their lighting. It's very dark with lights that mimic a candle light feeling. I totally wanna sit at the large table with a bunch of lights above it. The people that work here look pretty cool....like an upscale Wicker Park vibe. Think tattoos and thick glasses, I even saw a guy sporting a bandana on his head. Came here to grab a quick drink before reservations at The Aviary. I had a Death's Door Daisy, which the bartender made for me with hand squeezed lemon because she didn't have lemon juice yet. A ++ for effort on that one. She was using little wedges. The drink was really good, and she even taught me about the "nose" of a drink. Look at me, gettin all fancy. I really want to go back, the ambiance is amazing and they play some pretty cool music. You gotta check this place out.
