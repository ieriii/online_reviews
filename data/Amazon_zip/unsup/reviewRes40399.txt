Absolutely amazing! Highly recommended. We ordered the scallops to start, which was the best scallops dish I've ever had, period. For our mains we had the wild boar sloppy joe and the venison, and they were both excellent. Bang for buck, this is probably one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The only downside is the super long wait (1-1.5 hours) and there is very limited bar seating as you're waiting. I would definitely recommend going either very early or very late to avoid the long wait, but even if you do end up waiting it's completely worth it!
