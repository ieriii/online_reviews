Yum!!! I never knew how badly I could crave Costa Rican food until I tried Irazu. The steak casado (I think that's what it's called) is out of this world...and it will feed you for days. Also, the oatmeal shakes with milk are a perfect end to a spicy meal. I recently tried the vegetarian burrito...didn't really do it for me, but that could be because I was comparing it to the steak casado the entire time! The atmosphere is nothing to go crazy over, but that's part of the charm, I think. I can't wait to go when it's nice out and eat on the patio.
