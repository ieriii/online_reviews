This place has my favorite silverware in the city. Good atmosphere & yummy food too. I had the Hawaiian duck curry special, which was a little too fatty for my picky self but still excellent flavor. The jasmine tea & mango mochi were yummy. Our servers were very nice & patient. Will definitely return. BYOB (liqour store on Thorndale or Dominicks on Broadway both convenient options). I don't think they charged a corkage fee for our screw-top wine but I didn't peruse the receipt either... If they did, it wasn't a lot of $.
