We had really amazing food at Schwa. Loved every single course, and just blown my mind off with the surprise course, quail egg ravioli. Sunchoke soup was my other favorite. Wow! Schwa was better than Trotter, Everest IMHO, par for par with Alinea. I also love that all the chefs, include Michael Carlson, come out and present you the course. I love that you get the words from the creator, which to me feel personal, rather than from a well-trained server. Why the 4 star, you ask?! Well, I love that it is a BYOB joint, but it comes with the price that our champagne wasn't served in a flute or that our wine needs some breathing and no decanter was avail. Of course, everyone gripe about their reservation system. I had to cancel my reservation at Graham Elliot when Schwa offered us a 9 pm table and I'm glad I did. Sorry Graham!
