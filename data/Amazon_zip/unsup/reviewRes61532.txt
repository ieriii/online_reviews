I love me some Cafezazzo! I come here a few times around the year with my kids and sometimes hubby, Food is delicious, Coffee is good. Service is ok. could use some work. I think sometimes the cook is not the same cause every time I go back the food taste a little different. The only bad thing I have to say is the place seems to be always COLD!... The door is so cclose to the tables it seems impossible to keep the place in good temp. But other then that I continue to come for a quiet time and good food.
