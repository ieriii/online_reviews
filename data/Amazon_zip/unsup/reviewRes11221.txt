This is my favorite breakfast spot in Chicago....so far!  A few points: 1) you can almost always expect to wait at least 25 minutes on the weekends 2) they change their menu seasonally which is awesome 3) it is a little loud, but not a big deal, the food makes up for it! 4) anything with the ginger butter is amazing!
