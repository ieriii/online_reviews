First thing, our table was set differently than the others. Whatever, I didn't really *need* breadsticks anyway, but I was surprised our server didn't bring them to the table. We weren't too sure about what wine we wanted, and my girlfriends were settled on white vs. red. The sommelier was fantastic and very sweet, we tried three wines before making a selection and he was happy to oblige us. He also sent out a little burrata, a gratis, for us to try. I think the server was ok, very nice to my friend with food allergies and helped to ensure she could eat something and not die. They didn't have what I wanted first, which is no fault of their own, but what I did order came over-cooked. I still ate it, it didn't ruin it, I just didn't think the dish warranted the charge. We ordered dessert wines and mine was starting to turn - the server was kind enough to bring me another, and confirmed the bottle was 'at its end'... I mean, the place was alright. I feel like I've heard a lot about it and it's in a great location, accessible and next to the river. But it's a'ight. I am guessing the place is better suited for wine and cheese flights? Their selections on those matters were pretty decent.
