Restaurant review The mecca of beef! This AYCE experience is the dream dinner for meat lovers. I find that this is the best brazilian steakhouse concept. For those who have never been, there is a variety of meats that are cooked on skewers and brought to your tableside by your "gaucho" who will slice and serve the meat fresh from the grill. The meats include medallions of filet mignon, lamb, pork ribs, variety of chicken dishes, sausage and more. You cleanse your palate after each dish with carmelized roasted banana and mash potatos. All you have to do to catch the attention of your gaucho is flip the card to green and you are go, red is of course to hold up! In addition to this endless supply of perfectly cooked meat, there is a extensive salad bar which includes variety of cheese, hard cut salami, lobster bisque, and sushi. You will leave feeling stuff and wanting to come back! Pro: endless supply of meat, great quality, friendly staff Cons: expensive, two people will run into the 100 after tax, drinks and dessert not included Hidden gem: Sign up for the eclub, BOGO (buy one get one free) on your birthday which is a large amount of savings!
