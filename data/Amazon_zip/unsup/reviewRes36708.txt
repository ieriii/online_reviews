Love this place. Went here randomly after a google search of breakfast places in the area. The juice was amazing, the coffee was amazing, the service was ridiculously fast, and the food was GREAT. I don't even mind that it is a bit pricey and the staff seems to always be in a hurry. This place rocks.
