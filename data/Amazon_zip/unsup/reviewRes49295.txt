This place was really cute and JAM PACKED on a Saturday morning.  I hate that pressure you feel when people are yelling, can I help you, are you ready, can I help someone.....of course, they are trying to be of service but it just makes me jittery and nervous.  Anyway, I finally decided on the b& w cookie and a few macarons.  Since it was really only a sampling of the many things they had, I hate giving such a blah review but....they were pretty blah and for 10.75 I just had 3 little macarons and 2 cookies.  I appreciate the work that probably goes into the macarons but 1.50 for something the size of a quarter, not sure if I would do it again...
