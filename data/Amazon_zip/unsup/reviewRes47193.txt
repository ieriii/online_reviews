If I had to compare Lockdown and Kuma's side by side, Lockdown would win hands down!!! Not only their burgers are all certified Angus beef, their imaginative pairings are amazing. I tried the Flight Risk, in which you get three little versions of their burgers. The Fat Elvis (with PB and Banana) was strangely good, I can't remember the second one, and the Punk Bitch (Gruyere & Prosciutto) was my favorite. But what really sets this burger joint apart is the atmosphere. Our waitress was so nice, I could not believe it. There was no death metal playing on full blast, and their outside patio was nicely set away from the noisy Western Ave in the shade of some big trees. Overall, this will be a definite come-back experience for me when those juicy burgers call me back.
