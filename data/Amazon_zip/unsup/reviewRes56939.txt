Maybe my review is biased and I will say that it was not my first choice to dine here...it was my husbands. On our visit, the service was lacking. The men carrying meat walked by and seemed not to notice us even when my husband had his card flipped over the right way. I appreciate that they were accommodating for my vegetarian diet, but the salad bar seemed a bit over priced considering the options and the mediocre (at best) food.
