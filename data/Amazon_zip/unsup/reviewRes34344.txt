I really wanted to like this place, but I just couldn't. The decor is cute and the staff is friendly, all of that is fine. But how do you screw up breakfast foods? The food was just not good. My boyfriend's egg was waaay too runny (gross!) and my "crepes" if you can call them that were thick and gummy. Nothing special at all here- I've had way better brunches in the area. Blah!
