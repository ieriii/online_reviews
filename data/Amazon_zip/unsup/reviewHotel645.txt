I've never actually stayed in this hotel. However, I stayed at a Doubletree before in Austin, and really liked their cookies. So when I see a Doubletree in the Chi i decide to ask if I could get some cookies, and they were super nice. They gave us one for each of us (3) no charge. So 5 stars for that cuz those cookies are fucking incredible.
