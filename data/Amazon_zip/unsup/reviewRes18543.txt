Went here on a Wednesday night with my boo a little after nine and we had a perfect time. The place was busy but not too busy we couldn't grab a table right away. If you're a beer lover you will love this place. They have an extensive variety of draft beers available and an even larger menu of bottled beers I never got around to looking at. Fantastic burgers. I appreciated that not only did this place make a good burger, but they had great burger buns. I hate places that serve you a ten pound burger in between two croutons like any human can pick that up. These guys put together a very good burger that I could still eat with my hands. Very happy. They also have several varieties of seasoned fries available so no complaints there. All the people complaining about the ketchup here need to start eating with grown ups more often. Yes it's true, Bad Apple makes their own ketchup, and they seriously need to consider abandoning that practice. Their homemade ketchup is a sad thing, tasting like someone added a cup of water to Heinz 57. If I owned this joint I would change the ketchup. It's embarrassing to do everything so perfectly and then fail on something so simple. That said, it's just ketchup! Unless you're 5, you should not let people's complaints about ketchup deter you from checking out Bad Apple. You will be glad you did.
