YUMMY!! Great food prices, great food! We came here on a friend's recommendation with no expectations and were very impressed. Bacon fat popcorn was tasty. Polenta fries-good. My entree, Pork Belly with Fried Egg--awesome! I ordered it because it sounded interesting and found that it was not only very tasty, but also very unique. I can't say it tastes like something else I've had. The garlic aioli I think is the key. Dessert was also awesome! Mint ice cream sandwiches really had mint in it--reminded me of a gourmet ice cream truck I sampled in LA. As for beer, my husband fell in love with Anti-hero. He said, "It could not have been more fresh, the bitterness was perfectly crisp" (He likes hoppy beer, btw). As for ambiance, this is a pretty noisy bar, but funnily enough, we in our booth were able to hear each other just fine.  Not a health food place, but definitely a great treat!
