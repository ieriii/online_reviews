The food is pretty good, I'll have to admit, but the servers are mediocre and inattentive. Double check your bill, as ours had errors. It's always crowded, and that means it's always loud. And I don't mean loud as in there's an exciting buzz in the air. On a weekend night, I'm talking shouting-across-the-table-like-you're-in-a-hurricane loud. So the best advice if you really want to eat Mia Francesca's food is really just to get your food to go.
