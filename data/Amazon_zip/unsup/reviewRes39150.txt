Oh SSGS. I want to love you, I really do. Your bountiful banchan is what keeps me coming back despite your poor service. I have no problems with the busboys and the guys who change out the grill....they're great. No problem there. But the ladies. Oh the ladies. Why are you so impatient with us? Is it because we're not Korean? Are we not cooking the meats properly? Do you want us to eat all the little dishes, even the ones we don't particularly like? PLEASE I implore you! Let us know what we have to do so that when you see us it will be like a happy friendly reunion filled with good food and good times. Ok so maybe it can't play out like that but I would like to go there just once and not feel like I was forcing them to feed me and the sooner I left the better. Please?
