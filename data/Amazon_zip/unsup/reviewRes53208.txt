Came with a large group. Points to the establishment for being able to seat the 20 or so of us. Service could have been a bit more coordinated as one-third of the table was waiting for apps while the other two-thirds were on their on main course. Outside seating worked out well given the nice summer weather - not too warm and the night was pleasant enough, with a gentle breeze helping cool everyone. Though I did not try it, positive comments on the mojito mix - paired well with those who brought their own rum. Sangria mix was so-so though, again, I did not try it. I guess it depends on what wines were used, though the non-alcoholic version seemed a bit sweet. Overall, positive comments on the Ropa Viejo and the assorted empanadas. One person that had tried the masas de puerco thought it was okay, though apparently on a prior occasion it was better. So overall, safe to say consistency seems to be an issue here, though not surprising given the general price point. Would definitely come here in spring and fall as the outdoor seating was nice and with weather on your side, can make for a great evening out.
