It's a bar in Anderson that has alot of beer. It's good if that's your thing. My friend likes the selection of Belgium ales. Me? I'm more of a wine/whiskey person. I say $11-30 a person because you'll end up buying at least two pints/glasses of something. They let you sample stuff if you're not sure you'll like it (probably as long as it's on tap)
