Garcia's used to be pretty decent. What happened? I used to come by w/ friends all the time, back when they were a hole in the wall. Service was alright, food was not the greatest but at least it was decent Mexican food. Came back maybe a couple of months ago - service was just awful. Waited forever and a day for a server to take our order. Also add another forever and a day to get their attention to get the bill, and then to get the bill + credit card. I was pretty incredulous. Food was so-so. I've had better Mexican food in Chicago, i.e. De Pasada by UIC, Las Pinatas at Old Town, etc.  Sorry Garcia's. You were great... but I don't think i'll be coming back anytime soon.
