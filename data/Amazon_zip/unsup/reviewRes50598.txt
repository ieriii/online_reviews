Back in the day, Wishbone had a special place in my heart for their grilled chicken breast with sauteed spinach on the side. I went back recently and ventured into veggie burger territory. It was okay, but heavier on the grains than veggies - I usually prefer the reverse. I opted for a kaiser roll (instead of "black bread") and, welp, it was a kaiser roll. When it came to choose a side, I had a flashback to The Glenn's Dinner Experience of '10: no fries. There were other potato options, but homegirl wants a straight-up fry with her verger.  Because I was denying myself (or rather, was being denied) fries, I subbed a piece of cornbread with butter. I'm glad I did - it was sweet and, brace yourself, moist. My companion, Melanie S. of the youthful metabolism, ordered the fried chicken and mac n' cheese. It occurred to me upon seeing her meal, that I had asked Wishbone to golf with a volleyball, whereas Melanie S. knew how to let them hit a homer.    The service and atmosphere were nice indeed - we were seated right away and scored a primo table outside. Our server was friendly and helpful except when I asked about the difference between the regular vegetable platter and the "fiesta vegetable platter" on the specials menu. He replied that the difference was "the fiesta." I have a high tolerance for smartassery, but I still didn't get a good answer.  Overall, good, not great.
