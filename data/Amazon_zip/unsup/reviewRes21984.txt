Mission Impossible: to find a restaurant in the city that has great food, is hip enough for out of town guests, that doesn't require reservations on a Saturday night, AND is kid-friendly?! Greek Islands was IT, and IT totally delivered. Greeks know food, and they know family, and what seemed like a whole hustling team of servers managed to bring us great food while keeping our wayward toddler in the safety zone.  The calamari and saganaki (flaming cheese) were delicious, and the stuffed tomato and various fish dishes were robust with flavor. You can't go wrong with any dish. Calling it authentic Greek would be an underestimation - I've been to Greece several times and I think the food here is better.
