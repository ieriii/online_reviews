My wife and I have been frequenting this place since we moved to Chicago four years ago. The margaritas are amazing (and half price Tue/Thurs), the food can't be beat, and the staff is as friendly as they come.  The margaritas some cheap on tue/thurs at $4 a piece or $16 for a pitcher. Not only are they cheap but they are good too and get the job done. We always go classic with lime on the rocks but they have many other flavors if you like to mix it up. Also, the staff always makes you feel more than welcome in this place. Every time we walk in we feel like old friends who have been gone for too long. We take every who comes to visit us to this place and no one has left disappointed.
