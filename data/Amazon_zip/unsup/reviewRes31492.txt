Wow! What a treasure! I went with a friend (friend of the chef, Guy Meikle) and was treated to taste bud pleasures of every imaginable delight. First of all, the food was an exciting adventure of which my palate has not experienced in a long time and I thank Guy for treating us to several options that night. The mixologist (who I bow to) made the most amazing drink that night (part of their 365 menu) of which I will remember forever. Could not recommend the restaurant highly enough. Go out of your way to try this out!
