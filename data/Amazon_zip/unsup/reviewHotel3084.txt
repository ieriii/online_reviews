A friend and I ended up here last weekend. It was my first stay at a W hotel, and I will probably try them again at some point in my life. It was a lot of fun to have a nice bar, with a great view, in the building. We never really made it back here in time on Friday or Saturday night to check out the scene, but I hear it has lost its "it" status. Our room was great, we had a nice view of the lake. I'd say if you can get this for a decent rate, go for it.
