The food is great and reasonably priced and the drinks are too. Service is passable...not amazing.  Its all about the food. Some of the best chips and salsa!  If you order fajitas you'll get more than enough food for two so I suggest ordering extra round of corn tortillas.  My girlfriend and I never get tired of this place. They are open late so when we come home late after some drinks we get fat here.
