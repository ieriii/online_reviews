Le colonial is one of those places that makes me happy anytime l think of my previous experiences there.The atmosphere is absolutely fantastic, lovely decor,excellent food, service is truly outstanding.l always have a great time here from start to finish.My Husband and l regretted dining at Joes seafood for our wedding anniversary and wished we had dined at Le colonial since we already know what great service they give.l'd give this place 5 stars anytime!
