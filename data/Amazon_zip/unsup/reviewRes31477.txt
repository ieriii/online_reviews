During my life I've experinced numerous bouts of hysterical vegetarianism and have had friends that decide to quit meat cold-turkey. Given a friend's recent conversion to veg and my bf's continually claiming that he is veg (even though he eats meat) I decided to bring us here.  I don't want to write about my previous experience there because it was horrid and would need negative stars or some equivalent.  Thursday's meal involved potato skins, reubens and a generic beef sandwich. ALL OF IT WAS BLAND. The mac and cheese was pretty awful and so were the potato skins. Given the existence of Handlebar and others, why anyone would choose to come here is beyond my scientist-brain's comprehension.
