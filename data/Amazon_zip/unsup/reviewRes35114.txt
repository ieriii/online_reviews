I only give 5 stars to the restaurants that actually deserve them! I have been going to Shaw's for over 10 years now. Love sitting in the oyster bar and have always had a wonderful time. The oysters are delicious and the clam chowder is also a must! Yes, it's a little pricey, but worth the experience. I wish that Arturo was still working at this location, rumor has it he is now working at a suburb location.
