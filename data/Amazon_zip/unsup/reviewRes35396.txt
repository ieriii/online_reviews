The gold standard for seafood downtown. This place absolutely puts Riva and Joe's to shame. Even if you are not big on seafood, you will be satisfied after your meal. The menu has a breadth of options at almost any price point, though it's going to add up and be pricey. Certainly not a place you go regularly, but that's why I like it. The lobster bisque soup is to-die-for, and I usually go for the crab cake burgers. I've had good luck with their halibut and tuna as well. If you're into oysters, be sure to stop in for happy hour. And even if you're not, the place fills up by 5:30 with a business crowd. Bar service is decent and they're using expensive liquors. Tap beer isn't bad but you'll pay for it. I like Shaw's and I've never found someone who didn't.
