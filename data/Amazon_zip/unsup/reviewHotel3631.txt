3.7 really. The hotel is pretty and luxurious, but... For a hotel that charges as much as it does, I'm amazed at the way the Drake nickels and dimes their guests for everything! My parents stayed here while I was finishing my MA, and while the place is beautiful, seeing my dad have to constantly open his wallet made me feel generally underwhelmed about the whole place.
