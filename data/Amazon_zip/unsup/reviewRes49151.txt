My husband and I both travel weekly for work and dine out at a plethora of restaurants in metropolitan cities throughout the world. We still talk about the pork chop entree we were so fortunate to stumble across at Bin 36. It was absolutely divine! We live in Denver and cannot wait to make our next trip back to the Windy City so we can visit this place again! They had a great "by the glass" wine list and the ambiance was spot on. The cheese list was also amazing and I loved that there was basically a small wine shop near the entrance.
