In town for work, I searched out restaurants near my hotel and found The Purple Pig. It's always a bit awkward to eat in public by oneself, but I had a nice time sitting at the bar - the bartenders were super nice, as were the folks sitting around me. I had a delicious rock shrimp appetizer -- very simple and refreshing -- and waygu sirloin tips with asparagus for an entree. Both were reasonably priced, decent-sized portions. I also had a delicious glass of wine ("Fidelis"). Overall a very positive experience! Will definitely be back next time I'm in town.
