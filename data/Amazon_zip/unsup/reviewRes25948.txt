I'm not a major fan of chain restaurants but I do love the Melting Pot and was hoping to find a non-chain alternative. I think the best thing about this place is the cozy-dim-lit basement-curled-up-next-to-the-fireplace ambience. We didn't have great service and actually I found the fondue to be just average. Not sure if I would go back, I hate to say it but I might actually prefer Melting Pot :(
