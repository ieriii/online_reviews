Dare I say i found a gem, hidden on the dirty Cly...yes. Came to waste time as my cat was getting her blood work and ultrasound done...so I had an hour. The cat's kidneys were a tad small, adrenals need some help, spleen is large, she has anemia which they still aren't sure if why...But yeah the Cuban place. No complaints, i like the small size, kinda old school. This is the kinda place Ricky Ricardo would take Lucy to after swinging to his the sounds of his band all night, and lil Ricky...back to food. I drank two shakes which were great, cured my hangover...And had the lunch special. Prices were competitive...15 dollars for me...ten's about average after taxes etc. I would go back and back and back
