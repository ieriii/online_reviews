My boyfriend and I went to L&E right after work on a Monday night and were seated immediately. The interior was warm and nostalgic and we were promptly greeted by our server. We were impressed with everything we ordered and appreciated the input of our server when we asked q's about the menu. I was also impressed with the amount of food coming out of such a tiny kitchen. It's true, the portions are on the small side, but I usually find that my eyes are bigger than my stomach. I don't like leaving a restaurant uncomfortably full...I do like leaving feeling like I tried something new and it was amazing. :)
