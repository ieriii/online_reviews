I was in the neighborhood and also wanted to try them, so I did. Oh boy, I wish I didn't. I got 4 French macarons and 1 vanilla cupcake. And all came to be $8. The cupcake was absolutely just gross. Buttercream had strong corn starchy taste. The cake part was what made me gag. So dry, so stale, so eck. My French macarons were such a disappointment. I love these guys, almost to an obsession. The cookie part was too dry, and didn't have THEE essential chewy-ness that these wonderful cookies are suppose to have. Buttercream center was "alright". It's cute in appearence, but looks alittle rundown and alittle dirty. I am not coming back to you, sorry babes. I have better at Jewels, bitches. That's pretty gross....
