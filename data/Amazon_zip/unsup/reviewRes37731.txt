I really like the concept of Fox & Obel, but I do think it is a little too pricey. The food in their deli is very tasty, but seems to be priced a $1-4 dollars more than it should be. I don't think they have as many enticing vegetarian options in their deli as they should. As for the groceries, they are definitely priced at a premium. Like I said, love the idea, but I think you'll actually spend less at a Whole Foods! And you'll get more variety. I guess the bottom line is I would prefer Whole Foods over Fox & Obel.
