This is what I imagine the food on Top Chef tastes like - full flavored with surprising little elements that make your taste buds go, "damn, that's good!" For starters, my friend and I each had the corn soup and shared a simple salad. The corn soup is ladled into your bowl right at your table, with a nice, salty strip of bacon sitting in the bottom of the bowl. We each ordered an entree, but told the waiter we were going to share so the kitchen was kind enough to bring them out already divided on two separate plates. We chose the risotto with seasonal vegetables (eggplant, squash, green beans) and striped bass. Both were simply sublime. Despite being stuffed to the gills we forged ahead and shared the chocolate churros with dark and milk chocolate dipping sauces, served alongside a chocolate mousse. The entire meal was flawless from start to finish. Good food paired with great service and a chic ambiance - it doesn't get any better.
