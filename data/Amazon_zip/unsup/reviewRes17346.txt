3.5 stars more like it i've eaten at this place twice now and never have I eaten in the main seating area. I've always opted to sit in the lounge area. MUCH easier, never need a reservation. I do plan on sitting in the main area, one of these days. I've heard so much about this place so I had high expectations. Most of the food was pretty good. I like the whole small portions idea, everyone gets a little bit of everything. What I was displeased with was the drink I ordered. I ordered a very simple drink, dirty martini on the rocks, extra dirty. I sent it back twice because all I could taste was vodka. My girlfriend ordered a drink from their drink list and that turned out pretty good. Overall, I was satisfied with the two times I've been there. I'm still not sure what all the hype is about tho...
