90 miles is a shack. It has limited window seating that offers a dismal view of a sparsely populated slab of Clyborn. You half expect to see yuccas rolling down the street. And thus, it perfectly embodies that unexpected gem that makes Chicago endearing. Went for lunch, and the sandwiches are wet, messy and soulful. The ropa vieja overflowed with tender, soothing beef in a satisfying creole sauce. It should be eaten to the brass sounds of a smooth baritone, may bring the ghettoblaster next time to facilitate this. The ratio of meat to bread is tactful and appropriate, which is of utmost importance. Indulge in the sides- even if it means sacrificing laundry quarters- especially the yucca frita and plantain chips (mariquitas).
