We visited Lao Sze Chuan for the second time this weekend. The first time we went, we had pretty disappointing beef noodles and salt and pepper squid. This time round, we went to try their hot pot - our friend recommended it and we thought this place was worth a second shot. It's $17.50 per person, you get two soup bases (we chose one spicy and one mild), and it comes with beef, seafood (some fish and prawns) and veggies. We were disappointed again! The soups were more salt than anything else, and the seafood hadn't been fresh since 2007. It was definitely quantity over quality, and we left feeling dissatisfied and poor. Why do you disappoint so much Chinatown?!
