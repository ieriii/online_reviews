I'm from SoCal... if you ask a Chicagoan - what's your favorite pizza place - guess what? You'll get a different answer! I've been to this place about 10 years ago - brought here by my Chicago friend cuz I had to try "Chicago Style pizza"... and this visit - my other Chicago friend brought me here...so I'm thinking that's pretty good - two random Chicagoans voted for the same pizza place. :) We ordered the Gino's East Supreme - sausage, onion, green peppers minus the mushrooms (someone in our group didn't like the mushrooms). I thought it was pretty good - A LOT of cheese - man, these Chicagoans love their cheese - probably more than the Wisconsians! I'm used to the crispy flat bread style pizza or the greasy doughy deep dish.  I really liked the Corn meal crust - it was a a nice departure from what I'm used to. If I lived in Chicago - not sure if I would eat this all the time - its HORRIBLE for you.... like a month's worth of cheese intake! LOL! But, I would eat it again and its worth trying it for the dining experience.
