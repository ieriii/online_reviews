This meat-eating chick loves Chicago Diner. The menu is unique and flavorful, and it makes me feel good not to eat meat sometimes ;) This is definitely hardcore vegetarian fare- lots of meat substitutes like tofu and seitan. Think about the dishes as being *inspired* by meat, not trying to imitate it. The best things I've had are the tostadas and Dagwood sandwich, which has seitan prepared like corned beef, as well as fake bacon. The seaweed side is always a winner. The Grand Prize has to go to the peanut butter cup dessert. Oh my LORD is that delicious! The only downside is that there's often a wait, and sometimes slow service.
