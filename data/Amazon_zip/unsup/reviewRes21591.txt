Taking pot luck on scoring a table without reservations at Frontera Grill, we were told there was a 2 1/2 hour wait, and that reservations should be made two months in advance. Not wanting to get the Northwestern sophomore with us into any ruinous eating habits, such as the Tasting Menu at Topolobampo, we went down the block to XOCO to sample the same owner's take on cafeteria style Mexican 'Street Food'. Forget Tacos and Burritos (not on the menu anyhow). Start with some Tortas, Mexican heros. We shared the Choriqueso, with minced sausage, peppers and cheese. Delicious. And a Mushroom Torta, with goat cheese, black beans and arugula. It was OK, bur the Chorizo won that round. Main course were soupish dishes called Caldos. Best of the lot was the Carnitas, with plenty of tender tasty pork, as well as potato dumplings, spinach and avocado. Close to it was the Pork Belly Vermicelli, with mushrooms and zucchini. I'd order either or both again, but there are several other enticing caldos on the menu. Preceded everything with a side of Guacamole and Chips, and several Victoria Mexican beers, a real treat for me as it has not yet been introduced to New York. I'll be back next visit to Chicago, unless I know my schedule two months in advance, and can get into Frontera Grill. One question - how much do you tip the helpful wait staff, who really had nothing to do but take away your empty plates, and bring some extra hot sauce when requested?
