I have to agree with all of the other 900+ reviewers this place is awesome! You should be prepared to wait in line, sometimes for an hour or more but it is well worth the wait... even in our Chicagoland winters. The range of hot dogs is staggering, concoctions that I would never dream of but that are super tasty. There is a good reason they were featured on Food Network a few times, they truly are a Chicago landmark and best of all they are right next to Eagle Insurance, if you grew up in northern Illinois in the 1980's you will appreciate that reference.
