Well what can I say! only 3 stars.......when so many others gave this place a 5. My main problem with coming here was the limited choices for a vegetarian. I ended up getting the Woodland Mushroom Torta, it really was not too bad, I would not say it was extraordinary, but it tasted good. It consisted of mushrooms, goat cheese, black beans, arugula and a spicy 3 chile salsa for dipping. I have heard the hot chocolate here is fantastic, so I think I may have to come back here sometime just to check that out! Overall this is a great place to come if you want a quick bite to eat and don't mind that there are limited choices if you are a vegetarian.
