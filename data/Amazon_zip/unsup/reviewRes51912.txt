Ah...Gino's East. My sole reason to visit the Windy City. Okay, Gino's East, explore Chicago, and see my cousin (in that order). I've always been a pizza girl. I love all pizza! Thin crust, thick crust, cheesy crust, pan fried, oven baked, $0.79 from the freezer or costco, pizza has been my life. Hence, Gino's East.  We walked from our Hotel in the morning to burn off any extra fat that we might've had. Gotta prepare, pizza is serious stuff! The door was average, looks like a pizza joint. We walked in, the decor was meh, feels like a pizza joint. Wait was 10 minutes. Don't get me wrong, we timed it JUST RIGHT. If you go at the wrong time, be prepared to line up outside the door and around the corner. You can ask those who came after us, the line was LONG.  We ordered two deep dish pizza: meaty legend and Gino's supreme. The meaty legend was better, but just by a tad. Once a bite was taken from that heavenly pizza, everything melted and faded away. It was definitely-a-must-have Chicago experience. still...drooling...*slurp*.
