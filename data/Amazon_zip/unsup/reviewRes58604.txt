I love this place. Consistently great food and an upbeat staff. Not sure what the guy meant about dead eyed , huffer waiter Okayy...yet he has been there several times?? Hmm sounds like he is giving bad vibes and the staff probably draws straws to wait on him and this waiter drew the shortest straw...I like the vibe and the waitstaff is always freindly and go out of their way....but that is just me...So this is a top choice for good prices and a fun place!!
