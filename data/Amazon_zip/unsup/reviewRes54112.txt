Bad Pozole. Maybe the chef or kitchen had a bad day. I've actually eaten their pozole before and I was pretty satisfied, but not this time. I'm sure even Rick Bayless himself would have been displeased with the way his own dish tasted or was presented that day. It's been a while since I had this dish and I've procrastinating to write this review, but what I remember the most about this dish was how salty it was and how the chicken pieces were presented. I'll explain the chicken part. Prior to this visit I've had the chicken pozole a few times and I remember the chicken being shredded and thus had a more appealing texture to it. This time however, the chicken was very chewy and instead of shredded pieces, there were sliced cubes of chicken resembling those found in a can of Cambell's soup. To be quite honest, it kind of grossed me out. The presentation, texture, and saltiness of the plate was definitely not up to the standards of a place like this. I didn't say anything to the manager because I rushed out due to another commitment, but I wished I had. Will I return? Maybe, but this time I may try something else.
