I've been eating from Calo's for as long as I can remember. My grandmother lived right over on Racher and Ashland so we frequently ordered from them. The food was always good although I usually either got pizza or pasta. Occasionaly I would get the chicken or ribs and I was never disapointed. I can't say much about thier interior remodelings as I've ever only been inside three times in my life. The first when I was six and the last two times were on Valentines Day last year and 6 months after that. The Valentines visit was amazing. We had a lovely table by the window and the candles on the table were wonderful. I was also very pleased with the service. If only other places could be as good with thier customer service. It's kind of a long trip for me to get to these days but I still enjoy going.
