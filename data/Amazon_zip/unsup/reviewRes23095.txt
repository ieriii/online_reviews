Saw this place on Hot Dog Paradise on the Travel channel. My boyfriend love tubular meat and I had the address down and made sure to check it out. It was one of the best hot dogs I've had. I'm not a total hot dog fan, but they won me over. The milk shake was good. You get the Chicago no peppers as they're spicy and tomato as it's pickled (I didn't know and made that mistake). Had it with everything else and it was good. The fries are decent. The milk shakes were to die for. Real fruit for the strawberry. On the last day my boyfriend and I ordered all three shakes and were stuffed. He's a big guy and if one hot dog and one milk shake fills him up, it's a good meal. We would have eaten there everyday, but we were in a food city and had to try other foods.
