Been going to the Lousy Shoe since i was a pup. Did my first work here. For the Triads. Not really. Service - C- = Mean surly waitresses who have been working here forever. Bus boys don't bring water until you ask them 2 times. Ambiance - C - Cramped. Never enough seats, even for Lunch time on a freaking Tuesday. Food - B = I used to think this place was the bees scrotum, but I have fallen out of love with Chinese food. Also, why is it whenever I try to order Chinese food on the phone they always ask me for Chinese food? Example- Me: Hello, is this Lao Sze Chuan? Can I place an order? Them: "Chinese food?" I reccomend: Dim Sum Cashew Chicken Lamb Curry Mongolian Hot Pot Steamed broccoli
