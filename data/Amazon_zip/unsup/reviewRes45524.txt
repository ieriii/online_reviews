First off, Wilde has possibly the most beautiful bar I've ever seen. My friend and I talk about it every time we go. The decor in here is lovely; the stained glass dome? Wow. And the library with the fireplace is awesome. You just don't see that at any bar. Excellent selection of imported beer. Drinks are well made, and bartenders are always friendly. Food is a little overpriced as it's hit or miss. But go for the bar. It's fantastic.
