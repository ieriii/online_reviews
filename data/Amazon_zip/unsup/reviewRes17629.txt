Whoa...this place is just damn cool and don't even think about trying to find it using your iphone. It ain't on there...It's the kind of place that really is enthusiastic about mixing drinks and taking pride in making sure your glass is never empty. All the drinks were a mighty $12 but you really do get what you pay for. Plus, the atmosphere is something out of a movie and feels like you're at a 1920's new orleans mansion party, minus the flappers and jazz, although they were blastin some funkadelic/snoop dogish tunes. I shall return...
