Love the thai/sushi option. The delivery is a plus as well and is actually how we found the place. The food itself is solid but nothing mindblowing. Have yet to eat in, only take out and delivery but we plan on going soon. Delivery is super quick and I never do sushi delivery but it has worked out so far with Indie. Keep up the good work!
