I took out-of-towners here about a month ago and we all had a blast. It was an experience! We chose the family style option from the menu as it allowed us to try several different items and none of us knew much about Greek food--which was delicious. We ended up sitting right outside the kitchen which we though at first would be a bummer, but it turned out it was a lot of fun. We got to be part of the hustle and bustle, and the chatter of the waiters was part of the ambiance. I'd go back more for the experience than for the food, although that was good too.
