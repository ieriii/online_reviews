alright, i went here for the first time this week with a few of my friends. this place isn't really trying to look cool or anything. it's just your average dim lit sports bar, with flat screen tvs and blackhawks jersey on the walls. what isn't so ordinary is their food selection. we ordered a half pepperoni/half mushroom, all bell pepper pizza. MMMMMM, wow! we also ordered the cheezy bread, which was 3.50, a great deal, if you ask me! if you have more than 4 people, you might want to order more than one, though. it's pretty small. the dough and crust were what is really memorable for me. it was soft AND crunchy. the zillions of pepperonis they packed onto my half of the pizza were super salty and not too greasy, like a lot of other pepperoni places. the waitresses were friendly and the total, for four people, came to $28 and a little change. i think place is a really great deal. i would say go here if you aren't looking to impress your date, or if you just want to grab a slice and a brew with your friends. i feel so mediocre about this place!!
