I was spoiled at this restaurant. We went on the Fourth of July so it wasn't too busy and we got very quick service from the servers. The salad bar and side items were very good, but I couldn't fully enjoy them as I concentrated on saving room for the entrees. Service and food quality was impeccable. Will definitely go back!
