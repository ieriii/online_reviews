I've been a patron of this fine business for many years now. I must admit that the pizza quality has been hit-or-miss lately, no doubt due to the increase in business requiring more speed in preparation. Also probably accounts for the somewhat slower delivery in the past year or two. These are the only reasons it didn't get 5 stars. But I tell you, when you get one that is up to their old standards, they hit it out of the freakin' park and no one even comes close. I don't know what it is, maybe the sauce, maybe the crust, but when they're on they're ON!
