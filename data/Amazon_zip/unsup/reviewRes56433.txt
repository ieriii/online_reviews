So I came by on saturday night. We had I think 10 of us all together. We came in for my friend's birthday. It was pretty busy but we had a table and the service was still great! I think it was just about everyone's birthday party that night. They were sweet as sugar. They brought our table Fried Bananas with some Strawberry ice cream with a candle in it for my friend. It was pretty just to look at! Imagine how it tasted. It was my first time there. I wasn't quite sure what to wear and whatnot. But as it turns out they're pretty casual and their customers veries from old, young and the inbetween. Niceeeeee. It's truly a great place. And they're by alot of bars. ohh yeaaa :)The fun part for me is always the BYOB. They supplied us with the glasses and ice buckets.The girls and I had such a great time and the food was incredible! We ordered soooo much we couldn't even finish all of it. The Sate Shrimp was soooo good that we had to order a second order of it. Yummmm. The Vegetarian Rolls were delightful. We had also ordered Curry Chicken, King Crab Pasta, Seafood Noodles, Bamboo Roasted Duck, 2 orders of Avocado Wontons, Eggrolls, and Summer Rolls. I can't remember what the other dishes were but everything was wonderful. I'd totally come back.Turns out, they deliver pretty much EVERYWHERE! I don't live around here so that's a given Brownie Points.
