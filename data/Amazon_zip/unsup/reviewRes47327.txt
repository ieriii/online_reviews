****Edit****** The food has gotten a lot better. I updated from a one star to a three. If the crowd and ambience was different I would rate a 5. *************** My first couple experiences with Lock Down were just by passing by. First there was the time I tried to turn on to the street that it is on and almost hit a bunch of "dude bro's" who were standing in the middle of Western. At first I had a problem with this, but now I think a bar that causes "dude bro's" to maybe get hit by cars might be a good thing. But then I decided to get some food from this local spot. After all, who wouldn't a bar that opens up down the street to be awesome. I called to place a to go order. First I got put on hold, held for 14 minutes, then got hung up on. I called three more times. No answer, so I decided to walk down. I mean maybe they were busy. I walk inside and was bombarded by questions about if I have ever been there and how I liked the spot. At least I wasn't being ignored, right? I heard that this place was supposed to be like Kuma's but they only had one burger with unique ingredients, so I figured I would just go ahead and get an old stand by. Beef, Cheese, BBQ sauce, and Bacon. A burger that should undeniably burst with flavor. Little did I know that the JAIL theme meant that they served bland, shitty food. NO FLAVOR AT ALL. I had to open it up to see if there was BBQ sauce. There did happen to be a watery substance the color of BBQ sauce, just didn't have the taste I guess. So no stars for the food. The concept of the bar? A jail themed bar that is a virtual venue. Now this could be cool. Live bands telecasted from wherever they are doing a show that night.....NOPE. Dvd's of a bunch of bands that I could watch on Paladia and save myself the headache you get from huffing D'bags cologne and Trixie's "gummybear" scented body slather. And a JAIL themed bar in an area where a lot of kids already get in trouble and go to prison? Really? What does the jail thing have to do with the concert thing? I mean maybe if they served food on prison trays but it was gourmet. Like Gourmet Sloppy Joes or something like that. But alas, Instead of a cool new place moving in we get watered down food, suburban trixies, thick necked d'bags, and the worst designed restaurant north of Orlando. I think I will pass next time. Get a real burger at Kuma's.
