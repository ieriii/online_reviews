Unfortunately, the poor service took away from any enjoyment we could have had with the dinner.  First, we asked for white rice, never got it.  Second, ordered 2 cokes - got one.  Bao for the duck showed up 10 minutes after the duck so we got to eat cold duck on bao, which makes it taste like you are eating shortening.  So not worth the $32.00 for the duck meal.
