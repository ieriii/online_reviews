This place is slick. I arrived Friday night after a long car ride and the lobby was lively with gorgeous young people dressed to impress. I felt really plain and out of place! However, the service was fine and the room (suite) was huge and decadent. The view was killer- I'll let my photo contribution do the talking. I had two problems with the room: 1) no coffeemaker/hot water pot (i like having hot water around) and 2) the showerhead (a rainbath like thing) was pretty weak. All in all great experience, though. The whole place had a very sophisticated, playful, and slightly naughty feel (the word cubes in the room were a great touch). What a lovely way to escape for a weekend.
