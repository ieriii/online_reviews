i'm from california, so i was feeling a bit doubtful about a seafood joint in the midwest. but a friend recommended shaw's so off we went. we went for lunch. i ordered the lobster roll (sandwich, not sushi), which was crammed full of lobster (a note to those who hate mayo - it's drenched in it) and totally delicious. my mom ordered the softshell crab entree, and my dad the seafood salad. YUM. my lobster seemed fresh, but my dad thought that the lobster in his salad had been previously frozen. however, we thoroughly enjoyed all three dishes. the service was great. after some confusion over the dessert prices, the waiter bought us dessert, which he absolutely did not need to do. nice. the raspberry and key lime pies are good choices for dessert. worth a splurge for seafood-hungry coastal dwellers.
