Spent a week here for a work conference and extended for a girls' trip for a couple days. Very convenient location. Shops, bars, restaurants are all within walking distance. Taxis came quickly. Service was friendly and helpful.  The rooms were decent; bathroooms were a little smaller than I would have liked (hey, I was sharing with another woman!).  The fact that they had a real, full-on Starbucks in the lobby was a HUGE plus. To me, nothing is worse than having to attend day after day of a grueling national sales meeting with bad coffee. Every day started off right here!!! A bar being in the center of the lobby meant you were never far away from a cocktail the second work was done, either.  I haven't stayed anywhere else in downtown Chicago so I don't have much to compare it to in the city but it was a great location at a decent price for a big city.
