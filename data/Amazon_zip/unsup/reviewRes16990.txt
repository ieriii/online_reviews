Let me start off by saying that you can never go by what people say until you actually have the experience yourself. This place is not only pretentious but completely over rated. Our party of seven waited 42 minutes to get in simply because seven people had to walk out in order for us to walk in since no one is allowed to stand. It was so dark in there we had to use the tea lights to read the menu . The door man" george " was rude and stuffed us in a booth way too small for our party after boasting how he had moved people to accomodate us. Apparently George cant count, we said SEVEN PEOPLE! So apparently the menu is based on the prohibition era so no they do not make white russians and no they dont have olives. Interesting since they are blasting COUTRY WESTERN music, I hadnt realized that music was big in the 30's. The drinks were not bad for a 12 dollar each drink but limited. I believe a lounge should be a laid back enviornment where you can actually here your friends talking and not have to yell over coutry music and have a set of rules to follow like grade school. I give this place max of two years before it ends up forgotten and nothing but just a bad memory. What a joke...... By the way the " home made" donuts had cocoa puffs on them, were those around in the 30's??????
