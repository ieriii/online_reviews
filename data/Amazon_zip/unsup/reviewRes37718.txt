This place is packed on weekends. Be prepared to wait. The wait is worth it, however. Tons of beers on tap and in bottles, including favorites of mine such as: Chimay Blue, Tripel Karmeliet, and Sam Smith's. But the food is also really good too. I especially love the mussels in white wine and garlic sauce, and the pomme frites are exceptionally good--probably the best french fries I've ever had. Insider tip: there's a smaller bar upstairs that's usually less crowded. The only downside is they only have one beer on tap (that changes regularly) and a smaller selection of bottles. But at least you get to sit down while waiting for your table.
