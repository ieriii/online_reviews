I think Pequod's has decent pizza but I don't enjoy it as much as everyone raves about it. The reason I give it 3 stars and not 4 is because I am not a fan of their crust because its really doughy. However, you still gotta go check it out for yourself even though this would probably be low on my list to grab some za.
