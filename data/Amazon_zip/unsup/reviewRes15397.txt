Calo serves pretty traditional italian dishes with a few more ambitious nightly specials. The thin (well done crust) pizza is the best of their pizza line-up. The bread (great focaccia among other things) before dinner beats any other restaurant (from downtown to suburbs), and is dropped on the table immediately by a profoundly well trained bus-staff (other restaurants should take their bus-staff on a field trip here to watch and learn). I honestly try to stick to the specials, otherwise favor the pastas, the cream sauces, funghis, scallops, or the carbonara, though lately discovered the skirt steak is real nice. So, it's about value; fresh bread on the table, and most dinners come with soup or salad, potato/starch, veggies, AND a side of pasta (spaghetti or mostaccioli, meat or mariner sauce). Dress the dinner salad with the house vinaigrette and crumbled blue cheese on top!
