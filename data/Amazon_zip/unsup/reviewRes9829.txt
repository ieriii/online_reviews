Piccolo Sogno, i can't believe I have never ventured your way before now! Went with my bf last night for date night and we had a wonderful experience. Sexy patio, delicious pasta and a happening atmosphere. Great for birthday celebrations, girls nights, or whatever your flavor might be. Downside, our waiter seemed totally preoccupied (the place at 9pm on a Thursday was packed) but made it up to us by offering up excellent wine selections, all reasonably priced. I will be back!!
