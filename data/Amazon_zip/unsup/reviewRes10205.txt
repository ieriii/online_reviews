The patio at this place is AMAZING! It's perfectly set so that even on a super hot day you don't feel the sun beating down on your face. This place has an extensive wine list which is always great. Service was a bit slow...and for the prices I guess I was expecting the food to be amazing. The presentation of the food is really great...but the portions are smaller than you'd expect. I tried the Ravioli and was really disappointed that I felt like I was tasting a stick of butter. The salad I had was a mix of chickpeas, tomatos, onions, cucumbers in a cabbage leaf...very cute and tasty, but not for 13 dollars. I won't rule this place out completely, it could be very cute for a date place and just wine, however dinner..probably not worth it.
