I finally went to Hopleaf after several years of hearing friends rave about the place. I'm really glad i finally made it there. The beer selection was superb and the food was excellent. Upon getting there I was really impressed with the decor and the feeling of the place. The beer selection was great and the bartenders were very helpful in selecting some of the great beers I had that night. It took about 45 minutes to get seated which was not too bad and it allowed my friend and I to have 2 of the beers on their draft list which were great. After being seated the first thing I had to order were the frites as I had seen a bunch of the folks in the bar ordering them and they looked yummy! Boy, were they ever and the mayo they served with it was excellent. I decided to order the Duck Reuben as it was the item that plenty of my friends had told me to try. It was delicious and I really enjoyed it. The duck was tender and juicy and the sauerkraut and cranberry spread really complemented the sandwich well. I would highly suggest it! Overall I feel 4 stars was good only because our service was not the best and at times we were waiting for either refills or the check for quite a while. I would highly suggest checking this place out!
