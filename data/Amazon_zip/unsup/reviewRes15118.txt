This is arguably the best date spot in the city if you ask me. It has an old time classy speak easy vibe to it with amazing one of a kind cocktails made by talented mixologists. The music, furniture, and lighting all play off one another well and create this kind of dreamy calmness that I wish more drinking spots had. Nothing is worse than not being able to communicate with the person across from you because of loud TV's (I'm looking at you State!) or loud music (also looking at you again State! I had a tobacco manhattan for $12 and didn't think I over spent a dime seeing as how my attentive waitress brought me the extra side-car of manhattan that they had accidentally made.
