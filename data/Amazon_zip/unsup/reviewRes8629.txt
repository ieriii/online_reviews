I came here a couple of weeks ago to pick up a Prosciutto e Rucola (pizza with Provola, Prosciutto di Parma, Arugula, Parmesan) and a classic Margherita "pizze." It was cold and snowy outside, bright and cheerful inside. And the staff is so friendly! I was offered a complimentary glass of wine while I waited for my order. Why, yes, I *would* like some prosecco while I wait for my pizza! What a nice touch.
