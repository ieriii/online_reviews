Overrated. A changeup of Korean tacos by serving up Korean burritos. I shared some wings and had a Seoul Sensation burrito ($8). The burrito had a bulgogi, rice, lettuce, tomatos, corn and onions in it. The stuffing was ok but the burrito shell wasn't very good. The entire restaurant concept is fine: Korean food in a fast food style setting with a menu geared for uninitiated patrons of Korean cuisine. The food just didn't work for me. The chicken wings were poor as korean wings go.  Perhaps I'm biased since the home-made wings I'm used to is sweeter, crispier, and juicier. Didn't try the fried chicken. The interior is clustered and a horrible mess when busy.
