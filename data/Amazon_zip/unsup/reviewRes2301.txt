omg i crave for this stuff at least twice a week! yes, it's a pain to wait in line for a hot dog. but this is no ordinary hot dog. this is hot doug. this man is a genius. it's so orderly, and the guy is so awesome! everything is just 5 stars for me! i had my first game meat [elk] for the first time, and it wasnt so bad! my favorite was actually spicy jamaican. had duck fat fries and it was delicious! oh man, if only california had this. i would be soooo happy. doug, would you come to california???
