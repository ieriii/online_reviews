In one word, underwhelming. The lobby looks great, but when we checked in we got bumped from a king to a double room, no biggie but not great. The room was OK, but little things like paint peeling in the bathroom, the bathroom door having seen better days, the phone next to the bed missing most of the buttons, a late night dessert taking about 45 minutes to arrive, a great view of an air-conditioning duct ... when you're paying a not inconsiderable amount for a room you want better than this.
