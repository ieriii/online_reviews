No, no, no...not fine dining! Not a great steakhouse. More like a glorified lonestar. Maybe your 50+ y/o dad would be impressed, but not me. I'm not the type that would order steak and eggs at dennys either...if you get what I mean. I want my steaks to be of the highest quality and then cooked perfectly. With so many options that can deliver those basic requirements. I think I will pass on the next visit to wildfire....Mashed potatoes or loaded baked potato as a side really?!
