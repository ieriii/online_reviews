I'm a fatalist. And, being a believer in the greater world order of things, this had to be my hundredth review. After all, in a few hours, I will be suffering from intense heart burn and a splitting chili-induced headache, and who knows if I'll ever recover enough to yelp again. But at least the meal that caused all this pain was worth it. Absolutely delicious Chinese food, at hard to beat prices. Service was quick, efficient, dare I say even bordering on polite. And the food, ah the food. Tony's chicken, sauteed szechuan string beans (addictive!!!) and that Ma Po Tofu. No other ma po tofu will ever measure up to this one, in taste or spice. I may not be a huge fan of Chinatown, but this is a place I'll gladly return to again and again. And again. And again...
