Everything is good here! I've been to wildfire many times now and have tried many different appetizers/entrees and now i'm always at a loss of what to order because I really love it all. Some of my favorites include the chopped salad, cocunut shrimp, steak, the halibut (which all my friends absolutely love), salmon, sweet potato side, and the sauteed mushrooms are awesome as well. It's impossible to leave room for dessert at wildfire, but they have amazing desserts if you can manage to leave just a bit of room. :)
