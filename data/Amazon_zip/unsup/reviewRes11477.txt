I am from the east coast and have a special love of New Haven pizza. This stuff comes pretty close...not 100% but the best non-new haven new haven pizza i've had in years. And that is not an easy feat.  I've had the pizza twice now. Once there and once as delivery. The delivery was not super hot but what do you expect when thin crust pizza travels?  In restaurant dining was a little crazy. We went on a Sunday night and the place was PACKED. Good beer selection, tons of flat screen TV's. A little more sports/beer bar than I like but the pizza was amazing.
