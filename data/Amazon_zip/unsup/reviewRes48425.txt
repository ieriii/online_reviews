BREAD! So wonderful, crusty, earthy, and delicious. All restaurants should serve free bread like the Publican. But the real reason for my update? Spicy pork rinds. Oh yes. One of the people I was dining with said it best about the pork rinds. "These things are so good they almost make me want to start watching football". I think that says it all. This place is simply fun if nothing else. I could eat here once a week and enjoy every trip. Whether it's munching on pork rinds, drinking great beer, or dining in the fun atmosphere. I love it here.
