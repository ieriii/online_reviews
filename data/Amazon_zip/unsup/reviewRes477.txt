I had been looking forward to my experience at Alinea for, well, as long as I had known it existed. It's is no secret that this place is just a tad expensive so this was probably a once in a lifetime experience for me. Let me just say this to anyone that is debating whether they should pay rent this month or go to Alinea. Go to Alinea. Let me say this again, forget the rent, fast for a month, do whatever it is that you need to do. Go to Alinea. Anyone that has any appreciation for this new and exciting form of food/art will love this place. Working in the kitchen of another world famous establishment just up the road I have had a lot of exposure to incredible food, but this was beyond belief. Chef Achatz's mastery of his craft is truly evident in every dish. His ability to stimulate the palate as well as the imagination is awe inspiring. A final few thoughts: -Go for the Tour menu. It is worth the extra cost. -If it is a special occasion make it known. Trust me. -If you can afford to do so, opt for the wine pairings. It makes the experience go from a 10 to a 15.
