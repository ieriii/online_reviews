This is my favorite take out Thai food. Complex flavors and great range of dishes. Worth the (sometimes) hour and a half it takes to get to my door. I would give them 5 starts, but the rice is just no good at all. Always over cooked and gummy. I throw down the extra $$ for fried rice if I am in a ricey mood.
