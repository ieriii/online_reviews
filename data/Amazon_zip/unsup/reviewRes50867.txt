I like the whole concept of Wishbone. It's a very fun, friendly atmosphere with generous portions and straightforward food. I ordered the Yankee Scrambled Eggs. The eggs were very fluffy, and the home fries ROCKED. I found the biscuit kind of dry and heavy...as my friend said, "KFC kicks Wishbone's ass on this one." Coffee was tasty and lots of refills. My friends shared the Southern Eggs Benedict, and while they enjoyed the concept, they were really glad they shared (and didn't even finish their half-portions!) So....if you want food that sticks to your ribs, this is the place. But maybe you might bring your own biscuits...
