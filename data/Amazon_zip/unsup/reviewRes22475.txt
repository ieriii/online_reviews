One of the images that I will remember from my childhood is that sexy loinclothed hotdog winking at his shy ladyfriend. The hotdogs here are great, not the best I've ever had, but they're pretty good. The strawberry milkshake, however, is the best I've ever had and will forever be the shake that other shakes are measured against. It's a bit pricey for hotdogs and fries, but I think the whole experience makes up for it.
