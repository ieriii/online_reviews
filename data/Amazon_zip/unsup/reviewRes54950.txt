I am addicted to brunch. Nothing tops off my weekend more than rolling out of bed, throwing some clothes on and entering a world of eggs and coffee. The truffle omelete is amazing, the service is great and I love the vibe of this unique intimate cafe. I have been all over this city searching out the best brunch spots and I feel like I am in on a secret with this find. No hour long wait, cold eggs or flagging down servers for a refill. Every detail from the coffee to the filet mignon benedict is top quality. I like the fact that you won't find salt and pepper on their tables because everything is perfectly seasoned. I love this place and the enthusiasm of the small staff for their new cafe will surely make you want to return.
