First of all-- great Sunday bartender / she was awesome and took great care of us.. Good specials as well-- $2 Domestic Bottles and some Avion Tequila for $5! The food on the other hand is way over priced and quality pretty low. Tried the "Best Wings in Chicago"? Um.. No-- huge high quality wings in terms of meat but the sauce was horrible! Watered down tasteless Blue Cheese to boot? All for like $15!!! Never again/ Nachos were horrible as well as I could barely find a chip or a piece of chicken under all that lettuce? These were $12? Huh? All in all a cool place with way overpriced food but great service! GTFJD
