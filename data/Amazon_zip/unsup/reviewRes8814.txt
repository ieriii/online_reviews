I went here with a few friends after hearing rave reviews about the place. We all ordered our own pizzas, and while everyone loved theirs, I just didn't enjoy mine. The crust was a little burned and the sauce just not quite to my liking. I almost felt bad; I wanted to love it as much they all did, but I felt it was very average. I am not opposed to trying it again, but it isn't on my short list.
