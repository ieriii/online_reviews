I came here with my family and I heard alot of good thing about this place. I think it lived up to the hype, the service was great we waited less than 5 minutes for a table. All the workers are very polite and the service was crazy. Its like I never had to wait for food the second you want more food just flip your card from red to green and servers come with all types of meat. The food was great and they had fried bananas which are one of my favorite foods, so that was a bonus for me. Overall very satisfied and I will definitly come back.
