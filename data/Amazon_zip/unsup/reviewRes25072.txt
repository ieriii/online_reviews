Pretty darn good! Gallo pinto with plantains for $5.50, and some empanadas at $2 each? Can't beat it! I wish I had gotten more gallo pinto, however - it was just a little scoop. I mean, beans and rice are not exactly pricey, I feel like they could have been a little more generous. My friend had chicken and rice, which seemed really expensive at $11 for what it was (just chicken and rice - nothing fancy). Will probably order again, even if just for the empanadas - they were delish!
