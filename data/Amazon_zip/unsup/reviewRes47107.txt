lets start with the good... +strong, tasty drinks +really sexxxy interior +open late weekends (2 a.m.) +sunshine salad was really good +home grown and the bad... +fairly overpriced, unless you split a dish +inattentive service +menu could be clearer for those with allergies our server might have just been having a bad night... he was kind of a spaz. i think he only came to the table twice the entire night.. to take our order (after waiting 15-20 minutes) and to drop off the check. i might be back just for drinks and an appetizer or salad (if i'm in the area) but the entrees were absolutely nothing to write home about. duck with risotto was ...not a risotto. it didn't contain arborio rice, or parm, and didn't even stick together. i can't eat barley so i was kind of bummed out when i got my meal and it wasn't rice.
