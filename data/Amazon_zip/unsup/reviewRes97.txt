This was an incredible experience; 5 stars from start to finish. The standouts for me were the Burn Morels, Lamb, Anjou Pear, Blueberry, Balloon, and White Chocolate. I could never do justice and describe the food so I'm just summarizing. My group and I each did the wine pairing, with one of us choosing the Reserve option. The latter option didn't seem to be worth the additional price. There were only 3 wines that were different. Besides that, there is nothing else to say about our time at Alinea other than that the entire time was decadent and unforgettable.
