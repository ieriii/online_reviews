Our party of three was seated at the long tables, set up through the large open space of The Publican. In addition, there are private booths along the sides. The long tables make for a very friendly and community environment and the chance to be very friendly with other parties seated on either side, offering visual ordering cues. The Publican promotes a "family style" of eating, ordering the rather large, ample and very tasty dishes to be shared on a mixed collection of small plates, very cool! For an appetizer, we chose the mussels, served with a baguette. Dinner was the half roasted chicken, fried potatoes with a side veggie of shredded brussel sprouts and cheese. Don't miss the waffle dessert! We got lucky with street parking but your can always valet your car. I have been raving to friends about our wonderful dinner at The Publican and I will be back for more!
