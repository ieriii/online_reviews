I so like this place! It reminds me of a place that I used to go to in Wheaton, Luong Loi. And that is a good thing.  The place is as authentic as an American could ever want. I think...There are no plooms of exhaust from mopeds or dirty sandals in the sink. Two things that come to mind when I think of a real authentic restaurant in Vietnam. No no. I like the pork shrimp pancake, a lot. I also like the pho, its not too weirdly spiced like some that I have had. The lemongrass chicken is delightful too. I want to go back all the time. The flavors are all so bright and inviting. Go Get!
