Best of the best. You want Italian in Chicago, you got it! I've had some pretty spectacular meals and moments in this place with great company. This is a place to eat, to make memories, to enjoy, and to return to time and time again. A guy I used to date introduced me to this gem, and if for nothing else, I'm so glad I dated him because I know about this restaurant now! ha! In turn, I have introduced this place to some other people, whom are equally thankful. It is that special of a place...I love love love going here. Take your family here, your parents, your best friend, your sweetheart, or your worst enemy. It's amazing. Weekends- YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED RESERVATIONS Weeknights- depends on what's going on, but if you dine later in the evening, you should be fine without reservations. I've never been here around lunchtime. Not sure about reservations then. All the appetizers are superb. The minestrone soup is outstanding. Spinach Gnocchi, Tri-colored chicken fettuccine, Chicken Vesuvio and Chicken Sabatino are all favorites. Great desserts, excellent Cappuccino. Not a fan of bananas, but their specialty is banana's foster....so if you like bananas, you should check that one out. So many great times here, and so many more to come...
