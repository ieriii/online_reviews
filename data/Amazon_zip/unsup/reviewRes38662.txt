Being an avid beer fan, Hopleaf is like an oasis in the chicago uptown area. The collection of drafts and Belgian specially, are something I have never seen anywhere else. My personal favorite over here is the Kwak beer which comes in a real fancy glass. My review is based on the drinks, food and the place in general: Drinks: As mentioned earlier, Hopleaf hosts a variety of beers from the standard drafts to craftily brewed belgian ales. There are the usual whiskeys and scotchs' as well, but this place is mostly a beer place. Apart from Kwak (which is a must-have), I would also recommend Ommengang. Food: The menu is pretty limited but thats understandable that the place is more about the beer than the food. However, whatever's on the menu is fairly well-made. I would recommend the Mussels and the duck. The place: The only thing that leaves a lot to desire is the space available. Typical wait-periods for a dinner table on weekends can be from 45 mins to 2.5 hrs! The place is easily crowded due to its small size. The ambiance is very old-euro style with even the staff looking very european for some reason. Overall, its a great place to hang out with friends if you're looking to spend a couple of hours drinking beers.
