To start from the beginning, our reservation of two was slowly and incrementally expanded to a reservation of four -- by our request -- without hesitation from the staff. And, after an afternoon of drinking and losing all ability to tell time, we were promptly seated after showing up for our ever-dynamic reservation over a half-an-hour early. After we were corraled into our seats (our table was a wooden pig-pen type dinning situation in which wooden gates kept us from wandering about), we were told that we were lucky enough to be here on a day when there was a fixed, two-brothers-brewing-co inspired menu and beer pairings. We were also apparently lucky enough to have chosen a day when our bill would ultimately surpass $100 per person, including the beer pairing and tip. The first dish was a cured ham. As I'm not an expert in all things fancy, I'll just hope someone else on yelp can better document the dish's title, it was explained to me that this was a pig only bred in a certain part of the world, and was thus, very, very fancy. It was a thinly cut slice of 'ham' from a type of 'pig' i'd never heard of before that was so delicious ... I started to question it's origin, and started to get worried about the 'real' reason they were locking us in gates and filling us with beer & food and emptying our wallets. But, the more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn't even care, this wouldn't be a bad way to go. The decor was both modern and rustic, minimilistic and quaint. Plus, eating family style on mis-matched antique china was an endearing touch. I would like to try it again soon, at a day when I'm not forced into a menu and a bill that might not have been up my alley, but you could easily tell that the menu and pairings were a long time in the making, and I wound up getting lucky ... in the end.
