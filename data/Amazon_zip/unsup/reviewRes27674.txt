Excellent food and pleasant atmosphere. My meal was absolutely delicious delicious. I tried a variety of items including both the Huevos Motulenos and Huevos Fronterizos as well as the Guacamole. I would recommend trying all of these! This restaurant is a great substitute for Topolobampo since its impossible to get a reservation there. I like the laid back casual vibe anyways. If I lived in Chicago this place would definitely be a regular for me!
