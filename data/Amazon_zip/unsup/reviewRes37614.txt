I don't know how I haven't reviewed The Hopleaf yet. It's a travesty. I used to trek up here from Lincoln Park for their beer selection and relaxed atmosphere. That's how much I like it. We usually sit in the front room. They have beers on tap that you can't get anywhere else in Chicago. It's kind of amazing. It does get crowded in the evening, which is why I love, Love, LOVE this place early on a week night. I can try their beers forever. I will even admit that when I moved to Andersonville, being 2 blocks from The Hopleaf was a major selling point. I want this to be my second home.
