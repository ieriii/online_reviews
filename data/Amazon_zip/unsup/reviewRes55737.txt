I have fallen in love with Sabatino's since day one. Everything is soooo good. Oysters Rockafeller are my fav and the Veal Boulinaise is where it's at. It's not on the menu, but if you enjoy a cheese/cream sauce and veal this is the dish for you. I look for excuses to go there, it's just done right from start to finish. Be prepared to sit and eat. Good food takes time and eating at Sabbey's is a process. Well worth every penny!
