My girlfriend got married here over the weekend. It was absolutely beautiful. Apparently, this Westin is one of the few places in the city that can accommodate a wedding of 350 guests. Every detail was well executed and the ballroom was exquisite. I spent the morning of the wedding day in the bridal suite. It is an older hotel and you can tell, but it still has fantastic views and luxurious amenities. They also have the very comfortable Westin beds! The stair way was beautifully decorated for photographs. Everyone at the hotel was awesome. As for the food, the salmon was dry, but my date's filet was very good. I'd definitely recommend the Westin for a large wedding!
