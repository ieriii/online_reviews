LOVE this place! I've been in Chicago two days and I've eaten here two times-- and I'll probably go back tomorrow. Delicious vegan food and awesome service are always a winning combination with me. Plus there's a bottle of Siracha on each table which means bonus points for awesomeness. Last night we started with the special recipe "wings" which were delicious. I can't say they reminded me of wings necessarily, but I think that's not a bad thing. The seitan basted in a buffalo-like sauce was spicy and tasty. Then I ordered the chick'n "bacon" ranch sandwich and it was also sinfully delicious. I think we live in a bacon-obsessed society, so it was fun to participate in the vegan version of bacon-mania. We also split a chocolate chip cookie dough vegan shake that was too delicious for words. I don't know how to describe it other than "the best shake of my life"... including dairy shakes.  Tonight we returned and tried the Majestic Burrito which was indeed majestic and HUGE. So glad we split this deliciousness. And we had to try another vegan shake, naturally. We had the chocolate peanut butter shake and it was goooooood. The chocolate chip cookie dough shake was still my favorite, but the chocolate peanut butter was still winning. We've also had really good service from the hosts and servers both times. I only wish I could transplant this gem to Phoenix! 5 deliciously awesome vegan stars for The Chicago Diner!
