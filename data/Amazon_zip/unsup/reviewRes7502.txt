I came across a coupon for this place in a local coupon book. My sister was in town visiting and we thought we would give it a try. The place offers a good amount of seating and a very cozy atmosphere. Our coupon was for an appetizer, two salads, two entrees, dessert, and a bottle of wine. We had the bruschetta as an appetizer and it was delicious! I had the lobster ravioli and my sister had the pumpkin and sage ravioli. Both were FANTASTIC! Service as great and I look forward to going back. I still continue to see this coupon in the local book so I am sure that I will be using it again. I definitely suggest to look for this as you get everything I mentioned for around $60. This is an amazing deal for a special night out.
