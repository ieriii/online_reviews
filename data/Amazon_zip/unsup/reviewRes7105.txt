Went here back in October for a date with my long-distance beau who was in town for once. Why have I not been back yet?! I had been looking for a delicious, romantic, really nice place that wouldn't completely break the bank, and I definitely found it. I really liked the atmosphere, although I was not expecting it at all. The place is very tiny and is totally packed with tables, but it's still adorable and candle-lit. Very romantic. Let me preface this review by saying we were a little tipsy by time we made it to dinner. And I had just slipped and fallen on my ass in the rain right before we walked in. So I was in a terrible and sloppy mood, but the food and atmosphere definitely made up for it. It was one of the more memorable Chicago dining experiences I've had in the past two years of living here. I got the pesto gnocchi (YUM!) and my guy got the pumpkin ravioli...sooo good. We had a reservation and fortunately didn't have to wait. It was a Saturday night, and the line was out the door. Yikes! I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you can. If not, be prepared to wait--although it's definitely worth it. Our waiter was hilarious. And so nice! I went to the restroom at one point and apparently while I was gone the waiter came back to ask my boyfriend how the food was. He replied, "Really -----ing good!" and the waiter was all like, "Right on, dude!" What an experience. Can't wait to come back!
