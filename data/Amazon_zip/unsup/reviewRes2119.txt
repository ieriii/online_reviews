woe was me when hot doug's closed up in roscoe village. where was i going to get my raquel welch with the obligatory side of fries and a corn dog for desert? then my ears perked up upon hearing swirling rumors of a reopening. and when it rang true, twas truly a joyous occasion. never ever leave us again hot doug's.
