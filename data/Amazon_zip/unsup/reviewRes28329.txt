I'm surprised by all of the positive reviews! Maybe next time (if there is going to be a next time) I'll try dining in versus delivery. One of my co-workers raves about this place. So one rainy, lazy night, I gave them a call. I ordered a normal cheese pizza with fresh garlic. I don't know if they thought I said extra onions or what, but geez! The entire pie tasted of onions! Well, onions and cardboard. Honestly, I think I've gotten better crusts from Domino's. I'll stick with Art of Pizza for now, thanks.
