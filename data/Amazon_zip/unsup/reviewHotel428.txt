Nothing to write home about, and could use some sprucing up, but clean and comfortable. To be fair, we were not here under the best of circumstances -- sleeping the day away after a missed connection at Union Station -- but the service was generally friendly, and it was more than sufficient for what we needed. Proximity to Chinatown means lots of interesting food choices, but no convenience stores nearby. Its proximity to the El is great for getting around Chicago, but not great if noise bothers you.
