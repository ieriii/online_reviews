Whoever this "doug" guy is needs a swift kick to the junk. I'm sorry, but quite clearly this sadist just loves making people wait......the service could so easily be improved.....like have someone walk down the line taking orders....having more hours.....having a separate to go window or line....or having an entertainer out there, even a juggler, or here's a really wild one doug, how about having more than one person taking orders?! There's just too many options-obviously, the man loves watching everyone stand there for two hours, because the only way you can transform a HOT DOG into something really rave worthy is by making people wait two hours to eat it. At that point, your brain simply MUST rationalize the commitment, and a HOT DOG becomes worth waiting two hours in line for....... I mean, I liked everything I had...foie gras dog was good, chicago dog was excellent, and the garlic clove dog was good too....duck fat fries were decent, but I've certainly had better fries elsewhere. I'm all for "slow food," and I can wait for food to be cooked fresh. But at the end of the day, you're eating a HOT DOG, from a man who loves to watch you all suffer and who could very VERY easily improve service. Sure, the line's there for a reason (because the food is good), but come on....if there wasn't a two hour wait, would the experience REALLY be all that memorable?! Somehow, this magician has transformed bad service into a feature of the restaurant....I guess it works for ed debevic's (but there you get your food in the first hour of waiting)..... Big props for the food, but you lose stars for the business model....if he's really so passionate about his food, you think he'd want to improve the overall dining experience for all of his loyal customers.....
