We went to Piccolo Sogno on a rainy Friday night and it was packed! Granted they seem to have more outdoor seating then indoor and it was cold (hello winter!) it still seemed busy for late Friday night (we have 9:30 reses). Everything we had, from the complimentary foccacia, to the aps and the entrees were delicious! You must try the prosciutto and baratta starter (melt in your mouth), the wood fired calamari and octopus, and the branzino (bass). YUM YUM YUM. Fab-u-lous. Its been a long time since I went to dinner and was blown away by everything I ate but Piccolo Sogno did just that! I've been dreaming about our meal since we went and cant wait to find an excuse to go again soon. It may be dangerous that I live down the street....
