In a city known for it's delicious pizza...it's hard to say any one place is THE BEST...but I feel confident saying Piece is one of the top 5 pizza joints in the city (which is saying a lot). It's both a good thing and a bad thing that I don't live within the delivery zones for Piece. When you dine-in, the service is consistently decent. The place is open and loud and busy, which to some might be annoying, but one of the reasons that makes Piece a fun place to be any night of the week. I was there this past weekend with a party of 13. I had serious doubts that they would actually take us seriously based on the amount of people shoving their way through the door...but just as they told us, we were seated and served within minutes of our arrival. And the pizza is just something you really need to try for yourself. My personal favorite is the white pizza with spinach and mushrooms.
