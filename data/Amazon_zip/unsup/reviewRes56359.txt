I don't give out 5 stars lightly - that fifth one usually has to get pried out my cold dead fingers - but I can't avoid it with this place. It is Simply It - a great place to get exotic food at reasonable prices. 6 of us went there on a Monday eve to celebrate my wife's birthday. If I mentioned which one there would be more cold dead fingers -- so I'll let it pass. Anyway - the family made the trek to Lincoln Ave for a reserved table for 6 at 7 - and it was ready and waiting for us - with a personal hello from the owner - and let's face it - who doesn't like a personal hello from the owner. Makes you feel important. They seated and watered us quickly, took our wine and had us wined up in a matter of moments as well -then the fun started. The menu is a treat just to read. Spring rolls, tempura, sticky rice cakes - we selected a few and they were all delicious. The calamari comes in a 1/2 pineapple - and the 15 yr old daughter who won't eat anything - actually ate it all. They get 5 stars just for that! Main courses consisted of clay pot catfish - excellent if you like catfish - not too bad if you just like Clay pots. We also had something wrapped in banana leaves - which gave it a taste that we couldn't identify - something like candy circus peanuts was suggested - it turned out it was banana flavor - duh! Meanwhile the wine kept flowing as the food kept coming - 6 of of us shared 4 appetizers and 5 entrees - and my poor son (literally - since he just moved in to the city) was able to take home a nice doggy bag for the dog he doesn't have. All of this at a price I usually pay for just my wife and I to celebrate at a fancy suburban restaurant with less food and overpriced wine. I have to mention the beautiful arrangement of pastries, fruit and raspberry sauce they provided to celebrate the birthday. It was a great end to a nice evening. The beauty is the menu is so vast we can back and do it again and try all new stuff. A recommended dining experience.
