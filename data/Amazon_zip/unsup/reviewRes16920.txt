I was told it's an old, renovated speakeasy. The entrance is hidden, and we were let in by a big black guy in a sharp suit--nice touch, Violet Hour. You walk through a dark corridor that winds and dips, through a few sets of curtains, and then the room is revealed. Everything about this place is thoughtful and sensible. It's well-occupied, but not loud. I think they control the amount of people inside. Lighting is dim, but not dark, and the decor is haute, but you don't feel out of place. The group spaces are wonderful. You're given adequate privacy, so you can easily carry long conversations without screaming, and the music is tasteful. Their offerings were more impressive than other speakeasies I've been to (in NYC). A wonderful variety of cocktails. I love single malts, and I went to town. Prices are actually reasonable, ranging from $12-18. Drinks in NYC speakeasies are $2-3 more. I don't know whether it was because of the place, or because of the fantastic company I was with, but I'll definitely want to stop here if I ever get to visit Chicago again.
