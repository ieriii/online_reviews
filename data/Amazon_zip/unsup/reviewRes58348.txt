This is definitely a bar that I would classify as hip and for the cool crowd. I went here with a bunch of my friends one Friday night and it was a great place to hang out. The bar is reasonably priced and has more selections of beer than I ever thought could exist. Some of the customers at Hopleaf were a little sketchy. That night I went was also one of the most bizzare nights of my life when a party of about 10 little people, all of whom were guys, kept hitting on all of the girls in the bar, occasionally attempting to grope. They were kicked out eventually but it was pretty disgusting for the time that it lasted. I think they all were drunk. Otherwise, a great place!
