My rating for Mayan Palace would actually be 3.5 stars. First of all, don't go to this place without first going to http://restaurant.com and picking up a coupon for Mayan Palace, it's not cheap. That being said, the food is good. Don't get me wrong. It's just that nothing blew me away. I had the Chicken Ranchero and thought that the rice and beans were pretty standard, and the Chicken was well cooked, very moist. Beyond that, there was nothing special, and there is nothing that sets this Mayan-themed restaurant apart from other resturants. However, props for a great waiter and his good pick out of a variety of beers.
