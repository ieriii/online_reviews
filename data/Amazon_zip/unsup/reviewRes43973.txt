This is the way to do brunch...no OTT hype, no insane waiting times, very low-key! The food was good - we had french toast and the smoked salmon bagel. Loved the atmosphere and friendly staff. Very nice mix of patrons too, looked like it had some regulars just enjoying their breakfast and morning newspaper.
