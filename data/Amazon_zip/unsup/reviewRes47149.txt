Love love love this addition to the 'hood. The wine list and mixed drinks are outstanding. Great infused vodkas. Outdoor seating, pleasant indoor seating with a fireplace by the bar. Never had an entree that was disappointing. Good community minded place-frequent sponsors of neighborhood events. Live music. GO
