Went last night and had a terrific experience, even with an hour + wait. They were really thinking when they built the waiting/cocktail area. It sure beats getting bumped into for an hour while crowding around a bar and interrupting those eating there to get the bartenders attention. On the contrary, we had an excellent cocktail waitress, Jess, who kept our beer glasses full and made the wait enjoyable. It also didn't hurt that the weather was finally nice, so they had the wall of windows open to the sidewalk which made it bright and breezy. I stuck to the Bottom Up Wit which I thoroughly enjoyed and my husband had the Cross of Gold and the Logan Pride and both were quite nice. For an appetizer we had the sweet potato cakes, which are served with a red pepper & curry puree. These were quite good. Very sweet, could have used a touch of salt, but very good none-the-less. My favorite of the night though was the pizza special, a Spring Pea & Bacon Pizza served with a pea puree as the sauce, fontina cheese, halved grape tomatoes and an organic fried egg on top. TO. DIE. FOR. If you like more meat on your pie, try the Smoke House Pizza with pulled pork, bacon, and smoked tomato sauce. This was our first visit, but it will not be our last. So nice to have a walkable option like this in the hood.
