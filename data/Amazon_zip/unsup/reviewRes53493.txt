Tru is among the Chicago elite in restaurants. Featuring glass staircases of caviar and other eclectic twists on nouveau cuisine. The menu is constantly changing and is dependent on seasonal availability of items. The decor is dramatic with dark rich black tones coupled with crisp white tablecloths and hints of blue accents. Tru is very adult oriented so not a family place but great for a small group or date for those who have a global palate.
