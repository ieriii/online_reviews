I find myself dreaming of their Reuben when I'm away. It really is that good. Tried it with both dairy and non-dairy cheese, and the non-dairy compliments it best. Wasn't crazy about the nachos I ordered on another visit (my chocolate chip cookie dough milkshake made up for that), but my date was a big fan of her sweet potato quesadilla, so I will be returning to try it. The prices make sense, and (while it is always crowded when I visit) I come prepared for the wait.
