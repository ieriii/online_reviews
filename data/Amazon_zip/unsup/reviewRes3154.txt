Think I've been dreaming about the Korean BBQ wings on a nightly basis... I've been back 3x since I've been there (roughly two weeks ago). Inexpensive, large portions and the second someone gets up the spot is cleaned immediately. The breading and sauce on the wings are too perfect! Will be back many more times, probably more than the gym can manage to keep up with.
