Purple Pig is definitely for foodies and for adventurous eaters. I ordered a bunch of safe items which were decent, but nothing to write home about. Most of the menu my husband and I were unfamiliar with so we did not venture too much. As people mentioned, it's community seating with a big wait. The food came out almost immediately and with the community seating, we felt rushed. The wait staff was very kind and helpful, but I couldn't help but feel rushed. Also, the location is a bit touristy. I don't think I will be going back.
