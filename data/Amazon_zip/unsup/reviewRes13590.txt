What a fun place! It is, however, very small so you will most likely have to wait for a bit before being seated, especially with a group over 4. But, it is definitely worth the wait. It's a diner AND fish place. You can either get diner-ish food such as breakfast, burgers, etc AND there is a full menu of nice fish options. We all ordered different fish options, and everyone was very pleased. I ordered the tuna steak which had a really delicious spicy hollandaise sauce. All fish come with red potatoes and asparagus so it's a pretty balanced, delicious meal. Oh, and did I mention that it is BYOB! There is a $5 corkage fee however. I can't wait to go back when it is nicer out to eat on their patio. Oh, and there is a sweet special on weekdays before 5:00 which I hope to try over the summer. I can't remember what it is, but I remember that it looked good and cheap.
