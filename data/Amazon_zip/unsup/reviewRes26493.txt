My friends and I visited Chicago from Austin last weekend. We chose Pequod's Pizzeria based on a local's enthusiastic recommendation. True to his assesment, the food was absolutely amazing, though one of my friends is a vegan and ordered a salad; her salad came toppped with pepparoni...something the menu didn't mention. The short, skinny waitress that waited on us didn't seem interested in sticking around to help our table, even though the place was not too busy for a Satuday lunch crowd. Overall, I would definitely recommend Pequad's to anyone, and would love to go back next time I'm in Chicago.
