I've now been to Publican for dinner and brunch and I can't say which I enjoy more. I was there for dinner over a year ago but I'm still dreaming about the pork belly. You can cut it with a spoon and it feels like it melts in your mouth. For a former vegetarian I really enjoy a meal of meat, and the Publican is the place to go. I had the scrapple for brunch, and my party shared the frites with a fried egg as well. Everything is simple, but unique and delicious. You don't have to dissect your food to figure out what it's comprised of, but it's also never anything you could easily make at home. They have unique brunch beverages and their coffee is delicious. And I absolutely love the booths with the barn doors! You can keep out the riff raff and really feel like you're in your own little restaurant. I can say if you're a vegetarian or only eat fish/chicken, this might not be the place for you. My fianc got the meatless omelet which looked tasty, but you definitely want to at least be able to sample all the porky deliciousness.
