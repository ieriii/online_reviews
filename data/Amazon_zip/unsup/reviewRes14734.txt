I've been meaning to write an update on Sabatinos since they were closed down for a few weeks due to a kitchen fire back in January. We've been in at least a dozen times since they reopened. The food FUCing rocks! What I love most about this place is their consistency. It is great food and it is comfort food. No matter how many times we try other restaurants to celebrate events, etc...we always agree by the end of the dinner that we should have eaten at Sabatinos instead. Thursday night, at the last minute, we decided to eat at Sabatinos to celebrate my husband's birthday early. We were greeted like old friends, and we scored the private booth. Food was absolutely to die for, we ordered our usuals, Oysters, Baked Clams, blue cheese dressing for our salads, Stracciatella soup, Shrimp Enzo, Veal Chop, and spaghetti with meat sauce. They brought out complimentary brushetta and a fruit plate alongside their bread and pizza bread. I was so stuffed that I only could eat 2 of my shrimp and packed the rest home! Make sure to order their profiteroles!
