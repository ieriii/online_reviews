Saw this restaurant reviewed on Check Please. This should have been a warning to me. This place did not live up to the hype. I didn't find the staff helpful or friendly. As for the food, it sucked. The soup had two small pieces of chicken and yellow water with vegetables with absolutely no favoring. The items in the so-called salad bar were not fresh or tasteful. Don't waste your time or money coming here.
