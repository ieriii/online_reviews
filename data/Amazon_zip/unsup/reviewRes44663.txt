On this visit, I was asked if I've ever rated a Giordano's less than 5 stars. The answer is no. Even though the pizza was light on sausage and mushroom, it was delicious, flaky, doughy, cheesy goodness. My stomach is growling for my last leftover slice right now, and it is 7:26am. Don't judge me. I had never been to this location before and anticipated it to be less crowded than the original or any other Chicago location, but I was wrong! There was a constant line and groups waiting outside on Friday night. And for good reason! Vote for Giordano's! You won't be disappointed. P.S. It's awesome that you can pre-order your pizza as you wait.
