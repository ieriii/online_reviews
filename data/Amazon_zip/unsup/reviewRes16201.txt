If you just got paid and are looking for some great Italian food - go to Calos. If you are broke down and don't know when you'll see a dollar again- don't go. The restaurant is dimly lit with candles on every table - very relaxing and yes, romantic. The menu and bar is extensive. Every pasta dish (and there were alot of them!) sounded extremely appealing - it took about 15 minutes for me to make a decision! In any event, I felt the food was over priced. Everything that I wanted to order was around $17.95 and up - and I feel that is just a bit high for some noodles and garlic sauce - maybe a shrimp or two thrown in there. I opted for a non-glamourous dish, which still ended up being around $15 and then you add the price of all that wine..... A good restaurant, good food, nice staff - I suppose I and my wallet just have some feelings of regret - the morning after.
