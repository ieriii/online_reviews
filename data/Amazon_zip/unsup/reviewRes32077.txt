Pros: *The food was better than any other place we've tried in the area thus far. Better than Addis Abeba (our regular joint), and Ethiopian Diamond. The quality of ingredients was higher, and you could taste it. I am already dreaming of eating there again soon. *Parking was a breeze. There is a big pay box parking lot on Lawrence East of Broadway that had ample space available and made parking in the area MUCH easier for us. Use it, but keep it shhhhh. *Bigger Bedele. The Ethiopian beer called "Bedele" is my FAVORITE beer ever, not just at Ethiopian restaurants- ever. Its sweet hazy honey-copper body, grassy hop, and sweet malt flavor pairs well with moderately spiced east african dishes. They offer a larger size here, which I liked. Cons: *Stanley Tucci clone/ restaurant manager guy was super hyper to an annoying level- ran around frazzled all over the place all night- almost ran into me while we were being seated- by HIM- sort of freaked us out.  * The bathroom sinks had no working hot water, and in January, in Chicago- that equals an icy-cold and unpleasant hand washing experience. If you are required to eat with your hands and will need to wash up afterwards, hot water might not be too bad for business.  *Service was a bit slow, but very pleasant and sunny. We will be back!
