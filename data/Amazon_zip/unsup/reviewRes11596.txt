Best place for super thin new haven style pizza. Wait times can be long during games or later in the evening. Staff is always friendly and helpful and their beers are great. Usually I don't repeat on restaurants since there are so many I want to try, but Piece gets the unique distinction of being my only repeat. Definately make sure to try the goat cheese and pizza sauce appetizer and the red pizza with onions garlic goat cheese and it alien sausage. Awesome every time!
