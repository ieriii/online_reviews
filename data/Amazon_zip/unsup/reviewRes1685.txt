My Lordy, I still DREAM about Hot Doug's and wish I could transport myself there every day! Went to visit a friend in Chicago and knew I must go to Hot Doug's and only Hot Doug's for a Chicago dog. I'm an avid fan of Anthony Bourdain so I knew the situation upon arrival. When I told my friend I had to eat there she said "OMG that's the best dog in the city! How did YOU know about it?" Thank you, Mr Bourdain. Anyway, we waited in line for 2 hours on a Saturday like suckas but boy was it worth it! The inside of the place is amusing and entertaining [some wonderful quote about encased meats...] and it's fun chatting with the people in line and in the restaurant. Everyone is just, excited, to be there and you can feel it! My dogs (that's right, I got 2! I worked up an appetite in line!) were s.u.p.e.r.b. Think I just got the original but they had all kinds of cool variations to choose from. We also were crazy enough to go on a Saturday for the fois gras (duck fat) fries...pretty dang good as well, but I preferred the regular fries. I will be back any and every time I'm in Chicago.....natives of Chicago, I envy you, indeed.
