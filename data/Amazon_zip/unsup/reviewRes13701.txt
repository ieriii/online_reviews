This diner can improve better if they work on restoring better service and cleanliness. I have been here twice. First time, I thought it was cleaner than the second time, so my bet is the cleanliness fluctuates from time to time. Food wise, it is pretty much standard...nothing worth highlighting. Full bar is a joke though...most of their itemized drinks and beer are of limited by day basis.
