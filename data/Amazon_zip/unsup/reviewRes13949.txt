I've been here maybe 3 times and it is growing on me. It's a really nice looking restaurant and the inside is dark and cozy. The location is a bit far afield if you aren't familiar with Chicago but it's right in my neighborhood. Both times I've ordered a burger and it was amazing. I am a huge burger fan and they certainly met my needs. The fries are nothing spectacular but they pass muster. My friend got the duck pizza which was pretty good but tasted just the slightest bit strange. I wouldn't throw it out of bed.  They brew their own beers there,too. Obviously. I don't remember what beer I had, I'm not that into micro brews, but I did recall that I didn't have any issue with it.  Overall the menu is unique but not so unique as to join the ranks of frou-frou silliness that crops up on menus lately. It's still hearty, delicious, comfort food and I'd go there for a good burger anytime.
