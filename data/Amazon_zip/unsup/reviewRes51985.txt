I cannot believe people actually directed me to Gino's. What? I don't know what it is that I put in my mouth but I never want to put it in there again! The crust was SO dry and crumbly, and although I asked for a plain cheese pizza, they managed to pile on about 5 layers of pepperoni. Great. Just what I asked for. Service was fine, and there was ample seating but thank God I ordered a side salad. Or else I would have gone hungry. There must be better deep dish in this city... Stay tuned...
