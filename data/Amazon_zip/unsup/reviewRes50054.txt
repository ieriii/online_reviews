I came here for NYE, so I can't really comment on the typical crowd that comes here, but I feel most of the other reviews are right on when they say it's an upscale sports bar with more of a Lincoln Park feel to it. It does seem a little out of place for Wicker Park, but the place is incredibly nice inside with 3 different floors and plenty of space. My only complaint was that they didn't have vanilla vodka. Bummer. But vodka/sprites got the job done just as well. The bartenders and staff in general were all extremely nice. Will definitely need to check it out again soon.
