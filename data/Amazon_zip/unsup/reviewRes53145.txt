The staff is very friendly including the owner, making you feel like a guest in their own home. The Bistec is very flavorful, & delicious, this was a recommendation by our waiter. The Empanadas are yummy, and the Rice pudding for dessert, so sweet, kind of reminds me of a an Orchata, but eatable! I will definitely be back again and recommend to others.
