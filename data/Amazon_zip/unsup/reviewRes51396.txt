Everything about this lousy restaurant screams "We don't care". It started with an unfriendly, unsmiling hostess, and continued with a disinterested waitress.  The bland, soupy scoop of institutional guacamole reinforced the indifference, and the lame entree sealed the deal. I have nothing good to say about this meal. Never again.
