Wow, I have not put on a food beatdown like this since I inhaled five slices of pizza at Lombardi's. What can I say, this guy likes to eat. And I am not amused by amuse sized portions.  No worries here. Rick Bayless' Mexican street food spot serves up some hefty portions. Good thing they do because it certainly was not cheap. A Cuban sandwich, chips and salsa and limonada ran me close to twenty bones. Only for you reigning Top Chef Master. The food was superb and the Cuban was gooey goodness. I am also a huge fan of the green tomatillo salsa. There is no shortage of tempting choices and items take advantage of local suppliers and the ingredient quality is exceptional. Lunch is served after 11 and there was a line already forming Soup Nazi style. They serve breakfast here as well, and soups later in the day-too early no soup for you! Now if I could only figure out how to pull off the trifecta and gorge myself at all three of his fine restaurants in a single day. A guy can dream can't he?
