I had an amazing experience here yesterday for lunch. Got there slightly before 12 and was surprised not to find a long line. It was my first time, and there were many many choices, so I was glad that the waitress behind the register was happy to offer suggestions. I told her I wanted something with lots of cheese (it IS Mexican food, right?), and she suggested the Milanesa, which is one of the Tortas (read: hot Mexcian sandwich) on the griddle. I got it without jalapenos and it lived up to cheesy. Basically its a hot, wondeful, gooey, cheesy and slightly tangy chicken breast that has been breaded in pano and lightly fried. Served with a thin tomatillo sauce for dipping, this was a sandwich I couldn't resist. I wanted to stop eating it, but could not. I definitely recommend Xoco and look forward to trying other Tortas there!
