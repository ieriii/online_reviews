I don't know why I've only been to Le Colonial once... I probably crave/daydream about my food there a couple times a month... such yummy thoughts... Anyway, the restaurant is very pretty. I went there with one of my best girlfriends for dinner, but I think it would be a great for a date or for a formal-ish business lunch.  Here is a run-down of the (vegetarian) deliciousness I consumed: *Mango martini - delicious! And it came with chunks of mango in it :) *Goi Ngo Sen - HUGE delicious salad... I ordered this as an appetizer, but it could definitely have been my meal. I am not a fan of salad dressing, but the chili lime soy dressing was tasty and light! I ate the whole thing knowing I still had an entree coming my way :) *Tau Hu Cari - tofu, vegetables, and nuts in yellow coconut curry sauce. WOW. SOOO GOOD. I always think about this dish... and wish I was eating it again. I really need a Round 2 with Le Colonial. Soon.
