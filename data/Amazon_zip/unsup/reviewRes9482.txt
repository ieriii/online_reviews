Went here for brunch Sunday. Sooooo yummy! I tried the Curious Jorge. Let me tell you, there's nothing like waking up to a punch of tequila! It was creamy and coffee-y and topped with a caramelized banana. I'm glad I got it, but it won't become a habit. Started with the Lithuanian bacon buns and vanilla butter. Quite tasty. Here are our entrees in order of deliciousness: -**steak n eggs** - Golden Nugget, this is not. The steak is topped with crab and deep fried. I only had a bite, but I thought about it throughout the meal. This will be my order next time! -croque madame - I can't even describe the "bread", it was like a Parmesan bread wafer, with a rosemary flavor. Sooo good. The egg was not as runny as with most croque madames, but there was something about it that was really well seasoned. -biscuits and gravy - usually I think of a bowl of gray chunks, but this dish was very good. The sausage was very flavorful and the gravy was nice and rich. I'm loving the new tradition of breakfast "dessert". We ordered the waffle, which was different than the one on the menu. This one was a lemon poppyseed waffle topped with blueberries, figs, gelato and simple syrup with lemon tea and thyme. Delicious and not too heavy. It's definitely not something I could have handled as an entree though. One small gripe: we were the second group to arrive (with a reservation, naturally) and asked if we could sit in the beautiful atrium. They said they would take a look, then said unfortunately it was full. I looked at it again, literally only one party had checked in at that point. We were seated in the main room. I watched for the hour or so we were there and several of the tables remained unoccupied. It was frustrating that they were so rigid with their seating requests. If you go for brunch be sure to RESERVE the atrium, it looks fantastic. Dale came out and checked things out at the bar, but didn't come around to any tables. I will be back Mr. Levitski!
