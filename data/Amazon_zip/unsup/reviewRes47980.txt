**based on one visit** I've been eyeing this place since I arrived in Chicago, but just never went... and I'm kicking myself that I didn't go earlier. The space inside is modern rustic, just like the food. Most "tables" are seated at a huge community table. I know some people hate the community table, but at the Publican, the table turns every so often, creating a semblance of some privacy for your group. Our reservation was for 930pm, so I was starving. I wanted to order EVERYTHING on the menu. We settled on seven dishes for our party of three (well, it does say that the plates are to share, so...) and our waiter kindly pointed out that we wouldn't need more than 3-4 dishes. He was very helpful in helping us narrow down our choices. 1) Mussels with celery, garlic, and yummy broth. Served with very fresh, hot, crusty bread that is perfect for sopping up the deliciousness of the broth. (half order) 2) Fried clams with fried green tomatoes & arugula. How did they manage such crispy breading w/o making it greasy at all? 3) Farm chicken with summer sausage and frites. OMG this chicken was cooked perfectly. It was so tender and juicy. The sausage was smoky. The frites were crunchy and great to soak up the juiciness of the chicken. (half order. these are big chickens if that was a half). 4) Summer corn with lime, aioli, parmesan and magic. It comes in a tiny bowl, but it's really rich. I know. it's corn. But it's soooo good. We all ordered a drink (beer, beer, and cider) which were great choices to wash down all this delicious food. We were severely tempted by the dessert menu, but I would've had to change into pajama pants to eat another bite. I think Joey Tribbiani would tell you to wear your "meat pants" if you plan to come here!! Total was about 30pp before tip. I thought it was pretty reasonable for the top-notch quality and the amount of food at one of the more popular restaurants in Chicago.
