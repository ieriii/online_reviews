I have had better indian food. Although the service was good I did not enjoy my meal as much as I had hoped to.  Things I did like: Mango Freeze Dream, Mango Lassi, Pistachio Ice Cream & Garlic Naan. Not So much: Now, this is my second time trying India house for dinner (I also had their lunch buffet once) and I have to say I much rather have the butter chicken at Chicago Curry house because the Chicken pieces are smaller there so it absorbs the Makhani Sauce and flavor much more than the bigger chunks at India house. This is the same with the Chicken Masala. The chicken was dry in the center. However, I have no complaints about the sauces.  The samosas are big and they serve you two which is more than enough however they tasted bland. This is a good choice to order if you are not a fan of powerful indian spices, however I am a big fan of Indian Spices. The Samosas in my opinion did not have much spice or kick at all. again, chicago Curry house wins with the samosas..they are smaller (which i like) and much more flavorful. The naan dipping sauce here was good but i hate that it came to our dinner table chilled. I love it when its served Hot. If you are new to indian food and haven't developed a pallet to consume powerful spices, this might be the place for you. Also, you can try the chicken tikka which was what I started with the first time I tried Indian Food.
