You know when you have one of those meals that is so amazing that you think about it for days after? The food is blow-you-away amazing, service is great and the restaurant is unique and different. I haven't had one of those meals in a LONG time - until I came here on Saturday night! I would've loved to sit in the main dining room (maybe you have to reserve that?) but we were put in a dark back room. It ended up being nice but it was really loud. The boys loved the naked pictures of women on the wall. So I was a little disappointed about the sitting but I suppose someone has to sit there. Guacamole chunky yet creamy. Chips crunchy and fresh. Salmon ceviche refreshing and light. Frozen White Sangria was probably the best alcoholic drink I've ever had. Arrachera had a ton of complex flavors and the chimichurra sauce was to die for. We didn't have room for dessert. Next time!! $5 valet FTW!
