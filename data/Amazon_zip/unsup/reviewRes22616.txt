This is the place to experience Greek food in Chicago. While they do a great deal of tooting their own horn, so to speak, their food stands up to their boasting. I wouldn't call this place fancy- more family. It is busy everyday, but they do a good job getting people seated in a timely manner.  Now, please, dont just order the gyros plate or the combo plate. To truly experience Greek Islands you must try one of their lamb choices (colorado lamb - best in the world!). The meat is tender and juicy, and if you never liked lamb anywhere else, this stuff will change your mind. $18/ bottle of ice- cold roditis (greek rose wine) Service is hit and miss. I've had god service, and I've had horrible service. This place is super busy, so I can understand the inconsistent service. Oh well. Free valet.
