As mentioned in other previous reviews, Frontera Grill totally lived up to the hype in my book. I went a couple months ago for brunch, which I'm not much of a brunch fan and I still think of it to this day as an amazing meal. Simple plating but the flavors were not, they were complex, well thought out and just plain delicious! Oh and the drinks....make sure you order one! I had a blue agave margarita and it was so fresh and well mixed that I can still taste it. Wish I lived in Chicago so I could frequent here more often.
