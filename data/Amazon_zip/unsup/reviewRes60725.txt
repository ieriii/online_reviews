YELP REMOVED THE REVIEW BELOW FOR SOME PHANTOM REASON SO ILL SAY IT AGAIN. ....ok well totally bummed that i just wrote a fantastic review for Lockdown and it got lost in yelp waste land.So now it's a quicky note. I had a great experience here with my hubby. so much that we were back the next day for more of the same. the burgers are phenom and the room is a must see.  if you like burgers.... don't waste your time going to the "other place" go to Lockdown and get the ultra-burger experience.  I really wanted to add more to that review because a review on this place deserves detail. But I had already given the previous review that was mysteriously lost in yelp wasteland heavy detail and then there was no time to rewrite.  Let me underscore.... The burgers here are great!! The mac & cheese I got with my burger was cheesy and full of flavor. I built my own burger with pepper jack cheese, bacon and egg. It was plenty of food. My hubby had the Death Sentence which was a giant 20oz double burger.  Excellent!! It did take a while for our food to come out as our ticket got lost for a while but it was really not a big deal. They were very apologetic and it was worth the wait for definite. The atmosphere here is loud with great metal music and about 10 televisions that lined the walls with videos. The second night we were there Alice n Chains Unplugged was on all of the televisions. Free concert... cant beat that.  I love the way they go for it at Lockdown. They know what they're selling and doing and they do it really well. We will absolutely be returning.
