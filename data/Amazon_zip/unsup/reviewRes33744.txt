I just love this place. It is one of my favorities. It's small and exciting and the food is delicious. The portions are big and the prices are very reasonable. I always get great service too. They will customize dishes for you, which is great if you have certain dietary concerns or requests.  Obviously there's usually a wait, but it's worth it! Try it out!
