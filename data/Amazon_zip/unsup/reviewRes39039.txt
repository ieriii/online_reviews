Yes this as good as it gets. This is not a fancy downtown place with all kinds of different unique pastas, it is an exceptional italian and pizza place that has an easy atmosphere and a lot of food for your dollar. with your entree, veal, steak, chicken etc... you get soup and salad bar, pizza bread and warm bread, your entree and side pasta. I always walk out stuffed. The salad bar is one of the best and I order the pizza when I don't want to go out. A neighborhood jewel.
