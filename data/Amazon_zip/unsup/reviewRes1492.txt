I found out about this place from a friend and laughed at the name. It just sounded funny. Well, I don't laugh any more. These are, by far, my absolute favorite hot dogs besides Gene & Judes in River Grove. I dare you to try Hot Doug's. You'll never think of hot dogs again without also thinking of returning to Hot Doug's some day. They have great polish and italian sausage too.
