I dream of these tacos at least once a week. I've also recently begun to dream of the guacamole and the horchatas. Here's my suggestion on what you should order: 1. Get some guacamole with the free chips and salsa. 2. Order 3 tacos, onions and cilantro. 3. Wash it down with an horchata. 4. Enjoy the best tacos this side of Mexico.
