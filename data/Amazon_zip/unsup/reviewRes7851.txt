Meat, meat and more meat. Here's some sage advice to make your experience at Fogo worth the wait and price: 1. Make sure you're hungry--starved even. 2. Don't load up on the awesome salad bar. Trust me, it's tempting, but it'll catch up with you midway through your first meat serving. 3. Have a good chunk of time to spend at the restaurant. Enjoy the food, the atmosphere, and the long digestion ahead. 4. Try everything at least once. You may be surprised. Next time, I think I'll try it for lunch where it runs about $30 instead of $50 for dinner. Overall, this restaurant rocked.
