Just got back from a soft opening at Crisp, which is a fusion korean restaurant, and my oh my was it good! They were testing out their fried chicken. Two kinds BBQ and Spicy. I loved both. The crust on the chicken was nice and light...not overwhelming at all. The sauce on both types was very flavorful. The spicy isn't the type of spicy where you need to be concerned if you aren't into heat. It's more of a tingly flavor. Along with our fried chicken we also received ranch dressing, celery and....korean potato salad. Woo the potato salad was yummy and a nice accompaniment to the wings. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is set up for communal seating. There are about 3 big picnic style type tables that will seat about 8 people each and then counters that line the wall and window with stool seating. I actually like the communal seating set up. We sat across from this lady that was actually the sanitation inspector for the place that came to check out the food. She was pretty interesting and we shared tips on other restaurants to try out that served spicy foods. I'm very happy that this place is finally open. Granted I still will miss Rice Box but the owner assured me that there will be some items from the Rice Box menu that will show up on Crisp's. He said his goal is to make korean food more friendly to the masses that aren't quite used to korean cuisine. I can't wait to try out more of their menu. Look for a full opening later in the week.
