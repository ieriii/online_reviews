Pros: The beer is superb. The pizza is terrific. (best thin in Chicago now that Humboldt Pie is gone) Cons: The place is always packed during dinner. I've never been here when there wasn't a half and hour to an hour wait. You have to scream to be heard. Parking is a pain. I think my ideal Piece experience would be delivery of a pie and a growler and skip the crowded noise. But I unfortunately live just outside the delivery area.
