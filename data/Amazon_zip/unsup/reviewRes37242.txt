I've decided that the cafe at Fox & Obel is going to be my Saturday morning brunch spot to be enjoyed with a friend or a fresh magazine. As a foodie, I love the atmosphere. The cafe has outdoor seating serviced by waitstaff and indoor seating consisting of counters with barstools (perfect for dining alone) as well as 4-tops. Almost everything on the breakfast menu (served until noon on the weekends) is under $10. Classic breakfasts with a gourmet twist.  Lunch is equally enjoyable and the perfect place to get something for a decent price, fairly quickly, and maybe even grab a glass of wine. Their breads are top notch (you have to like real crust) and they have daily specials including seasonal soups. There's no doubt that breakfast or lunch at the cafe will inspire you to pick up the ingredients to treat yourself to a gourmet home-cooked dinner.
