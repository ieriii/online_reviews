First time I came here, it was so crowded so we were seated at the oyster bar. We ordered lobster festival family course, which gives us two lobsters, appetizers, and soups. However our server gave us tiny bar seating, where we had to cramp all the food into the table, not a very enjoyable experience. We asked for a bigger table but they said they're full, however five minutes later there are two girls came for drinks and they gave them 4-person table, HELLO? We are all customers here! Geez. Couple weeks later, I came back but this time I reserved table through open table and we had an enjoyable and delish dinner. Our server was really nice and attentive, which is why i added one star to this review. Food is great and seafood selections are fresh. I recommend their blue crab stuffed lobster and oyster rockefeller. Overall, its a great resto, but just make sure you plan ahead before coming here, finding table at dinner time can be painful.
