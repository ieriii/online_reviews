Went with the fam for my going away brunch- off to college, yo! I tried to eat my $45 worth, and I def think I did.  I ate: lobster bisque, a half dozen oysters, melon and king crab, a few fried shrimp, handful of crab bites, lobster pasta dish, some pieces of shrimp tempura and spicy tuna maki, shrimp cocktail, mini crabcake, carmelized bacon, crab leg, key lime pie tart, fruit salad, blueberries & raspberries, mini creme brulee... Needless to say, I stuffed my 5'1 self silly. Everything was delicious! I would strongly recommend the melon & king crab that comes in a martini glass as its flavors were more complex with mint added in. Also, you have to get the oysters (so fresh!), the carmelized bacon (so salty and sweet!) and the key lime pie tart. The dessert room by itself is wonderful. The service was impeccable. Even though it is a buffet and you get your own food, our plates were always cleared when needed, and our waters and coffee were always filled. Our server even gave my mom a complimentary mimosa for no reason. I will def be returning when I come back to the chi!
