Fate smiled upon us and we found this place quite by luck. As it turned out, it was a very memorable anniversary dinner. We arrived without a reservation and ate in the oyster bar, which is just on the other side of the main restaurant. The atmosphere is cozy, warm, and sexy. There was live music (blues) but not so loud as to make conversation impossible. I started with Oyster Rockefeller (4 for $12.99) and a cup of lobster bisque. Both were excellent. I then got a combo platter of scallops, shrimp, and a crab cake. The crab cake was all crab and virtually no filler. The scallops were prepared the best I have ever tasted in my life. The shrimp were grilled to perfection. The wife got sushi and said it was excellent. The meal was topped off with a complimentary piece of key lime pie because it was our first time. The service was attentive and accommodating. Overall it was a great eating experience and a great place to enjoy what Chicago has to offer. I would return in a heartbeat, but then I would also be bankrupt real soon.
