You know, that was some of the best jambalaya I have had in a long time, certainly at that price, and this far from New Orleans. Tasty, spicy, filling and good looking. My gf, country girl that she is, got the pan-fried chicken, which apparently more than pleased her. And the hush puppies were fantastic, as were the corn muffins, and the service. Not to mention the ridiculously awesome peach cobbler. ( we took food home so we could save room for dessert... I swear we aren't blimp people). The decor is great, and not too cramped. Buuuuuuuuuut, some of the sides are whatever. Good, but not great, veering from over salted to bland, or a combination of both. The greens were fibrous, the slaw was nothing to consider finishing. Apparently the tomato-cucumber salad was good... I didn't get to try any before it disappeared, and the smashed potatoes were good, but not great. I'll go back. For the atmosphere, service, entrees, and desserts. The sides only bring it back one star for me.
