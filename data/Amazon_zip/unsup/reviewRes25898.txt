This is a really, really, really good Vietnamese restaurant. I've moved away from Lincoln Park but still yearn to visit this place... The value of the food is good - for what you are eating and how delicious it is... I would imagine I'd pay a little bit more than what they are charging. Must try's: Fish in a Clay Pot, any or all of their appetizers, their soups... pretty much anything in the menu. The staff is fantastic as well. I always feel so welcome and special when I go to this place... probably one of the nicest staff I've dealt with in many of the places I've been too. Many times, I see the older male staff-member still stapling a sweet thank-you note to their menus, etc. It just seems like they are so thankful for customers. I LOVE COMING HERE!!!
