I use to live in chicago and go to Shaw's a few times every summer now i've reloacted to canada and haven't had a shaw's fix for a few years. but, thank goodness i was procrastinating at work and stumbled upon the shaw's crab house website, found out you can order their amazing king crab legs online!!! i ordered them online and they shipped them to me in canada! i got the 5 pound box, it was huge. had some friends over and grilled them, tasted amazing. wasn't the same with out the jazz in the oyster bar but i'll take what i can get!
