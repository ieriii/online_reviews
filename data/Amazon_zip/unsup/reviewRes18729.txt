Caro Mio is an amazing neighborhood gem that is also BYOB! The wait staff is always so friendly and accommodating. I've tried many different dishes there, but my 3 favorites are the meat lasagna, gnocchi with a creamy porcini mushroom sauce and 'Imboltini di melenzana' which is a unique take on eggplant Parmesan. The bruschetta is good, but very garlicky... so be warned!
