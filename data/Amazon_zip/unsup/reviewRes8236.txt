Go late or be prepared to wait. Seriously. We stuck it out and we were rewarded with a fantasically simple, yet wonderful meal. We started with the proscuitto antipasti and followed it with the Margherita Pizza. The owner was there and bouncing table to table. He took great pride in his business and it shows. This place is wonderful.
