Went today after seeing a movie, and my friend and I really enjoyed sitting at the bar and chatting with the Irish bartender. The place was pretty empty, which was surprising, but I guess because it was Sunday? It was the hottest day of the year, so we were dressed ultra casual (me in a tank top and shorts, my friend had biked there in dirty cutoffs and a really old t-shirt with holes - sorry Rick!). Add tattoos to that equation, and I was a bit worried we wouldn't be treated very well, especially when we walked up and saw the interior and the hosts wearing ties. But, my fears were totally unfounded - if anything, we received more attention than we needed! Anyway - the Gage burger was excellent, nicely charred on the outside, cooked to order, the marmalade was a nice touch. My friend had the fish and chips, perfectly fried and not at all greasy. Since he's a big whiskey fan, I have plans to go back with my husband to try some Irish whiskeys and snack on Scotch Eggs. I would recommend sitting at the bar if there's space, it seemed like the table service wasn't as fun.
