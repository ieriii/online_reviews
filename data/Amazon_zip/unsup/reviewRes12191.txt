This is one of our top 3 Pizza joints in Chicago (Got Pizza and Tomato Head in the running as well). The atmosphere is awesome and the homemand brews are worth the visit alone. We typically order a small white and small red pie with a pitcher of Golden Arm. Add their mixed greens salad to split with a friend or date and you've got a great feast. I highly recommend Piece as one of Chicago's best pizza/brewery spots.
