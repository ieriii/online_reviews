My parents stayed here over the weekend on their anniversary. They loved it. They gushed about the decor and the eventhough they thought the room was a little small, they took photos of it and sent them to me because they they liked it so much! Parents are weird. They ate at the 312 restaurant and said they liked the food. The hotel is near the Cadillac theatre and they took in a show on a Saturday night. So... my parents approve.
