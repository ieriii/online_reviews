Yes...like many here I came for the duck sausage and foie gras hotdog. I thought it was fitting since just only recently California banned foie gras. So as an "in your face" moment I had a few hours to kill in Chicago and being on a tight schedule to make sure I make it to my flight I dropped by here to get the infamous hotdog and savored every single bite.  It's decadent for sure...but amazingly good. Every bite was worth the trip for me. 2 hours driving from Wisconsin and then off on a plane again..it was amazing. If I'd come back again to try out the other goodies they had here. The elk hot dog sound promising. One major thing is there is a line. A long line. I came here before it opened..maybe 10 minutes before there was about 10 people before me. Line does move fast since there's a system and they do get out orders pretty quick BUT you don't feel rush at all. Great friendly place and great eats. What else can you ask for?
