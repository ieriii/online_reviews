I don't even know where to start. Me and my two girl friends had an hour to wait before our table was ready, so we were luckily able to get seats at the bar where we had some of the most delicious cocktails (one had passionfruit and mint? get it). We were seated in this beautiful circle room in a fun booth right in the middle. The decor in this place is amazing, and the wait staff was incredible. Our waitress was full of energy and passion, and was open and honest in answering all the questions on the menu. I got the Thai Chicken Pizza and it was incredible. Definitely worth it!
