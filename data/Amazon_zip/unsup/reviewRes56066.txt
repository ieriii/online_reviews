SuperDawg is as good as it gets.  Hands down, no BS the best hot-dawg in the city.  All I can say...the taste..the experience..the attitude.  I am not a drive-in guy.  I park, buy, and I am out.  So I really connot comment on service, but as far as the food.  Some may read this and say its a fast food place..Whats so special?  My only response is try the dawgs.  On that note, I have had one of the best grilled cheese ever there.  Have you ever gone to a rib place, and tried the chicken?  The usual response is no.  Try whatever is on the menu..whatever you feel like at the moment, I guarantee it is all good.  Please let me know if you do not agree...I will have to question you, and your taste buds also...something is wrong with you.
