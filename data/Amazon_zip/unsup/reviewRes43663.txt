I'm going to keep it simple here: - Price: Extremely reasonable for a Chicago steakhouse - Steaks: Good selection, loved being able to choose my own sauce etc. - Sides: Sound amazing, but they're really kind of tasteless (spinach) and deceiving (potatoes au gratin should be called onions au gratin)  - Dessert: yummy. - Wine: Great selection and our server was very knowledgeable and made an amazing recommendation (probably the best part of the meal)
