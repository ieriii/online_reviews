Graham Elliott was much better before he got the chip on his shoulder. I've eaten here about 4 times since he's opened. My first few experiences were awesome. Great music, great service...and entrees that filled me up, and were also pretty and creative. Now, it's Bone Thugs n' Harmony to bite-sized entrees, with mediocre service. If you're getting an app that's two bites, server...be on it. You know it's going to take me just a couple minutes to finish that, right?? Come on...you have to know! Two things that I still give GE props for: an awesome drink menu and that damn popcorn is heavenly.
