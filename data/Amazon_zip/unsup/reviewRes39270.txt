As quick background, since I can remember, I've never been a fan of breakfast food. I would happily eat spaghetti and meatballs with coffee in the am over an omelette and links. While I have eaten some good breakfasts in Chicago, after spending a morning at Longman & Eagle, I'm going to start setting brunch dates, rather than just being invited. Some thoughts: - The host a was a pretty chill guy. Yeah, he wore skinny jeans, but despite this, he was competent and friendly. - Chicken and waffle definitely lived up to the reputation.Well seasoned, light batter that was properly fried so it actually stayed on the chicken, and not over fried so the chicken is absolutely succulent. -free little samples of blue berry scones or muffins. Nice touch, and they were tasty. -Strong coffee, great floral green tea. Only negative is that the coffee didn't stay filled. My mom had to ask for two refills. -Attentive, non-obtrusive wait staff. Greeted the table promptly, made recommendations without being pushy and was familiar with the menu. Some kid threw a plate of food when I was there, and I would have never known expect ma saw it. Everything was cleaned quickly with no fuss or disturbance. I'll come back for the whiskey menu and a non brunch meal for sure. This place definitely lived up to its reputation, and though a bit far west, was as easy trip off the diversey bus. You can also take the blue like or Milwaukee.
