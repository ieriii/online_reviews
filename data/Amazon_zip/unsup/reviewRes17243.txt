I'm from England, home of great Indian food (hmm, that doesn't sound right). I have lived in America for 30 years and have suffered through many, many, absolutely awful Indian meals. Usually totally bland because they are scared of offending the "American palate" or something, and when I try to get them to kick it up a notch, that usually means throwing in some raw chiles which just kills the dish and my mouth. Today we passed by India House, I did a quick yelp, seeing 4 stars, and also it was incredibly crowded (we waited almost an hour for a table at 8:30 on a Saturday), always a good sign, so decided just one more try for a real Indian meal. OMG! This is by far the best Indian I've ever had in America, and probably the second best I've had ever anywhere (including Brick Lane in London, New York which has some pretty good places, and India itself). I got the lamb du piaza (lamb, medium spiced, with onions), my g/f got the chicken chile masala. The chicken was SPICY hot, maybe too much so if you are not used to that, and delicious. The sauce was deeply infused with the chile flavor, not just a bunch of hot chiles thrown in at the end. The lamb chunks were not the typical tough, gristly cubes I've become accustomed to, but instead were the most tender fall apart slow cooked scrumptiousness I've ever had. The naan was perfect, the service was perfect, the ambience was great. Never again will I say there is no good Indian food in America.
