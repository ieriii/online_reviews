OK, so here is why it gets one star. The food was excellent probably some of the best I have ever had. However.... My husband and I took my mom, a small town woman, and had a pleasant dinner. Just as we were about to leave, the manager/owner came over to our table and the first words out of his mouth were "Jesus, Buddah its none of my business." We have no idea what prompted such an outburst but was then force to sit and listen to him regale us with stories of drugs he had taken and how it never hurt anyone because he meditated so all those times he free-based meth were ok. No doubt, the food was perfect but we were treated so rudely, which had never happened before, that they won't get my business anymore.
