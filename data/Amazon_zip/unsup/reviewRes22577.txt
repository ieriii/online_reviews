It's an institution, from the crazy hot-dog people on the roof to the silly slogans on the box that every Northwest Sider knows by heart and the challenge of trying to say "Whoopskidawg" with a straight face. Sure, it's expensive, but everything on the menu drips with flavor and a unique twist, from the addictive pickled tomatoes to the crinkle-cut Superfries to the Polish topped with special sauce and the amazing milkshakes. You won't find anything like this anywhere else in the country, and it's close enough to O'Hare to always be my first stop for a taste of home after traveling.
