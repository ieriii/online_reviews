First off, let me say that I am not a hot dog fan, though I do enjoy sausages and cured meats. So when a friend and I decided to trek out into the middle of no where to check out what the buzz was all about we were surprised... cause it was pissing rain and yet people kept arriving to wait in line in the freezing rain to sample the multiple choices of meats in tube form. We were probably the 20th people in line and it took 45 minutes to get in out of the rain. Was it worth it? I had a duck sausage with truffle mustard and foie gras... genius! I also had a toulouse sausge topped with black truffle patte which was devine and to be honest much more memorbal ethan the foie gras duck sausage. At $8.50 per "dog" it's a bit pricey for the decor, but well worth the experience, which is what it is, an experience. The duck fat fries are awesome. I don't know if I would just go out of my way to wait in line for 45+ minutes again. If you can get out there at LEAST 30 minutes before they open, then I'd say it's worth it, but if not, then I'd say you should postpone the quest for gourment dogs for another day. Would I go back there though? DEFINITELY! keep in mind, this is not an everyday thing (if you're going for the gourmet dogs cause they'll kill ya) but it is definitely and occasional meal stop. It's very cramped, but the staff are welcoming and accomadating and DOug's a very friendly and funny guy. Keep up the good work Doug, you got a GREAT thing going there!
