This restaurant reminded me why I love Vietnamese food: the freshness! We were in the mood for lighter fare and ordered a vegetable stir-fry over crispy noodles and satay shrimp at the recommendation of the waiter. The fresh vegetables were very fresh and cooked perfectly al-dente, although the ingredients that necessarily came from cans (water chestnuts and baby corn) tasted off by comparison. The flavors in the satay shrimp (with sugar peapods, red bell peppers, and other veggies) were the perfect sweet/savory; the very light coating of batter on the shrimp absorbed the sauce nicely, though the shrimp itself was a bit tough from over-cooking.  It got quite noisy during dinner, but the service was prompt and friendly. We had a nice conversation with the waiter, and the sweetie comped us delicious fried bananas that arrived in a pretty arrangement with fruit and chocolate sauce.  Definitely worth going back to with a bottle of wine.
