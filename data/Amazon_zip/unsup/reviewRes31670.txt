This is probably my all time favorite restaurant. I have never once been disappointed walking into Chicago Diner. First of all, the staff is amazing. They are so personable and make the visit worthwhile. Secondly, the food is AMAZINGGG. I'm pretty sure I eat at this restaurant at least two times a week, it's starting to get embarrassing because the staff knows me by name. If you truly think the food sucks, then you have bad taste in general. If you want to eat shitty food I think there is an ihop down the street. You have to try: The Reuben, the mac n cheese, the sweet potato fries with the creole mustard, the philly cheese steak, and the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough shake... ....Okay so now you get the point, stop reading this and get over there
