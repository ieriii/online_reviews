5 Stars, all the way. Would give more if I could. This meal was amazing. Go with an open mind and you won't be disappointed. Highlights for me were def. the quail egg ravioli, which I had heard so much about, and got to enjoy. Yes, you're going to want many more of them. Also, the fish that was the substitute for the lobster-may have been sea bass? It came with fava beans, pickled ramps and some dehydrated quinoa? Whoa. So much flavor. Also the pork was to die for. I would definitely come back and try this place again after the menu changes. So many little surprises lurk around every corner. We brought lots of beer and just enjoyed the entire experience. About halfway through, it started to get a little bit crazier and the vibe changed, the music got louder, we just loved every minute of it. 11 courses, 3 hours later, money well spent. Kudos to the chefs!!
