I'll start by saying, Garcia's is my 2:30am dining option of choice. The copious amounts of cheese, large portions, and "nachos y quesadillas" make it ideal for late night grub. If you call ahead the food is usually ready by the time you get there (ten minutes or so)... That said, a normal weekend meal is a completely different experience. Having been there multiple times for dinner, I've concluded that the same things that make Garcia's late night great (greasy food, large portions, fast service) work against it at dinner service. The value is there and you'll certainly go home full, but delicate Mexican food this is not. Keep an eye out for football sized burritos, mounds of rice and beans, and over sized plates. Go for: -Late night food -Free chips and salsa at the bar while you enjoy a Margarita or a Modelo Skip it for: -Date Night -A light dinner
