Consistently great steaks. Very comfortable and sort of a cross between a lodge (stone and wood) and a 50's supper club. Casual dress, including jeans, is fine. I really like the seasonal vegetable offerings (grilled asparagus, butternut squash). I love their spinach salad - it's the best I've ever tasted. My favorite dessert is the key lime pie and my favorite appetizer is the scallops. Definitely will go back many times.
