Hidden Gem! Did not stay at the hotel just had a 2 day meeting! The banquet Staff was very accommodating. Breakfast, Lunch and breakout beverages were great! The location was perfect for getting to Michigan Avenue and walking around to see the sites! The team was amazed by how beautiful Chicago is!
