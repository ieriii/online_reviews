What can I say that hasn't already been said, not much, but here I go. A coworker stopped in today and brought it out to the burbs. He said the line was only to the door, so that is good. We ordered about 8 "hot dougs" and everyone said it was good. I tried the Aligator and the Rib sausage. I had half of each and that was more than enough to fill me up. Both were pretty good but I like the gator one a little better. Fries were good. It is expensive but worth it to try something different. Certainly not an every week sort of thing.
