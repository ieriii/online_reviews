I don't give many places one star, but I was so offended with the general attitude of everyone that works here that I have to do it. My friend and I were sat with literally one table between us and the host/hostess booth and were still ignored for the first 10 minutes that we were there. We kept looking around to try to flag someone to at least get us drinks, but everyone that "worked" there was busy socializing amongst themselves in the corner. We considered getting up and leaving, but were finally able to make eye contact with one of the many hosts who were doing nothing. He came over and said something along the lines of "did you want some water or something...?" We said that we just wanted our waitress so we could order. To that, he turned around and rolled his eyes. Are a couple of burgers and sodas too much to ask for? Our waitress did finally come over and did not apologize. When she realized we were annoyed, she said that she didn't realize that we were waiting for a long time. She, too, rolled her eyes as she turned around. ??!!??!! Our burgers were alright, but both were cooked to medium-well when I had ordered medium and my friend had ordered medium-rare. The fries were not very good. Despite the fact that this place is close to my apartment and has a great outdoor seating area, I will most definitely not be back.
