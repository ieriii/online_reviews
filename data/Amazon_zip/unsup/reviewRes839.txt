There are many restaurants in Chicago that have a Buzz Gap, where the buzz a particular place gets does not delivered in terms of how good the food is. There is something about people waiting in line and popularity in general that woos foodies into believing something is much better than it actually is. Hot Doug's is definitely not one of these places. If you live in Chicago, at one point or another you've heard about Hot Doug's-- about how good it is, and how hard it is to get inside the place. They're only open 6 days a week, for 5 hours a day, only accept cash, and there is almost always a line. "Go during the week," people will say, "because you will have to wait at least an hour on a Saturday." You will wait that long on a Saturday and probably about 15-30 minutes on a weekday. But if you are free and up for it, by all means. The specialty Dogs run about $8.00, with normal dogs running about $3. The specialty are the way to go, because they are great and the menu changes. For example, "The Dick Kelley" is a Curry Pork and Veal Sausage with Spinach Raita and Queso Zamorano. The spinach sauce and shredded cheese on this were mouthwatering, as was the actual sausage. It's just one of the most unique set of flavors that you will get anywhere in the city. Most importantly, the flavors work together and aren't just piled on for quantity like an "Awesome Meal Time" dish. Kangaroo, Alligator, and other exotic sausage are also currently on the menu, each with a gourmet array of toppings. Doug's is definitely a touristy/popular place to go, especially after the Anthony Bourdain appearance, but it will cost you time and patience. For that reason, it's not a place that I want to take a group of friends/family if they're in town. But, if I do get off work early for a doctor's appointment, it's one of the first places for lunch that comes to mind.
