I went here last weekend with my husband and parents. We got there around 11:30 am on a Saturday morning and sat right down. We started with the calamari and bacon fat popcorn. The popcorn was beyond amazing. I will never be able to come back here and not get it. My husband and I each got a burger, my dad got the pulled pork and my mom the Greek chicken sandwich. Everyone loved their food. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is just because I wish they had more selection of their own beers. Most of their brewed beers were heavy hops, which I don't like as much. I will definitely be back though.
