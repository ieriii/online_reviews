I haven't been to Meli in a while and we finally had a free day to go for breakfast. I had to write an update to my review - BECAUSE THE BILL FOR TWO PEOPLE WAS $43!!! We had four things - shot of wheatgrass, coffee, a mushroom omelette, and french toast. Yes, everything was delicious, but for $50 including tip for BREAKFAST is just ludicrous. I don't know if they had to raise their prices to make money for their second location or what, but that is just insane. Good bye Meli.
