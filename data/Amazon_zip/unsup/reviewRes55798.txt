MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT BY FAR!This place blows most places out of the water. First, they give you this complimentary pizza bread when you sit down that is amazing, I could eat this stuff every day if I could...Usually, I order the same thing everytime - Chicken Piccato. Chicken that is lightly breaded with a butter, lemon, and white wine sauce with pimentos and capers. This comes with three good sized chicken breasts and a side of pasta as well as soup and salad.You get A LOT of food for your money, it's reasonably priced, dim lighting, and perfect for family dinners and date night. I HIGHLY suggest this place for your next Italian dinner. You'll love it :)
