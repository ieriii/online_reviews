I came here for a happy hour after work and stayed for dinner. By the time I ate, I was fairly sauced, but I remember what we ate. Pork meatballs: SUPER AWESOME. Beet salad: Delicious. Orecchiette: SUPER AWESOME. Brussels Sprouts: SUPER AWESOME. Blackened Cauliflower: Delicious. So, in summary, great drunk-ish food. Solid service, slightly douchey clientele, but the cocktails and $2 PBRs help make that a non-issue.
