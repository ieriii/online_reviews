Grand Lux is the Cheesecake Factory's ugly stepsister. My daughter and I visited here one time and it was just "ok." Nothing spectacular or mouthwatering. We had no desire to return. I personally know many people who LOVE this place but the food just did not hit a home run for me, neither did the drinks, nor the service. The best thing I can say about Grand Lux honestly is the view! If you love the Cheesecake Factory, as much as I do, don't waste your time on an imitation that just doesn't cut it, go directly to the Cheesecake Factory.
