I was in Chicago over the summer and wandered in here with my girlfriend. As my luck would have it, it was all you can eat Alaskan King Crab Leg night. If I wasn't an atheist, I would have thought I'd died and gone to heaven. The joint was crowded but the staff quickly made accommodations for us at the bar. Our waitress kept the crab legs and Anchor Steam coming and I was very happy. Everyone at the bar was in good spirits, too, and I even ended up in a crab leg eating contest with the guy next to us but he had a mustache and I didn't so naturally he won.
