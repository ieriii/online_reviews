last night my boyfriend and i were in the mood for 'za. since the weather was so lovely, i suggested a stroll to nearby spacca napoli. he'd never been before - for shame! seriously delicious pizza. true neapolitan-style with a thin charred crust that is beyond compare. and they cook up so quickly! i went with the salsiccia e broccoletti (one of the white pizzas featuring italian sausage, rapini and fior di latte mozzarella. it truly hit the spot. the bf went with one of the specials of the night, which was a white pizza topped with fresh basil, strips of lardon (fatty bacon) and pecorino cheese. so salty and rich! afterward, we satisfied our sweet teeth. hazelnut gelato for me; zabaglione for him. mmmmm! as if that wasn't enough, the proprietor handed out mini canoli to guests as they were leaving...we split one :) and FYI, they do take out - you must order online and pick it up. no problem!
