I go to the Oyster bar about once a week with my boyfriend. Obviouslyif we go every week we LOVE this place. They know our names and I feel like family whenever I walk in. Needless to say the food is fantastic. I have yet to order something and be disappointed. Oh, and the oyster shooters are top notch. Be careful though, they are powerful and deliver quite the kick.Yummm
