This is not a fancy place by any means, a place for a pizza and beer in a bar-like setting. The staff is friendly, the prices aren't outrageous and the food is good. They are known for their thick crust pizza but we had their thin crust. It's not super thin by any means, but it has a great sauce and is loaded with toppings. We also had the Pequod salad which is plenty big to share. That comes with black olives, tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni, pepperoncinis, mushrooms, onions, shredded carrots, and green peppers. Oh and lettuce, of course! This place happens to be right across the street from the move theater which is very convenient as well!
