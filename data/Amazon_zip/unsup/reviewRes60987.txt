Fifty's got a great sidewalk seating section, good drink deals ($1 bottles on Mondays!), friendly (and hot) staff, and far-beyond average bar food. Everything on the menu is pretty good. Three unique levels, and Playboy covers in the bathroom. The only downside is the clientele runs toward the fratty / douchey, if you let that bother you.
