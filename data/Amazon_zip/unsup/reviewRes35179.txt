Known for it's roasted duck and I did enjoy it but the roasted chicken was so juicy, so definitely a must try. You have to call ahead for the whole roasted duck order and they slice it up in front of you for a little dining entertainment. On another note this is another place where they also roast an entire pig to order, boricua for your holiday pernil.
