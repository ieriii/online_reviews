Went here on a Friday night at 8pm. 16 deep birthday dinner party. They accommodated our gigantic party wo issue on the back patio, and even added an extra chair when someone showed up later. The only other Cuban place I've been to is Habana Libre, so that's my basis of comparison. I ordered croquettes as an appetizer, they were quite good, flavorful, and the sauce was lovely. I ordered the Masa De Puerco for the main course (chunks/medallions of Pork). They are flash fried, then covered with onions and garlic, and served with brown Cuban style rice. Portion size was HUGE. I mean HUGE. I was almost rolled out of the place, it's been a long time since I've been that full after eating at a restaurant. The meat, though, was a little dry, or rather, drier than Habana Libre's. It was still very good. Only down side is the place is a little small, which isn't that bad, and it's LOUD. I mean really loud. The fact that I was part of a 16 person dinner party actually worked in my favor, had I been sitting with 2-3 friends I don't know how much I would have appreciated the noise level. There was another front part of the restaurant, though, that didn't seem as loud. Oh also, BYOB. (WINNING)
