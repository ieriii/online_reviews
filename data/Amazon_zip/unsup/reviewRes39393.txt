I knew I had arrived at the right spot when I noticed the decal on a window reading "EAT SLEEP WHISKEY." With the time allowed, I was able to fit in two of the three: eat and whiskey. Dinner was comprised of a wild boar sloppy joe with beef fat fries and a bourbon cocktail that nearly had me on the floor after five sips. The somewhat long wait prior to being seated may have had something to do with the effects of this ever-so-delicious drink, but that is besides the point. Great food, fantastic service, well-made drinks and an A+ atmosphere.
