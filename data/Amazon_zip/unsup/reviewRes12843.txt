A bunch of friends and I celebrated a birthday here a few days ago. We spent a good amount of time in the bar area. The bartender was friendly and attentive. Before we went into the dining area, we asked the bartender if they could refrigerate the cake we brought along and he was totally cool about it. We ordered four different appetizers - Green Tamales, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Taste of Cuba, and Ceviche. They were ALL very, very tasty and we all really loved them. For the main item, I had the Blackened Duck that I absolutely enjoyed. It was my first time eating duck and I am a fan. The meat was perfectly done (medium-rare), succulent, and along with the slightly spicy sauce and mashed potatoes, this was a meal I would have again and again if I wasn't the kind who liked variety in food. My bf had the Roast Pork but wasn't impressed with it. I got to taste a little bit of the pork and I have to agree. I didn't find it to be anything special. It was a so-so item and NOTHING compared to my duck. I would highly recommend the Blackened Duck. We were all quite impressed with the overall quality of the food. The server was attentive and the table was cleared in a timely manner. When it was time for deserts, the server asked if we wanted anything but we reminded him of our cake. He volunteered to bring it out with the candles (we had taken candles along as well) and he did. We cut the cake, sang the birthday song, and took pictures. He then took the cake back to the kitchen, cut slices for everyone in the group and brought them all out. I was particularly impressed with this gesture. Most restaurants complain about outside food but this place was so cool about our cake and even went to the trouble of cutting it and all. Very impressed. This was our first time to this place and all of my friends and I would go back again if it wasn't for our desire to try out new restaurants each time. (The minus one star is for the Roast Pork)
