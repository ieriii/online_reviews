Tried this place for the first time last night, and yummmmmy! Awesome thin crust pizza and really good fresh-brewed beer. The pizza was nice and crispy, and wasn't greasy at all-I didn't feel guilty eating like 5 pieces! Really cool atmosphere, I loved the huge sky light on the bar side. I would definitely recommended this to someone looking for good pizza and a fun, social restaurant/bar!
