I booked the corner king room on http://hotels.com The description was really nice and sounded much better than the 2 that were less expensive. all to find the room was very small and did not have a balcony as stated in room description. the staff was less than helpful from the front desk to the valet, taking 20 minutes to get the car on a Monday night..? I really would not recommend this hotel.
