This is a terrific Lincoln Park restaurant! The food is amazing, and the ingredients are always extremely fresh. I love the salmon noodles, tofu spring rolls, avocado/cream cheese wonton, king crab pasta and pho.  The restaurant is BYOB, and there is no corkage fee. The owner is a wonderful host who welcomes his customers with great warmth and enthusiasm.I love this place!!!
