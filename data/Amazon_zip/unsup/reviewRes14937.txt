This place was fine, but only fine. There's a wide selection on the menu, but nothing was done incredibly well. Our table split mussels, two pizzas, a pretzel, the Thai salad, and a dessert. It was all just okay. Same with the beers. Service was good. Crowd wasn't annoying. If this place was in the suburbs I'd make fun of it. But it's not.
