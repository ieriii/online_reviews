Odd. That is the direction that Gilt has gone. The wait staff is fantastic as always, but the food and general service, is odd. Although we had to remind our waitress twice about the first dish we ordered which came out much too late in the meal. The cheese fondu is not. It is actually spinach dip. Don't let it fool you. The steak tartar, while it still tastes terrific, was not presented well at all. It was just kind of splatted onto the plate - as was the quail egg in the middle of it. Presentation is slipping. Drinks: Taste great and a really unique take on some classics, but inconsistent pours. One glass is filled to the top, the other is half full. It was also amusing that the staff kept filling my glass with more wine when I didn't even have a sip yet. So I dunno. I've been to guilt a few times over the last year and I'm going to assume this was just an off night for them. The food is always great, but they really slipped on presentation and details. Guess I have to go back in a few weeks on a different night and see what happens.
