I like Wilde. My wife and I come here far more often than we should given the amount of other great places to explore and try. Nonetheless, I thought I should finally write a review. The atmosphere is inviting. As some have mentioned, it has a nice, warm feeling that's very good for colder, nasty nights. The food is good as well. I had a lot of different things here and have enjoyed most it. Getting a side of mac and cheese as an appetizer or the artichoke cheddar dip have always worked out well for us. And usually the service is on top of things - friendly and attentive (tonight was an exception, but I'm not docking stars for it since it seems to be an outlier). But I am docking a star for something else. I think Wilde deserves 4, but what is so amazingly difficult about serving the main course AFTER the appetizer has been eaten? If you order an entree before you've received your appetizer, you can almost be sure to have things arrive on top of one another. We figured this out a long time ago and started waiting until we actually had the app in front of us before telling the server what we were going to have next. Tonight, however, the server came by and told us our app would be right out, so we ordered, and sure enough, before we could finish up the appetizer, our main course was shoved on the table. Did they put a rush on it? Did we look like we were eating the first course so fast that they were afraid we'd attack the table next to us if we didn't have more food to keep us distracted? How does this happen so often? I've been here and overheard tables nearby complaining of the same issue. So I have two tips for anyone trying Wilde: 1) Wait until your appetizer is in front of you, on the table, before ordering anything else; and 2) if you don't like close company, ask to be seated somewhere in the back half of the restaurant. I feel like it's a lot more open back there.
