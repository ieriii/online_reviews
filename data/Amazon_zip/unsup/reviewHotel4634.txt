Stayed here on a recent trip to Chicago. Chose it because of the location, the price, and the fact that you can valet park your hybrid FOR FREE! Yeah that last point kind of sold me on it. As for the rooms, yes they are small, but whatever. They are clean, seem kind of hip, and the bed is totally freakin' amazing. Like seriously the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. And I guess the blackout curtains would have been nice if I didn't have to wake up at the crack of dawn every morning I was in Chicago for a conference... I personally did not have a problem with the sink but I can see how people might, and the shower is wonderful. Not to mention the H20 brand toiletries, a local Chicago brand, nice touch! On to the service. The doormen are so nice. So nice in fact when I saw one of them on the street a few blocks from the Hotel he said hello and wished me a wonderful day. The front desk staff are another story. They are baffled by what I would consider normal touristy questions such as "how do I get to this neighborhood" etc. They actually gave us the wrong information. Good thing we didn't listen to them. Also, the noise level may bother some. You can hear a lot. You can hear the elevator ding. You can hear the shower next door. You get the picture. But yeah, stay here because of the location, price, FREE parking (if you drive a hybrid), and the eco-consciousness factor. Ignore bitchy staff.
