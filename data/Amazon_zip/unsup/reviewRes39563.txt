I love Korean BBQ, and this place is legit! And there are over 400+ people in Yelp world that agrees with me. I think this is the first time I went somewhere that served sushi and didn't even bother to look at the sushi menu. Come for the BBQ, you'll be glad you did! There's so much variety to choose from, and everything is tasty.  We ordered a number of items from the BBQ menu. The squid and the Kalbi (beef) were my favorites. They're crazily delicious-especially when it's cooked the rare side. Melts in your mouth. I heard the fried oysters and the seafood pancakes were good, so naturally, I had to try them. Verdict: the fried oysters were okay, but my mom's are better. The seafood pancake, however, lives up to it's reputation. Loved it! And the side dishes that come with it...man oh man. There's way to many to even fathom. It's practically a full meal. I think it came with over 15 little dishes. Love the tofu and the kimchi, though I can live without the awkward potato/egg salad and lotus dishes.  The place itself is whatever. A little bit on the grimey side, but whatever. I can look past it. The service was friendlier than I expected for an Asian restaurant at least (I don't mean to be judgmental and stereotype...okay I lied. I am judging and stereotyping). Our waitress were helpful in recommending which dishes, and which she would preferred over others. Glad we listened to her.  If you don't mind walking out smelling like Korean BBQ for the next two days, then come try it. I'm glad I did. Double mmph!
