First time having pho and I'll definitely be back. I love all sorts of Asian food (Korean is my favorite!) and I'm glad to add Vietnamese to my repertoire. Lots of menu items was overwhelming at first, but thanks to fellow Yelpers I easily settled on chicken pho. Will try some of the others next time. I went back a few days later and had the regular beef pho...so incredibly delicious!
