Also a great place for a good meal. My first experience here was take-out. I was craving some Baba Ganhoush and found this place online. I called in the order and picked it up (along with some lamb shank & rice). I love the baby ganhoush except for one little thing. They put some oil and olives on it in the center. Not a fan. But that was taken off and I enjoyed the rest. The rice was good. They have nice fluffy rice with the option of dill rice. I did half of each. The lamb shank is amazing. I get it everytime now. The meat just falls off the bone and the sauce is great. With the dinner I got a complementary side of feta cheese, radishes and onions sliced. The baba ganhoush came with pita bread too. The second time I went here was a sit down lunch with a group of friends. We did sort of a family style lunch. We ordered several entrees and tried a bit of each. We had chicken kababs, beef kababs, lamb shank, the ground beef kabab, grilled tomatos and lots of rice. We finished the meal with the desserts. I can't remember the name of the one I got. It was pretty much dough that was fried than soaked with a honey type sauce. It was TOOOO SWEET. I gave up eating it after a couple bites. Since that time, I have gone back for pick-up several times. I always get the baba ganhoush and lamb shank. They are my faves.
