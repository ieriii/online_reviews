I went here the other night for my birthday dinner with friends and thought all in all it was really delicious and fun. I chose an odd entree which was a Yucatan dish, and it was strange but tasty. Everyone else who accompanied me enjoyed their choices. I thought the chips & salsa were phenomenal too. It was very crowded and loud but that's the scene I was looking for. I don't care for empty and quiet.
