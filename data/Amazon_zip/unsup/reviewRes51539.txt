I love Garcia's. That is why I will not let my negative experience from today ruin my overall love for them. Our waitress did not look happy. Lemme rephrase that: she looked mean. She must have had a long day. Anywho, foodwise I ordered 3 tacos: chicken, pork and al pastor. The dish was stone cold and the few pork pieces lying on my taco were merely fat, rather than actual meat. Our waitress also took our order wrong. She apologized. Throughout the meal another waitress took over. They were all clearly busy, but unfortunately set a negative tone for the evening. And I clearly wasn't the only one frustrated, as people form various tables were continuously looking over their shoulders to see if anybody would help them. Come on Garcia's, hire two more waitresses and you'll have more happy customers!
