OK, as gushing review #109, I will keep this concise. Dinner here is like dinner at the home of a wildly talented and dedicated friend who is extremely type A about inducing sensory overload. If these guys weren't busy with that whole cooking/serving the other customers thing, I would have cuffed them to the table and had them tell me every single detail and history of each of the dishes we had. The amount of care that went into each course was inspiring. OK, gushing out of the way. The other relevant info: (1) BYOB and a low tasting menu price (comparatively) make this the only "best in chicago" restaurant yet that I would go to again. (2) If you are a twenty-something like me who occasionally feels a twinge of discomfort in superfancy places (like when Tru matched my napkin to my outfit, say), you will not feel any of that here. (3) I didn't make this reservation, so I didn't have to deal with reservation-pain. I understand some frustration, but if you live in Chicago, just call in and hope for the best - it's worth it.
