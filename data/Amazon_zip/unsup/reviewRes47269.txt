I have to agree with Jacob G. that it's not Kumas. It's BETTER. I found Kuma's patties to be somewhat bland, but they are very juicy and flavorful here. The pretzel buns are also softer and more buttery than other places. I'm not a fan of thick, dry buns. The border patrol (beef patty, carnitas, avocado, jack cheese, and jalapenos) is my favorite and you can add mac-n-cheese as your side for $2. There's an extensive selection of toppings that you can add to your burgers or mac-n-cheese. We've gotten take out, and the food holds up well. If you want to take your out-of-town guests for the best burger in Chicago, Lockdown delivers without the wait.
