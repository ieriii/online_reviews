A friend and I came here for dinner a few months ago. We went mid-week and the restaurant was hopping. We decided to dine in their garden area, which was super cute. The service was great. The server gave us some suggestions on what dishes to order. My friend ordered the Comal, which is Cafe 28's version of fajitas. I ordered the Almond Crusted Halibut, which was delicious. I especially loved the jalapeno mashed potatoes. The perfect amount of heat. I will definitely be back -- hopefully to try out brunch!
