Bin 36 Rocks. It is a great place for a nice business lunch or special occasion lunch. The service is quick and the wait staff is friendly and professional. It is not usually too crowed so you don't need a reservation. After lunch you can grab a freshly baked cookie and bottled water or coffee to take back to the office! Keep your eyes open for special events at Bin 36! They do a great job with all their parties and charity events that usually revolve around wine tasting. My family also enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner there this year and the food was outstanding. Am I a Bin 36 junkie? Yes, yes I am!
