i had heard some good things about this place and decided to try it. it's fairly loud and not terribly original--seems to be all the rage to open a gastropub as of late, but overall it was very good. if you're looking to fit in come in a plaid button down--preferably western with snaps and in the brown palette. you'll most likely hang out at the bar and see the ornamental ceremony of someone making a drink from bottles that look like they've been lifted from an old apothecary. mind you i''m not entirely certain that these small bottles actually contain bitters and the like (i mean they could just be drops of melted ice for all i know) but it looks like they are really devoted to the craft of getting you fucked up on whiskey before you sit down for a meal. speaking of sitting down--do get drunk before you do that if you have any issues about sitting closely to your neighbors. DO NOT BRING A BABY. and if you do--don't bitch about it to the surrounding tables that you're unhappy. this place is not kid friendly. i'm sorry. you're a fairly horrible person if you think this is the newest e_uivalent to the california pi__a kitchen (sorry missing keys--an problem i've been meaning to fix for some time). the food here is delicious. no complaints. the best part of my experience was dipping into the conversation at the next table. a guy on a first date. phoning his friend for wine pairing reccos (read: douche) and being just over the top in general. at the end of the evening we received his check and i was beside myself to find out that his friend had recommended a bottle of "forlorn hope." maybe this is an unspoken friend sort of inside joke in the dating arena. i hope so.
