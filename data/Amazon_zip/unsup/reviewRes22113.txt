I came here for lunch and with my roommate and a friend who goes to medical school downtown. This place definitely has the ambiance down. We sat outside because the weather was beautiful that day, and I literally felt like I was in Greece or something (or what I imagine being in Greece would feel like). We ordered the flaming cheese appetizer, which is legit just a slab of cheese, but for some reason I really liked it since I'm generally not a huge cheese person. I'm actually surprised this is such a popular appetizer, because it seems like one of those things that might not be some people's cup of tea. For my entree, I ordered dark meat half chicken riganati. The chicken was falling off the bone, and the sauce was perfect. I really loved it and i would probably order the same thing if I came back. My friend ordered gyros and I kept sneaking pieces of his gyro meat -- I think I literally ate half of his plate of food. The service was wonderful. For the appetizer, they weren't allowed to light the cheese on fire on the porch, so after they prepped it they knocked on the window to let us know to look over. They lit it while we watched through the window, complete with exaggerated gestures and silent applause -- it was very cute.
