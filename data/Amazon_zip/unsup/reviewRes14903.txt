We found this place by accident driving by one day, and seeing all these cars parked outside. We walked in and was blown away by the fake grape vines, and the antique look. I believe it was supposed to look like we're in an Italian vineyard. We were also surrounded by big families or elderly people. I cannot believe how AWESOME the food was. figs wrapped in prosciutto: wow. homemade gnocchi: wow. I always eat gnocchi when available, and this is good stuff. gnocchi di spinachi: wow pappadelle con funghi di bosco: wow, HUGE portions with fresh pasta and mushrooms. Linguine with black mussels: WOW. farfalle boscaiola: WOW The pasta section was AWESOME, the rest is good, but not as impressive. I REALLY recommend this place for the food, not the atmosphere.
