From the helpful and attentive waitress to the little older gentlemen playing the accordion in the corner this place has everything you could want in an Italian restaurant. We ordered some calamari and it was cooked to perfection lightly breaded and not at all rubbery. Our entre came with soup and salad bar and by the time our meal came I was so stuffed that I literally only could take one delightful bite before the bus boy came to wrap everything up.  This place has it all good prices (especially considering the amount of food), charming/kitschy ambiance, attentive/friendly staff and of course the pinnacle of any successful restaurant out of this world to-die-for crazy amazing delicious food.  My only gripe with La Ville (and it's a pretty small one) is that they have a one refill only policy on soda...in a place with so much food it seems odd to be stingy on the drinks.
