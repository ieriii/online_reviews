Amazing BBQ. Took 5 folks from out of town there for a work dinner and everyone was impressed. The pickles and chips that are provided when you arrive are wonderful. I recommend the competition ribs but beware, 2 people could barely share a rack. For the price, you get a lot of high quality food. I always think of Chicago q when guests come in town and need to make it there more on my own! the atmosphere is fun and lively but not too loud. I did like it when it was BYO but appreciate their great drink menu. Bravo to Chicago q!
