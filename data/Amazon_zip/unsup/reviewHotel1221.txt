I was doing some work for one of the conferences held at the McCormick Place. The conference host booked me a room at the Hyatt and gave me a confirmation for a late check-in. My flight was late and I finally made it to the hotel around 10:30 p.m. only to be told they had no rooms available. I am like WTH? They offered the guy in line in front of me the option of one or two rooms. I was pissed and getting no where so I took them craptastic offer of a room at the closest hotel accepting overflow - A Red Roof Inn in Deerfield - a good 45 minute cab ride with no traffic. That was a little piece of heck being sent to no less than 4 rooms before one was acceptable - one was dirty, one had no electricity, one was occupied by a man who threatened my life for breaking into his room... Then in the early a.m. I had to take a 90 minute cab ride back to the McCormick Place. What Hyatt Did Right: - Offered to comp the Red Roof Inn room - Gave me $120 in cash for the cab ride - Offered me a guaranteed room the next night at a reduced rate plus all meals comped. - Upgraded my room to a corner suite - Sent me "I am Sorry" snacks and form letter like notes of apology from the G.M. and catering manager. What Hyatt Did Wrong: - Sent me 1 1/2 hours out of my way to stay an an AWFUL hotel. - Gave me $10 too little to cover the cab fare back and forth - BILLED ME IN FULL FOR THE UPGRADE ROOM and FOR THE SNACKS!!!!! I was stupefied by offering all these nice things and then sending me the bill. Really?! Do you treat all guests this way??? I guess as a convention site they really don't have to provide quality customer service - they get people regardless. When I travel, I generally like to stay at nicer hotels - Hyatt has recently been crossed off my list. In the end when I complained about the bill, they did offer an apology again and comp the entire bill.
