Went here for NYE dinner, and wasn't disappointed. It's BYOB, and the waiters knew exactly what to do with our wine. The table next to us had brought a couple six packs as well as wine and everything was cool. They are gluten free friendly and the managers and most waiters know what can be made gluten-free and what can't ( they don't have a separate menu though) Food was great and cheap! We had the shrimp spring rolls, shared a large combo bowl of Pho Bo and I had the beef and seafood plate. All delicious! Only downsides, definitely more of a diner feel, and granted it was a holiday night but it was loud as hell in there. That said, staff was friendly and knowledgeable, food was yummy and a great price. Will def be going back.
