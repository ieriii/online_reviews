Stopped in last Friday - just before 5pm. The place was pretty empty, but that was great. A bunch of old highschool friends were in town and we were planning on just grabbing a few drinks and then heading off somewhere else. Our server, I believe his name was Eldrich??, was extremely friendly and patient with us - because at times we can be the most indecisive people. We wound up at the booth/table in the corner because a few more people joined us... ordered up some starters... of which the wings were AWESOME... crispy but sill covered in the right amount of buffalo sauce (seriously the best wings i've had in awhile). Well after a few drinks... a few of us decided to stick around for the evening. More drinks, more food (the club sandwich was delicious - and the goat cheese app was soooo yummmy) and a lot of good times. The hawks game was on, so it got quite crowded (and it was a Friday night)... but our service was great... the food was yummy and the drinks were perfect (we didn't have to wait long for anything!!) It wound up being a great night! Would definitely come back another time!
