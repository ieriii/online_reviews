Pretty cool place! It's definitely a beautiful, interestingly designed hideaway that you have to either find out about on Yelp, or have someone bring you to. The door blends into the wall and if you don't know where it is, you'll walk right past it. (We did). We were sat immediately and ordered a plate of hummus which was SO GOOD. For drinks, I had one of the bitters (can't remember the name, Artichoke something?...) which was lovely and came with a big lump of ice in the glass which I think is to die for. (Easy to please, much?). My friends had the Mai Tai and one of the Rum drinks with the word Seaman in the name. Both were tasty. It definitely has a cool ambiance and I would highly recommend it if you feel like being trendy, classy and spending $12 dollars on a cocktail. I have only one gripe, and it really deducts a lot of points for me.... The rules. I get it, I get it. It's a super classy bar and everyone should be on their best behavior, blah, blah, blah. No baseball hats? No cosmopolitans? No cell phones? ....Bitch please.
