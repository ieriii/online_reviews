I'm not impressed with this place. Their pizza isn't all that wonderful, expensive, and the beer is bad. People who love this place are blinded by hipsterness. If you go there, it gets so crowded and loud that it's impossible to actually have a conversation with the person across the table from you, who is further away from you than the person sitting at the table, next to you. The layout is bad. Even the waiters and waitresses have a hard time maneuvering their way around. Pizza takes forever to make, it's not filling, and at $2 per topping, no matter what size the pizza is? No thanks. If you get it delivered, it's under-cooked and soggy. Might as well start pre-heating your oven at home, as soon as you order it for delivery. Wait, scratch that, hold out for an hour and then pre-heat your oven, cause you'll be waiting a long while for your sub-par pizza. I suggest going next door to Santullo's, for cheaper, quicker service. It feels much less like a frat house in there.
