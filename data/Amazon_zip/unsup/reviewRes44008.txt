I have walked by this place a million times. I think I was a bit intimidated by the cool decor and the funny doors, but I am so happy we came here! It's our new go-to sushi place.  I really like the atmosphere. I have a big problem with how gross most of the sushi places in the area look. I walk in most places and immediately get worried about the cleanliness of the place,but not here! It's so nice and cute! A tad more expensive, but worth it.
