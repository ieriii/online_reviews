This is the best pizza in the city! Both their thin crust and deep dish are way above the competition. I like to go with a group and order both kinds - because they are so different, but I can't decide which I like better. The staff is friendly and the place is very inviting :) Being located right by the movie theater makes it the perfect stop for dinner and a movie! If you haven't been there - make it a "must do" next time you are in the mood for pizza! You won't be disappointed!
