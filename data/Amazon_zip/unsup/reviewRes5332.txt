I gave Purple Pig another chance and this time our experience was wonderful and that's all because of the person serving us. She was friendly and gave us good recommendations. I was comtemplating on the drinks and she did, what the best servers do, she bought both of them to taste so that I can order the one I like. Food was delicious. I am meeting up with friends today at PP. Will post the latest, if food and service are not consistent this time around!
