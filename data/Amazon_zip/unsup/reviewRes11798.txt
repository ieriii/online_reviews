This place is so cute! I went with family when I was in Chicago visiting, and found myself wishing we had a breakfast place like this at home in Arlington. I ordered an omelet because I can't resist a good omelet, but I had orderers remorse right afterwards thinking I should have tried one of the crazy pancake or french toast options (Oreo pancakes, pumpkin cream cheese pancakes, chocolate tower french toast, etc...). No one at my table ordered french toast or pancakes, so sadly, I couldn't mooch off of them. Next time I'm in Chicago I plan to go here and I plan on ordering the chocolate tower and eating as much as I possibly can.
