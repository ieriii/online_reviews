How many pizzas have I had in my life?I have no idea, but if the pizza auditors gave me a number well into the thousands, I wouldn't dispute it. That said, Pequod's is, without question, the best pizza I have ever had put in my mouth. Fresh ingredients, carmelized crust, perfectly baked. Pequod's alone is worth the trip to Chicago.
