i'm all about half stars, so 4.5 stars for xoco. shared an ahodaga and a choriqueso with a friend because i trust my fellow yelpers. the ahodaga: it comes sitting up in a spicy tomato sauce. the sauce was spicier than i thought a medium would be and it actually overpowered the meat a little. the bread was a little soggy too. by the end of the sandwich (the part not sitting in the sauce), it was a little dry. a really good sandwich, but would've been great if the sauce was spread evenly throughout. now the choriqueso: amazing. so so good. i'm stuffed, but i want another one. great flavor. good bread to meat ratio. the crispy bread really added to the sandwich and complimented the chorizo and cheese well. very tasty. got an authentic hot chocolate which was also good. very chocolate beany in a good way. would've tasted better with the 2% milk to add a little fat, but i was trying to be healthy. the churro ending with a shot of chocolate was absolutely delicious. a perfect ending. crisp and sugary. based on the choriqueso and churro, 5 stars all the way. minus half cuz the ahodaga. will definitely be going back.
