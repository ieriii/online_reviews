I loved the look and feel of Piccolo Sogno, and I loved the food even more! I started with the poached pear salad, which was lovely & light, and followed that with the Stracci di Farro, which was amazing. It was so flavorful and well prepared! It had beautiful pasta triangles, asparagus, truffle oil--nothing not to love. My husband, who was feeling under-the-weather, ordered the soup which he said was "just soup" and the salametti (pepperoni) pizzi, which he said was "just pizza." I'm not sure what he was expecting, but I'm dismissing all his opinions since he was a grouch and, besides being under the weather, I think he did not choose wisely. We did not come to this wonderful restaurant for pizza! He tasted my dish & loved it. He said he wished he had ordered it. We'll definitely be back & enjoy much more of their wonderful menu.
