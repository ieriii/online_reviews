One of the worst meals I've had in Chicago, paired with some of the best beers. This is THE place to go if you want a huge range of Belgian beers, with plenty of the local craft brews on offer as well. Very crowded, so need to get there early to get a seat/table. Very noisy also. Wait-staff were fantastic. Biggest disappointment was the food. Everyone had raved about how good the food was, yet my wife and I both felt like it was one of the worst meals we've had in Chicago. On that account we probably wouldn't return.
