Another authentic Italian thin-crust pizza place! The decor, feeling, and manager are very Napoli. It rivals Pizza DOC. I love both of them. The differences are this place uses fresh mozarella and the menu mainly consists of pizza and a short list. DOC serves many other entree choices, uses saltier drier mozarella, and has more pizza choices. So, if you go with friends who are not pizza lovers or need a more romantic place, you may need to go to Pizza DOC.
