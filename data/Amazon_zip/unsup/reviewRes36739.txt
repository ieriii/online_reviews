This is definitely a hidden treasure in Chicago! The sushi is fresh, delicious, presented artistically and isn't pricey! You may have a hard time finding parking but the place is quite romantic, quiet and cozy enough to spend an evening with some good friends. This is a BYOB restaurant, just so you know.
