Yes, this place rocks...simply fantastic....I've lived in the neighborhood for six years and just made it to Irazu about 6 months ago...yes, I am a little ashamed. However, I've been at least 15 times since then...it's all good...The service is caring and genuine, the food is rockin' and not expensive. Get the ceviche, spinach and cheese emapanadas...I also love the palmito salad and the oatmeal shake rocks my world...I will try more things once I stop craving the items above...oh, and Lizano sauce is crazy good, like everything that A1 wishes it could be and I think it might be infused with crack
