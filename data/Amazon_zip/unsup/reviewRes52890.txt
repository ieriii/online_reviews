I could have sworn that I wrote a review for this place a year ago on yelp. Some how it's deleted? We ordered cubano - ok, very porky media noche - ok, still very porky lechon - very porky croqueta - greasy & over fried The food was very porky (duh) and greasy, and i was underwhelmed with the whole experience.
