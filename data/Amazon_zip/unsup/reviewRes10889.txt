Finally, three years after moving to Chicago I eat at the Bongo Room. Why did I wait so long? Because I won't wait to eat brunch, and all the reviews describing long waits turned me off to eating here. The solution? Come on a weekday. Sure, it's still relatively crowded but you won't have to endure longer than a 10 minute wait. That, I can do. So, my experience... divine! I arrived with a stomach dangerously hovering on empty and my usual craving for oh, about 6 cups of coffee. I eyed the menu well into my second refill... choices, delicious choices! I decided on the breakfast burrito (my go-to when dining out for brekkie) which turned out to be big AND beautiful. I almost finished all of it. Probably one of my favorite breakfast burritos outside of San Diego. I also snagged a bite (okay, three) of my dining companion's red velvet pancakes. Decadent as the cake and topped with a cream cheesy icing, Oh my! Service was quite efficient and never in your face... just the way I like it. I'll definitely be back!
