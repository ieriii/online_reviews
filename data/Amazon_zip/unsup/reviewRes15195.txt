I went about 9 years ago. The food was good but the customers were loud and very obnoxious and very off-putting and I said I'd never go back because of it. But I've read enough good reviews to try again. We arrived around 4:30 and it was empty (good) if you get a booth you have your own little room, nothing much to look at but romantic. The bread was mediocre. We started with Oysters Rockerfeller, and they were some of the best I've had, the sauce was exceptional and the oysters were cooked properly. Both soups were blah. The salad which came with the entrees was much better than I thought it would be, the creamy garlic dressing was great! My companion had Riches Special ,$23.00. It had a 5-6oz filet with mushrooms, it was good. It also included 4 breaded shrimp which my freind loved, but I didn't like that it was in the steak juice and had no sauce. It also included a 3oz breaded veal dish, it was ok. It also had nicely cooked brocolli. I had the seafood pasta $25.00,and swithced from the thin tomato sauce listed to a cream sauce which I asked them to put some garlic in. OMG, it was much better than I expected! The calamari was cooked perfectly, there was easily 5oz of lobster, medium sized shrimp and scallops, clams and plump juicy mussels. Quite a good portion of seafood!! And the sauce was way more flavorable than it sounded! I would totally reccomend this dish, which I had to bring 1/2 home, and I'm not a light eater! I would definatley go back!
