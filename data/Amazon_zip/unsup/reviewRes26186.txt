a few friends of mine work at this sprawling and awesome south loop hotel resto--and every time i go, they spoil me and i love it!!!! the portions, for small plates, are great. and the food and cocktails are absolutely stellar.  not to be missed: the sangria (especially if they have the one with pomegranate), the short rib-scallop combo, the russian roulette peppers, and the melon soup with ricotta sorbet.  and the piece de resistance....the rabbit agnolotti, which is definitely in the top 5 dishes i have had the pleasure of eating. try it...i don't think it will disappoint.  ask to be seated in the lower part of the room, you get a great view of the park and you can still see the open kitchen.
