I went to Alinea for my birthday on November 8. My overall impression is that while it was a very interesting evening and worth the experience, I wouldn't do it again. There was something about the experience that was slightly sadistic. The insistence by the staff (presumably this is coming from the chef) that so much be eaten a certain way and in a certain order was very controlling. You were punished with dirty looks if you didn't do it the right way. On top of that they played a came of guess what this is with several of the dishes and wines. By the end I was purposely giving absurd answers just to see the reaction, which was typically kind of snotty.The point of controlling so much of the dinner seemed to be to craft a particular experience for the whole evening. It was all orchestrated. There was a clear arc and story to it. However, the peak of the experience was in the middle so the final courses, all after the savory courses, were a comparative let down. The sweet courses were a muddle and we left remembering those more than the peak. They were not memorable. I think that was intentional. It seemed they intended the high point to be in the middle, while you are the restaurant, not right before you left and went back to the outside world. Once we finished the last course we ready to leave, but they left us sitting there for a long while. I guess we had been bad.I expected to leave feeling I had been to gastronomic heaven. I left feeling a bit like I had been to the gastronomic equivalent of Club Hell in the Matrix movies. So, if you are in to that sort of thing, go for it.
