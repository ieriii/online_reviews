Great beer, good pizza, but don't stand in line for it. I got into Piece around 6 on a Wednesday and just barely beat the crush. I had the Swingin Single (delicious Belgian) and whatever they call the wheat beer, which was also great. Food-wise, the highlight was the gooey, heart clogging spinach dip. We ordered 2 pizzas, and both were good -- on par with most high end pizza places. I really don't know why anyone would wait very long for a table, though.
