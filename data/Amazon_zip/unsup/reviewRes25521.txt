I was staying at the Blackstone- side note: HOLY NICE HOTEL! OK- onto the food- I decided to pop downstairs for breakfast and happened to be fortunate enough to get the brunch menu! Since I don't eat that much, I LOVE TAPAS! I had the baked egg in spicy tomato sauce and the tomatoes on bread dish (blanking on the fancy name). It was delish and inexpensive. Also- the coffee was fantastic- so smooth! Once it hits your lips...it's so good!...we're going streaking! So- final thoughts: I wish I could live in this hotel and have them cook me breakfast every morning!
