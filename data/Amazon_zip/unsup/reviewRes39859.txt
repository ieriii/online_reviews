I would give this place a solid A-. I'd say over all, a little expensive for my budget, so I wouldn't go there very often, but definitely good for a special occasion. We went for an early dinner, and it was a good thing, because as we finished up, there was starting to be a significant wait for tables, so I'd definitely suggest hitting it up early, since this place is so popular. I had the burger, which was good, if a little dry. I guess I really wish it had come with BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and mustard, but the beef fat fries were yummy and the burger was pretty tasty. I also had a pretty delicious (and well matched to my meal) cocktail, at the recommendation of our server, who was a really genuine and friendly guy. The steamed bourbon pecan cake my boyfriend had for dessert was amazing, and I liked the chocolate concoction I had, although I liked the malt gelato and caramel custard better than the actual chocolate cake-thing itself, which was insanely rich and I couldn't finish it.
