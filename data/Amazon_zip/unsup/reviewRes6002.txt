Cows say Moo Moo, I say Nom Nom If I were a Cow, I would gladly dine here. This particular Wildfire location serves some of the tastiest steaks I have ever had. I rarely give out 5 stars, but this place deserves it. It has a classy atmosphere, similar to what you see in a 50's mobster movie. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave great recommendations. I've tried other steakhouses in Chicago, thinking it was because of the corn-fed beef that the area uses, but Wildfire does a very good job of cooking their meats. I highly recommend the prime rib. It is a very generous portion and the meat is very juicy & tender. I also tried their Mac 'n' Cheese, Spinach, and Mash Potatoes as sides and they were all very tasty. I finished the meal with the Key Lime pie, which is by far the best I've ever had. The meal didn't break my budget either. At most upscale steakhouses, the bill would have been 30%-40% more. Great food, good atmosphere, fair prices. A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.
