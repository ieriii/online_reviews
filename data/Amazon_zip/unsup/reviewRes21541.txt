Wow, so I might be falling into the trap of thinking that Rick Bayless can do no wrong, but really he has hit it with this concept. Artfully made sandwiches and soups with great attention paid to the provenance of the ingredients, handmade hot chocolate drinks and desserts, AND LEED Gold certification for the restaurant itself. That is an impressive list. I had the Cochinita Pibil, a roast suckling pig sandwich with amazingly tart pickled onions, achiote and an insanely hot Habanero salsa. I of course brought the pain on myself by ordering hot (they ask when you order), and had to go up to the water dispenser a few times to quiet this. All in all...it'll be worlds better when they implement the take-out system, but I don't mind. The wait makes the experience that much more rewarding. I know that I'll be back to try all of the interesting tortas and caldos, and perhaps just to catch a glimpse of that avuncular culinary genius again.
