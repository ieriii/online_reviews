Best Chinese I've had in Chicago. It can be inconistent sometimes though. When you get take out you have to ask for soy, mustard and sweet and sour, they will never ever just have it in the bag. And still only give you 1 or two of each on a $50 take out order. That being said try the Spicy Pan Fried Pork. Be sure to eat it with some rice or I gaurantee you will be on the toilet all day the following day w/ flaming diarhea coming out of your ass. The Dry Chili Beef is also excellent.
