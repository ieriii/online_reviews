I've heard about this place for years. It's all over the TV, Food Network, Places To See lists ... So - if you like overhyped overpriced pizza with a thirty minute wait time to be sat and a 45 minute pizza cooking time, please stop by. Oh, BTW - they throw in the ROCK HARD pizza crust for free. Never again.
