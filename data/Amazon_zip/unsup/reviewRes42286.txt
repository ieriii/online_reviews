Gotta say I don't think I will give it a second chance despite the rave reviews. Not overly crowded but service took forever. This new trend over overly fancy coctails I don't understand. Douchy attitude of the bartender did not help. We finished our drink and left as it was obvious we were "out classed" by the regulars/kool kids. I looked at the menu and it did look tastey but I am so beyond the attitude of the self appointed ones I can't bring myself to deal with it again. Perhaps it was an off night, maybe the bar tender was bummed about the middle east but it set a taste that is not soon to be forgotten.
