great restaurant with really flavorful meat. i went last night with my family and we had a great time. the service was amazing and the food was even better. be sure to go on an empty stomach so that you can get your money's worth. it's usually $50 per person, but monday - thursday it's only $38 right now, which is a great deal for a brazillian bbq restaurant. as a tip, go very slowly at first. don't eat too much at the salad bar or of the bread and sides they bring to the table. taste a little bit of all the meats and then continue to eat the things you really like. the meats are juicy and flavorful and you can ask for the meat how you want, from rare to well done and they will try to accommodate you.
