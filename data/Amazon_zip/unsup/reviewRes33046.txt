Despite there not being any other patrons there (it was late on a Monday night), my friends and I still liked the atmosphere at LBB. Yes, Bronco is a little over-attentive, but we were up for it and generally enjoyed his attention and recommendations. The food was DELICIOUS - each of the four of us was stealing bites off each others' plates. We're looking forward to going back, especially during a busier night when they (appear to) have live music. Didn't give 5 stars only because, like many others said, if we didn't have a coupon it would have been far too expensive to return. If the entree prices went down about $5 each it would be 5-stars, hands-down.
