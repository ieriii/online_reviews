I would give it between 3 and 4 stars. We had a group of 5 on a busy Saturday night and were seated quickly (although I do see other ppl's point about the disorganized host) and we got a nice table on the patio. We split the soup of the day, the Cuban platter app, cevieche, and we all tried each others entrees. Everything was really good (although a bit salty). The only 'negative' was the service. It was a bit slow ex- 4 of us received our cocktails from the bar about 10 mins after we ordered, but the 5th waited for about an additional 10-15 and it was just a glass of wine. All in all, food was good, service was eh.
