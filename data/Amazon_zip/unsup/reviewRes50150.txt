Great service. I know this should be a given, sorry it's not. So I really have to reiterate how wonderful the service was. They made me feel welcome as if they were so happy to have my business. All of the workers were great, host, server, bus staff. The food was very fresh and tasty. I had the lump crab cake and fried green tomato. I chose these two appetizers as an entree because the entrees seemed a little too fattening. Actually, the lump crab cakes could have been an entree, very large portion. The crab cakes were seasoned well, not too much or too little, not at all greasy. The tomatoes had a crispy cornbread coating. Great dish, light and refreshing. Not at all greasy.
