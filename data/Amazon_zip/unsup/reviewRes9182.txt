Ordered delivery from here for the first time last night. The portions are so huge that it was good we only ordered two entrees and shared them (between two people) - and there were still leftovers! All was great - the salmon, the dill rice, the vegetarian plate - MUCH better than we had anticipated. Very flavorful rice and the salmon was cooked perfectly - not overcooked or undercooked. The vegetables were very fresh and crunchy. Loved it. On top of all that, the food was delivered 20 minutes earlier than promised, AND there was a snowstorm going on, so we were even more surprised that the food came so quickly. The delivery guy was also very courteous even though he probably had the right to be cranky because of the horrendous driving conditions. I'm giving Noon O Kabab 4 stars for now, until I actually eat in the restaurant and can post a future update.
