My husband and I ate here on our last night in Chicago for Labor Day weekend. And it didn't let us down! We had the Wood Oven Baked Goat Cheese for our appetizer. It was goat cheese baked in a cast iron dish with tomatoes and spices and served with baked pizza dough triangles. Very good! For my entree, I had their specialty, Horseradish Crusted Filet. It was filet mignon wrapped in bacon with an 1/4 inch or so of horseradish baked on top. (I had the petite filet. I wasn't sure how much I could eat after that incredible appetizer.) Also very very good! I'll definitely be back the next time that I'm in Chicago.
