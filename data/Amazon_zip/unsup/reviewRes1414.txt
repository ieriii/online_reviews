A+++.  Doug Sohn is a genius, plain and simple, and a good-natured one at that. Gee, why not take your Kendall College culinary degree and create a restaurant that serves delicious and often eclectic sausages for prices not much greater than McDonalds? With that in mind, you need only experience the duck-fat fries and accompanying line once. Sure, they're awesome, but come on a weekday if you have that kind of time; the fresh-cut fries are just as good, and you get a serious mess of them for $2 and not much wait. The only possible complaints about this place are, well, the Saturday afternoon line and the short business hours. Then again, if Doug can make a place go by only being open six hours a day, six days a week, more power to him!
