This is a great place. Great food. Great service. I Love the pizza. The crust is so crisp, really flavorful, no cardboard here. I would have given 5 stars, but the architechture of the space is really cool, and unfortunately rather filthy. I get that with ceilings that high cleaning is difficult. But, I swear the grime and dust bunnies on some of the beams was an inch thick.
