The crown gets passed once again. During my time in Chicago, I've always bounced between Joe's and Cap Grille as my favorite steakhouse (depending on a multitude of factors), but I think Mastro's has taken the top spot (and my apologies for picking 3 "out of towners "as my favorites in a town that is known for its steaks). Service is impeccable from the front of the house to the waitstaff. The food was amazing, I ordered the KC bone in strip and it had a great finish to it and was done perfectly. I always like my steaks a little more done than medium, but not medium well, the waiter recommended medium-plus and I couldn't have described it better myself. The stuffed mushrooms, all six (or so it seemed) variations of their mashed potatoes looked good (we opted for the Mastro's Mash (basically a loaded mashed potato)) along with the mac n cheese and I would order all three again. We ended with the butter cake, it was good, but not great imo...but I had lofty expectations given previous reviews. Drinks might seem expensive at first glance, I think my martini was $18...but they leave the tumbler tableside and are constantly refilling your drink for you, wine pours were also generous if you order by the glass. So the menu prices are not nearly as bad as they seem, seeing that you get 2+ drinks per order. Despite the reviews knocking how pricey this place is, our average tab here was miraciously cheaper than the avg bill at the aforementioned restaurants, but with that said I think prices are inline with competition around town if you averaged it out over a few meals. All in all a great meal from start to finish.
