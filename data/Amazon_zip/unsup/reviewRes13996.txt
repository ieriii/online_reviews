The only downside is that this place is usually packed. The upside is that it is packed because everything is awesome. All of their in-house beers are solid. The porter and the wit stand out as excellent. There is a standard lineup that is always available, plus some seasonals and special brews. They are always experimenting, so there is always something exciting available. The guest taps - on point. They fill growlers, except for the high gravity stuff (over 7% abv). I haven't had everything on the food menu, but I've had a lot of it and have never been disappointed. The pulled pork was a standout. What a winner. They could double in size and still fill the place. I hope they plan to expand - or open another location - or start bottling. A+
