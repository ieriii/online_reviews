I walked out the door of XOCO knowing I'd need to come back, if only to finish a missed food connection. A quick recommendation before the story: remember your seat number and exact dish name if sitting inside. I ordered the Ahogada, coming highly recommended from the staff and fellow yelpers. They brought out a sandwich pretty fast, and quickly asked if I got this sandwich. I didn't remember the name, and they asked if I was seat #74, to which I said "yeah, I think so?" Anyway, it looked damn tasty, so I took it. And it was! Best I can infer now, it was the Chicken Tinga - a think layer of breaded chicken, drippy anejo cheese, and a tasty pickled onion sauce which gave a nice spice profile. I had a thought, a few bites in, "hey this doesn't taste like carnitas", but I continued to destroy it. Shortly, a sandwich in a bowl of broth walked past. Lightbulb! That's what an Ahogada looks like! I died a bit inside, as it taunted "I am the best carnitas ever!" I drowned my 'taking a premature sandwich' shame in my bowl of guac and chips. Chock with onions and a light amount of diced tomatoes, this is some of the best around. About 10 minutes later, the waiter brings an Ahogada over to me, and asks if it's mine (as if to rub in my epic failure). No, I say, must be the guy over there who clearly got one too. Ok - looking back now, this appears to be mostly my fault. I was a bit sick and out of it, but nonetheless a poor excuse. Next time, Ahogada, next time.
