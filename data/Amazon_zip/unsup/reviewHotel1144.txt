I've stayed at the Fairmont Chicagoo since the property opened many years ago. While the service has always been five star, the property needed renovation. I'm pleased to say that it recently had a big face lift and once again shines as one of Chicago's best hotels. The bathrooms are upscale. My room had booth a bath tub and a shower with rain style shower head. The new decor is quite modern and comfortable. The lobby is beautiful and the restaurant (Aria, for which I did a separate review) is really good. The location and view make it a top choice for anyone staying in the heart of downtown Chicago.
