Not only the best hot dog place anywhere but simply one of the best restaurants in the country. The flavor profiles and taste matching are superb, the work of a team of people with some serious culinary skill. The foie gras and duck sausage dog is hands down one of the 5 best things I have ever tasted. If i lived anywhere near this place I would have 5 a week. Duck fat fries are great. Small seating area but the turnover is rapid and you can usually find a place. Expect long lines at any time but it is beyond worth the wait.
