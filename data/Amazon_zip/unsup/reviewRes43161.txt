Gilt is a great place to go for dinner or a late night drink. The bone marrow is yummmm!! and so are the frites!!! Ummm!! They have a wonderful cocktail list...and a drinkable table wine that is soo cheep. They also have $2 PBRs ( i don't drink beer but I saw it on the menu!) It is a great place to go with a group of friends. I love it! The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because the waitstaff is not awesome. Just ok. I had to ask for water several times...and yet ended up going to the bar (to get water) however the waitress brought my vodka tonics out rather quickly!
