Quick update: I received an email from the manager, thanking me for my comments and saying that they did a tasting on the mojito mix and that it was indeed too sweet. They have adjusted the mix now. That kind of attention and care about a customer experience is what sets businesses apart. 90 Miles, I wish you all the success in the world!
