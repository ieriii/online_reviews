I can't say enough good things about The Purple Pig! One of my favorite spots in the city and great any time of the day. The tapas style menu lets you try a bunch of different things and the portion size allows you enjoy more than the standard 1 bite per person. There menu is very seasonal so there is always something new to try. A few of my favorites include the Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta Smear, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes, Chicken Thigh Kebabs, Fried Smashed Potatoes & Tzatziki, but seriously everything is amazing!
