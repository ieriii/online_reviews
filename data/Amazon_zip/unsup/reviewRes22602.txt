Greek Islands gets 5 stars for the following reasons: 1) Consistency in service. There is not a waiter that is there that is not fabulous. they know how to take care of a table. 2) Always being able to seat. I have only waited 10-15 minutes max for a table on one of the busiest days of the year. They always accomodate, and they are open fairly late! 3) AWESOME FOOD. And great management. Very friendly. It is my second favorite restaurant in the city. Oh, if you like white wine, try a bottle of Petrulianos. It is a little sweet. light and excellent!
