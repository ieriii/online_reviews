This place pleasantly surprised me! It really was as every bit romantic as it claims to be! And the food... I still have been thinking about how good the food was and we went there last week! The dressing on the salad, the cheese fondue and the chocolate fondue for dessert was amazing! Also our server asked if we wanted a cappucino with frangelico in it, sounded good so we decided to get it, it was so verrrry tasty! But be warned, that drink set us back $22 dollars for 2 of them, our server didn't tell us how much it would be. but it was very much worth it! and the service here was very good! i suggest making reservations, as this place gets packed fast and it takes awhile to eat your entire meal..
