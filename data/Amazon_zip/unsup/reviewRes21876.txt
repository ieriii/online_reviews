The staff took a reservation for 12 ppl on a Sunday afternoon a week in advance. They had the table ready when we arrived with 10 fifth graders in tow. The servers were patient and helpful, the food was fairly priced for solid portions, and while nothing blew us away, we left with a good sit-down option for decent Mexican in Lincoln Park until Fiesta Mexicana reopens after their fire. One tv on mute in a corner (nice to check playoff scores without ruining atmosphere with noise), small front room, good scale, muted colors, with windows opening onto Halsted and Diversey.
