Well believe the hype--this place is the real deal! Reason for 4 stars is that we waited in line for about an hour and 20 mins on Friday (which if you really have something better to be doing is kind of a big deal!) but it was well worth it. I have seen Hot Doug's on various food programming and also from local chicagoans so i had to have it for myself. My friend, who is a chi native, and I got up there at about 11:10 AM and the line was already well down the block. It was a beautiful day out and I was on vacay and he had the day off so waiting wasn't that big a deal. We finally got to the front of the line around 12:30ish and Doug himself was incredibly friendly and takes all orders (and adds up the bill) himself. Really personable guy who seems to love what he does. The fact that he was wearing pajama pants and had a few words for every customer reallly speaks to the atmosphere of his establishment! We ordered the Chicago Dog and Andoille sausage, which are fixtures on the menu as well as the weekly itemed Hot Doug's BLT (Bacon Sausage with Avocado Mayonnaise, Iceberg Lettuce, Cherry Tomatoes and Hickory-Smoked Sweet Swiss Cheese),and buffalo sausage (brown ale and chipotle buffalo sausage topped by a horseradish cheddar cheese and bacon-garlic mayonnaise). I really enjoyed all of them but the Andoille was at the bottom of the list. The BLT was increeedddibleee!!! Also split a duckfat fries dipped in cheese sauce which was baller as well. Don't know exactly how to differentiate duckfat fries from regular french fries, but needless to say, they were really good. Definitely give this place a try if you have a few extra minutes and enjoy any kind of encased meat. Although the place is small, you can always really find a seat due to the flux of people going in and out. Go Gators
