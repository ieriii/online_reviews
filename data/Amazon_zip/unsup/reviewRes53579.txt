WOW...I am so surprised by how much I didn't care for the chicken at Crisp..It's not that I don't enjoy greasy fried chicken,,,,cause I do..but I normally avoid eating it, like at KFC, but had the desire to eat some fried chicken(maybe feeling anxious..I don't know). Anyway, I got the Plane Jane and a soda pop..1/2 chicken was the smallest I could get..It cost over $10 which was amazing to begin with.That's alot for fried boney chicken. I then sat down yesterday, Tuesday, and sat at a picnic table that was shared with other people around lunch. We all had to share these brown paper towel rolls, all with other people's greasy fingers on them as well...Im not a fancy person, but having my own individual napkin is like a minimum eating need that I have at a restaurant..Maybe this is how they do it in Korea, but not COOl at all..or sanitary.  So,,the chicken was just completely unremarkable..Just crispy fried chicken..a little peppering I think..but just chicken..Not bready like KFC, just skin on chicken fried up.  Maybe I should have added a few hundred more calories and got it with the BBQ or Seol sassy sauce to hide the taste of the chicken, but blowing my diet on fried chicken was bad enough. I ate about half, and threw out the rest.   I would give the food a 1 star,,overpriced and not good. The servicewas friendly and fast, so that bumps up this BIG let down to a 2 star.  WOW........
