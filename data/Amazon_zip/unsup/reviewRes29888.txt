I don't understand the frothing at the mouth for this place. I was really excited to eat here after hearing everyone rave about it. I might give it a second try for dinner, but Frontera doesn't have me running back. We arrived for lunch and there was about an hour and a half wait. I'm usually not willing to wait for anything that long, but I had dreams of a spicy explosion of complex flavors. Well...not so much. The tortilla soup was very good. Not the best that I have ever had ( I love Bogota's in Brooklyn! and El Paso in East Harlem just to plug those), but very good. After waiting forever..I'm talking maybe 40 minutes, we get our tacos. The tacos were just blah okay. The meat was cooked well, but it really lacked flavor. I thought it was really basic as were the beans. Ok everything on that plate was just blah, including the guacamole. For dessert, the pecan brownies were fine, but kind of boring too. What really got me was the service here. Our waitress would disappear for 30 minutes at a time. I understand that the restaurant was busy, but this was just ridiculous especially as it seemed like all of the other tables were getting their food twice as fast. The lapses between courses were really long and we couldn't flag her down or ask for more tortillas. Good thing, the margaritas were good or I would have been even crabbier.
