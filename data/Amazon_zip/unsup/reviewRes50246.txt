This place is OK at best. For the prices, I expected some great ribs and chicken. The ribs were incredibly dry as was the chicken. The ribs almost looked fake like the McDonald's stuff. But since this place is on Division, I guarantee every yuppie finds it "amazing" which it is far from. Some better places have way better BBQ in the city. Like the Honky Tonk in Pilsen and Q in the Loop. I will say that the delivery was really quick and under their estimate of 40 min - 1 hour. Oh, even something as simple as the Mac and Cheese was kind of shit too. I will say, awesome BBQ sauces. Even if they were a little overdone on the orange juice from concentrate.
