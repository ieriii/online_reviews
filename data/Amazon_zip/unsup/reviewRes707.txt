I think I'd better write a Yelp review on this baby even though I went there just over a year ago. Wow. Just, wow. From the non-descript exterior, to the minimalist art in the foyer, to the comfortable chairs, the atmosphere was just right. My friend and I decided that this would be the ultimate in our food adventurings. We were right. We tried the 12 course menu and each item was like a tiny work of art. My favorites included a carrot ravioli with a coconut powder filling served in a lobster consommee with lobster chunks and a lobster cracker and a tiny bison filet wrapped in potato strings and flash fried and served with a spice gel cube, pistachios and pistachio puree. Our server was friendly and informative. We went on a little tour of the restaurant after our meal, and then wandered dazed onto the dark sidewalk clutching our souvenir menus. An experience well worth every penny.
