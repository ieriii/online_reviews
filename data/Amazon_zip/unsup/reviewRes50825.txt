I've been going to Wishbone for years. It is a great place to get Southern/Cajun food in the city, and it is HUGE. Yes, you will have to wait if you show up at 11:00 on a Sunday, but it is worth it. My favorite: corn cakes. Yum. The great thing about Wishbone is that it is perfectly suited to those who either a) hate kids, or b) have 10 of them. They have two separate dining spaces, so if you are there without kids and don't want to be bothered by them, you can sit in the adults only area. However, if you do have a child with you, you never have to feel that people are annoyed. The noise level is pretty high, so a whining toddler is no big deal. It is also a nice place for parties. The food is great and the prices are really good. We had a party there a few months ago, and the server was fantastic, we had the entire "adults only" bar area to ourselves, and it didn't break the bank.
