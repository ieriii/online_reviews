i went here today because i've been wondering about it for some time. the location is impossible, so i rode the bike-the best way to get there. i expected it to be like a depachika (the underground massive food courts in tokyo) but it was more like a treasure island. excellent selection of european butters (!!), rare & beautiful meats, seafood & cheeses, all kinds of prepared foods, spices & breads. i bought some of their coffee & it was remarkably fresh & flavorful-i had it in my bag in a locker & it permeated everything within a 6 foot radius. the bulk items are unreal but quite pricy-the lemon coated shortbread balls seriously rock. and i wouldn't have known that if the sales person did not turn me on to them.  the service is TOP NOTCH. i went for the chocolate olives, which look exactly like olives but are really malt balls, a few chocolate covered strawberry balls & blueberry balls. then i got a sammie to take home-overstuffed fat roast beef with bleu cheese on delicious crispy french bread. i went to get some nz sav blanc but they charge twice as much as wine discount . i noticed they had a great selection of beer as well. but i will not buy alcohol at f&o.  i definitely will return. it's kind of like a gourmet food carnival for the well to do.
