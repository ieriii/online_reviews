I stayed here upon my arrival when I relocated to Chicago. Heres my .02 for what its worth. My disappointment was that for the money the room was a little rough. Nice, comfortable, functional, but kinda rundown . In fact, I think the rooms are converted studio apartments for business renters. The kitchen was fully functional. It had a refrigerator, range, microwave, plates, glasses, pots, pans, etc. etc. The bathroom was very small, and lit very badly. The furnishings were also nice, just dated . On the upside, the hotel staff was very nice. The location is great, just east of the John Hancock. Great starting point for any Michigan Ave. day adventure. So if you are looking for a hotel room with functionality, the Seneca definitely fits the bill.
