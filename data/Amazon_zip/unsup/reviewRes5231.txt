Pretty good, only down sides were 1 - they don't take reservations and 2 - waiting for a table can take a while, especially if you're starving at 10pm on a Friday night, but then again that goes for just about every fine dinning establishment in the loop. The presentation is more small plate than full entrees, think tapas but with more of a Spanish-Italian-French fusion with other, non-mediterranean, influences mixed in. There were a few more memorable dishes, one of my favorites was the Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans, excellent dish, kind of has a cerviche feel to it but without the raw fish, highly recommend it. The Octopus was also pretty good, another winner on my list. Of course one cannot go to The Purple Pig and not have pork, so my table ordered Prosciutto di Parma, very tasty but it was gone before in an instance. One of the plates I'm a bit torn about is the Fried Chorizo Stuffed Olives, in concept it sounds good, but the fried olives served at warmer than room temperature just didn't do it for me, you'll have to try this one for yourself and decide. Bottom Line: Break open your piggy bank and pig out!
