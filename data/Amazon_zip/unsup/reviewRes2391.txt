Absolutely the best hot dog I have ever had. They have it all for the hot dog purist to the foodie who wants it topped with everything. I stood in line for about 45 minutes then got the exotic crocodile dog with the duck fat fries. I wasn't sure at first if I should order the crocodile hot dog because it sounded like a novelty food that might not end up being very good, BUT the hot dog was AMAZING. I've never had such a delicious combination of hot, spicy, sweet, meat goodness in my mouth. In addition, I got to tell my friends that I ate crocodile meat. The fries were good (not sure if the duck fat made a big difference). I loved the outdoor alley seating, as well as the atmosphere inside. I wish there wasn't such a significant wait, but I guess that must be part of the experience! Bring some friends to chat with while in line.
