I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars. I have suched mixed feelings as this was my first Chicacgo deep dish. I compare it to Zacharies in San Francisco, which is really not fare because they taste so different. I guess it comes down to this, I notice great pizza is somehing I can't put down, and this pizza didn't really pass that test. BUT this is a chain and I think it was great for the area. So, if you are in the northern Loop or on the Mile this is definitely your best deep dish option within walking distance. Also they have a big order to go area, and the wait can be long.
