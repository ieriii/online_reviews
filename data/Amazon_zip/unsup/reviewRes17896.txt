Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum! Ok now that I've gotten that out of my system... HUGE beer menu to the point where it's overwhelming. In a good way! Cheese curds are out of this world! Seriously. Get them! Went with my bro and we decided to split two burgers and fries so we could try different things. Burgers: Edmund Fig-Gerald (Edmund Fitzgerald porter, fig & bacon relish, goat cheese, smoked onion) = YUM Elvis's Last Supper (bacon & peanut butter) = sounds weird but double YUM We tried curry fries and ranch fries. We also got extra ranch dressing on the side to dip because we were obsessed after having it with the cheese curds. Can't wait to go again! P.S. It does get packed in there so be prepared for a wait...worth it though!
