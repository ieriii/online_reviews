SHUT UP! Girl, I can go to an Indian buffet when I'm downtown on my lunch hour? Hell yes, I will go to an Indian buffet when I'm downtown on my lunch hour, co-workers be damned! Yes, I will smell of exotic flavors when I return to my cubicle, but I will also be the envy of the office as they know I had the best lunch of all. The buffet is fantastic. All of your Indian faves are there, and the goodies are all over: tawa paneer, curried goat, curried fish, chicken tikka masala, onion bhaji, and the list goes on. Just prepare yourself by not eating anything prior, and plan on skipping dinner. WHY?? BECAUSE THEY BRING YOU TONS OF NAAN, SUCKA! It's AMAZING here! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee India House!
