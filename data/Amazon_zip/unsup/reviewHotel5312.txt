Initially, we were very satisfied with this hotel upon arrival. The location was close to everything we had planned on doing and the room was clean. Our troubles began around 6pm the day of arrival (we were only staying one night). Our neighbors were a group of young 20-something kids who were running up and down the hall, slamming their door repeatedly, and yelling. After about 20 minutes of this, I went down to the front desk to ask what could be done. I was told that this hotel had a "zero tolerance policy" and they would be given one warning and then evicted. While I did not want anyone evicted, their response was satisfactory to us as we felt the situation would be handled, and we left the hotel and went out for a while.Upon our return at 10pm, our neighbors were still loud and were preventing us from falling asleep. We called the front desk, and for the second time that evening, security came up to their room to speak with them. The security officer told our neighbors that we were the ones who complained. Our neighbors got revenge on us at 2:30 in the morning, by banging on our door and yelling. We called security for the third time, and the hotel offered us a new room, but at 2:30 in the morning, who wants to switch?After a night of no sleep and feeling very dissatisfied with the way the hotel handled the situation, we spoke to the manager (Shawn/Sean) at check out. The manager could not even look us in the eye, gave a simple apology, and did not care when we said we would never stay at this hotel again. I was shocked at how much he seemed not to care about what happened, despite the hotel mission statement of leaving guests feeling "well-rested." I'm not sure where the people who work for this establishment were trained on customer service/security skills, but they failed miserably. We left feeling incredibly disappointed and angry with this hotel.
