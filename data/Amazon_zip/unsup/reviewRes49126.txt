A bit of a snoozer. Using gdine, we came here in a large group. The salad was decent but my burger was an epic failure. And after asking for mustard I was brought out dijon. How preposterous! You deserve a white glove slap across the face Bin 36. I shall not return to your loathsome restaurant. P.S. When it's 30 degrees outside, please don't have construction people working during the lunch service holding open doors. It kind of, maybe, sort of, lets huge gusts of cold air in. Diners don't need hard nipples while eating.
