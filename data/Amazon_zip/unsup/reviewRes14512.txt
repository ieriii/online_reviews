Not only are their microbrews topnotch, they have bacon encrusted popcorn as an appetizer. Let me say that again .. BACON ENCRUSTED POPCORN. Anyways, it was a great place. I ordered a burger, medium, and you know what? It was actually pink. A lot of places in this city have problems with that. Not only that, we were a party of 4, and after "over consuming", the server brought as back four separate checks which greatly facilitated figuring who owed what. Great beers ... and Matt, our server, took time to explain the process of how each one was made. I definitely recommend their seasonal (which is an Oktoberfest ale, so go and get one, now), as well as any of the IPAs, or the casks.
