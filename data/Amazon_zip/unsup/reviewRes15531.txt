Holy cow. What happened here. I use to love this place and the idea of it being an "exclusive" experience. But it seems a bit run down, it has lost its luster and I was not happy when my specialty cocktail came back all slushed ice to the brim. Things changed. Did management change? I miss the old violet hour. I think i will be moving on to the Whistler when in need of a good cocktail.
