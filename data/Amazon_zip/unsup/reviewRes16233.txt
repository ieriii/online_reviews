This place has been so built up on Yelp. When I ask non-Yelpers, they always give negative reviews of the place, mainly because they didn't read this page first and get all the good tips. Therefore, they were turned away at the door. I got there around 8:30pm on a Saturday and there were no available seats. There is a section for standing only (Note: This does not mean you are on the waiting list.) and we agreed to stand since we were only staying for a drink. Luckily, we spotted a bench in front of the fireplace, and the hostess agreed to let us sit there. I didn't recognize anything on the menu. It really came down to the type of alcohol I wanted. Once I decided on vodka, I just picked the one with the most interesting sounding ingredients. I had no clue what they were though. The waitress was super busy, so we ordered at the bar. The bartenders definitely take their job seriously. Even if you get a seat, go and watch the bartenders at least once because they are amazing. The waitress was also incredibly knowledgeable about the drinks. We didn't use her, but the group sharing the bench with us did, and I was very impressed with her familiarity with all the drinks. I tasted a bit of all the drinks we ordered, and every single one was good, so don't worry about ordering random drinks. The only thing I was slightly disappointed in was the decor. Repeatedly being told that it had an Alice in Wonderland theme made me create this exciting room in my head, especially with a lot of red. However the colors were very dark and neutral. It didn't look bad at all, it just wasn't what I was expecting.
