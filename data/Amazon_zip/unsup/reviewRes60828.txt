I was very excited about this restaurant. It has a great decoration and atmosphere, but I was completely disappointed by the food. I think it's the worst food I had in the city. I don't understand how they could screw up every single dish they prepared. If they fire the chef and turn htings around I may go back, but as long as they have their same chef, I will never go there again.
