So, after our trip to Fleet Feet last night, we went to Garcia's. First off, best chips and salsa ever. The salsa was super fresh and the chips were salty and delicious. I ordered the avocado burrito with cheese on top and my husband had his burrito deep fried with ranchero sauce and cheese. He also had a margarita. The marg was OK. It was a little sweet/watered down for my tastes, but to each his own. We got our food 10-15 minutes after we ordered it. Holy huge burritos! These are seriously some of the biggest burritos I have ever seen. My burrito must have had at least 3 entire avocados in it, along with beans, lettuce, tomatoes and onions. I was only able to eat half of it, and trust me, I'm an experienced burrito eater. It tasted good, but I wasn't blown away by the taste or anything. You do get an INCREDIBLE amount of food for the price, so that's good. If I'm in the hood again I will definitely go back to Garcia's for some cheap grub, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
