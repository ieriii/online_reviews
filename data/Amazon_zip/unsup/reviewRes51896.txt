We came with our groupon, and were disappointed at the food. The place was completely graffiti-ed, even the seats were written on. Our server, Ben, was courteous and served our food quickly. thin crust gino's combination - bad, the crust was burnt but the ingredients on top were raw appetizer combo - not good, the spinach sticks were over fried it's totally a tourist trap and the food bad. DO NOT GO.
