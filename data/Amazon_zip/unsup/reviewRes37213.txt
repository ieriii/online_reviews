Screw you, elitist foodmonger. Your produce section ain't all that. If you're a true gourmet cook's destination, you should have better selection. Same with the cheeses--Whole Foods has you beat there, I think. Secondly, your arrangement's stupid. Here's British jams and jellies on one rack; go around the corner and there's French marmalades on another. Why the segregation? Can't the condiments all just get along? Finally, your prices are just plain insane. Just because you put the corn in nice pretty piles doesn't mean you can charge $0.99/ear--especially since it's the same damned corn Jewel's selling for $0.40. Also, I finally found that ginger marmalade I've been looking for--for FIFTEEN DAMNED DOLLARS A JAR. Mairde! Luckily, I stopped at the Dominick's down the street and found the same thing (only British, not French and fancy-pantsy) for $4.
