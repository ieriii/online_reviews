This restaurant has held it's spot as my favorite restaurant for almost 8 years now. The food here is consistently fresh and all meat is cooked to perfection, no matter how you like it. Tip: If you're a big meat eater, be careful not to fill up on salad at the phenominal salad bar! Customer service here has always been stellar, and at my most recent trip, the manager even came by to chat with us a few times. Drinks are strong, wine is good, meat is literally second to none, and there is not a bad tasting item in this establishment. This will stay as my favorite restaurant for a LONG time!
