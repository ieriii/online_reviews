Oh Publican, what can I say about you? I love you? Yes. Yes I do. I've only been here once but would go back in a heartbeat!  I'm definitely open to trying new things, and this is for sure a place to do that. We started off at a bar table waiting for a real table and munched on some pork rhinds and wine. I remember I picked the wine solely based on the fact that it was in a box, but to my surprise it was pretty damn delicious. Get the box wine! We had asked if we could have a table to ourselves (they have loooooong community tables). They said it might take a little longer but they'd try. It actually didn't take long at all and we were soon sitting in our own little booth with doors that closed us in. How cute! Their service was great, they were very helpful with item menus too. I'm really picky on food based on textures. Weird, I know. But I still entertained the idea of the fried veal brains.
