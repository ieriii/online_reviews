Wakamono is not only my favorite neighborhood restaurant, but also my fav. sushi restaurant. You definitely get the most bang for you buck here, and it's BYOB! The spicy trio roll is def. worth it - you get salmon, tuna, yellowtail roll for $9.  They also feature "Japas" (aka Japanese Tapas), and the steamed sea bass with black bean & ginger is tasty.  I'm also a big fan of the classic makis (only $5 or $6), and love their yellowtail (hamachi) + scallion and spicy scallop.  Wakamono provides the freshest fish at low, reasonable prices, and it's BYOB. Unlike some of the other sushi restaurants in the city (I won't name names here, but a place that rhymes with APONIAS) that are EXTREMELY pretentious, rude, and serve maki rolls that fall apart. ****EDIT***** The Red Snapper sashimi appetizer is so tasty (with ponzu sauce) and tuna tartare is delicious.
