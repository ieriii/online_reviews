let me start by saying we went to Le Colonial in San Fran, and it was one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Unfortunately I cannot say the same about the Chicago location. I took my girlfriend there for Valentine's day and it was not at all what I remembered from our San Fran experience. Perhaps we tried too hard to order different items. We started with one of the spring rolls (because we had a duck spring roll in San Fran that was amazing that we didn't see on the Chicago menu) and it was really overly greasy. I believe my girlfriend had the Sea bass that was fairly bland. The best part was the noodles that came with it, but that shouldn't be the case. I had the duck that was plentiful but again not great flavors. We were extremely disappointed partly due to the food, but more because of the expectations based on the fabulous meal we had in California.
