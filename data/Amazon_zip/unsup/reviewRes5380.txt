I've been here a couple of times for drinks and snacks, and more recently for dinner. The staff has always been helpful with recommendations and tastes of the less common wines, and the food is very good. I particularly enjoyed the octopus, fried brussels sprouts, and the sausage. The only disappointment was the housemate copa, which was almost sweet in the absence of black pepper.
