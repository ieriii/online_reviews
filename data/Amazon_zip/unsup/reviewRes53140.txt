So the impression I got from our first meal was so great that I decided that this was the venue I would like to use for my bridal shower. I spoke to Corinne (the General Manager), booked the space and gave the deposit. About two months later Corinne emailed me and told me the price was not accurate and they would have to charge double to rent the space! WHAT! All of the details were specified on the contract including the rental fee and # of guests. All we herd from Corinne was that we would have to speak to the owner. I am beginning to wonder if he: 1) exists (because we have left several messages and I even sent people over to speak with him directly) 2) knows about the situation 3) understands that he is breaching contract (illegal) and this is completely unprofessional Its now been almost a month of no solution & no response from the owner. I have full right to contact the Attorney General's office and file a complaint. I am just shocked from the lack of concern from the restaurant. Thanks 90 miles ************* so NOW I get a response. Only its not, sorry, its more, you never paid the deposit, you wanted this you wanted that. I believe the exact wording from YOUR EMAIL Corinne, WHICH I HAVE is "I quoted you the wrong price". Don't try and back out now calling it MY fault. I gave the CC info and signed the contract, did you want me to run the credit card too, I'm sorry DO I WORK THERE. You are SO lucky I care more about my event than proving a point or I would SO get a lawyer on this. A contract is an agreement, legally binding agreement. Do you need a reminder of that? -so over this restaurant
