I was here a couple years ago -- and I was dining by myself. I ordered the Chicago style pizza, and the waiter failed to tell me they had an individual size served with salad. There was so much on the menu I overlooked this. But wish the waiter had pointed it out! So there I was, just me, sitting there with this enormous deep dish pizza. I ate two slices and was stuffed. I got the rest to go but when I got back to the hotel realized there was no refrigerator in my room :( So most of that delicious pizza went to waste. It's been two and a half years since I was there so I can't honestly remember how it tasted -- I do remember that I enjoyed it. Chicago has a brewery called "Goose Island" which made me very happy since my name is "oh my gooseness", lol. I had a couple Goose Island beers to wash the pizza down. Yay!
