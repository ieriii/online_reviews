I'll give the food at Sapori a 4 overall, but my experience was a 5. I took my dad here for his 60th. He's a HUGE Italian fan so it was the perfect choice. They printed his name on the menu and brought out a tiramisu with a candle (which was FABULOUS.) He raved about the place and it was a birthday he will remember. I give it a four b/c I was not impressed with the lasagna, my entree. Really, it was nothing special. I also tried the Cappellacci all'Aragosta (i.e. lobster ravioli) which I wish I would have ordered and was vastly superior to the lasagna. Yet, I feel lasagna is the true test of an Italian place and it let me down. Dessert was also fabulous. We got the aforementioned tiramisu and the bread pudding. Both were five stars. In summary, I'd like to give this place 4.5 stars (like its overall rating) but that is not an option. When I go back, I would not be surprised if my rating went up.
