I enjoyed 95% of my Tru dining experience. The food was amazing; flavor presentation, portions, and constuction get A's. There was no shortage of beverage selection; the wine list was atleast 50 pages. Tru is tastefully decorated. The service was outstanding; the wait staff was truly on-top of their game. However, it was eerily quiet. I was afraid to talk it was so quiet. Most places it is too loud to have a conversation, but here it is the exact opposite. I had to hold in laughs for fear of disrupting other patrons. I would not suggest this place for a group larger than 4. The only reason I didn't give Tru 5 stars is because I am afraid to talk inside.
