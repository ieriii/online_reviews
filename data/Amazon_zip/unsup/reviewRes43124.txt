Art of Pizza still remains as one of my favs in the city, especially if you like the thick ooey-gooey style of deep dish. Thin crust/NY style loyalists beware! I really enjoy the bright tomato flavor of their sauce, and the crust has just enough exterior crispness to hold in all that delicious cheese. Bonus 5th star for delivering from Lakeview all the way up to Lincoln Square!
