I was in town visiting a friend for the weekend and we stopped by yolk for breakfast in the morning (more like afternoon). This was my second time coming to yolk and both times it's been pretty busy when we get there. Not too long of a wait at all, though. The menu had a lot to choose from. I had the eggs florentine which was very good, a bit too much tomato, but still very good. The service is quick and very helpful. I'll definitely be going next time I'm in town!
