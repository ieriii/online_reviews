The quick quest for the "spicy pork rinds" from FoodNetwork's "The best thing I ever ate...." turned into.... meal #6 in less than 24 hours. Still full, outta the cab, and into... the pig pen. I almost laughed out loud -- people in groups of four were sitting in what used to be pig pens, I imagine. But the din of the place, the young professionals, decked out in their Chicago style wouldn't let you mistaken it for anything less than one of the trendiest places in town. Service was attentive, and beer selection was paralyzing... and like i said, the quest for the rinds turned into.... duck heart salad and oyster -- clearwater and kumamotos. Go with the kumamotos... very sweet and bite size.
