Awesome seafood, great service, reasonable prices! After seeing Glenn's on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, I have been eagerly anticipating their seafood for a couple of months. Glenn's lived up to my high expectations.  If you are coming for the all you can eat crab legs on Tuesday, make a reservation!  We had one and were seated ASAP.  The hostess and server were friendly and quick to meet needs. The crab legs were large, juicy, and very high quality.  The order initially comes with two, then you can order additional legs one at a time. We tried the scallop and mussel appetizers and I thought everything was fresh and well prepared. I will be back to try their fish.
