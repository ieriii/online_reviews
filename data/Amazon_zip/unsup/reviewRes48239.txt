My Publican patronage brought forth two realizations concerning food. 1. Although I appreciate and respect shellfish, I actually hated eating oysters. 2. Despite normally being a medium steak kind of guy I was kind of weirded out by the steak tartar. It tasted fine...but something about straight raw beef after being raised eating well-done just doesn't sit right. The lighting was warm, the centralized washroom sink was cool, and the decor was inviting. All of the staff we interacted with were extremely friendly (although they were a bit salesperson-y at times). Apparently $$$ restaurants offer primarily beers that aren't always the easiest to find and because of this carry higher price tags. I think the highlights for me had to be the fisherman's stew (which went over great with all 6 at the table) and the country ribs. Most of the dishes we ordered were split amongst 6 people and with all of us having interest in trying many dishes we slowly watched as the bill rose exponentially. Good overall experience. I would definitely recommending checking it out at least once.
