I went back to L&E with some buddies. We were hell bent on getting the most interesting items on the menu, and they did not disappoint, neither in terms of uniqueness or deeeeeelish-ness. The Foie Gras... melt in your mouth amazing. The Roasted Marrow Bones? Deeeelish. Pork Belly Confit... incredible and prepared perfectly. They also have a few rooms above, making this not only my favorite restaurant, but an Inn as well. The rooms are really cool, and you can check them out on L&E's website. Love this place.
