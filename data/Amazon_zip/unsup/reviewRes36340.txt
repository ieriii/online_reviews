In case you're wonderting, Meli is Greek for honey.  Anyway, Meli uses very high quality ingredients. The food is good, the service is fast and the coffee is tasty.  I would give the coveted 5-star rating, but I wish the menu was bigger. For example, the omlettes are great, but there aren't many to choose from.
