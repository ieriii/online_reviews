YUMMY!!! The atmosphere is a little weird but cool. Our waitress was very nice. She greeted us and asked us which table we wanted to sit at. lol. We sat down and they brought us water with a piece of mint in it. I thought that was cool. I normally see lime in water but this was new. So the waitress didn't come to our table for a few minutes but I think she was the only waitress there at the moment. She finally came over and we ordered. I got the strawberry crepe with nutella and some coffee. The crepe apparently came with a scoop of ice cream. Mmm. The crepes came out pretty quick. Oh wow. It was so good. The strawberries were fresh and sweet. The cream was fresh too. It also had the perfect amount of chocolate. Not too much but enough. I totally finished that in like three minutes. LOL!!! SO GOOD!! I definitely recommend this place. If you want a giant serving thats going to fill you until you explode then this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for a nice, chill place with great tasting crepes then check this place out. It wasn't too pricey either. 15 bucks for two big crepes and two coffees. ::drools::
