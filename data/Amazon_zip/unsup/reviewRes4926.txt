Once again, Love this place. This time, my boyfriend and I asked about the wait time (hour fifteen) but headed straight for an empty chair and place setting (yes, single empty chair) and started our dinner. He was standing behind me as I was passing a plate back. Our server/bartender was awesome! When the ladies chatting over after dinner WATERS moved their bag, our server/bartender asked if he could sit there. Great food, great staff, and great people who come here! We were good customers and enjoyed our time but got out of their once our meal was over. We got hazelnut ice cream to-go and gave up our bar seats to a lovely couple who was apparently waiting for those women STILL chatting away with their after dinner WATERS. So my boyfriend and I walked home (a few blocks) with the beautiful Christmas lights adorning the trees, our ice cream in hand, talking about the wonderful time we had. How romantic :)
