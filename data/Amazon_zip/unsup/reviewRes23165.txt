I have proclaimed this place my favorite burrito in the city of Chicago. I do this because it is just so simple: Steak (never has been over cooked), rice, tomatoes, sour cream and it has never let me down. My only beef has been slow delivery times. The quickest they have gotten to me (and I am not that far from them) has been an hour. This most recent time they did bring me the wrong order, which was a veggie burrito. I would not recommend that.  The emanadas I ordered were decent enough. The chicken was dry in that variety, but the cheese and meat/potatoes were good enough to eat.  All in all, I keep coming back for the burritos.
