Seriously. This is probably one of the most pretentious places i have been to in Chicago. And been to a lot. Service was HORRIBLE. Simply HORRIBLE. Bar service was extremely slow. Hostesses were rude and unhelpful and the waiter was simply stupid. Up side. the food was not that bad. Although a little generic. Save your money and your time.
