Here I was staying for 3 nights in a hotel that I thought would wow me and yet it did not. Let's see - It looked like my room had not been vacuumed, there was dust and the bathroom mirror, when the steam hit it after my shower had writing on it from the previous occupant; so that was not clean. 2nd day we were there, there was no coffee for the coffee maker and when I called and asked for some to be delivered the person who answered the phone sounded upset that I had even called. The concierge was snooty.  Overpriced for the value.
