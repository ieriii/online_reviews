Cozy atmosphere with a very earthy feel. They definitely promote local businesses and endeavors--if you go into the lounge, it's loaded with tons of brochures and fliers of local artists, musicians, etc. My friend and I got cupcakes: strawberry lemon (buttercream frosting) and the red velvet (cottage cream frosting). I wasn't fan of either frosting--they're too thick and actually quite hard but my friend preferred the cottage cream over butter cream. The cakes itself are pretty firm (and slightly stale) up top and get softer and moisture closer to the bottom which makes me wonder how long they've been sitting there for. So my take on their cupcakes is only OK. I really do like the quiet lounge next door. Slightly low lighting as it gets darker but it has spacious tables and big chairs.
