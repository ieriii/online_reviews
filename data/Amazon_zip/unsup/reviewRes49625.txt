The food is delicious! I ordered the 'matrimonio', a plate with fried plantains, delicious yuca, and roasted potatoes with a big hunk of steak and perfectly flavored chicken breast. The plate was humongous and I couldnt finish my meal. Prices were reasonable and its BYOB. Also our server was hilarious, I'm not sure of his name. A must try!
