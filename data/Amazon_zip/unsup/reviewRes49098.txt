The Sunday night family dinner is a really good deal for forty five bucks plus fifteen for wine pairings. I am a huge fan of pork so that helped, but I even got to try sand dabs for the first time. The complaints about the layout and design have some merit, but the room is spectacular. That said, the seating a common tables even by reservation is a bit weird. The service was knowledgeable and efficient, so I say four stars.
