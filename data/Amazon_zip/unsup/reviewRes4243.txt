This bar is not like any other that I've been to in Chicago. The live music is great, and I love that the doormen warn you to keep your voices low. If I want to hear drunk chicks "WOO" all night, I'd go to Wrigleyville. The inside of Green Mill is so cool; it is decorated very old fashioned and classy; there is a large statue of a woman in the corner. The bartenders make great cocktails - I always get a side car when I'm here. It is hard to get a seat sometimes, but it's the only place that I actually don't mind standing. People don't want to leave once they get a table, and I don't blame them. My only gripes are 1. the bathooms (in an awkward location next to the band, and also I've heard the men's room is disgusting) and 2. they only accept American Express and cash. I love this place as a chill option when I don't feel like party-ing but I still want to go out and have fun.
