Savory crepes for the win... I'm not really sure what to write about this place - it's really simple, casual and straightforward and always dependable for good crepes. I love all the soups they provide with the meal, but my favorite is the veggie soup they always have (sorry, not sure of the base veggies) with a good dallop of the provided hot sauce. I'm also really into restaurants on busy street corners. Just feels homey or cozy or something. I don't know. Maybe it's because it's BYO - yeah, that makes me feel at home too, I guess!
