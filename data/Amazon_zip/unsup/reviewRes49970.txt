Went out here for the roommate's birthday. I was starving and more so than usual. Waited on his friend to arrive. The free sangria that is available through the online coupon was pretty good. I downed that in no time plus his friend gave me hers. We tried the combination empanadas and they were decent. Nothing really that great, I'd had better. For entree I went with the combination skirt steak and shrimp. They cooked it rare just how I like it and it was well marinated. The shrimp were great especially with some of the marinade and juices from the steak. The sides weren't my thing. Some plantain, yuca and slice of a potato, rustic yes delicious no. Not a bad place for a quick meal and decently priced too.
