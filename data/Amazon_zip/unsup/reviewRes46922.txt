I have seen this for a while and have been like "yeah, whatever... gentrified/hipster/eco-hippie shit." Don't care. Then I had a friend come into town and want to eat there. I rolled my eyes but she was a guest so like, when you have a guest you try to be all hospitable and crap so I was all like "Fine, Bitch." and we walked there. I had the roast beef sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was VERY, VERY, VERY good! I mean good enough that I would like to go back and have another! But I'm going incognito...Can't have people suddenly thinking that I'm some friggin' hippie or something.
