This place is just OK. I wanted to like it, I really did. I think the biggest problem was the attitude of the owner. He is very rude and is more interested in the drama between the wait staff then the experience of the guests. At least that is the way it was when we were there last week. The food was average not good enough to make me deal with the DRAMA.
