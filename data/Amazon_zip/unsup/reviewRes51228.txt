first of all, where else can you get kentucky eggs or yankee eggs in one place? talk about civil-war-mason-dixon-line. they're even next to each other on the menu :) was that planned? second of all, do yankees or kentuckians really make such namesake eggs? i'm a yankee and i never had such a thing. so maybe i'm not a yankee, but i liked my yankee eggs.  however, there was a little too much sour cream and grease for me...but then again, i'm not out riding a horse in the cavalry all day. oh, and don't forget to look up at the ceiling or gallup through the art gallery hallway to the bathroom. great place, fun art, very good coffee, but it left me a little iffy on the yankee grease. i'll go back to have more good times with the menu names.
