I really wanted to LOVE this place ... really, I did. The decor, the concept - in the middle of Bridgeport! But the service ... omg the service. I've experienced better at the drive thru window of a fast food chain. The food was good, a little bit pricey for the amount they give you but I suppose the label "organic" comes with the price tag. The coffee was delicious, robust, a big kicker to a tired morning - loved it. Now onto the service. As soon as we walked in, we were seated by the friendly owner, I believe, and I thought "this is gonna be great!" We quickly made up our minds on what to order and waited for a server to come around. 5 minutes later, a waitress walks up to our table "I'll be right back to take your order," then another 10 minutes of absolutely nothing. A waitress just happened to notice that we were sitting there looking around for our lost server and took our order instead. Our coffee came out but we had no sweetener/sugar. So I got up and looked around and picked some up off the cook's counter. Our food was served very quickly - that was nice. But I needed pepper ... so again, we got up and looked for a salt & pepper shaker ourselves. Shouldn't this stuff be standard on a table? At one point, we ran out of coffee and contemplated getting that ourselves as well, since we'd practically been our own servers. It's very unfortunate and disappointing - everything seems to fall into place here except the service. And our server was so nice too. Maybe it'll get better, but from what I've heard, the service I received was as good as it gets.
