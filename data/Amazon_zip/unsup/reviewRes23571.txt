Four other friends and I shared a deluxe hot pot. It was about $25pp (including tax and tip). The food was good and all you can eat, but I think $25pp is pricey for hot pot (at least compared to places in LA), and the service was nonexistent. The restaurant wasn't even full, and we had to ask for water refills and new plates several times.
