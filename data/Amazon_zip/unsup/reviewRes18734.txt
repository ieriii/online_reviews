Coming back here 51 weeks after my first visit was some serious deja vu. - It was again Lit Fest weekend. (Sadly, I so rarely make it to River North that I went through six months of cold without being able to have a caldo or some bean-to-cup hot chocolate.) - I was with my husband and his supergeek BFF again. - Lanie Bayless was once again hostessing AND her arm was once again injured (last year, sling; this year, brace). - No Rick sighting (he was out of town). - Our wait was again about 20 minutes, not too shabby, they go as quick as they can. - The same woman at the register told us again that they were having credit card issues and could only take cash. - We again sat along the wall looking out onto the outdoor seating area. We did not, however, order the same things. I went for a chicken tinga torta this year, and chips and salsa instead of guacamole. The torta was awesomely delicious, with fantastic roasted tomato, just the right amount of queso anejo, and I wanted to lick out the bowl of salsa verde. We were also sufficiently stuffed that we did not manage any churros. Which I am sad about. But there's always next year, right? PS They now serve all caldos after 11 a.m. -- no more waiting until 3. I WILL have you, pozole, just you wait...
