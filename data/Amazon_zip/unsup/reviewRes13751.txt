Bacon fat popcorn - cheesy, bacony = WIN Mussels - blue cheesy, apple-y = WIN Forest burger - shroomy, gorgonzola-y, crispy shalloty, juicy, gigantic-y = WIN The beer is also pretty dang good too. This place is big and open. Very modern. You can see the beer tanks in back. This place will always probably be crowded, however, despite the masses that have already massed at 7pm on a Monday, I felt like we really didn't have to wait long. I said "FEED ME!" and I done got fed. WIN.
