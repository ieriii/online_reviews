One of the best dining experiences. The food is prime, the experience is amazing, even their soda, they make themselves- and they are GOOD. The start was a series of edible cocktails. Quite a pleasent surprise. The play with texture, color and taste of the food is amazing!. The portions are just enough for you to get the real taste and experience, but small enough to keep you wanting more. The suspense of what comes next is part of the amazing experience! You will be wow-ed from beginning to end.
