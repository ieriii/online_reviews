I LOVE coast (Disclaimer: I don't have a seasoned pallet .... I have only dabbled in sushi over the last couple of years)! The ambiance is cute and intimate, the food is delicious, and what is better than a byob?!?! Bottom line ... it can get a little nosiey and often very busy (make a reservation on the weekend)----- but overall, this place is great to go with a group of friends and have a bottle of wine (or 2) and eat some good sushi (apple appetizer and white dragon roll!).
