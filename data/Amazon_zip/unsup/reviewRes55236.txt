Meat lovers paradise. My husband and I went here for my birthday three years ago and it was fantastic. IF you love red meat then you'll love this place. The salad bar is huge! The meats are juicy and flavorful. The staff was top notch. And they even came out with a special birthday dessert for me- I only wish I had my camera to take a picture. It really was a wonderful time for us. I've gone to Texas de Brazil and find Fogo de Chao less crowded and the staff more attentive.
