Some first class Chicago style dogs, but I will be going back for the Onion Chips (like rings, only less circular). My coworker had a burger, which he raved about the rest of the afternoon. We originally were going to go to Hot Doug's, but they were closed for vacation, so screw em, we went the old school route. Just a reminder, cash only.
