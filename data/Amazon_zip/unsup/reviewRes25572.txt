Best cheese fondue ever. They add cherry brandy and white wine, which makes for one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Have tried the shrimp, tenderloin, chicken, and scallops...all fantastic, especially with the sauces they give you. And don't skip the orange chocolate dessert! Restaurant is very dark and somewhat crowded, but it is also very romantic and unique. Great for special occasions. However, if you're looking to deep fry meat/vegetables in oil, eat varieties of chocolate fondue with caramel and oreos, or have a girls night out with martinis, I recommend the Melting Pot.
