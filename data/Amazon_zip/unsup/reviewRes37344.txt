How can one not love Fox & Obel? Once you get over the sticker shock, you will fall in love with this store. They bake dozens of different breads, desserts, etc, and have an extensive sushi area. They have amazing to-go salads, sandwiches, and soups. If you want to impress friends/family that you can actually cook (without actually cooking), then Fox & Obel is the way to go.
