I am stunned that so many people praise the pizza at La Villa. I tried three pizzas there tonight: one thin crust, one stuffed and one pan. They were all bad. The sauce tasted like it was out of a can, the flavorless crust was far too thick for a stuffed pizza, the toppings were utterly unimpressive. I will not eat it again.
