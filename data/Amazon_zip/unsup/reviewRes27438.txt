After waiting for at least a year to try this place, I was finally able to make a reservation and check out Rick Bayless' famous restaurant on my most recent trip back to Chicago! Being a huge foodie, of course I would have to try out a Top Chef restaurant! The decor and music makes the whole experience all the more fun. We were seated promptly and service was great. Our drinks (mojito and magarita) were prepared wonderfully as well! But now onto the food...we ordered two entree: Poc Chuc de Puerco and Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena. Both were suggestions from our server and absolutely delicious! There was more than enough food for the two of us and the prices are very reasonable! The one regret I have is not ordering the Ceviche sampler, as many a table had one! There's always next time...
