I've been here multiple times and each time I experience friendly, knowledgable service. In my experience, this has become a rarity in most dining establishments. I am not a seafood fan and I feel like a lot of their menu highlights seafood-based options, however, there are adequare alternatives that have all been satisfactory. It's a plesant environment - nothing fancy, but far better than your average bar n' grill.
