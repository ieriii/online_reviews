I really wanted to love this place. I love latin cuisine and it is 2 blocks from my house and always smells amazing and looks beautiful. But... I am sad to say that I found the food to be just ok. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. The interior is so beautiful and festive that I will probably still go back... maybe for drinks.  I ordered the fish tacos appetizer and kona ceviche. First of all, nothing tasted spicy to me! Second, the flavors were just ok-- simple, a little bland, although fresh. For the price you pay here, I'd rather go to Nacional 27 or a Rick Bayless restaurant. Fun decor, though. And decent mojitos.
