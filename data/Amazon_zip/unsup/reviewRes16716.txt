I am an experienced indian buffet connisseur. India Garden and Gaylord's are way better. Even the dingy indian buffet just east of the belmont el stop is better. The meat here is way too dry and does not work with the sauce. Nothing stands out, all is typical. I rated it so low, not because it is a dump, but because the alternatives are much better options. They had fish tikka masala, which I've never seen before, but the fish was also dry. The only reason I gave it two stars was because of the mango sorbet... it was delicious. Tandori chicken (brought to the table) was good. Also expensive. About 15 bucks before tip.
