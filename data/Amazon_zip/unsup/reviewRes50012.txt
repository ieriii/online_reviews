Wow, they let us use our Groupon on a Sat.night! This is our second time at this restaurant and each time we have been extremely happy with our selections. We had a party of 6 last night with some of us arriving earlier than the others. We were seated on time and ordered drinks and appetizers for the table. The appetizers came about the time that the rest of our group did. (Empanada combination plate and Chorizo con Arepa)They were able to nibble while looking at the menu. This is not a place to go if you are a vegetarian. This is a place for meat eaters. Each of us had something different...Entrana (skirt steak), Pollo al Ajillo(chicken).Langostios al Carbon (shrimp), Churrasco ( NY strip), and Lomo de Cerdo Estofado (pork). The steaks arrived as ordered (med rare)The plates are sizzling hot. We barely had enough room to share one dessert...coconut flan. Each of us had leftovers to take home. Expect to pay about $45 each, but I think it was well worth it.
