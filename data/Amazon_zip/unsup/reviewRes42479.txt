Went here for the first time and it was everything I expected...good food, fast and at a great price. My family and I went for lunch on a Sunday and as any good restaurant should be, it was packed. We were seated pretty much right away at a table that only fit our party. However, I think that they have a family style seating arrangement when your party is smaller. Wherever and with whomever you sit with the food will be the same. We ordered 3 bowls of Pho, #89, spring rolls, an order of fried egg rolls and a Chinese broccoli dish. The food came fast and we were out of there in less than an hour. The Pho came with a huge amount of bean sprouts, mint and limes (but I thought it was delicious without any of it). The broth was so tasty and the noodles/beef were cooked perfectly. Everything was delicious!!! Ive been going to Argyle (to eat and grocery shop) since I can remember (so Ive had my share of Pho) and this by far the best place to have it!
