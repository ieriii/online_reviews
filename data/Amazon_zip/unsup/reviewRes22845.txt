we wanted to try hotdougs but they were closed for which seem like building renovation. so we ended up at the superdawg drive-in. the superdawg was ok, but nothing extra special. i've had chicago dog from other places in the past and they look and tastes about the same. i think you come to this place more for the experience. but the iconic place is still worth a trip and a good photo opp at least once if you ever are in chicago.
