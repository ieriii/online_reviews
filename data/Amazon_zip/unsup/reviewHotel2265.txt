I stayed at this hotel for a conference the week of June 4. The conference facilities are nice, and what one would expect from a hotel located in a downtown district. The rooms were clean, and updated with a contemporary look. The lobby is large and open. The pros: -location -staff is very helpful and friendly -lobby bar is lively and serves decent drinks The cons: -the wifi access throughout the facility is spotty and extremely cumbersome. Being there for a conference, I was also working. I needed reliable access for the multiple devices I travel with. One can login as a guest in one's room, but when one tries to login on the conference levels, the same network is either unavailable or unusable. Same is true when trying to access via the lobby -- there is a separate network, apparently, for each of these areas. My iPhone was virtually unusable via wifi outside of my room, same for my iPad. The 3G access is awful as well. Text messages between myself and a colleague (also staying at the same hotel) were spotty -- either not arriving at all or taking several minutes to arrive. If you're considering staying here as a business traveler, I would recommend one of the many other options in the immediate vicinity. Obviously, based on the above, I place a premium on broadband internet access which has colored this review. Fast, reliable access is a must for me and the hotel fell woefully short in this regard. That said, it was a perfectly acceptable experience outside of the wifi issues, and based on the moderate price, might be a good choice for those looking for a room in the heart of the magnificent mile. There is extremely easy walking access to multiple great restaurants, and the art institute is just a nice stroll down Michigan Ave away.
