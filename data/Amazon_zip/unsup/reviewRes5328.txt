Very, very tasty. We had the pork fried almonds, braised baby artichokes, pig's ear, and the eggplant caponata with goat cheese. The winner was definitely the pig's ear. Served with super crispy kale and a fried egg over easy in a pig bowl (yes, a pig shaped bowl), the crispy pig ear is definitely a must when dining here. The atmosphere is super fun, and the waiters very knowledgeable about the extensive wine menu.  Would love to go back!
