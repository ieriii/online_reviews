I have been to Chicago a few times for business, and I have stayed here the last 2 times. I am very pleased with the ammenities this Hotel comes with, and how nice the rooms are. The beds are very comfortable and they even have comforters instead of the basic stiff quilts that are provided at most Hotels.
