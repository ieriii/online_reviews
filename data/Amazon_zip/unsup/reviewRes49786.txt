Rolled into town and had read about this place on the way. Great wine list and tapas-style dishes. Did the cheese flight (there are good American cheeses after all!) and a nice plate of charcuterie, with some great wines. Extremely friendly staff and actually chatted away with the owner for a bit. Would definitely go back.
