I Met up with a friend at The Purple Pig a year ago. Had cell phones never been invented, I may very well be left my friend sitting alone all night. The gem was nicely hidden. My initial reaction as I walked into the restaurant was the coziness. It's "sit side-by-side with strangers" cozy. One long bar table across the middle of the place. Group parties not recommended.  I also notice the number of good looking people. Not only good looking, but stylish men and women! So if you're single, look your best and check it out with a friend. As for the food...till this day, I don't know how to describe it. I liked it, but didn't love it. There were ingredients in the dish that may not taste so great alone, however paired with something unexpected, the results were amazing. For example, I tried a dish with butternut squash served with pesto. Anything squash for me is a bust, but this dish was just YUM-MY! My favorite and it did come highly recommended; Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. The meat was tender and it has this odd herbal taste to it, but I can't describe it. I have to go back to try some more.  Many people have gone to the Girl and the Goat and when asked what I've thought of it, I often say it reminds me very much of The Purple Pig. However no one I've spoke with has tried The Purple Pig. So if you've tried Girl and the Goat, give Purple Pig a try and tell me if I'm way out of line.
