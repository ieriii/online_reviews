we went to Garcias for the first time last night. My husband and I live 5 minutes away and my parents were in town wanting to go out to eat. My dad loves combo meals at mexican restaurnats and we wanted to try it.  very clean and friendly. the meals we had probably were not the best things to order there. I am vegan and had kind of a hard time getting no cheese or sour cream. my family all eats meat though, so they were happy.  they put so much cheese on everything, it was overload. good, clean, family friendly AFFORDABLE mexican food. we will go again for sure!
