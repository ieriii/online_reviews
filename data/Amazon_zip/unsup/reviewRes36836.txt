Ordered from this place for dinner a few nights ago. Thought it was expensive until I saw the size and quantity of everything. Definitely worth the price, especially for the amount and quality. Not the best sushi I've ever had but certainly up there. The fish eggs especially (my favorite) were very good and tasted fresh.
