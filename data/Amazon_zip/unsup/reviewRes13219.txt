This is the place I take my girlfriend whenever I do something stupid. Yes, it is so good that it will actually get you out of the doghouse! You can order anything on the menu and it will be amazing! If you want some of the best seafood in Chicago, without having to go to some posh bourgeoisie joint, then this is your place. The all you can eat King crab night is not only a dinner, but an amazing experience! Get reservations for the king crab night, cause it fills up. Great selection of beer and cereal, yes thats right, they have every kind of cereal you could ever want. A real jewel in the city, go check it out.
