The food is incredible and the atmosphere is very Tommy Bahama. I just had a few complaints about our waitress (we went with 5 people) - we got there very early and were the only table there. We waited 10 minutes for our waitress to make an appearance and get our drink order. Then she brought out all of our food at once (salads, soup and entrees) so there was NO room on our table. Some of the items needed explaining because they had to be combined (noodles/cilantro in the soup) but she didn't explain what was being served. Our table was so full it was hard to tell what went with what along with no room to eat - it was very odd.  Overall the food was amazing but hard to appreciate each dish because of the huge amount of food on our table. Finally we had to hunt down our waitress to get the check....she was MIA for 30 minutes while the eaten food sat on our table. Maybe she was new? I will definitely go back but just a very odd experience.
