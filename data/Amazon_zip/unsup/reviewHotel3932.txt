My wife and I booked a room at the Congress Plaza Hotel. We found what looked like a water cockroach in our bathroom. We called the front desk and was put on hold for over 10 minutes without explanation. Two staff members who did not identify themselves showed up at our room door. When we told them there was a large insect in our bathroom, they immediately denied the existence of the bug. They went in and quickly glaned inside the bathroom and maintained their denial of such insect. I had to literally point it out to them in order for them to believe me. They identified it as a water bug that comes up through the toilet. What did they do? They flushed it down the toilet! Right after they said that's where it came from! They did not remove the bug from the room or kill it. Finally the front desk took us off hold on the phone. I informed them of what happened, and they said they only had 1 room in the entire hotel to offer if we wanted to change, but it was much smaller. Whether or not that was true is yet to be revealed but at that time I did not believe it. The next day we checked out and was not asked whether we enjoyed our stay, so we took the liberty of once again voicing our displeasure. We were comped a free breakfast which honestly made no impact on our confidence of this hotel. Why would we eat at a place we feel does not put priorty in cleanliness of their guest rooms? The front desk attendant apologized on behalf of the hotel and we never spoke to the manager face to face.  Overall, the only thing worse than finding a roach the size of your thumb sitting on your toothbrush, is the inexplicable indifference shown by the management to resolve our extreme discomfort over the whole situation. Never again will I stay here, nor will I recommed to anyone.
