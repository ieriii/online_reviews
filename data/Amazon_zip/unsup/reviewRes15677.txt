I've been going here since 1991 and it is still one of my favorite restaurants for dine-in or delivery. The food is consistently great whether you go on tues. for lunch or on a busy sat. nite. The King Crab Legs are my benchmark to which I compare ALL other restaurants, in any price range and Calo keeps winning. The seafood something (also on the menu "at market price" ) is also fantastic and easily enough for 3 people. When I order delivery it is always hot, prompt and just as good as the dine-in. Did I say I love this place?
