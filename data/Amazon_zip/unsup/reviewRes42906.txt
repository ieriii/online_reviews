I ordered a salad from Fogo 2 Go for pickup. My coworkers have ordered pizza and chicken from them many times and have always been satisfied. The salad did not go over so well. 1. All of the ingredients except from the cucumbers and lettuce were from a can which was not mentioned at all on the menu. The salad was not served in a fresh baked bread bowl as described. This may be because it was carry-out but should have been mentioned at time of order. 2. As you would expect from many places the salads are most likely pre-made and spend some time in a refrigerator. HOWEVER. I received my salad and the cucumbers were so old that they were completely rotten puddles of slime on the lettuce. I have had experiences with this before after forgetting a cucumber in my fridge for a few weeks. 3. Two insects right on top of the salad in addition to one black hair. 4. The pita bread would have been good if it were intended to be a roof shingle. Here's the thing. I know what to expect when I'm buying a $6.00 salad from a pizza/chicken joint . I wasn't waiting on something gourmet or especially delicious. Just something to get me through lunch that wasn't greasy. But ROTTEN food is completely unacceptable. Not to mention all the shit that was in it. Whoever is working there can at least pop the box open and see how old the food is they are selling to people. The reason for the second star. The manager handled this well. I had a fresh salad delivered to me which in all honesty I did not eat. It was still canned food on a bed of lettuce. Like I said, their pizza and chicken always seems fine and the guys enjoy it. Just respect what goes out your door and you won't get responses like this.
