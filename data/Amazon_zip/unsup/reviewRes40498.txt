Food was fine, service was fine. BUT. After paying, we walked out. 2 minutes later, I realized I had left my sunglasses on the table. I went back, and although our table hadn't yet been cleared, my sunglasses were gone. Everyone played dumb. C'mon, I wasn't born yesterday, folks. I'll never be 100% sure what happened, but it's beyond a reasonable doubt in my mind. You steal my stuff, you get 1 star. Period.
