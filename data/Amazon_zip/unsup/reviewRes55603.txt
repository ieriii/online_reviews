Today I was amazed, so amazed I had to open an account at YELP to tell the word about it. My husband had the breakfast burrito which was awesome. It is rolled tight and then the tortilla is grilled, so everything is nice and compact, not messy like most burritos. He loved it. It was freaking huge as most of there food seems to be. I had their version of a BLT-which is bacon and ham. Everything was fabulous. O.M.G! AMAZING! Our waitress Marcy made our first experience a very enjoyable one. She was great, and her sense of humor made our S. Pats day even better. Thanks to Groupon I discovered a perfect restaurant today. If there's one restaurant I'd recommend here in the city from now on, it's Cafe 28 FOR SURE!
