Updating and upgrading my last review! I really love Meli's!! There were a ton of people there today (Sunday) and my wait for 3 people was still under 20 minutes. I think the service is great and the food is fantastic! The menu is huge. We couldn't decide if we wanted to get eggs or sweets, so we ordered 3 meals to split - a Meli smorgasbord!! The turkey sausage scramble was excellent (especially with some hot sauce); the red skin potatoes were soft and perfectly cooked. Then the sweet finales... the pumpkin french toast... yummmm, moist, a little spicy, so good! The banana pecan waffle... really good! It seems like the waffle has fallen off the brunch menu at most places, being replaced with only pancakes or french toast, but Meli's has a whole list of waffles!! I finally tried the fresh juice today - the orange, carrot, honey combo was really good, not too thick, but pulpy and fresh! Definitely got my vitamins in this morning! The smoothies at the table next to mine looked really good too, topped with loads of whipped cream. I guess I'll just have to go back until I can taste all the yummy items on the menu!
