I dint know whey I'm even reviewing Ruth Chris, there are currently 200+ yelps and this one feels as though I'm just throwing another penny into the fountain. Well here it goes. You cannot go wrong if you go to Ruth Chris (as long as you're not a vegetarian). The service is top notch, decor is deeply Republican but tastefully done, food is amazing. What can you say bad about a steak that is sizzling in clarified butter? If you are a fan of that short lived comedy skit Lil bush, the next time I eat here I want to say Rah Rah Rah while drinking my Manhattan and eating my New York Strip.
