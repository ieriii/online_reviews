this place is one of my favorite coffeeshops in chicago. the atmosphere is laid back, the food is yummy, and there is free wireless internet. also, most of the people who work there are really nice.  they offer special drinks for the seasons. the best is the mint mocha, and the apple cider in winter. for summer they will have a lovely mint iced tea. i lalso love the spritz cookies and the cranberry walnut bar.  one con is that this place can get cold if you are sitting there for awhile in the winter. but it's great to sit outside on the patio in the summer. i definitely recommend hanging out here!
