Hopleaf clearly doesn't need anymore reviews, but I'll give it one anyway. FANTASTIC. A beer list in its own leather bound book. Creative dishes prepared well - try the CB&J with mac n' cheese. Great atmosphere, especially in the back by the wood burning stove. Excellent service - the place was stuffed to the gills on the Tuesday night we were there with 7 others, but they cobbled together a table fairly quickly. Wish bars like this existed where I live... tough to get a Chicago-feel in California.
