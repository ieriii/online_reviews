Negatives:the oily smell of hair and clothing when you leave the place. Revolting.Also very crowded and small, narrow walkways. Also, how are you supposed to see your food? If you come here make sure to bring a flashlight powerful enough for a dark cave! Could not even read the bill when it came! Otherwise, the low lighting made it seem romantic yada yada. And also the wine bottles on the shelves and the atmosphere with the guitar-playing had its benefits. It's very crowded-must have reservations! We pushed our reservation back the same day we went, and the staff was very accomodating. (complementary coat check available is nice as well)The food was comendable but expensive. The cheese fondue was amazing, especially with apples and grapes. I had the seafood deluxe which consisted of two shrimp, two lobster tails, and scallops. Seemed meager, but I was stuffed anyways. It's hard to cook seafood without it falling off the forks. Scallops were the best part by far. Chocolate fondue was perfect consistency and it was delicious. Wish there were more choices for dipping! Overall, a unique dining experience, which should be shared with friends or a loved one!
