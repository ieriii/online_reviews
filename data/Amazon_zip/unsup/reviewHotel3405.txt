The location was fantastic. The room was great - spacious, comfortable, attractive decor. The free Wi-Fi was nice, as the 3G signal in the area was at a crawl. We used a Groupon and I was asked to login at the front desk rather than being allowed to use my iPhone app so we could print the voucher, which I wasn't terribly comfortable doing. So why am I giving The Allerton only two stars? Two words: hot water. As in, there was none at all the morning we checked out. Not even at 11 a.m. (Luckily, all we had on the agenda after checking out was schlepping to the airport.) When I mentioned this at check-out, I was first mistaken for someone else that had called down to complain about the hot water situation, then unapologetically informed that 300 other people had checked out this morning.  Really? You're a hotel. The two very basic things you provide are a bed and a shower.
