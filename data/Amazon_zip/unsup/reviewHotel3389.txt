Rooms were bit on the small side but had everything we needed and was centrally located on Michigan Ave. We were literally steps away from shopping, dining, tourist spots, and transit. Front desk staff was extremely friendly and upgraded my room to a corner room at no extra cost. Our room was clean and comfy, everything to hope for. I'm sure if we were larger people or had 3 or more staying in the room it would have felt cramped (especially w/ the bathroom) but we're not so it was perfect. Bed's were comfortable and the room had several windows to enjoy the city views; also included in the rooms: 42in LCD TV, iPod dock alarm clock, & safe The property had a surprisingly spacious gym on the top floor (take elevator all the way up and then use the staircase to the next highest floor... looks a bit sketchy) with great views of the Water Tower. The gym had several TV's and cardio machines for guest use, also towels & water. Probably the only thing that's a downer are the tiny & slow elevators, figures since it's an old classic hotel that's been heavily updated & remodeled. Tips: walk over to the Avenue hotel next door to hail a taxi during busy times... a lot quicker. Buy your own water for the room at Walgreen's on the next block since the tiny Vos water's in the in-room fridge cost $5. There's no free Internet or unlocked wireless networks but there is 4G reception if you have miFi device features on your smartphone. The 2nd floor M-Lounge is open until Midnight every night.
