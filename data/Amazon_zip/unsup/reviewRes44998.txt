Hate to be cliche and give five stars, but I can't think of anything wrong with this place. I was visiting friends who live in Chicago, and they took me to dinner here, saying it's "The" Chicago Pizza. Went just before 7 on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy understandably - wait time was 30-45 minutes, but you can pre-order, so our pizza was ready almost as soon as we sat down - it was really not a bad waiting experience at all. We got a medium for us two girls and my friend's husband - she and I had two pieces and that is PLENTY, and her husband had 3 - I think there was even leftover, so don't worry about not being satisfied! Crust is flaky and nice, dough is perfectly doughy, and the cheese is great - (as far as I can tell) good quality mozzarella, and plenty of it, without being sickening. Got green peppers and tomatoes - peppers were delish and tomatoes were decent, my friend said he loved his Canadian bacon. I was afraid I'd feel sick after eating such "decadent" pizza but it was not greasy at all, and although I normally feel disgusting after eating junk food, I fully enjoyed this pizza and didn't feel like I'd pigged out or anything. A real winner, this place! It was seriously really good. That night they were giving out coupons for $5 off your next visit, and since my friends live there and there were a lot of out-of-towners, they got a lot of these people's coupons who couldn't use them! The only negative I guess I really have would be the tables are pretty close together..which is a littleee weird sitting near strangers, but hey, what can you do. It didn't really diminish the experience for me in the least. I will definitely be eating at Giordano's next time I'm in Chicago!
