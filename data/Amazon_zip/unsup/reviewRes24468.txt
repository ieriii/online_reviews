So many desserts, so little time. We decided to cap off our night with the Walnut and Almond with Rose water Baklavas (for comparison's sake). The waiter told us that the Almond was far more popular. After our first bites, we both decided we preferred the Walnut. It was far more flavorful, with a serious cinnamon kick. But after a few more bites, the subtle sweetness of the Almond kinda won me over. We paired our dessert with their Hot-Nes drink. I mostly went for the name, and luckily the drink was tasty.  Definitely a chill spot and a cute go to place for an easy romantical date, if you're into that kinda thing.
