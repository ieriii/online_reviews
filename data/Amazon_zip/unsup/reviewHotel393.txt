I was expecting typical Garden Inn service when I stayed here on business, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff is excellent. Everyone spoke to me and went out of their way to ensure a quality stay. I even got to experience the event staff, as my business was conducted in the hotel's meeting space. The Food & Beverage service is five-star, and the guest room accommodations are top knotch. I will definitely stay here when I return to Chicago. Great location, great property.
