I enjoyed Tank, although some of the spices were a little new to me. The restaurant was really busy on a Friday evening, so we had to wait for a few minutes and we were lucky to get our own table (some groups shared). However, our food came quickly and was delicious. I had the shrimp egg roll and one of the beef soups, but I would probably try something else next time. But I would definitely want to go back.
