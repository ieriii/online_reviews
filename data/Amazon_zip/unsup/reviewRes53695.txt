Went to Schwa for a birthday dinner. I had no problems getting a reservation -- two DAYs before we ate. It can be done, you just have to flexible. I left a message on their voice mail saying I'd like a reservation for any day that week should they have a cancellation. They called back a day later with two different days for me to choose. Logically it makes sense, most people make these reservations so far in advance, when the time comes they can't make it.The food is fantastic. It's great to watch the kitchen in action. BYOB really helps on the price.
