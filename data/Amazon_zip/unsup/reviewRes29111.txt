Went here the Sunday night after Thanksgiving weekend. It was hard to find a place that was open, but we'd wanted to try Opart for awhile, so this was our chance. The interior is very nice compared to 99% of most Thai restaurants. The portraits on the wall when you first come in are a bit weird, though. Service was fast and very good. We started with the potstickers which were good. The menu said pan fried, so I was thinking that they'd be steamed, but just crispy on the bottom. They were definitely deep fried. They were huge, though and you could tell they were made in house. We split the Tom Yum Kai (tom yum with chicken) next and loved it. It was a little more citrusy than I'm used to, but the spice was great. They also serve all their soups in tureens with burners underneath so your soup stays really hot. It was a nice, fun touch. We also split the green curry (delicious!) and the pad see ewe with chicken (good, but nothing compares to Butterfly down on Grand Ave.). I noticed the portions are smaller than most Thai places, but we still had leftovers to bring home. We also had the jasmine tea which was good, but they don't have strainers in their pots, so you end up with lots of tea leaves in your cup which can get annoying. I really liked all the food and will definitely be back.
