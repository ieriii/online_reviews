My favorite Ethiopian in Chicago so far. This place is a little pricier, but worth the money for the experience. I have been on both special occasions (my birthday!) and regular evenings, and the service is usually excellent. The berbere sauce here is excellent and the injera is the perfect texture with a hint of sour. Their menu can be a little confusing; you can choose your own entrees for a platter, which can be easy if you're an Ethiopian veteran, but overwhelming otherwise. I feel confident saying that the wait staff would recommend for first-timers. My only complaint is that they substituted entrees in their platters without telling us; I was a little upset and felt that maybe they thought we wouldn't notice or know the difference.
