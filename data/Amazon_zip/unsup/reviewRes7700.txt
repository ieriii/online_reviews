Well, what can I say. You can't really look down on endless meat. We went here for restaurant week and my experience was simply just okay. Actually, probably worse than okay, because we paid $120 for 2 people. We ordered two all you can eats (meat and salad bar), an iced tea and yea, that's it. Tax, tip later, $120. The meat was not.that.good. It was fine, it just wasn't worth $120. I would rather take that money and go to any other steakhouse in the city, including Ruth Chris. My iced tea was FOUR DOLLARS. Sorry, I understand you are in the Loop and you are a tourist trap, but four dollars for a watered down iced tea? Please.  The only redeeming quality for me was the salad bar. It's funny that people here have mentioned bad things about it, because I thought it was phenomenal. Yea, it wasn't your classic salad bar you would see at Old Country Buffet (do those even still exist?), but it had all the right things for you to stock up on and bring back to your table as a side note to all of the meat meat meat coming your way. You could stock up on asparagus, mushrooms, artichokes, bacon, cheeses, olives, salad, potato salad, etc etc. I was in heaven.  The desserts were great, and included in the restaurant week deal. Our waiter didn't seem to be pleased to have to serve during restaurant week. Okay, I get it.....the bills are smaller than normal during this week, and the cheaper prices may be bringing in some riff-raff (compared to what they may be used to), so they may be getting lower tips.....but if you treat me right from the start, you will get a large tip from me. Just because I enjoy a deal doesn't mean I am cheap. So, all in all, it was a fun experience, but not even worth the money spent on a deal week. Try other brazilian steakhouses, or even just another Chicago style steakhouse. You'll get a better "CUT" for your money.
