Pricey but delicious and it's BYOB. We got the prefix. The restaurant is quite small but the service and food are great. We even had the chef come out and see how everyone was doing and talked to us about the dishes he made and what inspired him to make it. The sign of a good chef who is truly passionate about his food and strives to serve the best. Everything in the restaurant was fresh and used whatever vegetables and fruits were in season.
