This place sux @ss T#rds. A friend of mines family catered from them and everybody got sick. When they determined that Nuevo Leon was the source, they went back to at least solicit an apology but came up empty and the management actually accused them of trying to ruin their business in some way. Just to be sure they contacted the health inspectors and sure enough, they got shut down for many health code violations. But on their front door they claimed that they were closed for remodeling. Point being, if you want to play Yuhoo roulette with your but, then "look no further..." A better (and safer) choice is up the street at La Cebollita. They're BYOB too.
