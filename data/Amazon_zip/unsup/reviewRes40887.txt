Best pho in Chicago. Broth is flavorful, meat is fresh, and noodles are just the right consistency. I've also tried their catfish in claypot which was also flavorful, but a little bit too salty for me(just eat it w/ a ton of rice). Other than that, the flavor was really good. My friends have ordered the duck and curry noodles and they all swear by it. There's always a wait, but the few times we've gone here with a big group, we only waited for ~ 30 minutes. The trick is to hover over tables until they get uncomfortable with your stares.. haha jk. A Chicago staple!
