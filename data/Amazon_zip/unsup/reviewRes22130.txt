One of my favorite Greek Restaurants. I have been to Greek Islands on several occasions (work related functions, date with the husband, and family birthday dinners). Every experience has been a good one thus far. To start with, free valet parking is always convenient.  Secondly, the dishes are pretty delicious. The family style dinner is exquisite, starting from the chicken to the dessert at the end. I've had their chicken panini, very yummy. The service is fabulous, and the decor is appealing. I have sat in various spots within the restaurant and have been content. There is a family style place right by the bar, and it is perfect for large groups. I have sat in the busier sections (also ok) and up the little stairs. Even when it is crowded it is pretty cozy. I really do like Greek Islands and enjoy coming here at least once or twice a year.  On a side note, I was here recently for a holiday meeting and it was more packed than ever. However, the valet attendants were super quick. I was astonished at how fast they took my car (although there was a line) and how quick they were to get my car after lunch.  If you are looking for a delicious dinner or lunch and you are in Greek town, I would highly recommend Greek Islands.
