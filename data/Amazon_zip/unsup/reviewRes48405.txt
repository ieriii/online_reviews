Good, but not great.  If Yelp allowed .5 star increments, it would give this place 3.5 stars.  We arrived and we're promptly seated on busy Labor Day evening.  Our server, did a good job explaining all of the favorites on the menu, ordered drinks, had good conversation.  -The first dish was served, but it was intended for another table, not ours.  -The second dish, the chef's tasting of oysters, was good, but it was missing a spoon for the mingnonette.  I would've liked another sauce option with the oysters, since I'm usually accustomed to eating my oysters with spicy sauces. -A "small" issue with the pork rinds. -The bread service, which I should believe should always come first, was served during the with the entrees.  -Out of the heirloom tomato salad. This should never happen, 86 the item and give the remaining salads to a server to sell.  Overall, just a lot of minor details were missed during the meal.  Our server was great, but I felt like the runners and support staff needed to be on-the-ball better.  The food was good. Very simple, but I was really expecting a lot more from this meal. I still believe that Avec is Paul Kahan's best restaurant.
