Plenty of reviews here, so no need to elaborate, but here's my take: Awesome place for event dining, and something that's definitely worth doing once if you can swing it (heck, go once a year or once a season if you're posh). I went with two friends for no reason other than that we wanted to give it a go, despite it being way out of the ballpark for us financially. We made our reservation, dressed up, and had a blast. We went with the smaller menu (PLENTY of food - I don't think I could have handled the full 24-course option) and just ordered a bottle of wine (sure, we were dropping lots of money, but we were trying to be reasonable) and felt like we got the full experience. Food was wonderful, service was great, and the experience was a big thumbs-up. My one recommendation to diners is to relax and have a good time. We felt like we were the only ones in the joint enjoying our meal: everyone else was stone-cold quiet and somewhat serious. So have fun, get tipsy, and ask your waiters lots of questions. Once the waiters figured out that we were chatty, they started spending more time with us, sharing a few extra details, and challenging us to identify the main ingredients. It's food -- it's not that serious. And it's food with a sense of humor, so it's REALLY not that serious. Save your pennies, go once, and have fun!
