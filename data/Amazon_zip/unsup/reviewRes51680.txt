I was looking forward to the Mexican food. I had heard it was good. We ordered margaritas to start, which were not too strong and not too weak, so I could have drank and enjoyed a few of them. I must have eaten an entire basket of chips/salsa because they were so good. However, I ordered pollo de mole and I've never tried it before. I was scared because of the way it was described to me. When the dish came out, it did not look appetizing and after the first bite, I had to muscle down the rest of the chicken. I am not sure if the mole was bad here or if mole is just not good to me. The service was good, attentive, and someone was always there to help serve us. They always gave us more chips and salsa, which is always the minimum requirement at any Mexican place. I want to try this place again and order some other dishes, but so far, only 3 stars.
