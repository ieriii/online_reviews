My wife and I went with a friend for dinner and the food wwea excellentWe found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. We had the Crostini di Avocado and grilled calamari for an appetizers  I had the risotto pescatore yummy and my wfe had the ribs which she said was excellent. Our friend had the lasagna which she loved. I just wish they had frosty mugs fo the beer but thats ok since most places do not have them.The deserts were also very good. Tiramisu and the chocolate Raspberry cake. We will definitely be back.
