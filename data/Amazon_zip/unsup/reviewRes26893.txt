Really fun place for dinner. We had excellent service from a waiter who was quite knowledgeable about the Frontera menu, including their (extensive) tequila selection. Everything that came to our table was perfectly cooked, and the creativity in the dishes made them all unlike food you will find at any other restaurant, Mexican or not. My trout was buttery tasting and wonderfully flaky, and the flavors in the accompanying chili peanut sauce and rice were very well layered and made the dish come together very well. The tortillas were very clearly freshly made, and much higher quality than tortillas at most other Mexican restaurants, including those that I consider to have excellent tortillas. Also, the green salsa is amazing. I would definitely go back, especially with a big group of people.
