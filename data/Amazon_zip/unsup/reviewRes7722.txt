Best italian in the city. You cannot go wrong with any dish here. Best choices are the lasagne (you've never had lasagne prepared like this before) and the lobster ravioli. Service is stellar and the owners love and appreciate their patrons. Prices are extremely resonable. Great ambiance too. My only beef is that there is no room for waiting for tables since the bar area is tight. Highly suggest getting reservations if you are going. Also, my in-laws are italian and very critical of italian cooking. They came in from out-of-town and were wowed. Great stuff! If you live in the neighborhood, get on the mailing list. They routinely send out coupons for $15 off.
