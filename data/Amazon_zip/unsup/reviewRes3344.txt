Crispy, Salty and a little Sweet. Korean BBQ I Love You! Ate there last night and was excited to learn this is now in my hood. We shared a whole chicken 1/2 Seoul Sassy & 1/2 Crisp BBQ. Both were really great. Chicken was succulent and the outside was oh so delish. The guy who started it told us that the Chicken is hormone free, fried in canola oil and 100 calories less than your usual fried chicken (not that I am counting... or maybe I should) Anyway, couldn't finish it all so he even aerated the box so the leftovers were crispy the next day and let me tell you.... they were perfectly crisp the next day. Mmmmmmm I will be back!!! Run don't walk. ps Bring cash for now... credit card machine is down for a few weeks. I hate paying 5 bucks for my money.
