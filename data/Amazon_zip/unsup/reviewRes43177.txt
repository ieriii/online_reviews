As a regular (because of location), I think milk and honey has quality stuff but is a tad bit overpriced for the portions of their food. However, it could be a lot worse... as you can see by other places in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. Some of their specials are to die for - others are a miss. You can get any sandwich as a wrap - which I recommend. I've had so many things on the menu - my one thing to say is that their take on some mexican food is a miss (except the juevos rancheros, which are really, really good). I honestly feel as though you could make most of their stuff yourself. But that's just what it is - simple food with attention to flavor. Get the caprese as a side - it's very spicy but perfect. I love the interior and I love their whole atmosphere and look.
