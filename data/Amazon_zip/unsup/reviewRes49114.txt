yum. went here on monday night after a champagne tasting, so we were feeling good to begin with. but the atmosphere when we walked in was immediately warm and inviting, and we were transported to another place...we didn't feel like we were in chicago...maybe europe, maybe NYC. it was packed for being late-ish on a monday night, and although we did have to wait a bit for a table and it took us awhile to get a drink while waiting for said table...as soon as we flagged someone down we got our drinks right away and the service for the rest of the evening more than made up for being somewhat ignored at the bar table area. we shared 4 plates between the two of us and i think it was the perfect amount of food, sampled some delcious beer we'd never had before (this menu is FANTASTIC if you are a beer lover this place is a must), and had a great reasonably priced bottle of gruner with dinner. squash salad and pork belly were notable standouts. this pork belly was probably the best i've ever had thus far, i highly recommend it. i want to go back and try some more beer and some more of the plates! communal seating somewhat in the middle, except for tables around the walls including these super cool booths on the side - they shut you into your own private booth (looks like they seat 4). i shall definitely return. the fiance is sooo jealous i went here first without him! speaking of which i don't think i'd go here on a first date - you have to share all of your food and i could see where it might be quite awkward with a stranger.
