mmm, mmm. I had heard good things about this place and after my first visit I was not disappointed. I had the crawfish cake po' boy and it was extremely excellent... and so were the mashed sweet potatoes. There were many things on the menu that looked simply delicious and it took my a while to decide. The prices are pretty reasonable and I would definitely go back to try something new (assuming I don't cave and just order the crawfish cake po' boy again... which is a distinct possibility). This place is very close to the Paulina Brown-line and has a parking available around the corner. I can't wait to go back :)
