I took the advice of my fellow reviewers and was having a major Greek craving and decided to try it out. First impression, very large and Greek chain looking but all the workers were Greek, the food was very authentic, saganaki, loved the octopus appetizer. Tender and great olive oil and spices. I had lamb and would be happy to try any of the lamb dishes, they all looked great. Free valet parking was an added bonus.
