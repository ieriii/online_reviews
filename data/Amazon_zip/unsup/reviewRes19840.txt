Gage is a very popular spot, which makes for a very loud place during happy hour. But that's ok, feel free to scream right along with the rest of the patrons. Took a friend out for her bday and we ordered the fondue, zucchini & olives, and the signature gage cocktail (so delish we had 2 each). The appetizers were tasty and hot, but it took a while. The appetizer portions are not large, but they were the perfect size for us. We walked from her place, so we didn't have the headache of trying to find a parking spot.  We arrived early, so we were seated promptly and sat at one of the high tables. But beware, if you arrive for happy hour after 6pm, you may find yourself having to stand in the middle of the aisle way (not a sexy look).  The bathrooms are decent. The place is a tinge pricey, so be prepared to hand over at least $100 for two people. Gage gives one an upscale feel, but its not that upscale, just pricey. I would give Gage 3.5 stars, if possible. The bday girl had a nice time (which pleased me) so all and all, we had a great Friday evening. Besides, Gage helped me get my weekend started. Woot! Woot!
