Mmmm we love this place! My bf and I went here for a birthday/anniversary dinner (yes, they are the same day - birthiversary is the best holiday ever :)), and we were reminded once again why it's one of our top 10 places in Chicago. Delicious food, impeccable service, amazing and fun decor and atmosphere, and simply a top-notch restaurant. We ordered the arepas and ropa vieja for appetizers, and these were easily the highlight of the meal. YUM! The flavor combinations in both are spectacular as they dance and mingle and melt their way across your tongue. The arepas were my favorite, while my bf preferred the ropa vieja. But both were outstanding. For entrees, I ordered the salmon (with quinoa and vegetables), and my bf ordered the steak and potatoes. Again, both were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Afterward, the waitress came out with a surprise birthday treat (my bf had evidently tipped her off), which was very unique but again, delicious. It consisted of a piece of cinnamon flan with a dollop of whipped cream on the side, drizzled with raspberry syrup, with homemade caramel popcorn clusters ringing the plate. I would never have thought to mix all those ingredients, but the result was excellent and much appreciated by my taste buds. Five stars well earned for Carnivale! We'll keep coming back, that's for sure.
