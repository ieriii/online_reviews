We sat at the kitchen table. This itself was an experience of a lifetime. Not only did we have our own private table from which we could overlook the kitchen, but we had the most amazing service I've ever experienced. It felt that everyone was basically told to take care of us no matter what. In fact, at a couple of points even the sommelier poured our water for us. On that note, Chad, the sommelier, was fabulous. He did a really great job helping me, a Napa oaked rich wine loving girl, find a lighter wine to better go with the food. Very impressed. And, there were even some affordable bottles of wine on the list. They ranged from $45 to 6,000 (no typos), and the decent selection of wines by the glass allowed me to try more while not spending way too much. The food was pretty good. The only bad thing about the kitchen table is that you don't choose your menu. This means we were exposed to things we probably never would have tried on our own. This is good and bad. I thought the food was just okay (BEAUTIFUL, but not always my taste), but I really enjoyed trying everything and I absolutely feel that I would think it was better had I ordered my own choices. Toward the end of our evening, I needed to use the restroom. When I asked where it was, a server actually took me there and waited until I came out to escort me back. Incredible. We also then received a full kitchen tour, and a tour of each piece of artwork in the restaurant. Very impressed. Will give it 5 stars when I stop regretting the outrageous amount we paid for food we wouldn't have chosen on our own.
