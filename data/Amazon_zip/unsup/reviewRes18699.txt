First things first.........you can NEVER go wrong with any kind of Special. Be that dessert, beverage, torta or so-on We often make trips to the city that revolve around lunch or dinner at Xoco. Wednesdays are definitely my favorite day to go as I am a huge fan of all things pork belly. I could eat 5 pork belly tortas. But I'd have to withdraw a small fortune from my bank account to do so.  Like most restaurants with world renowned chefs controlling the menu this food is nothing but flavorful. I also love the abaghado torta. It sets my mouth on fire. I like that.  I recommend the hot chocolate, but must warn you that it's very thick! which I was not expecting at first. I mixed it with some ice cream and it was quite a treat. One time when we were there they had this outstanding dessert. It was something like.... ice cream with maple brown sugar bacon streussel and carmel and hot fudge...I...could have died and gone to heaven. heaven.
