I have eaten here twice. The first time, I had some kind of vegan stir-fry(for those that don't know at this point, it is a restaurant with vegetarian and vegan offerings; no meat). The second time, I had the fajitas. I'll keep this review short: everything I've had was bland at best and highly overpriced(taste to cost ratio). If it were not for the vegan peanut butter supershakes, or blueberry smoothies(yummy!) and their other varieties, this place would cease to be on my radar. Although... I would probably go back again; after all it was not awful and it feels good to be in a place that doesn't serve up the flesh with vegetarian dishes as just an aside. If they could infuse a little more love and spice into their foods, I would say that this place would be THE go-to restaurant for Veggies and the veggie-curious. Sadly, it falls short.
