If you think firm cake and stiff frosting is good, then this is your cupcake destination. The frosting on the red velvet cupcake was yummy cream cheesy and smooth, but the frosting on the vanilla cupcake was literally stiff. When I bit into it, the entire layer of frosting lifted off the cupcake. The red velvet cake was fairly moist and palatable and the vanilla cake wasn't all that memorable. Now, they do get points for colorful frosting, but my first criteria for frosting is creamy! As for price, I did not feel sticker shock.
