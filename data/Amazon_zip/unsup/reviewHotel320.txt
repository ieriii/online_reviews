Incredible! Where do I start? At the great staff who checked us in, the decor of the lobby, the cute Parisian style elevator, the 2 tvs in our room, the excellent amenities in the bathroom, the modern mini bar, the comfortable pillows and bed, the soft towels, how it's the same $ as The Beverly Inn, LA but heaps better, the awesome complementary breakfast served in real bowls, not styrofoam!, their recycle bin in the lobby and there good location. Best quality hotel for this price range and this area for sure.
