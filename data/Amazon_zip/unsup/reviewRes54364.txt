My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers. Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere. However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie. I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers. All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money. Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine. Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad. Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the weekend. My half of the pizza was sausage, onions, and green pepper (this is what I normally order at Lou's or Gino's). The pizza arrived at our table with the patented black crust and the eating began. I believe the true test of Chicago deep dish pizza is actually the final bite of pizza where you get the crust and the toppings all in one. I immediately turned my pizza around and took this bite. It was great the crust was crunchy and airy at the same time. The toppings were plentiful and the sausage had good seasoning. When I saw the black crust I wondered how can that not taste burnt, but it didn't. It tasted like, well... caramelized cheese,brilliant! For 4 beers, appetizer, salad, pizza, and tip this experience cost us $74.00 and we still have three quarters of a pizza left to enjoy. Although I would not rank these guys above Lou's or Gino's I wont rank them below either.
