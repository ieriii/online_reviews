WOW WOW WOW WOW! This is a must stop for any foodie! We did a huge dinner list! And yes I would go back and do it all over ;) But I would do a whiskey flight right before this time! This is our Longman & Eagle flight dinner list. 3 people total : 55-65 per person depending on the drinks ;) We had a few! ------------ Buffalo Frog Legs - Amazing, had this first and all three of us were blown away by this! We could not get this dish out of our minds. Chicken taste like frog! (Lew) ;) Sweetbreads - OMG, these should be illegal is what we agreed on. Very rich, perfect for a belly full of alcohol. :)  Marrow Bones - God I love Marrow! This dish gives you two very nice sized bones FILLED with yummy Marrow! If you love bone marrow give these a go! Rabbit Pate - Good, yum yum yum rabbit, was done very well. Didn't get a WOW factor like some other dishes. Still very yummy! Duck Rillettes - Good, perfect presentation. Scallops - Very good. Two large sized scallops with some sort of corn based sauce. Agnolloti - English pea filled. I would pass on this just not my thing, but it was good enough that I ate it! lol Grilled Califlower - Veggie dish. I am not a vegetarian and normally steer away from such dishes but Lew wanted to give it a go and I am glad we did! You must give this dish a go its very good!! Grill taste with sweetness. I cannot remember all the ingredients in this I will try to remember later :). Half Chicken - We were extremely full by the time the chicken showed... This bird is AWESOME! Free range bird top quality and it was soooo yummy ... it reminded me of down south home cooking very buttery! Kobe Burger - Beef Fat Fries with these burger! The Fries stole the show on this dish. Kobe Meatballs - Good, they were very tasty I love Wagyu, but this really didn't engrave into my memory as much as the Frog Legs, Marrow Bones, and Sweetbreads.
