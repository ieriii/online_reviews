My husband, children, and I stumbled upon The Purple Pig by accident on Memorial Day around lunch time, so we had no expectations. We were able to sit outside and enjoy the wonderful weahter. Service was prompt and attentive, and our waitress didn't seem to mind the fact we had our children along, although the place clearly caters to an adult crowd. The foos was fantastic: fresh flavors offered in original preparations. The chicken leg kebob was a sizable serving, and the panini were tasty and filling despite the small size. Try the farro and ricotta custard with chocolate sauce: a nice twist on a traditional peasant dessert.
