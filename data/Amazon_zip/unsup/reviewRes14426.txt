We went to Revolution Brewing for lunch yesterday, and got seated in their super fun upstairs wooden booths.  Our entrees were delicious, I had the Tempeh Rueben, and one of my friends had a very delicious Bisquits and Gravy that looked pretty awesome as well. I tried out two of their house brews, both were tasty and good. My biggest issue with the whole experience is that we ordered the $15 cheese plate to help stave off our hunger pains while we waited for the rest of our food. Lo' and behold, they brought out our cheese appetizer at the same time as our entrees. At that point, I think we would have rather not had it at all, then just the apology of our waitress. I understand mistakes happen, and in the restaurant industry it can be a challenge to coordinate the timing of when plates make it to the table; so we will probably be back. It was just a little disappointing.
