This hotel is wonderful. We had a great experience with the front desk and they even gave us coupons one night for a late dinner. The rooms are fun and somewhat art deco style along with the rest of the hotel. The view was amazing and the rates were very fair. The only thing I have to say is the elevator is a little slow but add character to the place. We plan to be back.
