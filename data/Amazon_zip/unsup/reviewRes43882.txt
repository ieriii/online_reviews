Fantastic service. Even though our order got messed up, our waiter really took care of us and went out of his way to make sure we had a good time. Decor/Ambiance When you walk in...I got the impression of Southern steamboat, moving slowly up the Mississippi. Very different feel than other long-standing Chicago institutions...no wheeling and dealing vibe like Gibson's...but classier, though slightly stuffy. Steaks My bone-in Delmonico (ribeye) was cooked perfectly. Slightly charred on the outside, perfectly pink inside. Surprisingly the outer part was not all that flavorful, but it definitely got better as I worked towards the bone. From a strict meat perspective, I think I'm still a bigger fan of David Burke. Service Again, phenomenal. First our server indulged in our wanting to see the meat cuts and explained the cow parts. And though he screwed up our order, he more than compensated by refilling our side of spinach & mushrooms and offered to buy us all dessert . Though perhaps he knew 3 guys weren't going to order dessert (ha!), it's the thought that counts. While I was there to go to town on cows, if I wasn't, Kinzie had a fantastic value $20 3 course prix fixe. But in general, the prices at Kinzie seem to be slightly lower than the competition, and quality does not suffer. Combine that with great service = great meal. I'll come back.  Oh, and the private room seems like a good time.
