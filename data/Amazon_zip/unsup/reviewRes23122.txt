Always a delicious time at Lao Sze Chuan. I was first introduced to the restaurant by a friend who works in China, who claimed it was the most authentic Chinese in Chicago. Etc etc. She's right, and so are the denizens of Chinese-food lovers in Chi-town who flock to this unpretentious, delightful corner of Chinatown.  One of their best dishes is the ***tea-smoked duck***mmm-mmm--don't be fooled by the image of shreds of pink limp meat in a stir fry; this dish is closer to a rustic duck confit in a parisian bistro. NO: this baby comes on the bone, with shatteringly-crisp duck skin, dark and white meat portions, all chopped up in gnaw-friendly morsels and served with a lovely dose of hoisin on the side.  For our most recent dinner, we opted for the truly perfect Szechuan dumplings (savory ground pork folded into delicate wonton skins, topped off with chili oil--what not to love?) and kept our little fingerbowl of chili oil to mix with the hoisin as a rich, more complex condiment for our duck. We then cleansed our palates with neverending tea and chinese broccoli in garlic sauce--bright green, fresh, crispy, with mellowed shards of lightly toasted garlic.  I give Lao Sze Chuan my highest recommendation as a chinese food restaurant in chicago--follow the other posters on this website and order what people recommend. The menu is vast and they have some real standout dishes.  All this from a girl who would rather eat most any other cuisine other than chinese--except if it's LSC (or Mandarette in LA).
