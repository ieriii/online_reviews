love love. i go just for the veggie dogs and tots and still think the wait is worth it. bring a book, a friend, or a well-charged phone - you *will* be waiting in line for quite a while. Doug himself works the counter and is super friendly; wish I could say the same for the guy and girl that hand out the food.
