Sunda is hands down one of my favorite places to eat. Been here many times and i love it. The sushi is made fresh from the best fish and just melts in your mouth. the staff is respectful and well trained, and know what they are doing. No waiting around or looking for them. They have a great wine list also! * the night I went Joe Jonas came in, like it was no big deal ;)
