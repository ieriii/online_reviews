Great find in Pilsen. It's straight up great mexican food. As a life long Chicagoian, I new I was in the right spot when I saw all the cops cars lined up along the street.  Prices are cheap, food is plentiful and very flavorful. It's not fine dining, but it's not TBK or any number of late night drunk burrito places. Can't wait to go back!
