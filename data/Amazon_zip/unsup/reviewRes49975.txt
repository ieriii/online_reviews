Came here on Monday of Memorial Day weekend around noon and it wasn't that crowded yet, so we sat on the patio. I didn't catch either of our servers names (there was a trainee) but they both standard sports bar service, not always there but attentive none the less. The food was good, but everyone knows that. My group all got burgers and they all came out cooked correctly and with the right toppings, so we were all happy! From just sitting on the patio the place doesn't look like much, but it's still a fun place. And there's a list of specialty shots that they make that I am dieing to try!
