though i consider myself to be a modern bride, i did still want to tie in some historic chicago to my wedding day. i ended up choosing to have my wedding at this hotel because it has a very cool vintage regal feel to it while it is still updated with everything you need. our reception was in the renaissance ballroom. i wanted to have breathtaking views for our OOT guests to enjoy. they had an onsite planner to help with everything and it was a big help throughout the entire process. they even had experience with other asian weddings and were able to help us with menu choices that would satisfy both our eastern and western guests.
