I generally tell everyone that Chicago is all about the diverse neighborhoods and great hidden gems within them. The Gage proves the Loop can have its gems as well, if not so hidden.  The fact that I have went to the Gage twice each of the last two weekends I have spent in Chicago stands as a testament to the great food and beer list. Love the extensive list of Bell's and Great Lakes bottles which I miss out on the East Coast. This place is perfect if in the Loop area. Just across from Cloud Gate (the bean), near the Art Institute and walking distance from the Downtown Hotels like the Wit (my personal fave since giving up my residency).
