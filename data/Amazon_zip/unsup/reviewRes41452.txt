Pho Xe Tang is the second Pho restaurant we have tried on Argyle. The other was Pho 777 and while that restaurant is also delicious my lunch partner and I decided Pho Xe Tang has better Pho and better atmosphere. My friend ordered the Tank Pho, the typical pho filled with beef flank, tripe, tendon, and sausage. As is standard the pho came with a plate of sprouts, basil, lime and jalapeno. My friend thought the meat in this pho was of a higher and tastier quality than that of the same pho at Pho 777 and absolutely loved it, devouring far more broth than I thought possible. I ordered the number 83, it was a vermicelli noodle bowl topped with deliciously seasoned, thin crispy beef, amazing sweet and tangy pork patty, grilled shrimp and perfectly crispy fried pork egg rolls. This and the vermicelli were served on top of lettuce, carrot, cucumber and mint and garnished with peanut crumbles. This dish was incredibly flavorful and interesting and extremely refreshing, I loved it. It was served with a dish of sweet dipping sauce that their egg rolls are served with. This sauce is magical and I poured it all over the dish, with a little of their Sriracha and soy sauce. We also ordered the fried shrimp egg rolls which were fantastic, they also came with the sweet dipping sauce, divine! I also sampled the mango smoothie, it came with tapioca and garnished with fruit. I actually asked if they had bubble tea and ordered that but a smoothie arrived instead. It is not quite the same as bubble tea and not quite what I wanted but still very tasty. Will definitely come back here to sample more of their menu. If you are new to Argyle and just aren't sure which Pho place to try first I recommend Pho Xe Tang as your first try, they have a huge menu and are very busy on weekends but it is worth the wait (and even worth sharing a table, which we did with a sweet and quiet couple).
