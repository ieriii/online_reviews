where is this place? twice, i went with an out-of-state friend, and both times hot doug's was closed. we went to the shoppe that is near the midway games office - is this not the correct place? it is very frustrating to anticipate juicy hot dogs and duck-fried fries and be disappointed that the store is not open. both occasions we arrived at mid day, around 1 pm - why would they be "closed" at what should be the peak time? grrrr!
