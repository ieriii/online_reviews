I loved staying here. The beds were comfy, the staff incredibly nice and attentive, and the location? A few blocks from millenium park, kitty corner to the picasso, and less than a block from a jimmy john's. update -- I STILL loved stayed here. While it's a great summer location, it's also a fantastic winter location. Walking along michigan ave in the snow is beautiful. Oh! and on a return visit I got a hand written note welcoming us back. Great nice little touches.
