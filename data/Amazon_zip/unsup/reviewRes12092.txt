Oh Cafe 28, I used to visit you every week for brunch. It was fun. Now you've gone and ruined it all with one bad plate of Chilaquiles.  If there's one thing you should know about Jason M, it's that you don't F with my Chilaquiles. You can make a mediocre pasta or a bland BBQ and I might forgive you, but I will never forgive the bad Chilaquiles.  Where was the sauce? Why was my chicken just a grilled thigh on the side? Ummm, egg? WHY WAS THERE NO JOY?  Your Bloody Mary was still pretty good, but not as good as I remember. Carrot and celery are so 1998. Today, people use cheese and meat and stuffed olives and pickled peppers. Get with it.  Nothing was horrible and Meg L rather enjoyed her omelette, but that doesn't make up for the grave sin that is screwing with Jason M's chilaquiles. Get it together.
