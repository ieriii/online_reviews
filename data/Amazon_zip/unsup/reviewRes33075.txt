Too busy and too loud. Very long wait for breakfast food that's good but nothing special to note. I've had omelets and waffles here. It seems usual. Can't really mess up breakfast food, but I've had better elsewhere. They have large portions which is great except I can't really finish it and I'm not going to pack breakfast food. Not sure what the hype is all about. I think bongo room, Meli cafe, and over easy cafe are much better.
