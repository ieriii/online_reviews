I stopped in here for lunch recently since I work right down the street. That'll be the last time I eat here unless I have visiting friends who will die if they don't eat at a palace of Bayless. Don't get me wrong, the food was... not bad. Unfortunately, everything else combines to make it a "not so pleasurable" experience to eat at Xoco. I had a Cubana sandwich and some Chips with Guacamole. The latter was perfect. The guacamole was probably some of the best I have ever had and the chips were sturdy, hot, and fresh. The sandwich, with pork, bacon, black beans, and avocado was crunchy and flavorful but at 12 dollars I was expecting a bit more. My total bill for both was just under 17 bucks which is a little steep. Combine with a wait time approaching half an hour in line and an additional 20 minutes after you place your order (not sure what that is about), and it just seems to me that all the hype over this place was essentially for nothing. I was also treated to full on Trixie/Chad PDA makeout sessions from the group in front of me in line. The entire crowd seemed composed of the Lincoln Park stereotype. I think I'll go back to grabbing a hot dog from Gold Coast Dogs and eating it by the beach. "Meh" is the perfect word to describe the Xoco experience. Don't believe the hype.
