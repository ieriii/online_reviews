Took my clients there for dinner on Tuesday night and all I can say is "WOW!!" Both the food and the service is just to die for. I would go there again and again when I in the downtown area. Usually I would go to the one in Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg but my clients were staying at a hotel in downtown and it was just easier to stay in downtown. I am very glad that we did. Great place to take your date and bring your American Express.
