My friend and I met up there for an early dinner. The wait was supposed to be 45 minutes, even at 6 pm, but it was about a 30 minute wait instead. Crowded, noisy, but worth it.  The beer is nicely priced and the food is as well. The mussels Belgian style were so good, especially the broth. And the CB & J? I think I will be dreaming about that sandwich. It was awesome. Who knew cashew butter, fig jam and morbier cheese could taste so good?
