Having enjoyed dining at the Gage before, working at Michigan and Randolph has made the Gage a standby. A just-pretentious-enough restaurant with a diverse menu, energetic dining room and great staff, I have yet to be disappointed by any of my choices at this great Dirk Flanigan location. The service is also great, though a few of the more haughty waiters take a few times at the Gage to warm up to you. If you get the one garrulous Irish waiter, then you are in for a fantastic meal. The food is consistently excellent, with their best offerings honestly coming from the simple concepts that they hit out of the park. My personal favorite on their menu is the fish and chips - the fish is always perfect and the breading crisp. Other highlights include the waygu sirloin salad, the roasted woodland mushrooms, the fries with curry sauce, the tilapia every time they've had it on special, and their very generous pours of wine in very large glasses. Do yourself a favor and stop in.
