This is the only damn Thai place in town that makes the food spicy enough for me. I'm not even kidding, my lips are STILL inflamed from what I ate over there Saturday night!!!! I know ordering Pad Thai in a place with so many other options is lame of me, but it's so good there, I love that sweetness that is immediately followed by the burn. It's like a challenge for my taste buds. This location is also byob, and you gotta go into the bar next door to get into the liquor store next to that. They had a decent selection, and it's convenient. Can be kinda crowded here, and a little cramped, but worth the wait!!
