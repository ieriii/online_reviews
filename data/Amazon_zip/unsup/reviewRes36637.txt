Meli is right down the street from my work, so I've been here quite a few times. I've had breakfast and lunch and it's all delicious. The fries are made with some type of batter and they are yummy, crispy deliciousness.   The skillets are awesome, too. Basically, I don't think I've had bad food from here. The only negative is that it can get pretty crowded during the lunchtime rush, and they don't take reservations.
