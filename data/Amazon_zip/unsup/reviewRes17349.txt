As an out of towner, I thought it was cool to check this out with my friend for the "been there, done that" sort of place. The unmarked door was kind of funny because we probably looked moronic looking for it. Once we got inside, there was only a few people queued up in front of us, so we were seated in a booth within a few minutes. We did people watch, and tried the $11 cocktails. Not sure if I would be a regular here if I lived in Chicago, but it was not an ordinary hang out. It did seem like there was a lot of pretentious attitude walking around the bar. Coming from the land of Newport Beach and all that OC entails, I don't particularly like finding some of the same attitude in other cities.
