Man, I love Big Jones. I've been there at least 5 times over the past year, and it's always been consistently good.  The highlights: They typically give each table freshly-made beignets. Mmmmm. nothing quite like freshly hot fried dough first thing in the morning. And I'm not joking. Yummers.  Also, the cheddar cheese biscuits are amazing. It's difficult to describe them without using expletives. Dinner: Fried green Tomatoes (when they have them) are excellent. Boucherie Plate an array of charcuterie. Each are delectable.  The burger is damn fine.  The shrimp and grits are tasty.  I will say the pork loin and the cat fish are a little meh. But the fried deliciousness that accompanies it (a hushpuppy for the cat fish and a Cajun pork boudin ball for the pork loin) are crunchy, fatty amazingness.  Also, the specials that I've sampled are some of the best food I've had there (a duck breast one night and amberjack another night). So, if you're torn about getting the special, get it.  Finally, the staff is courteous, efficient and helpful. If Big Jones were a man at a bar, I would totally try to take him home.
