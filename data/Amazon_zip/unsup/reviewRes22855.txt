If you love spice, and love chinese food there is no better restaurant for you! From their Dried Chili Chicken or beef, to their Dried Chili Pork which is like bacon with a kick, the spic is intense but perfect. The prawns are wonderful, the salt and peper scallops are awesome and the cabbage in the chili oil is a great way to get started! You can't help but gorge yourself but be sure to eat a lot of rice or you'll regret it the next day!
