This place is phenomenal - innovative food, great wines, great service, great ambiance. I can highly recommend it, and we go out to nicer restaurants in Chicago frequently.I put on a birthday party dinner for 20 people, and that is usually a lot of work. Not here.  Tenae Graybosh helped coordinate the event and she was absolutely professional, creative and great to work with. It was a multi course meal and we had the entire back room, I pre-selected the wines, and we started the event at the bar with some appetizers (roped off in the back for privacy). The entire dinner party loved the food (everybody ate too much), the wine selections were a hit, the service was impeccable and that is usually tricky with a group this size, and the Manager Brian that evening was absolutely on his game and kept the show rolling. We started the party at 7:30 on a Friday, and we closed the restaurant down that night.I usually don't write these reviews, and I personally don't know anybody who works for the restaurant. But it was that great of an all around experience that I would have sold the crew that made that night happen short. Would recommend this to anybody, and I know we will be back plenty of times.DR
