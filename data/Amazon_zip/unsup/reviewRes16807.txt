My first Indian food experience... I got talked into it. "You need to try new things, and I know a great place with a buffet." (I'm a picky eater). So we go. I actually loved it. The buffet is really great and they have a little of everything. I'm much more of a fan of chicken than any other meat, and surprisingly I had a lot to choose from. The Spinach was really great too... They bring a fresh roasted chicken to your table, and the bread (nan) is fantastic. Everything was extremely flavorful. I had rice pudding for dessert - it was so good. I tried the mango sorbet too but I wasn't that big of a fan. I wish I could remember the dishes I had so I could recommend them, but honestly, everything was very flavorful and I had a very surprisingly pleasurable experience! It was a little pricey - considering I was full after one plate (two of us, no drinks, and the bill was $36--to me thats a lot for lunch). But I suppose it depends how much you can eat. Anyways, I have to say, I'm glad I went and I really did like it.
