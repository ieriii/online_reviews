Had a plan to go here for lunch today, had sign up saying closed for cleaning. Upon a closer look, I saw on each door a big orange sign saying shut down for health violations. They had the doors open saw it was hard to see the city signs. The violations I saw checked off wereunsanitary kitchen conditions, roaches, rodent droppings and a few others I can't remember. YECH!!!!! So I guess it will be a few day before they reopen. But "I won;t be going there! Anybody else see the signs?
