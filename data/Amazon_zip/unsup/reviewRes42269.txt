Outstanding food. Really - I eat out more often than I eat at home and this place is phenomenal all around. Food - I split the Pork Meatballs, Cornbread, and Bread/Balsamic/Garlic appetizer with a friend. All were delicious. Aside from bacon I may eat pork 2-3 times a year and the meatballs were the best I've ever had. The sauce it comes with it good enough to lick it off the plate if it were socially acceptable. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the Pistachio ice cream. I love pistachio but this was just so so. Service - Our waiter handled our large group (10 people) extremely well, was very attentive on refills, and didn't rush us at all even though the place was fairly crowded. Decor - Great atmosphere that's not too loud. While pricey you definitely get your money's worth. It is superb!
