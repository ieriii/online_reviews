A bunch of co-workers from the region and I headed out to Wilde last night to have fun, let loose, and say goodbye to one of the biggest personalities in the Chicago market. Set in Boystown, Wilde is a fantabulous Irish restaurant and bar. I walked into the place and was completely taken aback. I don't know what I was expecting, but I for sure was not expecting this. Inside Wilde is...just f&*^ing awesome. The first section feels like a restaurant, then there is a bar, and then a LIBRARY area, more restaurant, and another bar. It's all decorated dark and it is dimly lit, and the ceiling has gorgeous paintings on it. The food...oh god...the food is some of the best I have had. I didn't get a dinner for myself, I wasn't hungry, but I did have plenty of bites of food and dessert from other people. The desserts are amazing, Guinness Chocolate Cake, Apple Crisp, even the plain vanilla ice cream was good! Everybody loved their dinner and the fries I ate were the best fries I've had. Ever. The staff were very helpful and nice and attentive. The crowd was fun...but the place wasn't full by any means and there were about 20 of us there as a group... Overall, great food, great ambiance and atmosphere, and I will for sure be back!
