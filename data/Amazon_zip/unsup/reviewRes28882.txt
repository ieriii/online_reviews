Amazing! I have been wanting to come here since I moved to Chicago. Finally had some friends in town and an excuse to go. We could only get reservations on a Friday at 5:45 and I was blown away at how crowded it already was. But loved it because I was nervous there would be a couple of us in there. The margaritas are great and I am not even a huge fan of margs I managed to have 4 (yes was a little tipsy when we left). We had some guacamole and chips as an app and i got some Chicken mole enchiladas. So flavorful! I did think it was a lot of food so we ended up taking some home. Overall lively atmosphere and some great Mexican food!
