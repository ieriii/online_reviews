I mean, this place could have been a lot better if the waiters weren't hitting on all of us at the table (a mix of guys and gals). We didn't ask to make our drinks strong for us - but thanks anyway! With my buzz going on strong after 1 sip of the margarita (jeez, are you serious? I think I just sipped 3 shots) and eating ceviche served with - saltines? - I knew this place was treating us like the folks with bland taste-buds.  Now, my intention is not to hate on these bland-taste bud folks - but most of us were latino! I like my ceviche well marinated with lime and my torta well-spiced - but this hasn't come to play in mouth - nope, not so much. 2 stars Mayan Palace - well I did love your Tortilla Soup before I was intoxicated - so lets make you 3 stars. I'll probably go back when I feel the need for attention from the waiters and when the mood strikes to have a 27 shot margarita. Not joking.
