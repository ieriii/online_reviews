Melis is great! Everything about it is perfect, the food options, portion size, decor and the pasta salad that comes with the food! :) I have been here twice now and am addicted. I had the three cheese grilled cheese which was delish - the bread was stretched Nan which was awesome. I also had the veggie panini and both times I got the pasta salad as a side which is a meal in its own and is some of the best pasta salad I have ever had!
