I am in no way a Korean food know-it-all (I usually order what is suggested to me)... but I have never had a bad meal at san soo gab san. This place is at the corner of my block... so 5 stars for convenience! I have typically been there in pretty large groups, which I am told is a great way to experience a variety of dishes at this particular BBQ. We usually just get a few combination platters and pass them around. Food wise, this place gets 4 stars from me... but there was a definite docking due to repeated bad experiences with the wait staff. There was only one time where I would say I was treated well by the waitress, and it was a time that I went with a few Korean friends of mine who did most of the ordering for the table. If you are in the area, check this place out! and a reminder... Berwyn (the cross street the restaurant is located at) is a 2-way street and the south side is NO parking... you will get ticketed... and royally piss off all of us trying to get to our houses. :)
