I think this once hot spot has just about run it's course. I was there with a pretty large group. We had a table reserved (which was allowed b/c of the size of our group), and our actual server was great - nice, attentive, answered all of our questions etc. Here's where it gets bad. We were rushed through our meal - that while won't break the bank is far from cheap. We ended up at $37/person, and since there were a lot of us you'd think that maybe they wouldn't be rude to a group who just gave the restaurant several hundred dollars in about an hour's time. The guy with the facial hair, either owner or manager, basically came up to our table pretty much the exact instant that the plates started being cleared, and requested we move along. What kind of way is that to treat anyone in a restaurant in a city filled with thousands of good ones? When people dine out, they want to feel comfortable and not feel like they are a burden by spending their money in your restaurant. I understand the idea of turnover, and people waiting for tables, but there's a big difference between lingering over that last sip of wine and not ordering for two hours, and simply digesting your meal and wrapping up. So, if you want pretty good food and very poor treatment, have a good time here. For my money I'll go to Frasca or Pizza D.O.C. and get the same food and feel like I can enjoy myself.
