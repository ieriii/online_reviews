We got a good deal on this hotel through hotwire but it would have been worth it to go outside of downtown. There's no view from any angle and the hotel has only an outdoor pool. We had to pay an extra $15 per day to walk next door to an indoor pool since it was winter out. This was listed as a 4 star hotel but it lacked a number of amenities I expected from a hotel with that rating. Parking our car in the hotel garage cost almost as much as the hotel room itself. I've stayed at the Knickerbocker which is a true 4 star hotel and there's no comparison. This is more like a 2 1/2 or 3 star hotel at best.
