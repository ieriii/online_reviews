I've been a fan of the bongo room for a few years now. I think their strength lies in the sweet and unique pancakes and french toast items, more than the savory. I'm not a benedit person, but many people have raved about the steak benedict w/pesto hollandaise. My favorites are currently the apple brown sugar crumble french toast on the specials menu and the pretzel pancake. It feels like you're eating dessert for breakfast, but I totally don't mind:)
