Four stars? Five stars? Are all you people from New Haven or something. Piece's pizza is about as adequate as Chris Dodd's Financial reform bill. Got the New Haven Style pizza--big mistake. One of the worst, if not the worst pizza, i've ever eaten in my life. Cheeseless and soggy. Toppings slide right off when you pick up a slice. And what's with the huge rectangular baking tray that takes up half of the table, when we ordered a medium pizza. Four stars? Really people? Lets try to have some standards folks.
