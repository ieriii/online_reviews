So, I booked this hotel for me & my husband for 1 night via Priceline. It was my 1st time to use Priceline so I wasn't totally sure what I was doing. This hotel is really, really nice. The entire staff, from the valet, to the bellman, to the concierge, were all so helpful. Our room....it was very pretty, clean, but the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in! My husband and I laughed about it, but seriously, I would guess a prison cell is larger! I'm not even kidding...I think they took a storage closet and thought, "Hmm, we could make a few extra bucks if we put a bed in here". Again, more than anything, we just thought it was funny. It was quiet and fairly easy to navigate through the hotel...and this hotel is HUGE. They said it takes up an entire city block. We had show tickets for 11pm without dinner reservations and the concierge was more than willing to recommend dinner establishments & call and get us reservations . It was a super stay!
