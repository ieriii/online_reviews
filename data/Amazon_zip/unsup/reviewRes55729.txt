To all the Lincoln Pk/Wicker Pk/Lakeview yuppies and scenesters- please stay far away from this place. We don't need you crowding us at the BEST italian joint on the Northside. The food is GREAT, service BETTER,and prices are reasonable. Please continue overpaying for decent food and crap service at the trendy spots east of Damen, while I kiss the sky at Sabatinos. To all others- the Spinach Gnocchi is heavenly, the spinach soup is unbelievable and the wine list is pretty impressive- you must come here (don't forget to tip the musicians).
