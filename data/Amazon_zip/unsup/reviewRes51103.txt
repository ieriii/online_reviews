Went there for lunch on a weekday after I looked up "Brunch in Andersonville" on my Iphone about 3 weeks ago. Signed up for Yelp to write this review. There were about 3 tables with people at them when we arrived and the server was by himself with terror in his eyes. The service was extremely slow and as more people kept showing up the server looked more and more terrified and it was quite obvious he had no idea what he was doing. He was nice and pleasant but I ran out of water after a couple of minutes and didn't get it replenished for 10 minutes. I asked him for a recommendation and he said the burger was the best he had ever had. My girlfriend ordered a tasteless bean dish and my burger had grisly fat sections, a half stale bun and was smothered in mayo. I eat 2 or 3 burgers a week all throughout the city and this was by far the worst 15 dollar burger I've ever had. The worst was yet to come. While eating, the phone at the restaurant kept ringing with no one to answer it because the server was completely in the weeds. Then we started hearing obscenities being screamed out of the kitchen by a chef. He was violently berating other, female cook in the kitchen for at least 10 minutes with a plethora of f bombs. There was a family with a child sitting right outside of the kitchen. I was shocked. Everyone could hear him and he didn't stop. I go out of my way to tell people how awful of an experience this restaurant was for me.  I signed up for Yelp to let you know. That Chef needs to be out of business. Way overpriced, terrible service (for lunch at least) and a chef who can't keep his mouth clean when the whole restaurant can hear him.
