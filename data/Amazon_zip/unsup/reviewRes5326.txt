The purple pig is a fine restaurant. I saw positive reviews regarding their pork shoulder and bone marrow dish so I decided to give it a try. In brief, I fully enjoyed my first experience here. I ordered the eggplant with goat cheese and milk braised pork shoulder. The bone marrow was the major reason why I went there, but they didn't serve it on that day. Bummer. Anyways, the eggplant dish was a great surprise. The bread with goat cheese was fantastic. The goat cheese was one of the best I've experienced so far, and the bread slice was toasted perfectly. Topped with the eggplant caponata, the flavor was rich and exciting. To be more specific, its flavor was fairly 'colorful'. It had so much going on in harmony in addition to the sweet/sour base. The pork shoulder was well braised and seasoned. It tasted mild and had a nice texture. The pork kind of melted after chewing, and it didn't get in between the teeth. Thumbs up. Besides, I liked their urban yet laid-back decor. The waiters and waitresses were attentive and friendly. 4-star is a conservative score. I need to try their bone marrow first. It will probably bump up to 5 after that.
