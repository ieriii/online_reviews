This review is for the lounge only, not the restaurant. The lounge has beautiful tropical Polynesian decor and at night with the lights, it is a magical, romantic place. Add to that the delicious fruity drinks and martinis (and they're strong by the way) and you have the makings of a great place to hang out with the girls or a date. I would definitely recommend this place!
