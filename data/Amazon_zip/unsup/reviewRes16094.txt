I have been here 3 times (so far) and have thoroughly enjoyed myself every time. The first time, I came here with some friends and had the arrachera with rice and beans. EXCELLENT. Prepared so well with tons of great flavor. Two thumbs WAY up. The second time, I came here to watch my friend's father's mambo band perform for Carnivale's anniversary (shout-out to Angel Melendez and the 9-1-1 Mambo Orchestra!). I didn't eat this time but the margaritas were great. Try the mango margarita -- it's delicious! The third time I came here was Friday, May 4. Two of my bosses took me here for staff appreciation week. OH MAN! Do they know how to appreciate me or what! I had a jibarito and it was to die for. The plantain was crispy but not too tough, the steak couldn't have been any more perfect, and the side salad next to it was great. I have no idea what kinda dressing they put on there (maybe something of the balsamic persuation?) but it was tasty. :) The decor is great. It's so bright and colorful, but it's not obnoxious. While lunch was a great time to go, dinner is better. Sometimes there is live music and the atmophere is just overall ALIVE and exciting. Waitstaff has always been friendly and prompt. I can't wait to go back! Mango margarita...here I come!
