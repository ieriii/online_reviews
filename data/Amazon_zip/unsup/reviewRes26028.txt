Visiting Chi town from LA of course I needed to try what they are known for so I Ordered a small deep dish with Sausage, mushrooms, and green peppers. The best part of the pizza is the crust...yummy "caramelized" crust...as referred in another review. I love the big pieces of sausage. One slice was more than enough!!
