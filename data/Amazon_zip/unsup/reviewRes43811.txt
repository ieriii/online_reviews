I was very very happy we chose to go here! My parents & boyfriend and I made a reservation for 7pm on Saturday night. We arrived, and they took us to our table which was in a private dining room in the back. The place is pretty huge, many smaller rooms besides the large dining room. There was another family in our room and a table of about 12 people. But it was still very quiet, very dim, elegant. A private restroom and coat closet were in our dining room as well. The el goes by every 30-45 minutes as well which you could slightly hear, but it was a nice tour to a Chicago steak house, and not intrusive. Dress was business casual, nothing overly fancy- even on a Saturday night. But some who were dressed up looked perfectly appropriate as well. Our server came and told us about specials as well as drinks and items from the menu that he enjoys most. They also have a Winter Delight menu (which is faxed price.) Choice of a salad, entree and dessert for $10. SO cheap!! Believe it or not, mom, dad and I go the house salad, tenderloin medallions, mushrooms and smashed potatoes (large portions) and dessert. My boyfriend got the Delmonico steak with a side of spinach and mushrooms. We all just loved it! Delicious! And coffee was great too. The only bad thing was- they forgot to bring our goat cheese appetizer. We just told them and they asked if we wanted anything else, we said no, and they removed it from the bill. No huge deal. We actually finished dinner at about 8:30 and we ended up staying and talking until about 9:30. So it was a good 2-1/2 hrs after we were seated. they didn't bother us, they didn't rush us. They let us be. And when we were finally leaving, the place was pretty empty except for the main dining room. I would definitely go here again for the food, the convenient location (just behind Merchandise Mart), the romantic ambiance, and the considerate and friendly service.
