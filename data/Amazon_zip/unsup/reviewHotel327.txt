My friend and I stayed here this past Valentine's weekend. It's an older hotel so it has a really nice atmosphere and old-fashioned (i.e. courteous) service. They were not intrusive but very accommodating. GREAT location for us - just a few blocks from Wrigley Field, and near several cool nightclubs, The Metro a few blocks past Wrigley Field, and tons of shops, restaurants, bars. The CTA is close by as are other public transportation. VERY comfy beds, robes were provided, as well as a very efficient blowdryer. Only complaint was that like most buildings in colder climes, the heat was very high and we could not figure out how to turn down the radiator. Fortunately, the windows opened so we got some fresh air. Given the small amount of time we actually spent in the room, we didn't bother calling down to ask about the heat, but I'm sure they would have responded right away, just like they did to all our requests. We checked out 2/15 and stayed with a friend for 2 more days, then went home. That's when I realized I'd forgotten a favorite sweatshirt! Called the day I got home, 2/17, and spoke with Maria. She called me back to let me know she'd found my sweatshirt and I delightedly gave her my cc info to have them mail me my shirt. It arrived yesterday along with a top Ithat I forgot I'd forgotten! Will definitely stay here again! Affordable too!!
