Fantastic, probably one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Im a big fan of latin food and this is at the top of my list. Ive eaten here a few times and always enjoy their beef dishes. I also attended a mojito making class and it was awesome! The teacher was patient and we were were provided with many snacks as well as got to drink all the moitos we could make. Im all about hands on education :)They've got a few big tables and private rooms, so if you're going with a big group be sure to make a reservation.
