I love this place. The food here is always good-- very consistant.....The delivery is great, the food shows up hot and fresh. I would reccomend the Koubidah and the Barg Kabob, my favorite. The Babagunoosh and the rice are by far the best. 5 stars would have been given if the menu prices were a bit lower, But i guess if you want great food you have tyo pay for it.
