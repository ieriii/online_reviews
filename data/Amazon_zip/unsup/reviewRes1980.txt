After trying Franks and Dawgs, we decided to try our luck at getting a Hot Doug. The line was out the door, but moved relatively quickly. The area was nice, and street parking was free. For the amount of people there, we were still able to get table. I had a apricot and brandy chicken sausage, and hubby had a Chicago style, and the Rattlesnake. Mine was only so-so, and the cheese on top did not seem to go with the sausage. I hated the Rattlesnake. The duck fries are only served on Fridays and Saturdays, so we settled for the regular fries, which were so-so. Disappointing, and so surprising considering the other reviews. I wish the flavors were as good as Franks and Dawgs.
