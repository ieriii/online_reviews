Just had seen a thread for an Italian Restaurant.. and without a second of thought Sabatino's is always the first to come to mind. Far and away my favorite Italian joint in the city. Talk about a throwback... This place is amazing!.. I'll admit, I'm a real sucker for that old school, Italian supper club atmosphere.. Its dark, great music.. a piano bar with seating built into the piano!.. the wait staff are mature maitredes bow ties tuxedos and all.. A real Chicago original. The food is amazing and beyond reasonably priced. great place for a celebration and an experience you will not soon forget! Top of my list when friends/family are in from out of town.  Leave the gun...Take the cannoli!
