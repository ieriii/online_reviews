This place is incredible. Definitely worth the wait. And Doug is as cool as it gets. For people who have never been here, Doug is the owner and the guy who takes your order at the cash register. He's very friendly and makes you feel like you're the only person in the restaurant when it's your turn to order. From the regular menu, I recommend the Frankie "Five Angels" Pantangelli and The Elvis. But you should really try something off the specials menu, especially the Ribeye Steak and the BLT.
