Great food & atmosphere.. You can't go wrong with their specials or any burger. Went tonight as only my 5th time and it was better than ever - just wish it wasn't so tight in there. If you're going out as two, invite a couple more people (the tables are that much better). All around great place, awesome food... One of the best spots in Chicago.
