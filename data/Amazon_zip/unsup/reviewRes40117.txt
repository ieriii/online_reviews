This place is A++ Drinks are stellar, food is some of the most delicious I have ever tasted. I advise to go on an off time if you want to get in. This place is totally 100% worth the hype and then some. It's worth the hour you have to wait even at 5:00 pm on a Sunday. The atmosphere is very intimate and the service is exceptional.
