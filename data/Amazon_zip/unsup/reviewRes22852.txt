Delicious, authentic sze chuan cuisine. Chef Tony is a genius. The Chef Tony's Chili Chicken and Salt and Pepper Lamb are to DIE FOR. I could take a tub of either of these to the movies and snack on it for hours. The black bean whitefish and sze chuan beef tenderloin are also really good. Actually, never been disappointed. HOWEVER - DON'T GO ON CHRISTMAS. We stood outside for an hour and a half in the snow before we could be seated. Any weekend prepare for a wait, but Christmas was ridiculous. Although it is fun to hear people cheer when their number is finally called.
