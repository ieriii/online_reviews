I had dinner at the Gage on 12/22 for dinner with 8 of my friends. We were out celebrating the holidays. Our server, "K", was nice enough and even brought us three desserts "on the house" that we did not order. We thought this was so nice, until the bill came and we were charged for those 3 desserts! We did order a few bottles of wine, but we are not oblivious to an extra almost $40 bucks on our bill!! We pointed this out to K and he immediately said he would take it off the bill. No question asked. Hmmmm but the question is- was he trying to take advantage & pad the bill of what he thought was a table too drunk to know??? I won't be back!
