I was visiting some friends in Chicago for the weekend and we stopped into Carnivale for some drinks and small plates. We arrived right at 5:00 pm on Saturday evening, just as they were beginning dinner service. The space is colorful and lively. To drink I had the Organic Paloma. So good, I had a second. We ordered the Guacamole which was perfectly traditional and tasty. Good thing we ordered the large order as the chips were equally as awesome. Next up was the Hiramasa Ceviche which was clean, refreshing and delicious. The Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos) were average, and a bit on the bland side. In and out in about one hour, and off to the next stop on the tour. I'd definitely come back on my next visit to The Windy City. If you happen to be from Philadelphia and reading this review, Carnivale is comparable to the likes of Distrito and El Vez. Bonus points for listing the Farms they source from on their website. Every restaurant should do this. Awesome.
