Love this ambiance of this place. Lowly lit and communal tables definitely makes this place special. Plan on splitting your appetizers and entrees with your group. While I personally didn't like the bone marrow, it was also the first time I had it and I wasn't sure what to expect. For entrees we had the pork belly, rib eye, and the chicken. The pork belly was absolutely to die for... granted I cant recall a time I've had bad pork belly. The chicken was very very flavorful and juicy. If I were to do it again I would've gotten the meatballs instead of the rib eye, but I highly recommend this new, hip River North joint!
