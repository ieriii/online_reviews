I came here for mother's day brunch. just my momma and i. :) we started off with mimosas and they were serving a special menu for mother's day. salad bar was awesome. they had one bar just for desserts. service was awesome and they gave us a seat next to the window (since we love to people watch! haha) as i requested. after dinner, we went up to the rooftop. it's not too big but spacious.  i always wanted to go back to try their dinner menu but i never found time. hopefully soon. i will update my review when i do.
