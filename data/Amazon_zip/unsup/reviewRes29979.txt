In retrospect, perhaps I should have tried to come here for dinner instead of a 0730 early breakfast, because I just wasn't terribly impressed with my texas french toast for breakfast. Love xoxo's description of this place, cuz quite apt. Dont' come here to this quiet locale in Gold Coast for noise, trend, cool, glitz. Ain't gonna happen. Instead, walk a few steps down and walk into what is more like a dated conversation pit that was so in a few decades ago in living rooms....there's even an old-fashioned cash register that one has to press down really hard for it to make that clunkety-clunk sound that just adds to the overall feel. Apparently, at least 4 other parties were already well into their breakfasts. Though quite ample in portion, the toast was just chewy and 'limp'... don't know how else to describe it (I have had stellar french toast in my time....read Tower cafe or Bella Bru, Sacramento). Though dipped in egg and then pan-fried, the toast did not possess that great play in crisp and then soft on the inside...instead it was all completely soft somewhat tasteless. Would have been a nice touch had they just added a splash of nutmeg and/or cinnamon to the egg batter. Syrup is the other half that comprises a killer french toast experience: it was... meh. From the perusal of breakfast reviews, it's sort of hit/miss with this well-established place that is connected to the south of a condo building. The entree + grapefruit juice ran about $14 for breakfast. Just south of Goethe on Dearborn... had a wonderful, quaint, stroll through historic Gold Coast looking for the FLW Charnley House.
