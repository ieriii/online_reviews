I came here with two girlfriends last weekend for dinner, and I was really impressed with the food. I had the special of gnocchi in arrabiata sauce, and it was really delicious. The gnocchi were filled with ricotta and were such light perfect little pillows. The service was very good and my friends enjoyed the BYOB policy. We got there at 6:30 on a Saturday and got a table without much of a wait but by the time we left there was quite a crowd at the door. The only thing that I did not care for was that when the host sat us, he let us know that they needed the table for a large party at 8:1 5 PM. We felt a little rushed at the end knowing that and wished we could have stayed a little longer. Despite that awkward encounter, the food was so good, I am really looking forward to returning. I would give 4.5 stars but I am thinking about those gnocchi again and will bump it to 5 stars.
