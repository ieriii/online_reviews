My only previous Greek restaurant experience was years ago here in Chicago. I'm pretty sure we went to Athena but I can't remember because I didn't Yelp back then! I thought the place and food were mediocre at best so I hadn't made a point of returning to Greektown since moving here. I recently went to Greek Islands for Sunday lunch with friends and my opinion has been changed! I had a great meal and experience there. The food was really good. I had the avgolemano soup based on friends' recommendations which was different than I was expecting but so creamy and delicious. Also tried the hot lima beans appetizer which I wouldn't have picked out either but they were fantastic as well. For my entree I had an orzo & lamb dish with a tomato sauce and loved it. The entree was huge too so I enjoyed it for dinner again later than evening as well!
