I love Cheesecake Factory and had high expectations for Grand Lux, but alas it was a big letdown. It takes forever to get a table and is very noisy and cramped inside. Maybe we just ordered the wrong items but none of our entrees were anything worth writing home about. Pasta dishes were rather bland and uninspired I've had better at Olive Garden and Noodles & Co. Sadly, the complimentary bread was the only thing good here.
