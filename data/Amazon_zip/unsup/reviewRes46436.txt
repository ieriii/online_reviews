How can I complain about a perfect Sunday Sunny morning and Mimosa for breakfast! Anything that combines liquor and breakfast is A okay in my book. Aside from that I had a perfect experience! My friend and I only waited 5 minutes and were cheerfully greeted and seated. My waitress I believe she played for the same team because she gave me special treatment my friend thinks. Though banana's are not apart of their fruit bowl I requested them and she had specially made all banana's and strawberries for me. I didn't have to waste or pick out the other fruit that originally comes with. The tables are nicely separated, and we enjoyed our neighbors of older women out on brunch. The food was beyond filling and delicious! We had breakfast with a dinner appetizer. Potatoes wrapped in egg roll style with bacon is simply heaven! I felt the prices were perfect, (Note: you are downtown the only thing your getting cheap is Mc Donalds) but I felt our meal of $50 bucks plus tip was beyond reasonable. I'll will make it back here asap!
