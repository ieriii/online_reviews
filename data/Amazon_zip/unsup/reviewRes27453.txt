This is a great gringo-friendly joint on 18th St. I have not had the chance to explore some of the other restaurants, but the food is cheap and the service is super fast. The restaurant can get very crowded, and if you go on a night that is busy, it can be a bit overwhelming. If you want to stuff yourself for less than $20, this is the place.
