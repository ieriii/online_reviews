Awesome food, great ambience, delicious cocktails, and just trendy enough for my fashionista friend's birthday dinner. In a span of 10 days, I ate here, The Publican and Purple Pig (a flurry of holiday get-togethers, what can I say), and Gilt Bar was definitely my favorite of the 3. We had a group of 7 so we took one of the communal tables at the front - so it was bustling around us, but probably calmer if you sit further from the door. Everyone had a cocktail to start - not a bad one on the list. The gnocchi was pillowy, the oricchiette perfectly spicy. I wanted to buy out the kitchen's entire supply of pot roast w/ red wine sauce. Word on the street is that the bone marrow spread was to die for (I don't go in for that kind of thing, but my dinner companions raved about it). For dessert, you must try their homemade ice creams (brownie sundae ice cream! what the whaaaat!), preferably alongside the warm milk chocolate chunk brownies. Definitely going back here again as soon as possible!
