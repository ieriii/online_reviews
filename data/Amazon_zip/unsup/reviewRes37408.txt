Now I know what a $12 beer tastes like. Hopleaf is fun if you have some money to spend trying out beers you never knew existed. Every time I've been here, it's packed, so try and go earlier if you don't like crowds or waits. Beers rotate in and out, and there are literally dozens to choose from. I've never had the same thing twice. Belgian ales are the best! Service is friendly... a little slow at times, but hey, I understand it's busy. The Fireside is another place in the area that serves up about 80 different beers, so if Hopleaf wasn't your thing for whatever reason, try Fireside.
