decent sushi, can tell the place has been around for a while, not as trendy as other places. waitress was a little odd, when one of us ordered a drink with cucumber vodka she told her not to get it because someone had gotten sick from it earlier in the week. too much information. drinks were decent, a little too cheesy, one looked like an umbrella drink. rock shrimp were amazing. other rolls were good but not mind blowing. tables were a too close together - someone next to us spilled their wine - which went all over my friend's coat and my purse. sushi is more upscale and inventive at mirais and japonais, would go there instead.
