After an early morning flight from new york, this place could not have hit the spot any more than it did. I dont think I can say anything else that has not been mentioned already, but it really is that good. The egg combinations were awesome, as was my sandwhich. And the prices only make it that much sweeter. Definitely head out to the west loop and try it...NOW!
