Wonderful! My daughter who cooks at an Inn on the east coast and I decided to celebrate the holiday with visits to three interesting restaurants this week and began with Sprout and it was a treat. She has Scallop, Short Ribs and Eggnog, I did Licorice, Lamb and Lemon ... every course was delicious and satisfying ... great flavors, plated beautifully without being overdone. The intermezzos were wonderful ... grilled cheese with apple was super but I keep thinking about that lovely raspberry ice and wanting more! Sprout will definitely be a regular stop for me ... what a lovely new spot in Chi.
