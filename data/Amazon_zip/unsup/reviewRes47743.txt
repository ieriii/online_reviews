The restaurant is like a fusion version of the typical Brazilian steakhouse (think Fogo de Chao, Brazzaz...). I enjoy this better, since the flavors are more diverse, so you don't get sick of what you're eating as readily. Not all of the different meats come out on sticks, and some come out on platters. (Ah, I feel like royalty!)  The selection at the salad/pre-meat bar (Harvest Table) is not as diverse as at the other Brazilian steakhouses. I was just overall not *that* impressed with the Harvest Table, although it did have a good number of different cheeses. The place is gorgeous, and there is a rooftop area that I did not get the chance to explore. Maybe another time...
