I used to love this place until the last two times the staff was so rude. The most recent time there was no one waiting for a table (so we would get the next available). The hostess suggested we go somewhere and get some hot cocoa and she would call us. What ??? I am coming there for dinner, why would I go somewhere else to fill up ? The time before that we waited for a table only to watch some other people stroll in and be given the table they had reserved.
