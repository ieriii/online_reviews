Creative exciting food for sure representing some of the best of the new generation of american cooking. The music is loud, the atmosphere extremely casual (wear literally whatever you want), and the customer service irrelevant. The whole atmosphere makes you think you stepped in the middle of a genius culinary heavy metal experience. Foodwise, everything was great but there was some degredation as the evening wore in presumably correlated to the staff whiskey shot consumption! Alinea is still an order of magnitude above cuisine wise IMHO but Schwa is like the rebellious younger brother. Good luck with the reservations....
