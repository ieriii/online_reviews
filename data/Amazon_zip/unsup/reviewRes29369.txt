Frontera is a must-visit in Chicago. Went on Friday night for first time and it lived up to the reviews. The margarita was very good--I ordered the Topolo margarita which is shaken tableside. All of the food was incredible. My favorite was the fresh tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa. Also the best tortilla soup I've ever had.
