Mmmm ... yuca! My friends dragged me from packing for my imminent move, and took me here for my birthday dinner this past weekend. I've been to Cafe 28 before for dinner as well as brunch, so I was happy! We shared a goat cheese appetizer (my friends can never say no to it, wherever we go) and the Tamal Cubano, which is kind of a deconstructed pork tamale. No, it's EXACTLY a deconstructed pork tamale, in the form of a tower, with a Cuban accent. I had the Cuban Roast Pork, which came with frituras de yuca, or yucca fritters. They're basically little deep fried balls of starchy goodness and trust me, they're delicious. The roast pork was cooked perfectly, and would have been boring except for the mojo it was topped with (pronounced "mo-ho"). My wonderful but very gringo friends kept calling it "moJo" with a "j" sound, and probably because I'd had a drink or two I thought it was funny. Mojo is a seasoning made of basically onions, garlic and citrus. The pork was supposed to come with caramelized onions on top; however, they weren't so much caramelized as sweated, but they were tasty. I think they were rushing our entres because we did have to wait a bit (not that I noticed, because we were having a great time). How could I not have cake for my birthday dessert? Dessert was a rum cake with berries; with strong black coffee, it was a perfect ending to my meal. Service was top-notch: friendly and helpful. While we were waiting for our entrees, our server felt compelled to assure us that they were on the way. As I said, I hadn't noticed the wait but it was because we were enjoying our conversation and we'd had appetizers and drinks. However, I did appreciate the communication from our server, who was great. I felt very special as the restaurant acknowledged my birthday with a free dessert and NO SINGING. Happy Birthday to me!
