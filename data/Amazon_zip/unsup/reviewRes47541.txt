all of the nomz, all of the nomz. Came here for Zed's EPIC brunch for a friend's birthday and did not leave disappointed! Think of the buffet brunch as pregaming Fogo de Chao as it's a similar setup. You have your salad bar/harvest table of salads, cheese, cold cuts and other treats. THEN, you have servers carrying different delicious choices of chicken and waffles (my fave), crab cakes and poached eggs, sirloin, sausages, brined turkey, salmon, french toast, oh my god, I could keep going! Excellent service, and their unofficial goal/motto is to have you rolling out of there once you're done!
