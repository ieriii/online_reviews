When we visit Chicago, love to get the house salad and pasta. My husband and I share this with the house bread and is enough to satisfy our appetites at a reasonable price. Good atmosphere. We enjoy sitting in the booths...Nice environment--lots of people, but good acoustics and friend people. Would recommend it, but be prepared for long waits during weekends and main dining hours.
