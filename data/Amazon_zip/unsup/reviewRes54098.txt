Rick Bayless has done it again. Very good food. Make sure you give yourself ample time to eat since the lines can get very long. Very creative twists to Latin food. Think of it more as upscale fast food. It seems to be structured very well...the lines move quickly, you order, sit down, and still feel as if you're at a sit down restaurant with Rick Bayless' wonderful creations. I have yet to order something I haven't enjoyed. Everything has been very good.
