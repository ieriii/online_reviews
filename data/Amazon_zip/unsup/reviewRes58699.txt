I can't stop raving about our diner at Graham Elliot. We have dined at many of the higher end restaurants in Chicago and can say that this is in the top four in terms of not only food, but service that makes you feel comfortable, if not at the top. We did find it odd at first that we were told that we wouldn't be seated until the actual reservation time (we got there about 20 min early) despite there being many open tables. We later discovered that it wasn't due to open tables, rather that there was a private dining event in a back room and they needed to make sure to stagger the tables so that the kitchen and wait staff would be able to attend to all tables with the same attention. Waiting until the reservation time so that we have attentive service is not a problem in my book.The food is incredible. The menu is set up to do the tasting menus. If you go and order a la carte, know that you will leave hungry. However, we did the 8 course tasting with the wine pairings and left feeling pleasantly full. The flavors in the dishes are incredible, and the portions are perfectly thought out to not over-power with the strong flavors. While the food was awesome, I think that the flavors are too strong to have larger portions.Service is something that I have not experienced in any other restaurant in Chicago. From the call to confirm the reservations when they asked for dietary restrictions, allergies or preferences, to being asked if we were on a time table or could enjoy a more leisurely meal, to the detailed descriptions of the food and drinks, the entire staff at Graham Elliott showed their pride in the restaurant. Can't wait to come back!
