4 words: best french toast ever. This is my favorite breakfast/brunch spot in the city. Their coffee is also outstanding - not that watered-down crap you usually get at sit-down places. They use fresh, high-quality ingredients (ex: Phil's cage-free eggs, fresh honey). Lou Mitchell's is for tourists. Bongo Room is ok. Go to Meli's for a fresh, wholesome, quality breakfast/brunch at a decent price. And if you're into french toast, then get your a$$ to Meli's pronto.
