Two of my friends and I stopped in on a night when the restaurant was noticeably busy, but were still able to get a table right away even without a reservation. Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable. Our food was OUTSTANDING, from appetizers to entrees to desserts The owner even stopped over himself (on a busy night, no less) to offer his recommendations on the menu, and offered to personally pair wine choices for our entrees. We eat out a lot and this was one of the best dining experiences we have had to date, and we will definitely be going back to the gage again!!!
