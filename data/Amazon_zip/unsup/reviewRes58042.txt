Great food, HORRIBLE SERVICE. It's pretty much the worst restaurant service I've ever experienced. I did realize that when it comes to Chinatown restaurants, service is usually not that excellent to begin with, but my experience was that bad...I went with a party of 14 and the following things happened: the first dish came out by itself (and nothing else came out for a good 10 minutes), no rice until we flagged the server multiple times, the last dish came out after everything else was finished, and I had to go up to the register to get the check after waiting for 10+ minutes. I mean, seriously???I have been to Lao Sichuan before and the service was acceptable, but I got a table downstairs then. I heard that the service upstairs is horrible, and apparently it's not just a rumor. If you're planning to go to this place, get a table downstairs. If it wasn't for the food, I would give this place a 1-star without a doubt.
