Perfection. This place was cool, calm and a great way to spend a three day weekend. My travel partner and I are crazy enough to go to the Windy City in January, so we got a kickn' deal too. The bathroom in our room was gigantic and there was even a little couch/table area which, considering the vibe of the hotel, I renamed "The Nook-ie". If you get a chance to stay here, you'll feel very swank.
