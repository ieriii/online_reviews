After an afternoon of shopping, a friend and I stopped in for some wine, a cheese flight and good conversation. This was 5 years ago and I was a cheese flight virgin so I had no idea what that meant. He and I, both being not so fancy schmancy, had to ask what the hell it was. We agreed to give it a go and we were not disappointed. I remember having a stringy cheese from France (not like store bought Frigo's string cheese but like crazy whoa it looks like a gooey yarn cheese). I was fascinated with the way it looked as well as delighted in the taste. It was mild and had a nice texture (even though my description sounds so, eh, pleasant). Years later I even found an old Bin 36 matchbook because it was so pretty (pink and green minimalist design) (that and I'm a pack rat). I was also under the notion that John Leguizamo owned this place. Either way I was excited to be there.
