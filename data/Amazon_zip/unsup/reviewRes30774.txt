Started a bit rocky when we arrived for 5 pm reservations and they weren't evenseating people yet but once we got seated our server Chris was super attentive and just the right amount of personable. The Brussel sprout salad was my favorite dish of the evening. The sake sushi was the best piece of salmon I've had in the city. Will definitely be back.
