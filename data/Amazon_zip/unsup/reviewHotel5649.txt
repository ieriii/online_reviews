I normally avoid "business" hotels, but, if you want a gorgeously comfy room with a lovely modern decor, stay here. (The lobby and bar are kind of boring, but the rooms are beautiful.) It's downtown, just off Michigan Ave., so it's close to great Magnificent Mile shopping and loads of restaurants. I recommend the very short walk to the Sofitel Hotel on Chestnut for Sunday brunch. It will make your trip.
