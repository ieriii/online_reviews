I went to a friends house, for Sunday Funday of course, and this was his recommendation. After walking in, on a Sunday at 5p, it was crowded. But we were seated within 10 minutes. After being seated, we decided to order some spinach dip. Very good and not too cheesy. Love the garlic in it. Then for the meal, we ordered a large spinach and mushroom white pizza. Awesome!! The crust was perfect, the white sauce was good and the spinach and mushrooms were fresh.  As for the decor, cool bar setting. Good layout and tv's placed well. Service was good and quick. Would definitely go back.
