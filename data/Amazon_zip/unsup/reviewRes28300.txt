This was our big night out spot while visiting Chicago. Overall, a good night--no real complaints, but I just wasn't blown away either. Upon arrival, I was struck by how orange it is in there. I wondered if it was a Halloween theme, but remembered it was September, so that didn't make sense. I like the reflecting artichoke images, very cool. We ordered drinks immediately and, even though I tend to avoid gin due to bad nights in the past, I had a blueberry gin cocktail that was amazingly delicious. I could have inhaled about 6 of them. The popcorn is a nice treat--good flavors, except it was a bit stale and seemed to have been made days ago. We decided to go a la carte, so we could share dishes. I started with the tuna sashimi appetizer with pureed avocado and passion fruit. The passion fruit dollops were amazingly incredible, but the fish had barely any flavor. I also had the corn soup with a garlic marshmallow. It was good, but nothing amazing and I got tired of the same bland flavors as I kept eating it. The star of the night was the bison steak with the BBQ sauce that tasted of root beer. The meat was perfectly prepared and was juicy and delicious. I could have eaten it every day. We also ordered the PB&J dessert, which was good and creative, but not my thing. It made my friend very happy, so that was nice. The service was strangely attentive and absent at the same time. Our water was refilled almost immediately after each sip and my empty plate was removed quickly, but I often had to wait quite a while for a glass of wine and was almost done with one course before it arrived. It was, however, a nice big pour. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, however. I'm glad I went and had a good meal overall, but next time I'm in Chicago, I think I'll check out other options.
