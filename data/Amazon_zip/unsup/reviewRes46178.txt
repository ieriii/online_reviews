This was our second visit to the Grand Lux and it never disappoints. The hardest part is trying to pick what you want from their HUGE menu of wonderful food. Portions are large, so be careful not to order too much. The Calamari Salad was probably the best salad I've ever had. Very unique. Bottom line, in the two times we've been here, we've ordered too much both times, and we didn't get a single thing we didn't love. Wonderful restaurant - we'll be back again & again.
