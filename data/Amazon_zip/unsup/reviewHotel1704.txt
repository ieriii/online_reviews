The concierge was so very helpful we enjoyed him very much. the location is great, especially if you like the theater, and there's lots of good shopping and restaurants nearby. Kimpton hotels are fabulous, so, the rooms may have been kind of small, but the decoration and music and attention to detail more than made up for the room size. I enjoyed my stay very much!
