This is my second trip to Xoco. Delicious again! We waited 45 minutes for table at noon on Saturday. That's my only criticism - need more tables! It is such sweet torture to wait in line when you're hungry and essentially standing in the kitchen, and watching all this food being made. We had an assortment of sandwiches. They were all very good especially the cochinitas pibil. Outstanding. The bread is so delicious and the spice level is nicely aggressive. Hot chocolate was very good. Try the one made with almond milk - super rich but not heavy. Yum.
