I give them one star that they were open and acknowledged our presence .The service is terrible. We were rushed through the whole thing. Our dinner took maybe 20 minutes since the waiter kept on coming up, interrrupting our conversation and asking if we need anything else. Yes, I might have needed a WARM dinner. I'm vegan/vegetarian and food tasted nasty. The waiter had no idea what was going on in the restaurant and was unfamiliar with their new menu. Mac/Cheese and veggie gyro arrived cold and tasteful. My friends nachos were cold as well and covered in strange cheese mixture ( not fake cheese, realy cheese but strange tasting). Place was dirty, way overcrowded for the quality of food, bathrooms in bad condition as well. I would have overlooked all of the above if my food was good and warm.Won't go there again.
