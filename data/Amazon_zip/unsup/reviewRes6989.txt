We started our gluttonous restaurant week at q and were greatly pleased. Delish ribs and cornbread-- and they brought us a small bowl of the chilli to taste even though it was not the size offered. Amazing stuff. The waitstaff was one of the best I've experienced.  This place is casual yet fancy at the same time. Liked it a lot.
