Been to Publican several times now and it is great. I have had pretty much everything on the menu, and don't think I have ever had a bad dish. I love the communal seating and the atmosphere. The beer list is extensive and full of interesting finds. The only negative I have expericed is the service. Hit or miss depending on the visit but overall Publican is still top notch. Enjoy!
