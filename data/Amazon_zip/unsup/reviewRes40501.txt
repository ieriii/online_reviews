Good restaurant. I have been coming here for a while. However I stopped coming here any more for about a year. Just went back again over the weekend, after a long hiatus. They charge so much here for the same thing you can get just a few stores away. Good quality pho, fresh ingredients... their high price has caused me to go somewhere else. If you dine here, I recommend getting strictly pho, other dishes are average but you pay more at this place.
