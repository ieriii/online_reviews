I wasn't sure what to expect, as the reviews were mixed...sort of love it or hate it from most. And I LOVED it! The place itself is beautiful, a great room, classy decor. The salad bar (hot or cold) doesn't matter much to me as I save my room for meat, but it all looked great. I did have an oyster and a meatball, both wonderful. On a Monday night it was pretty slow, but that just meant more meat for me. Great selection, all promptly brought by the table. Only had one piece that seemed sub-par, everything else was cooked just right and flavorful. And I tried it all. Multiple times. It was a "I skipped breakfast and lunch for this" type meal, and well worth it. I've done Fogo and Pampas, and this is my new favorite. Look for coupons, as there are deals to be had too.  Now, it's time to bring my cholesterol back to normal levels, so it's a few days of health food in my future!
