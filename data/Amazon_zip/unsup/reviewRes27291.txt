A rare thing happened: I made a mistake. I made a reservation at Graham Elliot on a Tuesday, and then arrived with my party of 4 on Wed, precisely 24 hours late. Luckily, the very gracious host was able to seat us right away in any case. But I felt that I owed GE. The popcorn has been discussed- obviously great. I typically get annoyed by the overuse of truffle oil, but it was appropriate here. I started with the heirloom beets, accompanied by hazelnuts, pickled pears and horseradish foam. The beets were excellent and everything on the plate complemented them. Presentation (as with all of the dishes) was excellent. I also tried the chestnut bisque, which was delicious, though almost too sweet for my taste. GE got back at me for my missed reservation during the entree portion. I ordered the arctic char but received the chicken dish. But I like how he serves revenge: Upon informing the waitstaff of the mistake, they couldn't have been more gracious and apologetic. I received the char a few minutes later - it was really really excellent - and got dessert on the house. In the end it wasn't a big deal and I got a free desert. The caramel apple desert with peanuts and apple foam was, for this non-dessert person, a lot of fun. The caramel and peanuts seemed to pop off the plate and the apples (sous vide?) were of perfect tenderness. The apple foam was nice, but superfluous. Also: great local gin; friendly staff; cool/casual space.
