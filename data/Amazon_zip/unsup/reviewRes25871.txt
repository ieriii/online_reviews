Very romantic and Delish! Although I must admit that I am generally satisfied with any pot of hot melted cheese or chocolate that is placed before me. I've never been to the melting pot, so I can't compare, but I thought Geja's was delicious. (But why does it have a spanish theme? Is Fondue an ethnic food? I thought it was a 60's American movement...)
