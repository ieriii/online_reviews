Angie's List of Reasons Why I Love Coast: 1. Variety - There's no shortage of maki rolls on the menu at Coast. Some personal faves are the Coast Crab, Ceviche, Sunrise, White Dragon, Wasabi and Sweet Potato (Don't judge. It's awesome). 2. Bite sized pieces - Sounds like an odd selling point, right? But I love the fact that the rolls are small enough to be bite sized. This means I'm not battling with having to take down a roll slice in 2 or 3 bites, which is messy. And you don't get every flavor into your mouth at the same time. And let's be honest, it's pretty unladylike. So the one bite roll slices at Coast are tops. 3. BYOB - Although there is an annoying new rule that you can only have 1 bottle of vino per 2 people. Pffft.... 4. Relatively inexpensive - We're not talking dirt cheap sushi (actually, really cheap sushi kind of scares me), but it's affordable. I love Coast. It's one of the best around. Although I always TRY other sushi joints, I always come back to Coast. Kind of like a good for nothing ex-boyfriend that you just can't let go...
