It's like living inside a pinanta! So many colors! So much to look at! My head is still spinning! Came here for dinner after catching the 4pm showing of Cirque de Soleil - Banana Shpeel with my date, and before you knew it... 3 hours had passed! Street parking was plentiful (and free after 6pm), but it was a Tuesday night, so parking's pretty easy to come by anyway. Our waiter was really good. Knew the menu inside and out, provided good recommendations, and was attentive without being too overbearing.  We started out with some aged manchego which came with this really tasty fig jam. The jam tasted like pureed apple pie! I had the Chuleta which was cooked to perfection and served with this bacon-polenta mash. OMG. Not only does bacon add a nice smokey/savory touch to the sweetness of the polenta, but the pork chop was grilled to perfection! It was moist, flavorful, and just... yum. Really really good! The boy ordered Churrasco which was also super yummy. You could still smell and taste the smokiness of the grill on the tenderloin, and the meat practically melted in your mouth. So good! There was also a little kick at the end. Loved it! Tack on a Rasberry Mojito for me (not too sweet, which is what I like), a Carnivale Margarita for him, and a bottle of tempranillo to split, and you have a bill of $120 (plus tax, minus tip). After finishing the bottle, we went exploring! If you get a chance, take a stroll around the restaurant. You'll find a lot of artistic photo's hung around the various rooms. Very interesting. All in all, a great experience with great food and awesome company. I will DEFINITELY be back!
