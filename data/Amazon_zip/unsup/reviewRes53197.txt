So tasty! I loved the Guajirito sandwhich. Super tasty, tender and just what I needed on a very cold Chicago night. I will be coming back here soon and I can't wait to try more things on their menu. The staff are really nice. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I've only been there once, I need to try more before I give them the full star treatment.
