Went for dinner last night and must say was very much impressed. Sat on patio with girlfriend under the trees and lights and felt like we could have been in our own backyard. Our waiter Mark was awesome,he was more old school then the mono toned no personality servers I have had way to many times before. Was very professional and there when ever we needed anything. He appeared at just the time we need more wine, was not intrusive and had a funny and great personality. He also had fun with all the support staff that assisted which was nice to see. And the food ,well it was probably the best I have had in Chicago. Girlfriend had the straccy? and I had the sea bass.Appetizer of antipasto was awesome. Will definitely be back and soon and cant wait to tell friends and family.Thanks Piccolo Sogno for a great time.William
