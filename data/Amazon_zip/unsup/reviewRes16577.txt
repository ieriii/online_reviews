*Note - this review may be a bit skewed because I was three sheets to the wind on free hotel drinks. Not a bad way to be. As I stumbled through the door (see above), I was overtaken by the sights and smells of wonderful Indian food. I happen to love indian food. I sat and was immediately served. Service was friendly, courteous, and rather speedy. I had the Aloo Gobi, samosas and naan. The highlight was the naan. Both the samosas and gobi were standard fare Indian - neither stuck out as amazing (I have two different restaurants near home - Pennsylvania) that blow this place out of the water - but trust me, it was QUITE good. I would most definitely return here the next time I'm in Chicago. Maybe I'll come sober so I can be a better reviewer... nah, probably not.
