This is the culinary proof Jesus did not die in vain. I would not, by choice, go to a cheaper steakhouse, nor would I go to a more expensive one after this experience. For the price, the amount of food you get is absurd. The quality is amazing as well. I can say that the filet mignon was the best cut I have ever had; it was better than fancier places with $30+/plate prices. The house special sirloin was amazing too. As far as service goes--fantastic. They were extremely attentive while not being overbearing. Plates and refills came before even I thought of them, and the dishes replaced in the first sign of being cold or empty. Truly, they are ninjas of food servicing. The atmosphere was very nice, but I did not feel under-dressed in a collared t-shirt and jeans. The music was at a perfect level where I could still hold a conversation with my date amongst the stuffing of face. If you can spare the $50/person price tag, this is a must. Also, if you sign up on their website, then you get some really nice deals (i.e. 25% off, buy 1-get-1-free birthdays/anniversaries, etc).
