i love the atmosphere and decor--latin chic, classy, and bold. they have great sangria, caipririnhas, and mojitos (try the raspberry). food/dinner is a hit or miss. costilla de res is worth a try, though. pass on dessert. carnivale is a fun place to go with a group of friends. i've gone on a tuesday night and weekend and seating's never been an issue for our large party.
