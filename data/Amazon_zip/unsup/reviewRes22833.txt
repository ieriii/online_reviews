What a yummy lunch spot! I met my folks for some late lunch here and we were all very happy with the food. We're definitely "American" Chinese food eaters, so I can't comment on their authenticity because we all ordered American style dishes - Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken, and mu shu pork. But all three were absolutely delicious. The potstickers we ordered were fantastic too. They charge $1 extra per person for white rice, maybe that's normal but I haven't experienced that before. Luckily, the rice is perfectly cooked and plentiful so it wasn't really an issue. My biggest complaint was the chairs - they are those clear "ghost chairs" with the restaurant logo on the back. They are simply the most uncomfortable chairs ever. Besides that though we had a great lunch!
