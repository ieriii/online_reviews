Coming from a Sicilian family who can never quite find an Italian restaurant that lives up to Nana's own recipes- Calo's is an A+! My father gives a restaurant's lasagna one chance- he gave that chance to Calo's 3 years ago and we are still going strong! My favorite is the baked tortellini al forno-- so much pasta, you will DEFINITELY have leftovers. My mom gets the filet every time, and she has never been disappointed. Even Nana enjoys the fair- feasting on the linguini with clam sauce, while Papa enjoys the Rigatoni ala Barrese (spicy red sauce with sausage and peppers). Staff is recognizable and will remember you-- always friendly and accommodating. Clean and inviting atmosphere-- great for fancy dinners or a Sunday night pizza in your sweatpants (actually my first experience-- pizza's not too shabby either). This is my family's pick over and over for dinners where "the family" comes together to eat. It can get pricey, but the portions are ridiculously huge and they make for delicious leftovers. I highly recommend it. Actually, I recently moved from the city, but "the family" is returning to Calo's next week for a dinner! It is SO WORTH THE DRIVE!!!
