Hands down, the best hot dog I've had. Better than Pinks in LA, better than any street dog I've had in NYC. Yes the wait can be long at times, but it's worth it... maybe not every week, but once in a while. My two favorites so far are the Salma Hayek (Andouille sausage) with grilled onions, mustard, and relish and the Duck Sausage with Foie Gras. Their specialty dogs can be pretty gourmetish and maybe more than what you want to spend on a hot dog, but man are they full of flavor. I just hope all these awesome reviews of this place doesn't over hype it for all of you out there.
