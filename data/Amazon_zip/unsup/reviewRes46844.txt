It seems like a slight to give this restaurant the same star rating that I gave to White Castle. I don't mean it that way. My actual rating is 3.5 stars. Here's the thing: I love what Uncommon Ground stands for. It sources most of its ingredients from local, sustainable farms (or from their rooftop garden). I also love that I can walk to the place in literally 30 seconds from my condo. I just am not that wowed by the food, and it's a bit expensive. I've had a pretty good eggy/meaty breakfast thing, a decent cheeseburger, a pretty good steak, but nothing that struck me as memorable or all that satisfying. I want to love this place, but if I want to eat clean/sustainable food, I can whip up something I got at the farmers' market, or I can hit the Whole Foods prepared food section at a fraction of the cost.  To be honest, and maybe this speaks more to my philistine palette than to any deficiency of Uncommon Ground, I get more overall satisfaction making a late night run to White Castle than I do eating here. Perhaps my star-rating should take into consideration social and health considerations, but I'm going to eschew an overly intellectual analysis and go with how happy the overall experience made me. It was fine. I felt good to be eating responsibly. The food was fresh, but the preparation was kind of boring. White Castle, on the other hand, is garbage. It's socially irresponsible and unhealthy, but it tastes good and I have fun eating it. Overall, social responsibility trumps fun (Uncommon Ground get 3.5 stars while White Castle gets only 3 stars), but only slightly.  Wow, what an inauspicious start to Yelping . . .
