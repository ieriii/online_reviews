For what this place is supposed to be, which is of course an oxymoron - "vegan diner" - I don't know how someone can complain about it. It annoys me when people say that because a place is vegan they aren't supposed to be making the "imitation" dishes. What, are they just supposed to make frickin salads? For people who haven't been vegans for a very long time, like my brother for example, for him to be able to go in there and get food that he was eating just a short while ago and think that it tastes comparable and in some cases better, that's a good thing. Back to the food - their mac and cheese is out of this world and their gyro, complete with the cucumber sauce is awesome. I brought one home for the hubby today on the way back from a trip to the doggy dermatologist and Wigglyville. When I put it out in front of him and started to dig in he said "I thought we were trying to eat healthy" and I just shoved a forkful of the mac n cheese in his mouth. About half way through the gyro I told him it was vegan. He was shocked. Now that's an impressive gyro. Did I mention I'm Greek? Even more impressive gyro, eh?
