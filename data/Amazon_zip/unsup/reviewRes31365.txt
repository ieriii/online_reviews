WOOOWEEEE! They got some great home-made sausages! LOVE it! I've been to this place a couples of times now and it hasn't disappointed me yet. When I feel unhealthy and lacking energy I crave Nana's carrot juice, it's tasty and refreshing! They serve a good hearty breakfast that is organic and delicious. I feel full and satisfied when I leave. The service was decent. Food came out pretty quick, the server came back often to check up on my table but her demeanor seemed a bit fake especially her tone when she spoke, not the friendliest waitress. But then again, she got the job done and it's all about the food...isn't it? As far the wait, I recommend going during the week during off peak hours, you'll get seating right away!
