I found this place when I visited St. Andrews and had to return the next day. See, the decor was stunning and the place was packed. I ran in and grabbed a to go menu when I noticed that they had lunch specials which included soup and an appetizer for $7. We returned the next day for lunch. I had the miso soup, which was ok. It was kinda creamy, which I am not used to and there was some seasoning that just didn't agree with me. The crab rangoon was amazing. I had the basil chicken fried rice which was quite tasty and some jasmine tea. The service was good. I don't eat sushi, but did think it was cool that they offered some fish-less entrees. My husband said that if wanted to take someone to a thai restaraunt to impress them, this is where he would go. I tried some of his pad thai which was good, but he felt that there was not enough chicken and too much tofu. I would go back cause of the atmosphere and decent food, but it was by far not the best thai food I have had. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, so I am rounding up.
