This was our dinner selection for Restaurant Week on 02.23.12 and it was a perfect choice and they will see me again. We selected from their RW Dinner 2 menu: Beignets stuffed with Shrimp, Monkfish, Diced Filet Mignon, Shrimp Curry, Shrimp Fried Rice, Cellophane noodles, banana wonton and Mango Sundae. What can I say expect that everything was delish. The servers were attentive, but not over bearing. Everything came out right on time. Very nice atmosphere. Upstairs there was a DJ and the music was nice. This is a nice place to hang out with a few friends and a great place for date night any day of the week!
