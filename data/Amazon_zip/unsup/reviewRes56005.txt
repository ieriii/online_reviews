We had lunch here on a recommendation from the concierge at the JW Mariott, and what a great recommendation it was. I had the ribeye sandwich which was well prepared and very tender. My wife had the eggs over homemade hash which she enjoyed immensely. We shared a bread/pastry basket with our friends and the banana bread and apple turnover was pretty darn good. Not bad for pub food. The decor was also trendy and fun sort of Iike a clean subway station but in a good way without the piss smell. I would definitely go back when I return to Chicago in 3 years.
