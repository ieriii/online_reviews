I wanted to give this 5 stars!!! It's such a cool space and the location is amazing right on the park, but maybe those two factors are what keeps people coming back, cause the food was very average. Buffalo style nachos to begin with were meh and then I got a wrap which was even more meh. No fries which was kind of a bummer as well, so I'm sorry RJ's, but you are classic in looks and feel, but not in food. I still might come back and give you a shot for dinner...
