Walk in with an open mind. You know you develop the irrational dislikes and likes in regards to what you are willing to expose yourself to? Yeah, do yourself a favor, throw it all away. I have never been one for molecular gastronomy, but going to this restaurant has given me a fresh perspective into believing in the science - or art. When they say 'no course is the same' they really do mean it. The beginning of the night started with the waiter asking me of my likes, dislikes, food allergies, and whatever else I would prefer. They fit every course around what I had specified. The presentation was impeccable - less a dish that you eat, rather a grand presentation that you watch unfold, becomes your dish, and finally you enjoy every bite. One of my dishes was presented, oddly, to me on a pillow - yeah, you heard it, pillow. When I was ready to dive into the dish, the waiter punctured the pillow and off I went. I know smell is directly related to how your food tastes, but it couldn't be more apparent than this. There are quite a few people who are critical of this restaurant and a few more who rave about this restaurant; even if you have read the bad reviews, it's worth a try. It's a meal of a life-time that I plan on having a few more times in this life. Please be on time! A bit of a winter storm was barreling down and they called me 10 minutes prior to my reservation to see if I was showing up or not. They have a 15 minute window in which they will cancel your reservation. The restaurant staff is very direct in enforcing the dress-code through their information they provide on the phone. However, when I was there in person, there was a guy with a t-shirt and shorts. Um, what? I'm letting that slip, the food, experience and environment just are incredible!!
