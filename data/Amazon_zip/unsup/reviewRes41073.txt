Just got back from this charming little restaurant. Went there for my gf's bday. We wanted to do the 5 course tasting, but we brought our own cake, the staff was completely reasonable and helped us out. Instead of 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 desert/cheese plate, they accommodated us by doing 2 appetizers and 3 entrees for the same price. We had the mussels, duck salad, lamb biscuit, halibut with risotto, and braised short rib. Everything was very good especially the halubut with risotto. Charming little atmosphere with great service. Their white chocolate mocha was REALLY good drink also. Highly suggest it for small intimate settings. Have fun...DO IT
