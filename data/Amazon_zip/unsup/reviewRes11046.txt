I have mixed feelings about Bongo Room. The food is good but service is quite bad. Let me explain... maybe 2 months ago I met up with a couple of my friends. I was running late so by the time I got there, it was close to 2pm (the time they close). The hostess gave me a very nasty look but sat me with my friends. The waitress comes up to me and says "you can't order because our kitchen is closed." I was shocked! There were other people ordering and I did not know what was going on. I asked to talk to the manager and he said "well your friends lied to us and said you weren't coming." I told him I was running late asked if I could order and he said I could. I mean, why am I held responsible for this mix-up? I thought it was horrible customer service.  I got a typical order, eggs/hash browns/toast. It was good but not as good as regular diners. The waitress was very nice but I really disliked the rest of the staff. I feel like these places CAN be assholes because they know people will keep coming back. I don't plan to go back to Bongo Room. It's too crowded and there are better places to eat brunch. This place is very popular so wait is at least 45 minutes, more like 1 hour.
