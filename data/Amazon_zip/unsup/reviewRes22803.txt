Once again, I'm shocked that I've never written a review for this place. Greek Islands has been a family favorite since... well... let's just say that my dad had his bachelor party there in 1982... back when there was belly dancing in the back room. I've had most of the items on the menu, mostly due to curiosity. Things I reccomend: saganaki, yeah, it's not authentic Greek, but come ON... flaming CHEESE, grilled baby octopus, lamb kabobs... or whatever lamb special. So good. And lastly the mousakka... this is probably one of my favorite foods in the world. Additionally, I find myself craving their roasted potatoes. I mean, yeah, they're just potatoes, but they really do hit the spot as a great side. I've been to a handful of dates here, but DEFINITELY not for the ambiance and location. It's a great place for families. It can get a bit loud, and super crowded on the weekends, but totally worth it for huge portions, and great food.
