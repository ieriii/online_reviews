Finally made it out here on a Saturday morning 25 mins to open. There was already a line of 20-30 people, but 5 minutes later the same number of people had lined up behind us. Street parking was ample, though I imagine it got worse for the people 20 behind us. At 10:30 sharp, the doors opened and the line slowly started moving. Got to the front of the line at 11:00 and ordered: 1. The Game of the Week: Brown Ale and Chipotle Buffalo Sausage with Bacon-Garlic Mayonnaise and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese 2. The Smoky Joe Wood (Today's Celebrity Sausage): Spicy Thai Chicken Sausage with Chili-Garlic Mustard and Sesame-Seaweed Salad 3. Garlic-Rosemary Smoked Chicken Sausage with Rosemary-Garlic Mustard and Smoked Cumin Gouda Cheese 4. Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli, Foie Gras Mousse and Sel Gris Managed to snag a seat indoors and the food came quickly (less than 5 mins). Thoughts: 1. Good though the cheddar wasn't melted and didn't pack any horseradish taste. 2. Delightfully spicy. Who knew seaweed salad would go well on a hot dog? 3. Mustard was a bit overpowering. Couldn't really taste the dog or the garlic. There must be another garlic dog that other yelpers refer to. 4. AMAZING. I would eat nothing but this for a week if Hot Doug's was open that many days of the week. The sausage itself was already tastier than the other sauges and then the foie gras was just the amazing delicious cherry on top. Do yourself a favor and order one. Gets 5 stars based on this alone. On the way out, the line was even longer than the longest it had been earlier, so looks like there's no avoiding the wait on Saturdays.
