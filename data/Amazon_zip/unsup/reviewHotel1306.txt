I had my engagement party here and the staff was nothing short of amazing. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you are thinking about having an event. The restaurant here is now closed and used as event space. It is SO grand. Wood paneling, chandeliers everywhere, and does not feel banquety at all. The food was incredible, everyone said it was the best they'd had at a party at a hotel. They also gave us a really great rate for all of our out of town guests which is unusual for pretty much any hotel where you are just having an event and not using a huge block of rooms. We hired the Bandoleros who are also great for parties, they sound a lot like the Gypsy Kings. All in all it was a spectacular event and wouldn't have been quite so fabulous without the help of the magical team of the RCH.
