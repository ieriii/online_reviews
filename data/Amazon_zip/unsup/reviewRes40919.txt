Having just come from a trip to Thailand, I was hankering for some good Asian noodles. You'll find them here. This is some wonderful Pho. My husband got the HUGE bowl and I got the duck rice noodle soup. Both were great. We also got the vietnamese spring rolls (which I never like and still didn't) and an Avacado/Taro bubble tea as recommended by our friend Kyle. Doesn't sound good? It wasn't bad! Try it. I love the bustling, shared table atmosphere. The place is BYOB, which is always a plus in my book. We'll definitely be heading back.
