I'm really torn about Fox and Obel, mostly because of one bad experience. I was really excited when I came here and found truffle and goats milk butters and fancy olive oils and all kinds of foodie goodness. I bought some butternut squash ravioli here and brought it home for my boyfriend, who's a vegetarian. He cooked up the ravioli and was eating it and noticed something that had a meatlike texture, but didn't taste strongly of meat. I checked the label again, and confirmed that it said butternut squash ravioli. Then, I noticed that it looked like another label had been taped over with that one, and I peeled off the label on top. The lower label indicated that the raviolis had veal in them. That was something that I expected at an asian restaurant because usually there's meat in everything, but a gourmet food store? Totally ridiculous. Buyer beware.
