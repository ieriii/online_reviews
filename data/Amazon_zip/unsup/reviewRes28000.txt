Finally got to go here because I was in the area. It was ok pizza. I was raised on Gino's East, where I love their cheese, the thick cornmeal crust, the sausage patty, and mmm the savory sauce. Here, everything was just ok. For anyone who remembers Rocky Rocco, the pizza reminds me of that, and I rather have Rocky's. (Madison has acouple locations, yay for me!) I would go here again, but would not trek out on purpose for it.
