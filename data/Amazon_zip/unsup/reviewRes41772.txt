I know that Tank Noodle is very, well, noodle-centric, but I was jonesing for a banh mi. What I ended up with was entirely average, both in meat and vegetable portions and in taste, although I should have expected something along these lines for the price of $3.95. My Vietnamese drip coffee with condensed milk was excellent, though, and I was about to end the meal on a positive note, but I'm pretty sure that I was overcharged, unless that coffee cost $4.00 for some ungodly reason. I might try the pho here at some point, but I'd honestly rather go somewhere a little more mom 'n' pop than this. The next time I need a banh mi, however, this is not my place.
