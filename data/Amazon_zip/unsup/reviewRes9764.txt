Fantastic food! I had watch Top Chef before so I was in a hurry to get to Sprout to try out Chef Levitskis dishes. We really liked the concept of the choose your own 3 course meal with some added bonuses were just as delicious. I had the Octopus and my girlfriend had the Lamb. We both were licking out plates clean. We enjoyed the entire experience. Tell your friends about Sprout, they won't be disappointed!
