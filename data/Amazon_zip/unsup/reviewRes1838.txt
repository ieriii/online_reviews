Most definitely, as good as a hot dog gets. First of all, it's awesome that Doug himself takes your order and talks to you. As friendly as a man could be, Doug is a generous and amiable guy. He in himself makes this place 5 stars. Now for the hot dogs. They are good. Like, really good. You might not 'love' each one you try, as each has such exceptionally strong and different flavors. But they will be like nothing you've ever had before, I can gurantee it. And I think every customer hits on one special that is amazing to them. So go forth, enjoy these wonderful gourmet delicacies. They will not disappoint (not even if there's a two hour wait, you'll only enjoy it more).
