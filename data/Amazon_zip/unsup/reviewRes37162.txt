I like pub food more than 'gastropub' food, so I did not eat here, but it is a great place to stop for a drink. Huge number of interesting microbrews on tap and a good bottle list as well. I was in early on a saturday evening and the place was packed. But bartenders were doing a good job taking food and bev orders quickly, and the crowd was pretty amicable. The best part was the upstairs bar. Quiet room, space at the tables, it was an awesome place to sit and visit with friends and would be good for a first or second date as well. Coat Hooks: NO
