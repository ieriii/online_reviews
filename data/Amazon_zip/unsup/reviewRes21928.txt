This place has some delicious food! Most of the time when I come here there is a long line, but it seems to move along nicely. It usually takes me 1hour-1hour and 20min from the time I stand in line to the time I'm walking out of the door with a happy belly full of food. As far as menu items the ahogada is my favorite torta (I would get the mild if you aren't a fan if very spicy foods) Other things that are good would be the chips and salsa/guacamole, the churros and any of their fresh made juices. I think the only thing that I can say I dont like is the hot chocolate, I have tried most of their flavors and didnt care for them at all. It is a treat to come here :D
