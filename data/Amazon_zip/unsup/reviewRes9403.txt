Finally made it to Sprout to try out brunch, and if you haven't yet tried - please wait no longer. The ambiance is perfect for more of an upscale (no need to wear your Sunday best, but Bears jerseys would be inappropriate) and laid back brunch for adults. The staff were all friendly and courteous, and our waiter - Adam - provided much helpful information about the specialty drinks & food and was wonderful to banter with about their beer selection. The food was !!!!!!!!!! How else do you describe... -- Bacon buns - warm dinner rolls with pieces of bacon. Slather on some butter and you are set. -- Apple crepes - perfect fusion of complementary of flavors. -- Duck hash - a light dish, unlike other typical hash dishes. You must must get some of the brunch cocktails. Please do not pass up the Rumtaki Fizz. Bacon infused vodka with pineapple! We also enjoyed the Truffle Shandy (have you ever had truffles to drink?? WOW!), Bugeymosa and their Bloody Mary was full of spice. To top off our lovely experience, when we asked Adam they had anything with chocolate on the menu (afterall, what is brunch without chocolate?) - he worked it out with the chef to bring out their chocolate dessert - a PERFECT end to our meal. Do not pass up Sprout as a brunch option next time you have guests in town and want to impress, are in the mood for a quiet experience, love quality food, etc.
