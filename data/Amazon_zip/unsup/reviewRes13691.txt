I'm glad we made reservations!! Great selection of fresh fish. I was disappointed that they were already out of the red grouper and mahi mahi, but had a really good pretzelled (sp?) walleye that came with roasted potatoes and asparagus. It was a big honkin' piece of fish--the serving size was nice for the price. It's also BYOB so hit up the liquor store next store! I would definitely go again for the cool vibe, great fish and next time I want to try their breakfast/brunch.
