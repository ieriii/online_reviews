Ventured all the way here from the loop at a friend's recommendation. She told me it was the best deep dish in Chicago. Not true, but still pretty good! Partly our mistake -- we ordered by the slice instead of a whole pizza made fresh, which makes a huge difference when it comes to deep dish. So even though it's super convenient to grab a slice, if you're making a special trip to come here, that's probably not the way to go.
