Have stayed here twice and had nothing but spectacular service. This hotel has a great swanky feel, but the price is just about right. (Was able to score a sweet deal using some starwood points) This is the hotel where almost ALL the MLB teams stay and you're likely to spot players all over the hotel during the season. Even if you're not staying here, take a load off in the cool reception area and people watch.
