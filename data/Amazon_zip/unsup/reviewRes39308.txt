Longman & Eagle's mantra is great. " Eat. Sleep. Whiskey " 3 of my favorite things (vices, maybe) in life. I would say that L&E does the term 'gastropub' a great justice. I've dined here several times and I've been more than pleased with what's been brought to the table. The food is super inventive without the overhanging sense of pretentiousness that some places hot on the chicago food scene tend to emote. The overall feeling I get from the patrons and workers is that they all have a respect for food and feeling good. No frills but excellent things are done. I always recommend this to people in search of something tasty. Things that have stood out.. - compressed melon salad - mushroom agnolotti - sweetbreads - wild boar sloppy joes (even good as leftovers) Can't wait to go back... again.
