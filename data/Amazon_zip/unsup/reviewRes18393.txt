I'm bumping this up to four stars. I had dinner here again and ordered what was basically The Hangover minus the burger and it was far better. I also opted for the truffle fries this time - heads up, kiddos, any of the fry flavoring options offered in appetizer form can be applied to the fries that come with your sandwich at no extra charge. Truffle anything is amazing, but I really loved these.  I managed to wander back and check out the game room. Unfortunately, the game selection is pretty paltry - this place has nothing on Guthrie's, but the room is comfy and has a fireplace. I see this being a frequent winter destination!
