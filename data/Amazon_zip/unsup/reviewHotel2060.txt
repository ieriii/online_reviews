this is my go-to chicago hotel. stands head and shoulders above all other holiday inns i've ever stayed in. +1 for location. atop the chicago sun-times building. you can get to the merchandise mart L station without even having to go outside (useful in summer and winter). from the hotel lobby, there's a back set of elevators that will take you to the 2nd floor. walk straight through merchandise mart on the 2nd floor, you'll run right into the L station (brown line, one stop away from the loop) +1 for having some class. seriously. if nobody told you that it was a holiday inn, you'd have very few indications of such. +1 for clean rooms. +1 for brand new plumbing/hardware in my bathroom (21st floor). -1 for expensive parking ... but what else is new, chicago? dump your car elsewhere and take the L to the hotel. +1 for friendly hotel staff. +1 for taking care of priority gold members. voucher for 15% at the hotel restaurant, italiasia. +1 for good breakfast buffet at italiasia. +1 for cityscape bar. overlooks the skyline from the 15th floor. fantastic at night. +1 for the folks at the bar letting us come in and use the Wi-Fi for a few hours (without buying any food/drink). +1 for free Wi-Fi (with passcode obtained at check-in). +1 for banquet halls and meeting space. +1 for offering AAA discount rate. +1 for pool and fitness center. nothing too special. i've stayed at this hotel perhaps 8 times now. recommended, even if you're on a budget. i'll return the next time i'm in the city.
