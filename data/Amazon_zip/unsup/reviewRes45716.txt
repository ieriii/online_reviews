I have been her many times because the food is great. I went last night and the service was horrible! My friend and I work in a bar so we love to over tip as long as you talk to us and take our order. Well, our waitress did not get over tipped. She was horrible! If I ever go back I will make sure its for lunch when they are not as busy.
