First, I'm not a vegan or a veggie. But my father and my fiance are so I go here a lot. I've had a lot of vegan and veggie food in my life and this is just ok. The staff is great. But almost all the food is some kind of fake meat product which annoys me. A few dishes would be fine but there are veggies in this world that aren't just trying to find and duck substitute. And one last thing, if you're a place for veggies, wouldn't you have the best veggies in your food? Because they're mediocre at best.
