Gorgeous place. It feels so warm and cozy. I'll definitely have to visit the roof top during the summer. As for the dining experience, not what I expected and unfortunately we had a dinner reservation so I couldn't only go ONLY for the drinks as most Yelpers suggested. This was my first time at a "Churrascaria". For the money you pay , the food and service should have been excellent, it's wasn't. I mean our waiter was very attentive but the "gauchos" pretty much ignored our table the whole night. I could even see our waiter getting pretty annoyed. I went up to the salad bar and got a few items including some awesome awesome mushrooms with some type of feta dressing. YUMM. Then at the table they had the delicious biscuits that everyone raves about...and they keep bringing you more. For the meat part, I had two pieces of fish, a piece of chicken, some duck, a slice of venison, a slice of top sirloin, and a slice of prime rib. Hmmm...slices. Which we waited about an hour and a half for all this to come around. What a rip off!! I don't care if it was a Saturday around dinner time, they should be prepared. Not a good first time for me, hope the next Churrascaria I visit has a better dining experience for me.
