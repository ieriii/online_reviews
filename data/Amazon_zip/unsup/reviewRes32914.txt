I absolutely loved the carrot potato dish - I highly recommend the 2 person-3 dish each for 28 bucks, it was well worth it. Although my server wasn't very attentive (and I saw her smoking in the corner by the bar, how lazy to not even go outside) she was brutally honest as to what was good and bad, and she was right about them. She told me all the good desserts were sold out, so I could not get one. It was a little sad, being my birthday dinner and all. So I decided to let go of the the smoking thing, because at least I had good food to eat. I don't blame the servers, but more the floor manager, who seemed to be a little too laid back when he should be monitoring the servers.There was some guy who kept checking up on us, he was very nice but I have no idea who he was, he was dressed as a busboy but wasn't serving water? He made up for everyone else being so laid back, however, it was sort of strange as I didn't know if I could tip him, but would have liked to. The music was a little too loud, being an electric keyboard, it sounded a little tacky. All in all, it was an interesting experience.
