First and last time. After my house mate raved about this place I was stoked to try it out. We had onion rings as an app after our server raved about them. We found them to be lacking in flavor. Ranalli's onion rings are still my favorite. After looking over the menu I settled on the Gunthorp Farms Pork Chop which I found to be tender but lacked flavor. The mash and was delicious, at the same time it couldn't save the dish. Paying $30 for a tasty mash is not one of my favorite things to do and left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Coupled with okay service it was a miss for me. Also the roomie complained of a foul smell and we found out it was the trash can that sat near the steps; when the wind picked up it'd roam over and disturb our so-so dinner. Lastly, since I don't drink beer I opted for a Ginger Ale that was from the fountain. When I asked for a refill I was told that it'd be an additional $2.50. Found that to be a little odd since it was a fountain drink and the restaurants I frequent offer refills at no additional charge.
