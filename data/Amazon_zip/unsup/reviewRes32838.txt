Like many of the reviewers this was my first experience with Ethiopian food so I was a little hesitant about what to expect. All I can say is wow. A group of us went and so I got to sample quite a bit of the menu (we had a total of 8 entrees to share). Everything that was described as "stir fry" by our server was AMAZING. Pork, chicken, beef, you name it...delicious. The sour dour flat bread took some getting used to because of its unusual texture (spongy) and the no utensil thing was weird at first, but fun after you got the hang of it. All I can say on the negative side is they need to crank of the AC. Crowded restaurant + spicy food=hot hot hot!
