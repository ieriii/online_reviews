I've been wanting to go to Carnivale since it first opened... well, it obviously took me quite a while but I finally made it there! Hubby & I went for dinner last night and had a great time. The drinks were great (tried the mojito, raspberry mojito, & caipirinha), and we deliberately got there early to have a drink in the lounge and listen to the band, which was fun. I loved the ambiance with all the bright colors and festive feel; I also loved how open it was. Very large, clean, & well-decorated bathrooms are always a plus. Our server was excellent-- he clearly knew the menu well. And he wasn't too pushy with the upselling, as I've often found servers at comparable restaurants to be. We had the guacamole and the ropa vieja as appetizers. Both were excellent; I was particularly a fan of the ropa vieja w/ the spicy mayo. Yum! I had the arrachera (strip steak w/ chimichurri sauce on top of rice & beans) and my husband had the chuleta (pork chop). Both of us were pleased with our meals. I don't even really like pork chops that much, but I gotta say-- my husband's was very flavorful, juicy, and perfectly cooked. All in all, a great place to go. I'll definitely be back.
