We are from Houston, Texas. I think this restaurant is definitely overrated. I guess the standard in Chicago is different than Houston. We ordered Chili pepper chicken, Mongolian beef, Beef with broccoli and Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. They were all OK and we had better elsewhere. The service was very slow at the beginning. Waiter staffs were just standing around. As they got busier, the service got better. The place is small and it is kind of pricy compare to Houston. They gave you free hot tea and pickled cabbage but yet they charge you white rice which is very odd to me.
