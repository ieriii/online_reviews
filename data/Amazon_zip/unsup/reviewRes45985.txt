We went here for some desserts, and I didn't have a lot of high expectations. It was quite pleasant, service was attentive because we went very late. My take on the food: - This is definitely chain casual dining, so for what it is, I think the service is great - We ordered molten chocolate cake and beignets. We were fine with the 30-minute wait and they didn't take too long - The molten chocolate cake was kinda okay. It should either be very sweet, or very bitter, this one was sort of in between, did not have a personality to dare either way. The ice cream also wasn't very sweet - The beignets I liked. Though they are a far cry from the real thing in New Orleans, I love fried food. Of the sauces, the strawberry was my favorite, the other two seemed a bit fake I would come back here for something casual.
