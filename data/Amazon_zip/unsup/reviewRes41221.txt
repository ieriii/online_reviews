I don't know about all those rave reviews. I must be ordering the wrong thing. The pho is not as good as other places down the street (try Pho 777), hu tieu not so great either, mi bo ko (beef stew egg noodle) is alright - would order again, mi vit tiem just okay. So I've only ordered noodle soups, but not sure I'd venture to try again, maybe a rice dish or the banh xeo (looked good - saw someone else eating it). They do have a very extensive menu, so its good if you go with a big party and ppl can order different stuff.
