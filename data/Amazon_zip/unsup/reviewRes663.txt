I have been there 4 times now and each time is absolutely amazing. Each time he comes up with new and brilliant ideas for the food. Yes, its pricey and it takes a long time for the 12 or 20 course meals but its so worth it for the quality food and service. Staff definitely much friendlier than other upscale restaurants.
