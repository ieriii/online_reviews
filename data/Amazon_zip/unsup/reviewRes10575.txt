Excellent! Great service, great people, great beer, great pizza! Piece is definitely a place you don't want to overlook! Yes there are a ton of pizza places in Chicago, but if you want a real "pizza fix" go to Piece! Their white pizza is amazing (sans red sauce) and their ingredients are fresh, their dough is delicious, and paired with one of their crafted beers, you really cannot go wrong! I have been to Piece for parties, for games, and the atmosphere is so fun! Highly recommended, neighborhood gem for sure! You can always take out too... "Piece out!"
