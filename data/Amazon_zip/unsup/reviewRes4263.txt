Was in Chicago for a long weekend celebrating our anniversary and decided to stop in to experience "quintessential Chicago". I didn't hold out much hope since we stopped in on poetry slam night, but I was amazed at the talent of not only the musicians but the "poets" as well. The only sour note I had about this place was that the bartender was a complete dickhead. He had zero patience with us ordering and was pissed off that we even ask if they accept credit cards.
