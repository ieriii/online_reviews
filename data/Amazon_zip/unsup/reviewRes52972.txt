Ambiance: It felt like we were on a vacation for the couple of hours that we were there... Cuban music was playing, simple yet fun! The place is clean and when you're done, they "may" let you write on their wall!  the good: oh man.. .where to start?? the salad.. AWESOME! they have avocado, tomato and greens and the dressing was light but very tasty. I definitely recommend BISTEC!! their chimichuri was really good!! It's definitely enough to be shared so if you're indicisive, try different dishes and share! Best of all... it's BYOB!!! You can bring a bottle of Rum and they'll make you a whole pitcher of Mojitos! How cool is that?!! the bad: Other than the narrow hallway that leads you to the back side, this place is a MUST TRY! It's about $14-$25 per dish but totally worth it! the bottom line: If you love Cuban food, you HAVE to try this place!! If you love food...you HAVE to try this place! It's BYOB, flavorful food, and you don't really find the service that they provide in a lot of restaurants nowadays. Their staff is so friendly and accomodating and just made you feel at home.
