I went to Longman and Eagle for the first time this past Friday after the city has been abuzz about this place in the first week of opening!  I have to stay I was incredibly impressed by the food here.  L&E was pretty crowded but after about an hour and a half of drinking at the bar we got a table. Other patrons here were super friendly and easy to talk to and I loved that people were sharing their small plates with people they didn"t know. As I said the food was delicious and I will be here soon to try more. I tried the rabbit pate, clam belly strips and scallops with oxtail ragu. The rabbit pate was delciously prepared and homemade. The scallops came perfectly cooked with a tasty sauce and bits of cheese perfectly paried with the oxtail ragu made each bite a taste of heaven.  I can't wait til they start serving brunch at L&E. This is definitely one of my new spots!
