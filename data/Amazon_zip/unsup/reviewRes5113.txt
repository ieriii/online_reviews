We went at kind of an off time, and still, the service sucked. Our server left in the middle of our meal, and the new one had no idea what was going on. We ended up waiting a long time for everything, even as other tables got their food. About the food -- it was good, some very much so (milk-braised pork, e.g.) but not anything to really write home about.
