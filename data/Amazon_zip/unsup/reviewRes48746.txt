The food, the drink, the amazing service! The only thing I could possibly complain about is the the noise (a little loud) and the location (a little far west of where I would like to go), but those are retarded complaints only an idiot would make. I don't want to impose my wish list upon an establishment, especially one as utterly delicious and fun as The Publican.
