My wife and I always avoided the place because of the friggin line and crowd...we hate crowds. Today we went and got there at 5pm. Our server was a real nice guy, knew the menu very well and made two suggestions: Ox Tail and Pork. Our meals were incredible. I should've brought a tasty beverage but we REALLY liked the place and we will be back.
