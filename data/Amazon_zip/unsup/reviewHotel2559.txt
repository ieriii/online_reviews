For a place that's 'see and be seen', I expected people to be a little bit more fashionable. The night I went, I wore a new D&G dress and a ridiculous pair of heels... and saw guys in jeans and women in their Wet Seal best. I guess after the hype, I was expecting something a bit more authentic. Instead, I found a typical 'Ooh, this is so New York' kinda vibe, from people who've probably never set foot in TriBeCa or NoLita. The space itself is fabulous - very art deco, ultra modern and industrial, space that would be fabulous for a gallery. A bit on the cliche side, actually, but fabulous. The prices are high, as is par for the course for this type of joint.  The appetizers are decent, but nothing special. I'm guess I'm beyond over the whole 'stand around, look fabulous and be utterly bored by it all' thing... especially since I've done it better in Manhattan.
