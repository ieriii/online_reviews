Yummy Yummy Yummy!I can't believe I've never eaten here before?!I went here with a friend one day, and we both got the Hot Doug and split cheese fries.Its so hard to rate a 'hot dog place' but this is not just any hot dog place.The charred dogs will keep me coming back for more, and I am very pleased I finally ate here!
