India House, how I love thee. You delight me when I arrive, before I've yet seen a menu with a sizzling iron platter of beautifully seasoned, oompah loompah orange tikki marsala and grilled onions. Your servers jump at the slightest movement of my head or hand - regardless if I am just reaching for the napkin and shifting around in my pants to allow for the maximum amount of space in my stomach to fill up with your delicious buffet.  At $14 per person which includes the piping hot tikki marsala that comes out fresh and direct from the kitchen, you offer a steal of a deal in a high-end area. Devon Street - what? I need not go up north anymore and ride with the homeless people, and instead I am parking myself in one of your plush booths and surrender myself to heapings of curry, tandori chicken, lamb kabab masala, mattar pineer, lamb vindaloo, and every other dish that we've attacked.  Your buttery fresh garlic naan could potentially double as a fantastic pizza crust -- it is warm, electrifying, and handy as we clean up our plates and dip it into all of the dishes, whose names we forget from our food coma. Your people - Indian, Chinese, Hispanic and whatever else color you may have back there in the kitchen - are so courteous and hospitable - they actually smile back and acknowledge us through the kitchen window. Maybe it's because they're surprised how enthusiastic we are as we skip up to and back from the buffet tables.  I write this review while salivating over this video that I found on youtube that another patron of yours posted: http://www.youtube.com/w. Sizzling goodness and an incredible value. You can bet that my friends and I will be back soon again for your lunch buffet. And if someone moves too slow in line, we will trample them faster than brides-to-be at a sample sale.
