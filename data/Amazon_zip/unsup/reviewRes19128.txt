The BA is a great place to get a drink when you want to grab some good beer without a high tab. The prices for the quality drafts are right on. I truly wish the beer flight was less than $18 for a few 4oz shots as I wanted to try all of them. The lighting is something you have to get use to with orange lights and orange ink on the menu which makes you feel like its Halloween. My biggest complaint about the place is the seating near the bar with picnic style benches that had me seeing the chiropractor the next day. Unfortunately we were so uncomfortable that we left without getting to try the food. I will be back and hopefully get a table next time.
