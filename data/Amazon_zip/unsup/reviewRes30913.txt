This is one of those places I almost don't want to write a review about, because I want to be able to go back and get a table. But I think it is too good to keep to myself, so here I go. I love Nana. I went there for an early Sunday morning brunch with some girlfriends. First and foremost, unless something changes in the future, they ACCEPT RESERVATIONS! This is truly awesome for a brunch place. Our server was friendly and attentive, with good menu suggestions. We didn't feel rushed or overwhelmed, and were allowed to have a pleasant brunch without feeling guilty about holding up a table. The mimosas with fresh squeezed juices were yummy, and the hot tea was pleasant with unlimited hot water for the whole meal (yes, I've been charged for hot water in the past). The food itself was wonderful - 3 of the 4 of us absolutely cleared our plates, and one made a comment that she would lick the plate if she could. I had the English Muffin breakfast sandwich for $8. The muffin seemed to be homemade, the egg was perfect, the bacon nice and crispy, the potatoes were delicious, and the side salad a nice tangy counterbalance to the creamy spread on the muffin. One friend had the huevos rancheros and devoured it, and another had the biscuits with duck gravy and it was to die for. Nana is a terrific brunch spot, in a great neighborhood (much love to Bridgeport) at a reasonable price. Most items on the menu were $8-14, which I really expect to pay for brunch nowadays. I'll definitely make the effort to go back.
