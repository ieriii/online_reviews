Tortas from the woodburning oven... Music, sweet music. Rick Bayless is the composer and the choriqueso torta (homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, tomatillo salsa) is his symphony. Dee-lish. The setup inside is a bit small and can be construed as cramped, yes. Whatever. I got a seat when I went in (5:10pm, day 2 of opening week) and experienced minimal line-waiting time. It's hit or miss anywhere you go. I mean, haven't you been to places that were busy one day and not so busy another? Yes, you have. It's called get over it if you want good food. Please remember to also try the almendrado (choco-shot + almond milk) as well as the Mexican choco-hazelnut cookie. My mouth is currently watering. Gah.
