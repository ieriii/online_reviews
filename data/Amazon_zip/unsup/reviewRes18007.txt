After many visits here, this place is due for a review. The quality and flavor of the beef they use for their burgers definitely sets them apart from other burger places. They get their beef from NYC butcher Pat LaFrieda. They offer hand-cut fries WITH the burger (not a la carte), and the ketchup is house-made. The fries are great plain, or with seasonings. I'm a fan of their truffle fries and their garlic fries. If you're getting an appetizer, definitely order the fried cheese curds. Greasy, salty, and cheesy, oh my... Their burger menu changes regularly, but the majority of the burgers are always on the menu - like the Black 'N Blue and The Frenchie. Those are the two burgers we almost always order. Medium-rare. I've also tried the Edmund Fig-Gerald (nice balance of sweet with savory) and the El Chupacabra (bold flavors going on there), as well as a few others. But honestly, keep it simple if you want to taste the actual burger. Too many toppings muddle the flavor of the beef. Just order the basic Bad Apple Burger if it's your first time there. The beer and drinks menu is extensive, probably bigger than the food menu. They offer outdoor seating in the summer, and they even have a "kids" section, where they have board games and pinball. If you want to skip the crowds, lunch time is your best bet. They've had a few hiccups in the past - burning the fries and overcooking the burgers - two big no-no's for me. But it seems like they're more consistent now.
