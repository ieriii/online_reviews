This place is not nearly as bad as most of the reviews would have you believe. It's just old. The staff was friendly and the lobby was actually pretty nice. The room was $87 per night and was about half the size of a normal hotel room. It was a bit beat-up. For example, the baseboard had some sizable dents in it, and the paint was peeling on the heating unit. Also, the bed was not the greatest. The view was cool though, and it was certainly clean and sanitary. No bed bugs, horrible smells, or anything like that. So it's a decent value for the price and it will be fine as long as your expectations aren't too high.
