excellent, but I can't say that it knocked me off my feet. I had high expectations if this place, and while they were met, they were not exceeded. some of the dishes were not very pretty in my 12 course meal. for example, the chocolate dessert looked like pooh on a plate. But some of the dishes were incredible. Overall a very nice dining experience. I like how they kept topping off my wine during each course (some restaurants are pretty cheap when it comes to the wine pairings), but for the $90 extra you are paying, I guess it's should be expected. I also thought that $7 for a cup of coffee is just insane. Did they roast the coffee themselves?! Geez.
