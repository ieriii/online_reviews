I've lived in the area about 1.5 years and pass this place on my way to and from work. I can't believe today is the first time I've tried it with all the great reviews on yelp. We ordered: -Cubano- really good sandwich, I think it needed some more of the mustard that was on it, a little dry, but still delicious -Maduros- sweet plantains fried, very very good, not overly greasy or seasoned, just tasted the way plantains should. -Empanadas- Beef version with a nice cilantro/onion salsa on the side, really good pastry dough and the inside was a good mix of beef and veggies. -Croquetas- I think these were stuffed with pork and cheese, came with a spicier mayo sauce, pretty good. Call ahead take out service was ready when I arrived, (5mins early from what they told me) and I was in and out within 2 minutes.  I'll definitely be back and try a different sandwich to see if I can bump them up the 5 star range.
