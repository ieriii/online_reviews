Hmm. I was unimpressed by place. I hope I don't sound like a complete snob, but when you're spending a certain amount of money you expect top notch everything. First off we ended up getting seated 35 minutes late for our 8pm reservation. After viewing other reviews, it seems like this place has an issue with this. We came for the steak. Like most people do when they go to a steak house. It was over cooked to begin with. But they also serve food on 500 degree plates. With nothing to cover the borders. You're warned of this, but aren't they aware that meat would continue to cook at that high of a temp? Half way thru my steak it became inedible. Disappointing for a 40 dollar fillet. Also food doesn't look presentable. They didnt wipe the plates so there is grease and whatnot splattered all around. Making your dish look unappetizing. We ordered side dishes. Mashed potatoes, asparagus, and spinach. All of which were pretty lack luster and the portions weren't as large as Gibsons and the price was about the same. Wine suggestion was pretty blah too. We bought by the glass, I believe it was called undercut or something similar. I probably wont be back. There are better places to go for steak in my opinion.
