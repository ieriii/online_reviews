I went here on a grubwithus dinner with 3 other travel lovers. We had a wonderful night in our own private room. The food was endless and so delicious. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. I had been meaning to try this place because I had heard that the food was excellent. We enjoyed the regular bruschetta and also the crostini di avocado for the openers. They're so filling! Next we shared the caprese salad. I think we were also given a giant serving of the mushroom risotto. There was just so much food, it's hard to keep it all straight! Finally, we had some eggplant lasagna and a few different desserts to polish off the meal. I would definitely recommend this place for a group or for a romantic date. It's easy to get to, easy to find street parking, and just a really good rustic Italian restaurant. I will gladly go back!
