This place was voted one of Chicago's 38 essential restaurants, and I completely understand why. Everything was amazing. I recommend: - Sitting at the bar so you don't have to wait for a table. - The egg toast (I seriously don't understand how they perfected this unique dish...the texture and taste were perfect). - Risotto (very delicious but was a bit too cold) - Hanger steak (cooked perfectly...it was fantastic). I am definitely going back on Monday for half-off burgers!
