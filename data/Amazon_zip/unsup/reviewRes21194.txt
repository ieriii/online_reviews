Yes, there was a line, YES IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT. I love, love, love interior Mexican food and the quasi-gourmet variations of classic street food was something I was seriously looking forward to. I ordered the Pibil Torta and thought it was amazing, if I could I'd add it to my daily diet. My only caveat was the habanera dipping sauce, it was almost unnecessarily hot. I cook with habaneros, I know they're crazy hot anyway, but that sauce almost had me dumping my face in the bathroom sink. Could've been a heavy batch, and I may never be back, so no way I'd let it ruin the meal. I did have the water of the day which was a ginger and mint--something-- I can't remember, but it was really, really good. Lastly, we ordered the churros (like mexican funnel cake) with homemade mexican vanilla ice cream, that was the best five bucks I may have ever spent. Amazing.
