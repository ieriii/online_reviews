Great lunch spot if you're visiting the LP Zoo. Salad bar is fresh and fantastic and could easily be a meal all by itself. Good soup. Great burgers and chicken sandwiches. Service is friendly and prompt. Good selection of beer. This place is a warm and welcoming, family-oriented, neighborhood joint with good food. Highly recommend.
