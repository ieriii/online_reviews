I recently spent a few days in Chicago visiting family and friends. On one particular night, about nine of us decided to have dinner at the Chicago Q. When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised to see that we were given a private room, complete with a flat screen tv (a football game was on)! The BBQ here is delicious! The meat is so tender and juicy it falls right off the bone. And did I mention the macaroni and cheese and cornbread? Delicious! We're a fun group, but full of strong personalities.  Anything we asked for, our server, Lateef took care of. He even anticipated several requests without skipping a beat. He helped make our evening an enjoyable one with his attention to detail. This is a restaurant I definitely recommend for anyone who loves BBQ.
