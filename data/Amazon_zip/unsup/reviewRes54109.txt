Loved it. We went there for breakfast on a tuesday morning. We got there at around 8.30 and the place only had about 10-15 customers. Service was fast and the food was absolutely delicious. We got 2 chocolate espresso (it wakes you up right away), 1 agua de Jamaica (refreshing), 1 huevos rancheros, 1 egg chorizo torta and 3 churros with chocolate sauce (the chocolate sauce is to die for). A very satisfying meal, bold favors, very refreshing sauces, roasted tomatillo for the torta and roasted tomatoes on the huevos rancheros. All this experience for only around $30. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and try some more items on their menu. We will probably eat at this restaurant every time we will visit Chicago.
