My buddy recommended this place. And I decided to check it out tonight. I dont know about the ambience of this place, seemed as if it was still be remodeled from what I saw but ohh well to the food I guess. I had the chicken chargha half slab..cost 6.99 . The chicken was just great...very tender lots of flavor and the naan bread was probably some of the best bread I had yet. I give this place 3 stars because I really did nor like the service ,or the setup..food was great though. Will be back again maybe my rating will change.
