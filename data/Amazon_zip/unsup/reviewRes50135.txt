Great place for watching a game and grabbing a bite to eat. Bar food but with innovative, delicious twists! Their wings are great, but be warned that they are HUGE - twice the size of regular wings, so keep that in mind when you order. Favorites are the Heaven burger - with Brie, Pear slices and berry jam (yeah, sounded weird to me, too, but was absolutely delicious!), and the BBBLT (yes, there is THAT much bacon on it!!). Mac and cheese is just OK and the sweet potato fries are great, but the spiced BBQ ketchup that comes with them is not for me. Place is LOADED with TVs and unless there is something special going on, they are very accommodating when it comes to making sure you get to see "your" game! A favorite in the neighborhood.
