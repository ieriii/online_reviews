FOOD: this rating is only based on the beijing duck dinner (we haven't tried anything else from this place, but seemed like your typical chinese restaurant otherwise). you pay $30 for this dinner that could easily serve 4 people, and their duck was delicious. they first bring the whole duck out on a cart and carve it in front of you for your first of the four course meal. we love getting good value for food, and this place is hard to beat for that. they also make homemade ice cream and sorbet which was a great end to such a yummy duck-full meal. SERVICE: really nice people that work here, and it seems like a family-run type place. in the middle of dinner we had misplaced a piece of jewelry and the busboy and waitress stopped everything they were doing and tried to help us find it, which let us know they care about their customers! (we did end up finding it). AMBIANCE: hmm.. well if you know chinese restaurants, it's the same deal. we're used to it so we understand that you're going to these kind of places purely for good, affordable meals.
