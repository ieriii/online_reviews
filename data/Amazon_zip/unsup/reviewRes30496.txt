Oh Chicago Diner, you're repped coast to coast as one of the top places to get animal-friendly with it, but I can't give you that last star because your food is so damn expensive. I'd be at the counter every day if I wouldn't have to take up a side job as an "companion" to that guy who keeps advertising on Craig's List. Anyway, you can't go wrong with a breakfast dish or a baked good at this place, and the bloody marys are to die for. It's a great place to take out-of-towners for brunch because they're guaranteed to never get a meal like this where they live. I haven't tried the lunch/dinner entrees, but they're on my list for next time and the time after that.
