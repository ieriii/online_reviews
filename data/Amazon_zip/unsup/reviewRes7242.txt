Ambiance - Love it, especially upstairs. It's a great place to have a small gathering. You can request to be seated on the couches, and it feels like your at home in your own living room. Food - THE BEST smoked chicken. I dream about it sometimes. I also adore the cornbread and the complimentary potato chips they serve with the meal.
