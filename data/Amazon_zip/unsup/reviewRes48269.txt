We had some reservations....we had to get to the Publican by 10:30. So a little lazy morning and back to the CTA blueline Old Irving stop by just after nine. Quickly hopped on and into the city we went! Hmmm. This time we have to get off a bit before downtown. Oooh. Coool views of the City from here but really nothing to see upclose. It's in an old warehouse district so no shopping really to do, just follow the directions to the Publican.  This is the place I have been really looking forward to. It's got a nice modern vibe...lost of young twenty somethings in jeans and too cool haircuts working here. The menu is full of funky yet not pretentious food choices. Oysters on the half shell coming from 6 different places. Wow! I love good fresh oysters. They came with some sort of vinegar but I just couldn't abuse these little guys with any sort of added flavor. But I did taste it and it was tasty as well. The crackers that came with the oysters were ok. But nothing really to be looking forward to. We also ordered the Chachouka for Ly. And I ordered the Pork Schnitzel with Waffles and we shared a side of bacon. Thick hunks of bacon. Not slices at all but thick cut with a fork pieces. The food was great and tasty. My pork Schnitzel was good...but of course I really don't have a comparison so all I can say is that they were enjoyable. The prices were hefty but I planned on that. Ly' wasn't as impressed...not because it wasn't GREAT but because we have had equal experiences in Reno, most recently at Campo. One thing I thought was cool about the place was the communal washing station for the restrooms. They have 5 individual doors marked 3 for women and 2 for men. Each door has a bathroom stall in it. You do your business and then come out to wash up in the middle. The place takes communal to the next level.
