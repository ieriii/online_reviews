We've only been here once and while the food was very good (and came out very fast!) we had a few issues with the service so I'm sticking with 3 stars.  The Gnocchi al Brevidi (basil sauce w/chicken & pine nuts) was delicious and the basil sauce had a bright summertime feel to it. Hubby had some sort of jumbo shrimp w/linguini dish & it had lots of chopped up chunks of shrimp in it as well - also very good. The fresh bread on the table was also very good, with a refreshing hint of lemon to it. Everyone was friendly but not as attentive as I would have liked. My wine glass was empty nearly ten minutes before the server asked if I'd like another glass. And whoever refilled the bottles of olive oil on the tables did not screw the cap on tightly (or someone wanted to play a practical joke on someone) and the lid came off splashing a great deal of olive oil all over hubby's shirt. Luckily it was a black shirt so in a dark restaurant it was not noticeable but try as we might to get the large stain out we could not so the shirt was tossed. Our server brought over another napkin for him but didn't even apologize. Not that it was directly our server's fault but an, "I'm so sorry!" would have been nice.
