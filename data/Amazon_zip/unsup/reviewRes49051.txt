So THIS is how you do brunch?! Arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday, maybe it was our lucky day but there was no wait for a party of three. We sat at the communal table; I think the "pens" are a novel idea, but I'm not sure I'd personally want to be trapped in one. Felt friendly but not on top of our neighbors, extra points for providing individual chairs instead of communal benches, too. The Publican does right by their Bloody Mary's. The original and the Moroccan carried some kick, both accompanied by an array of beer backs. Standouts included the thick slab bacon and the red wine poached eggs with prosciutto (they sounded odd, they looked pink, magically the combo worked...well!) The French ricotta, honey, with beer bread, dates and pistachios was just enough sweetness and added a nice fluffy touch, and we rounded it out with the kielbasa and an order of pork rinds, which I begrudgingly admit were pretty tasty. I left feeling satisfied but not stuffed and I didn't even have to wait 45 minutes for eggs! I feel like I have to say something to even out the praise, so let's say the coffee was a a tad weak.
