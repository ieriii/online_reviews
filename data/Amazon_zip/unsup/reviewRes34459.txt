I really, really want to love this place. But on weekends with the wait being over and hour and a half is a bit ridiculous. I'm not going to wait over an hour and a half for mediocre food. It was a good, traditional place. The decor was colorful and bright, with mostly blues and yellow. We sat at the counter, which was kind of crowded and there was little room. The food was nothing special and the service was nothing special. Leave this place to the tourists.
