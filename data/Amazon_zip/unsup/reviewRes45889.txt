Every single time I go to Chicago, no matter how much time I have (or don't have), I visit the Grand Lux Cafe. I've been to the location in Chicago as well as the one in Vegas, but my love for it started in Chicago when I stopped inside for a casual meal. When you go, order the mashed potato spring rolls. Yes. Don't ask anything about them, just order them. Request hot sauce. Also, make sure you order the Beet Salad with Pistacios and Goat Cheese. I always order two of those because I can happily destroy an entire plate of it on my own with BF sadly staring at me with puppy dog eyes that I so cruelly ignore...all for SALAD which I hardly ever bother ordering in a restaurant. There are sandwiches, salads, burgers, pasta dishes, and desserts for EVERYBODY - no one misses out here. The menu spreads far and wide with all sorts of influences and the portions are huge. Brunch there and come with an appetite. The service is warm, the views are great (sit near the windows so you can people-watch over the Magnificent Mile), and the prices are reasonable. Order dessert in advance and relish it slowly. You won't get rushed here no matter how busy it gets so it's okay if you order one last Mimosa before you go...no judgment. Never have I had a bad experience there, and I am very pleased because I have been there countless times.
