Since my last review I was contacted by Fogo 2 Go and given a sincere apology for the time it took to prepare my last pizza. I was also told that they changed their delivery company. Since these were my only two major complaints I would now recommend ordering from here. My fiancee gets pizza from here on a somewhat regular basis and it is rather good.
