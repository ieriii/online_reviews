I am a self proclaimed foodie and I have lived in Chicago my entire 31 years of existence. Shame on me for this being my first time going to Hot Doug's!!  The Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage was a culinary masterpeice on a bun. The flavors exploded in my mouth like a symphony. I have been in a euphoric food state since I left the restaurant. I will definitly be back to try some of the other specialty sausage and the duck fat fries.
