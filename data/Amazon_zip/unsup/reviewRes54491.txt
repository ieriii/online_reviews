As a vegan i have heard tons about this place, finally got go there. Been veg 5 years, decided to get the 'meatiest' thing on the menu - the BBQ Bacon Burger and some sweet potato fries of course. All i can say is WOW. it was some amazing food, don't think i've scarfed down food that fast before. Definitely left me craving to go back, shame they don't expand! I would be there every day. As for the hype - of course! it's delicious and cruelty free! I went on a Sunday - there were lines but the wait was less then 10 minutes. Seating is packed but i didn't mind it - it actually causes convos to spark between tables so you might make some friends. Food was served super fast, waiters were very friendly and extremely informative on their menu items. Daiya cheese! they have it. What more can i say. Thinking about buying their cook book so i can steal some of their great recipes! Other than wanting them to expand - carry outs would be amazing as well! I would definitely make the trip from work just to get a carry out lunch.
