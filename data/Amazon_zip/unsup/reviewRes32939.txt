I came here during my first visit to Chicago during Taste of Chicago. The decor was super cute. My friend and I came kind of knowing what we want. The menu is jam packed with interesting sounding deliciousness. Indecisive and greed had us deciding on ordering a personal entree each and sharing one. No regrets here! I ordered the Tuscan Frittata. SO yummy. It was my first time trying a frittata and I def will order more. It was well seasoned, had chicken, potatoes, sundried tomatoes and fresh basil. On the menu it says goat cheese. I thought the cheese would be IN the frittata, not smeared on top. Not good for presentation and I had a ehhh face BUT the taste DEF made up for it. My friend order the Chocolate Strawberry Pancakes. Looked amazing. Tasted just as amazing. I'm not big on sweet stuff and it was drizzled in chocolate syrup, but it was good. My friend loved it. Now the best part of the meal. We shared the (stuffed) Red Velvet French Toast. OMG. That's all I'll say. So good. LOVED IT. All in all, the food was great. Service was great. Price was great. I wish there was one in NYC. Until then I look forward to my next trip to the Chi!
