Every review here so far is RIGHT on the money. Do ask the server for the daily special. Hopefully its a steak w/ranchero sauce.  My favorite is the Green Pork Stew - the serve this sometimes as the soup of the day - but you can also order it as a dinner... Be sure to get the FLOUR TORTILLAS. They're home made. Yum. I've had bistec mexicana. Sooooo YUM! Tender, delicious. Yummy beans and the rice is fabulous! Bistec Mexicana, Chicken Burrito, Mole de pollo, Guac Chips and salas - chips made in house were hot in the bag - get the salsa verde and some rojas while you're dining. ...Been here several times since I wrote this review and I would be up to 10 stars if i could. During lunch you'll wait to be seated unless you're there at 1130 or after 1pm. Try to sit by the front door because abuelita is like the worlds best waitress and ...always ask her whats best from the kitchen "today" ...you'll be super happy you did!
