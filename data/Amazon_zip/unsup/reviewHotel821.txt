After a horrible night at the Drake (reviewed), this place was a surprisingly pleasant treat. Unpretentious and with a great central loop location, the hotel was perfect for my needs. INCREDIBLY friendly staff, HUGE bathroom, free vouchers for drinks and breakfast, low price. Not the most updated hotel (tvs are not flat screen, wood of armoire and bed headboards look a little dated, building is sort of narrow and old) but it's not that much better at any of the other fancy shmancy hotels I've been to. We stayed on third floor and I could hear the L go by, but it wasn't loud enough that it kept me awake or woke me up. I was bummed to see the free check-in upgrade offer, but our room was perfectly fine. Definitely recommend, definitely would come here again.
