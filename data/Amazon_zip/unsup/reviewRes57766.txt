We ducked into the Coast from the cold the other day with four adults and three small kids and took over the large booth in the corner upstairs. We were trying to keep the little ones under control but they were jacked up and having a blast running around and climbing. The staff was extremely friendly and unflappable amidst all of the chaos we were creating. And the food was great! The grilled calamari salad was especially fresh and delicious. The kids actually sat still once they were eating. We thanked the waiter for being so tolerant of our group and even the owner came over to say she loves it when families come in. We will definitely be coming back!!
