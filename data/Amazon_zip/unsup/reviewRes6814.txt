I'm usually not a big fan of Italian food; however, the food here was amazing: fresh and light. We had several dishes: calamari, lobster, lobster ravioli, mixed seafood dish (with pasta), veal dish, sea bass, pumpkin/squash pasta, bread with olive oil and cheese. Everything exceeded our expectations, and the ambiance was equally as great! Truly a great Italian spot! I will certainly be back!
