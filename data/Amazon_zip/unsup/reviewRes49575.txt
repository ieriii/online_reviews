There's no doubt about it - Bin 36's wine and cheese flights are supreme. There is something for everyone, newbies and connoisseur alike. The atmosphere is very trendy but fun for all occasions including a girls night out or romantic date. Unfortunately, the scornful service trumped any of my likes about this city hotshot. To make a long story short, double and triple check your reservation. Our group had a reservation for 8 but our table was set for 7. We decided to, in the manager's words, solve the problem ourselves and pull a chair up - a quick fix to a very minimal problem. The manager approached our table immediately afterward reminding us that our reservation was in the system for 7 and they weren't sure how they dropped the ball on their end. While she did apologize, she was deliberately being facetious and offended everyone at our table by her tone. After scolding us, she walked over to our server and talked smack about our group. Really wanted to enjoy Bin 36 but the condescending staff may have hindered my chances of returning in the future.
