Great Chicago style Super Dawgs.Service is punctual, but friendliness by staff is limited.Note to travelers or first timers: Know what you're going to order before you talk to a server, do not call them hot dogs as they will not serve you then. Ask for super dawgs. AND if you must have ketchup, which is taboo in Chicago on hot dogs, ask for it on the side for your fries.
