Holy Toledo is this place great. Just went for dinner with friends last night after a movie and was here once before in the summer with girlfriends - different seasons, different offerings, different experiences, both awesome. If you come in summer you must sit upstairs on the deck, so charming and relaxed. Last night was cozy and warm. This place is perfect if you like to try a lot of different stuff and are understand that Italian is more than just red sauce and that anchovies don't always come in a tin. Stand out dish of last night's meal was the salami and kale pizza. Highly recommended.
