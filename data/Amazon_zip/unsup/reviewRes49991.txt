Mega Saturday Night Fail. I should have known I'd hate it here. What exactly was I thinking when based on my previous experiences at Do Division Fest I've always noticed this odd anomaly of Wicker Park where multitudes of guidos, guidettes and folks that look like they've been bussed in on the Bedazzled Shirt Express notoriously park themselves to commence spiky hair contests and copious O-Bomb slugging? Well, I was thinking I was showing up to support a friend whose post-engagement celebratory evening was happening here and really, how bad could it be? Hmmm. Actually, pretty bad..... * The place is strangely laid out with 3 levels of extremely narrow space making it almost impossible not to get groped up, harassed or just generally harangued when all you want to do is hit up the potty located on the bottom floor. * Main floor bar had only one bartender on a busy Saturday night who was not only rude and inept but unprofessional toward my group to boot. * They serve their cocktails in plastic cups. I'm a big girl, I can handle my whiskey in a glass, thankyaverymuch. This speaks volumes, however, to their clientele and subsequent requirement of glasses that bend. * No chilling of Patron shots, and when requested, we were flat out told "No." * Apathetic service from other Fifty/50 staffers and a generally inhospitable attitude toward our large group. So, yeah, clearly me no likey. But let's be honest, preconceived notion aside, it totally fit the expected bill. Douchetastic. I hear the food is totally above par, but saw none of it late night on Saturday and will continue to never see it as my chances of returning back here aren't Fifty/50, they're Slim/None.
