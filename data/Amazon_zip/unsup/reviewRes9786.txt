i was immediately swooned over the french-colonial decor.. i felt like i was transported to the 1920s. my friend raved about the pho appetizer.. and how it was the best pho hes ever tasted. sadly, they ran out when i visited. i remember trying the bo bitet tom nuong (grilled filet mignon and sauteed shrimp) the bo sate (sauteed filet mignon with string beans) with tomato rice.. and i remember they were good. the best part.. they had a raspberry puree cocktail.. my favorite kind of drink! its a shame the san francisco one doesnt compare.
