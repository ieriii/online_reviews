I was looking for a good Indian restaurant and my friend recommended this place (and she doesn't even like Indian food!). It was top notch. I was so surprised at how large the restaurant was too! I made a reservation on the same day. The menu was sooooo robust it was nice to have options. I love vindaloo and all things spice but I'm not eating meat right now, but to my surprise they offered shrimp vindaloo and I was ecstatic. The food was really tasty, the servers were attentive and the portions were large enough to have a full size meal the next day. Also they were heavy handed with my glass of wine... it was like a 2for1!! I can't complain. I'd go back again for sure.
