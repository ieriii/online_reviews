Lots of choices for breakfast. Fast friendly service. Reasonable prices. Open early. I've eaten the biscuits & gravy, potato pancakes, butcher shop omelet. All very tasty! Love the fresh-squeezed strawberry orange juice. A nice alternative th 11 City Diner where the owner is so off-putting & Bongo Room where everything tastes like a dessert.
