We have been wanting to try this place for a while now. We had the table chips & salsa YUM! & the 5 piece empanadas, our favorite was the spinach & cheese the rest were ok. My husband had the dinner w/ steak, onions & a refreshing cabbage salad, upgraded to the rice & beans w/ a fried egg on top & sweet platanos. I had something similar but w/out the egg. My meat tasted old but my husbands was very good. I was disappointed. The paid upgrade of the rice & beans was not worth it, it was bland. 3 stars for the service, chips & empanadas & I'd go back just for those as appetizers & to try their oatmeal milkshake.
