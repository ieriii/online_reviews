Love the pizza but hate the atmosphere. I know I too am a tourist, but I usually eat off the beaten path. When I was in there, I was surrounded by a ton of people who 'made an adventure of' traveling off of Michigan Avenue. They'll never know the true gems that lie in Chicago, but that's probably for the better. If you're anything like me, place a takeout order and eat somewhere else. As for the pizza, it's phenomenal. I've had most of the big names in Chicago pizza, but when it comes to deep dish, Gino's is second to none. A large suasage deep dish filled up 3 very hungry men.
