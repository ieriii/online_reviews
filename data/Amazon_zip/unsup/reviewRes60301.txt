Going here with a love one is a must! The weekend huevos rellenos are to die for. The side of sauce goes perfectly with the beans, tometoes, cheese, and of course the eggs! This place is great and inexpensive. I would also suggest buying a bag of their signature granola -- It's the best I have ever had.
