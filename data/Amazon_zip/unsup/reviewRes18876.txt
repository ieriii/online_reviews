First and Foremost, It's pretty impressive how this place defies everything I was ever taught about supply and demand. High Demand for anything with the Bayless tag attached to it is inevitable in Chicago... well, anywhere really. Yet, they're still able to supply high quality food at more than reasonable prices and at a *relatively* lighting speed. Be grateful if you arrive and don't see a line forming out the door and down the block, but please, remember to be graceful if you do. With the high quantities of food and people they serve here, they *could* run it like the soup Nazi and pay no mind to you as a human being, but they don't. They've got a sort of "maitre d" in place to make things run smoothly and greet everyone with open arms (even if the place is too packed to even open your arms) while they wait. This person will explain the ordering process, let you know when it's your turn, and find you somewhere to sit so you don't have to feel awkward holding your food with no where to eat it. The space is small, almost cramped, but you're so happy to be there and be able to dine (and dine well) at a fraction of the Topolobampo and Frontera prices that none of that will matter. And once you're sitting and your food is in front of you, you'll forget that there ever was a wait. In fact, you'll forget about all your worries once you take your first bite. The Seafood soup was fantastic and certainly not lacking in the seafood and the mushroom torta was a great pick as well, though I'm normally not a super fan of bread that feels crusty. My BF enjoyed his meaty meal and I took a sammy home for my Bayless loving Daddio, as well. I believe all parties enjoyed their share and the BF and I would gladly wait in line again. Quick Tip- Don't overlook the Hot Chocolate and Mexican Chocolate Hazelnut Cookie... Abuela would want you to get it.
