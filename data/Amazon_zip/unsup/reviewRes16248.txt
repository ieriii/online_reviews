I've eaten at Calo in the past, and I have always been more than satisfied with the food and service. Tonight was a very different experience. The drinks and appetizers were fine. In fact, I would say they were quite good. I ordered the Seafood linguini in creme sauce for my main course. When it arrived, none of the seafood was prepared correctly, and it all tasted "fishy" in the way you never want to experience seafood. The creme sauce was in no way a creme sauce. It was just a broth with more of the foul tasting fishiness. I had two bites of my entree and decided it that was more than enough. My waitress, who was overall very good, asked me if there was anything wrong with my food. To be fair, she did offer to bring a different item, but I politely declined telling her the entree had left me with no appetite. I was surprised when the check arrived to see I had been charged for an entree I sent back to the kitchen. I was there in a group of four, and our check was over $150. I didn't make a fuss or complain, but at a restaurant of this stature, it should be policy not to charge a patron for a meal that can't be consumed. For the price of the entrees there are several restaurants in the neighborhood that provide better food as well as better service. It would be difficult to convince me to return.
