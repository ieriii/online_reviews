Great food, great value, fun...I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant and have been going for years. It's a birthday spot, an after work spot or just go to have fun spot. Our favorite spot in Greektown. AND they have FREE valet. Every dish is delicious and cooked perfectly, the staff is always friendly and personable - I always feel like I am a GUEST there. A+!
