At some point in my very late Saturday night, I declared that this was the happiest place on earth after Disneyland. Considering that I had been crying the entire evening, that is certainly saying something. L&E made me all better.... Excellent food, excellent staff, and I distinctly remember telling my friend in my drunken randomness that I loved the bathroom because it was going for a dingy, old, pub bathroom look but it was actually super clean and had designer soap. This seemed really important at the time, I don't know why. But really, you've got to go. The kitchen is open until really late (the real reason we went) and just churns out deliciousness like no one's business. Beef fat fries, I could've eaten that alone. Fortunately I didn't. My friends, there were cheese filled donuts, a flat iron steak that tasted good even when it got cold, a wild boar sloppy joe that my friend tried to finish even when capacity was reached.... oh sigh. Only downer was some of our first choices had run out, but considering we were eating dinner at 11.30 on Saturday night, I guess that was to be expected. The drinks are excellent, and our waiter Jared really knew what he was talking about. We got wonderful surprises when we reached the drunken point of "just bring us what you like, or what you think we'd like," and their predictions were right on point, given our soberly-made previous orders. The pinnacle was the bartender Derek making me an espresso-based cocktail, a nod to my love of coffee, and named it a Crying Melissa, a nod to me having been crying all night. There are no words as to how good that made me feel, in self-esteem, in spirit, and in inebriation. I will probably come back sixty more times. It's much closer than Disneyland is.
