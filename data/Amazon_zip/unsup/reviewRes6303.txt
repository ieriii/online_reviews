Honestly, I cannot tell you what all of the the hype is about. It's typically very loud and very crowded. The only thing kind of worth it is the parmesan crusted filet, which isn't cheap. Service is painfully slow. I would much rather walk a few blocks and visit Keefer's or Fogo de Chao...even Portillo's for that matter. Don't waste your time. Nothing special about this place. Hate to break it to you.
