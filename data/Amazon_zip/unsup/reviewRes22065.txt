Oh man. I am so sad to lower my stars to three, but it had to be done. I know they were busy, but it took 20 minutes for anyone to come to our table. After we ordered, our app and three entrees came all together almost an hour later. What is the point of an app if it comes with the meal? We were so hungry and shuffling plates around our table to make it all fit. The worst part is that I suggested this place to two friends who have never been there before. Everyone was a little disappointed and it made us late for our evening plans.
