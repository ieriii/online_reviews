Gilt bar wins the award for best bite of food I've had in the past year. And once again, if you follow me on Pinterest (all 26 of you), you'll see I eat pretty well. Maybe I should add a better work out regimen to go with all that eating well. Getting back...the $2 Pabst also threw me by surprise as well. Sure its Pabst, which in my opinion is a distant cousin of ass, but for two bucks??? I'll drink it. Couldn't pass it up. I also was only able to drink one, before having to order something better.  So the food. Um....the greatest period. Exclamation on the period. Bone marrow on toast with purlple onion marmalade (something everyone should eat before they die), and the gnocchi....I can't even put in to words how great that dish was. How unbelievable this bar was. We have a similar spot in Scottsdale called culinary drop out, that does a good job of mimicking this place, but trust me when I say, Gilt is the real deal hands down. I owe it to my self to eat here again. #Money very well spent
