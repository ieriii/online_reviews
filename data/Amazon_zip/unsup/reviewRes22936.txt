The clock just recently struck 11:30pm. It's officially been two hours since I left Irazu. Yet my stomach is still just as painfully full and bloated as when I initially walked out the door...and I couldn't be happier. I've spent months scouring yelp reviews in search of the city's best burrito. Mexican restaurant after Mexican restaurant left me disappointed. The only thing I have to show for those failed trips is a little more lovin to these love handles and a few extra hours in the bathroom. Little did I know that I wasn't even looking at the right part of the globe. Forget Mexico -- Costa Rica is the place for burritos. Without question, the Irazu Vegetarian Burrito is a 5-star burrito. Wrapped in a lightly grilled, thick tortilla, the standard vegetarian burrito comes packed with delicious yellow rice (not found in the regular burritos), black beans (clearly the bomb-diggity of all burrito beans), and veggies galore (I recommend throwing in some zucchini for $1 extra). Finally, I topped off this bowling ball-sized monsterrito with a little chicken. After all, who wouldn't want a Vegetarian Burrito w/ Chicken (oxymorons be damned)?  I'd love to give Irazu itself a 5-star review, but the apps and overly-hyped shake weren't quite as perfect as the almighty burrito. Nonetheless, thank you, Irazu. My burrito journey is finally over. I can die happy. Which just might happen tonight if my stomach doesn't eventually decompress.
