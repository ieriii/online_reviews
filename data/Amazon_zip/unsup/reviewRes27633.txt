Food is delicious. I took my m-i-l here for her birthday. We each got 1 cocktail, 1 appetizer, 1 entree and coffee (no dessert, no wine) and the total came out to about $170.00 with tip. Just be aware that you are making an investment when you come.  My brother and sister-in-law accompanied us to dinner and they are vegan. When I called ahead for reservations, the hostess was very sweet and said that they can totally accommodate our vegan guests. The chef made a vegan-version of one of the appetizers, a completely off-menu vegan entree and a vegan dessert for them. The vegan alternatives were thoughtful and had some effort put into them, and I thought it was really nice that they would be so accommodating. Though the restaurant did remember that we had two vegans, they completely ignored my m-i-l's birthday. The hostess had specifically asked if there were any special events associated with our dinner when I called to make our reservations, and our reservation card had the birthday/vegan information on it. Though the waiter addressed our vegan needs right away, there was absolutely no mention of my m-i-l's birthday at all. For a restaurant that is so interested in providing a fun, welcoming atmosphere and so willing to accommodate their guests, I was really surprised about this oversight. I have to say that it was disappointing enough to cost a star in this review.
