This review is for the lobby bar area of the hotel. LOVE IT! My buddy and I finished up dinner at Schula's and then finished our wine here since Shula's was closing. We sat and caught up in comfy seats and played electronic chess! Did I say, or write, "LOVE IT!"? I wish it was open later. Minus one star
