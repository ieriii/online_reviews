I thought this place was very good. I liked the minimalist chic atmosphere, and all of the rolls we had were very good. My only complaint is that its a bit crowded and the price points are slightly higher than other neighborhood spots with comparable food, but you're undoubtedly paying for the trendy atmosphere as compared to, for instance, New Tokyo.
