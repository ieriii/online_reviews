My boo thang loves Ruth's Chris so going to this steak house for his birthday was a no brainer. We arrived and the hostess seemed slightly distracted and proceeded to take phone calls for reservations. It was slightly off-putting that she didn't at least acknowledge the guests waiting to be seated. The manager happened to arrive soon after and she began to seat guests. We started out with the calamari appetizer and it was very good. The calamari was accompanied by a sweet tai chili-like sauce, perfect compliment to the calamari. Then for dinner we ordered crab cakes, sweet potato casserole, and a 8oz filet with a lobster tail. My crab cakes were good and I put some of that extra tai chili-like sauce on them to make them even tastier. One major disappointment for the bday boy, who absolutely loves this place, was that he ordered his steak medium and it came out medium well. The plates are so hot the meat continues to cook so it immediately got dry. When this was mentioned to our waitress she promptly took the filet away and placed a order for a new one. The manager also came by and apologized then promptly brought the new filet when it was ready. The new filet was medium rare so it still wasn't really the way he preferred it so it was somewhat of a let down. Outside of the hostess's lackluster presence the service was excellent and they were eager to accommodate us even though the chef in the kitchen was probably thinking he doesn't know how he wants his steak so just make it a lot rarer. For this visit only 3 stars for the lackluster filet which is usually on par.
