I really like the Gage, it's probably one of my favourite semi-casual restaurants in the Loop. It's quite smart, but in a sort of laid back way. I've always had an excellent meal here. I especially like the Vindaloo mussels, which is an interesting twist on one of my favourite foods. Don't come here expecting any classic favourites that will taste the way you expect, everything is different, but in a good way. The only complaints I would have is that it does get quite noisy and the portions are absolutely massive, although I suppose some don't really consider that a complaint.
