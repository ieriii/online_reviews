Food was fine--nothing particularly wowed me. The vegetable empanada was quite good. The ceviches were decent, but definitely not what I was expecting given my experience in Mexican and Peruvian ceviche. Had a sampler of ceviches: Mixto was not particularly good; Hiramasa was good flavor, but too salty; Tuna was quite tasty. Tacos de pescado had an interesting slaw in the taco that mixed it up. Arepas were rather tasty. Guacamole was nothing special. Dessert ice cream cake is massive. Beautiful interior. Food just did not blow me away.
