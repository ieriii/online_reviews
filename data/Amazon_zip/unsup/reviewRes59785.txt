Sadly I was not impressed. I had a single 14 inch pizza delivered to my apartment on a Saturday night. When I placed my order I was told it would take 45 minutes to arrive. I thought that was a bit ambitious, so I waited 90 minutes before calling to check the status of my order. I was told, rather rudely, that my pizza was still in route and would arrive "soon." Soon turned out to be two hours after I placed my order and COLD. Honestly, if I wanted to heat up a pizza in the oven I would have simply bought one at the grocery store. Decent pizza, but not worth the trouble.
