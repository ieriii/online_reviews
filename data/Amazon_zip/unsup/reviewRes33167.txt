My father-in-law is Turkish and calls himself the Sultan, so when I saw this place I had to check it out.  First off--- it was not clean. Done.  People expect to eat in a restaurant, not feel like they are sitting in a cab. The decor and the bathrooms...let's not go there.  Momma said if you can't say anything nice, just leave a 'one star' review.
