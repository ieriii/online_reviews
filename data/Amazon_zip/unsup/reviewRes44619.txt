The red velvet cupcake I had here was definitely the best of all the cupcakes I've tried since moving to Chicago...but I'm still waiting to be WOWed. I'm picky when it comes to cupcakes. This one was the right texture, but not especially flavorful, though the cream cheese frosting was great (finally someone gets it right). There was a selection of several cupcake flavors, but none of them were labeled, so who knows what was lurking there under all the decorative Halloween frosting. I liked the look of the shop, the service was in a hurry but mostly friendly, and I also tried a spinach and feta croissant since I thought I should eat something of substance before ODing on sugar. It didn't really resemble a croissant in any way but it tasted good. Gotta love the vintage neon sign. I'll be back to investigate these baked goods in more detail.
