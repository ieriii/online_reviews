Can I tell you what I love? Shaw's Steamed Alaskan Red King Crab Legs, that's what. They've been setting the bar for me on succulent legs for years - think at least a decade if not more - and I've yet to find another establishment near or far that can touch the consistently impeccable quality and flavor of this ample signature dish. If you enjoy huge, sweet, glorious crab, then look no further, this is hands down the best. Incomparable in every way, I swear it to the Red King Gods! They may send you back a pretty penny or two - $65 for the full order - but are worth every last butter-laden cent. Of course, Shaw's has much more than just Crab Legs, and ya know what? All of it is pretty damn phenomenal too. From the ever-changing daily Fresh Catch, to the beautifully briny Oysters and, one of my all time favorites, the uberbountiful Grand Cold Shellfish Platter with a serious selection of Whole Maine Lobster, Oysters, Crab Fingers, Cocktail Shrimp and Alaskan Red King Crab Bites - it's a deluge of seafood delight for sharing but experienced even better as a gluttonous individual intake. Service is always top notch with a hint of that fantastic 'throwback friendly' vibe, much like the Shaw's surrounds themselves. A little bit retro, a little bit supper club glamorous, a whole lot delicious. Five stars for the ultimate in unwavering crabby consistency. You can't go wrong here.
