I placed an order for delivery and after an ETA of 40 minutes, I received my food in a record 20. I tried the avocado rolls and the asparagus rolls. The avocado rolls were incredibly creamy and delicious. The asparagus rolls did not deviate from the ordinary. (It's difficult for asparagus rolls to reach a level of outstanding-ness). While a vegetarian may not be the best judge of a sushi joint, I must say I am incredibly impressed. My favorite part of the meal was the vegetable gyoza. It was extraordinary! The dipping sauce was a bit spicy but the best I have ever had. Not to mention, the delivery guy was very handsome. Icing on the cake!
