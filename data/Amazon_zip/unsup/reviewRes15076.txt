I get here about twice a year, usually for lunch. I do have to say that the lunch menu is a bargain, great bread, salad and chicken parm for $9-$10, can't beat it. (I usually go the the basil chicken though). The dinner menu however is expensive. There are better places for the price in lincoln park or Bucktown.  The atmosphere? Dim. Although there is no smoke, it seems as if there is a haze of it across the diningroom and just seems to be a lacking any sort of light. It definately needs some updating. Does anybody else notice that the pasta and sauce reminds you of something you ate as a kid, probably from a can? Its not necessarily bad, just doesn't seem too gormet for and Italian restaurant.
