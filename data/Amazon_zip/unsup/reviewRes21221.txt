I had been here once before but it was after the Drawing Room elite soiree and lets just say I was not in a condition to be critical of anything, I am pretty sure i just inhaled everything i ordered and stumbled out the door, in light of that here goes round two..... I finally made it to XOCO in time for breakfast, and I do have to say as a painfully non-morning person, this is definitely worth getting up and at-em for. A friend and a sampled an array of Rick Bayless breakfast creations, savory bread pudding (not really bread pudding but yum!), breakfast empanada, open faced torta (spicy!), and my personal favorite the egg and chorizo torta with avocado. This is by far the best chorizo I have ever had the delight of consuming, though at $7 I am not sure I could make this a regular breakfast choice...which brings me to a possibility they need to explore...BRUNCH, really you stop serving breakfast at 10AM? I think they should offer some overlap at least on the weekends because I could definitely eat all of these things at any time of the day or night. The most delightful surprise of this experience was the churro, this is not your typical carnival churro, but rather a fresh, complex, and delicious fried twist of dough. Frankly I think the drinking chocolates are a bit much, and though they recommend dipping the churro I preferred to let it stand alone. All in all a delightful morning jaunt, topped off with the always delicious addition of Intelligentsia coffee, my favorite!
