My #1sinful craving a deepdish pizza from Gino's East. I know that this will be one the reasons I will die, but I cant get enough of it. I havent had a fresh pizza from here in over a decade, but I get a frozen Sausage Patty Pizza from here time to time, I bake em' up and the smell and taste take me back. Gino's East, Pizzeria Uno, and Giordanno's, which is the best? Who cares just send me a deep dish with some quality sausage and maybe some pepperoni.
