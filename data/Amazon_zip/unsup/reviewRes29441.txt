As far as vegan/vegetarian restaurants, Chicago Diner is the best it can get! I reluctantly visited CD for lunch with my now vegan sister. She tried convinced me the on our car ride to the restaurant that this place was really, really good, and that I would like it. And, she was right! Although I didn't have the most adventurous thing on the menu, CD has perfected the black bean burger! The "burger" was really flavorful, absolutely handmade (not some frozen patty) and the creole mustard was pretty darn tasty. The burger came with a side of sweet potato fries- yum! I cleaned my entire plate. My sis went with one of the specials, Tostados w/ faux chorizo, lettuce, tomato, etc. and even vegan nacho cheese sauce! I was a little skeptical of the cheese sauce, but I had a taste, and it tasted like the real thing. CD even has a pretty extensive dessert menu from vegan shakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies, etc. We went with the Peanut Butter Puck. A peanut butter cookie, filled with chocolate and peanut butter. It was sooo good, I couldn't believe it was vegan! Service was a little spotty, but no big deal. My sis was right, CD is really, really good! I'll be back to try other items on the menu.
