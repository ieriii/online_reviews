OVERRATED greasy and oily food So I checked this place out with much excitement after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp and seeing the popularity of the chef. I even read the menu extensively before heading to the restaurant to fully decide what I wanted. My group and I ordered the Two Cups Chicken, Sole Fish Fillet with Tofu, Mongolian Beef, Soup with clams and tofu, and Fried Three Seafood Combo.  As many previous yelpers proclaim, service is SLOW but they are nice and friendly. My waitress was especially nice.  The Two Cups Chicken is overrated. It is too salty and saucy. The cuts of chicken are nice and tender though. As a Vietnamese person used to Thit Kho (which is a little similar to this dish), my expectations were high. The Sole Fish Fillet with Tofu took FOREVER to come out. I had the impression it would be a whole fish fillet, but it was actually small diced up pieces of fish doused with chilli oil and soft tofu... It was completely drenched to the point where it looked like soup. Ugh The Mongolian beef wasn't bad, especially for an Americanized Chinese entree. The soup with clams and tofu was one of the better dishes due to the freshness of the clams. The Fried Seafood combo of squid, shrimp, and scallops was DELICIOUS! Overall, this place left me feeling like I digested too much salt, MSG, and oil. Spice level was great- I admit but this place is overrated!
