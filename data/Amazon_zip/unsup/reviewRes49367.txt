Yesterday I had lunch at Bin 36. Located on Dearborn Street in the House of Blues Hotel, the restaurant is themed around wine, and food and wine pairings. The front of the restaurant is a retail shop where you can purchase wines from their list. Each menu item has a suggested wine, listed by its bin number. This in itself is welcome and takes away a lot of the guesswork when trying to decide what, exactly, would go with garlic and tomato hummus or braised Burgundian escargot. (For some reason they don't have wine recommendations on the breakfast menu.) I had the Pekin Duck Confit Salad and practically licked my plate and was sorely tempted to pick up the bone. I restrained myself and had to be content with scooping up every last bit of marcona almonds, which are shaped like little Christmas ornaments (very appropriate), dates, pickled onions, and duck confit. They used just the right amount of orange vinaigrette instead of drenching the salad. Their wine suggestions were a Gewurztraminer from Pfalz, Germany, and a Zinfandel from Lodi, California. I chose the zin for two reasons: it may be 60 degrees outside, but I still balk at ordering a lighter white at this time of year, and I just love zins. I didn't even read the name of the wine or the description until later, prefering to just go with their choice, but if I'd had any doubts those would have cinched the deal. The wine was "Earth, Zin and Fire" and the notes say it's a "party in a glass." I didn't start dancing on the table or searching for lampshades, but it was jammy and chocolatey and was a smooth accompaniment to the sweetness of the salad. I was full and happy and all seemed right with the world. Then it got even better: as you leave Bin 36, there's a table with coffee and to go cups, cookies, and bottled water. Take one, take three. They do this every day. Good food, good wine, and free stuff. I think I like this place.
