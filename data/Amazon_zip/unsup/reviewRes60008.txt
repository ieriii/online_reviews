I had brunch here last weekend with my boyfriend and a visiting friend. The BF and I split the Eggs New Orleans and some special involving spaetzel and chorizo. The egg dish was quite good - poached eggs, crabmeat, popovers, bernaise sauce, what could be bad? The special . . . wasn't. Overall, the meal was pretty tasty but it didn't blow us away. I did enjoy the free beignets a lot. They reminded my boyfriend of the ones he had at Cafe du Monde in NOLA. I think we'll come back for dinner sometime. I also liked the decor and was really happy that they found my credit card after I blanked out and left it on the table after paying.
