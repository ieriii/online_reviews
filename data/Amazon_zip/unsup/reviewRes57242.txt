This is going to be a quick review. My girlfriend knew I loved Poutine (being from Canada and all) so she searched all over the city for someone that offered true Canadian Poutine and this is where we landed. Great, friendly service and fairly true poutine - for an American restaurant. The fries are thick and the gravy was a bit light for my liking, but they had true cheese curds and overall not bad poutine.
