Delicious and fairly cheap. Great little Mexican restaurant that I've lived down the street from for months now but never visited until my friends came into town a couple of weekends ago. They were born and raised in the heart of Southern California, spoon fed Mexican food from childhood and now go to school on the East Coast, which is severely lacking in good Mexican food. Needless to say they were thrilled to find out I lived in Pilsen and so instead of chowing down on Thanksgiving leftovers we ate our way down 18th street and came across this place. The service may not have been stellar, but our waitress was sweet and I wasn't really expecting five star quality servers. This is after all a(n albeit highly colorful) hole in the wall type place. The food was exactly what we were looking for and while I'm sure there are plenty of Mexican mothers out there who could challenge any of those cooks to a cook-off, it was damn good. And cheap. I don't think I've ever ordered chicken ANYTHING for so little money and gotten so much in return. I got the chicken mole, which came with more chicken than I thought possible to fit on the plate. The only complaint was that I kept losing bits of chicken in the ocean of sauce. Not a problem though, next time I come I'll just ask for a small pond instead. My friends ordered nachos (which come individually, making them five times less messy and perfect for a date night), enchiladas and a burrito. All of it was apparently very good. And the atmosphere of the place is wonderful too. It's colorful, yet with a neat dim orange glow that made the night seem just a bit more special. We didn't bring any drinks but it's BYOB so definitely going to next time. All in all, if you're in the neighborhood or even just craving some good Mexican food in a pleasant atmosphere, you should go to Nuevo Leon.
