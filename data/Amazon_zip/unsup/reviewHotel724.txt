This is a very nice hotel on the Mag Mile. The nearby shopping and dining is great, and the hotel staff is very attentive. I found it interesting that place actively uses their green program. For every night I went without having my room cleaned I got either $5 off food or 500 hotel points. If you are a frequent traveler like me the points are worth it. They can be used at Sheraton hotels as well. I've stayed at the Palmer Hilton nearby, and that's a much nicer hotel for not much more. This Westin is nice, and it gets the job done. Caution, the restaurant bar has overpriced food, but it's good food.
