I'm a VERY picky fan of Chicken Pad Thai and this place is now neck and neck with Duck Walk on Fullerton for my favorite pad thai in the city!! :)  Love it! It's just the flavor I'm looking for when it comes to Chicken Pad Thai. It has the thinner noodles, but it is still full of a subtle yet delicious flavor that I love and not brown or orangey looking like the kind of pad thai I loathe. Chicken itself was good quality too. We also had the Crab Rangoons, yum, and the cold Peanut Spring Rolls which were also pretty good. Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is very busy and crowded so probably best for a dinner with friends or just a casual date where you don't want quiet. The place is broken up into 3 different rooms to eat in but just know that it is tiny-ish, and the decor is cute too! Just a nice warm place.
