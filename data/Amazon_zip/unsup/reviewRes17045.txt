I'm always surprised when I find out I haven't written a review for a place I go quite often. India House is one of them, so let's get right to it: "Soft & silky"; is what I get almost every visit & it is divine! It's actually the Chicken Reshmi kabob (tandoori) and I love it! (Good thing I remembered the name b/c if they ever took "smooth & silky" off the description, I probably wouldn't know what I was ordering...) The chicken is SO moist and the veggies (when they actually serve them) are steamed/sauteed on the hot iron plate on which it comes out. Lemony & yogurty. YUM. I try to stay far, far away from the dishes with sauce b/c I just don't know what kind of calories I'm getting with them and they are usualy SO good, I can't stop eating what would be enough for about three adult men... so I stick to the tandoori & kebobs b/c I can control how much I eat and the meats & veggies are typically spiced, not sauced. Also love the Lachcha Paratha with those layers of whole wheat unleven goodness... yum! And a standard garlic naan, which are always crispy yet chewy and not too heavily buttered or oiled. I bought a Groupon for India House only to be disappointed that I didn't buy more than one.
