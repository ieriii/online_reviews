Maybe the review I am writing is biased.. maybe it's the 60+ minute wait to sit at the bar, maybe its the 90 degree and zero breeze day, maybe its the hope and expectation that my 2nd trip to a Bongo Room (1st was the Loop location) would be the bomb.. either way, I can give this place a solid 3! I do prefer this location as being warmer and more inviting. It feels like a whole restaurant unlike its sister property. I ordered the Tomatillo Salsa Scramble. The description said to me flavorful, hearty and light, and not so guilty as something like a red velvet pancake with cream cheese would offer. Yet, when I got it, it was just okay. It was the kind of thing where I said, I can make this myself and get down with the get down. It was somewhat bland and just missing something. I think I might have still been somewhat hungry after leaving (does that make me greedy, lol). I digress (see paragraph 1 again), maybe I am biased, but this place doesn't need a 3rd time to see if its a charm unless someone twists BOTH of my arms. There is too much to be uncovered to settle!
