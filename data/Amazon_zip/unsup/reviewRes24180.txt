I found this place on Yelp! Wanted to try spicy in Chinatown.  I can say the reviews are very accurate. The chilli chicken is an explosion in your mouth. GREAT! The spicy broiled beef-- another great flavor. The food I can say is not the typical take out Chinese- so skip this place if you don't want authentic cuisine. The wait staff were Rude. Which is typical for Chinatown. The appetizer came last and my mouth was on fire before the water showed up-- but again, typical Chinatown service. The food was amazing. EXPECT TO WAIT. I will definitely return.
