I am a Thai student and surprisingly it's very difficult to find an authentic Thai restaurant in Chicago. Environment and the service at Opart Thai is good. Short walk from Western Brown Line. Overall, I do have a good impression. Tiger cry is delicious although the dipping sauce is not very spicy for Thais. Pad Thai with prawns reminds me of food back in Thailand. Ask to add some more fish sauce with chili, lime, and ground peanut then you get a traditional dish of Pad Thai. I surely will come back again.
