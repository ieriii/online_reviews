My dinner pal and good buddy, Jeff Borden met me here one night. We like to meet once a month and dine somewhere neither of us have been. He's a great guy to have dinner with. Great conversation and he likes to eat at nice places that aren't mainstream. It was a bit romantic for a couple of guys, I'll admit. Nevertheless, Caro Mio? - Outstanding. Step through the front doors and begin your journey to the heart of Italy. From the paintings on the wall to the quiet candlelight table settings to the delectable aromas wafting from the kitchen, just steps away from the tables. I love to hear a Chef "clanking away" in the kitchen just under the music. Wonderful. Be prepared because Caro Mio restaurant is a trip to Italy for your senses. In every bite of their fine Italian cuisine, you can taste the essence of a cozy Italian villa, over looking a rolling countryside with winding roads and a gentle sea breeze. (That was a bit sappy, I admit but I always wanted to write like that...yuk) Service - European, slow, authentic, but very personal, no rush, relax, take your time and drink some wine and enjoy a good conversation. I would never take a large crowd to Caro, no more than 4 people, tops. It's not that kind of place. Decor - is small, dark and romantic. You'll feel lost or in hiding. Food - "Bella." Music - Euro lounge, very nice... different. Bottom-line: Bring your best bottle (or two) of Red, your best girl (or wife) and huddle and cuddle in this cozy Chicago hideaway. I'm going back but on a really snowy night, mid week, sometime in late January. This time, I will take my wife or daughter, as shes my best girl. I have the best of both worlds. "Finisci di mangiare"! (eat up)
