Tender cuts of steak + sizzling butter + 500 degree hot plates = flavor country The steaks were perfectly cooked and stayed hot till the last bite. I ordered medium and the steak continue to cook so my second half was more of a medium-well (which was still super tender and delicious). Ohhh and the sizzling butter. Just too good.  Service was excellent and atmosphere is very nice.
