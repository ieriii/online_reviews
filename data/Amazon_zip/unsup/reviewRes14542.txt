Well I wound up here after taking a wrong turn after deciding to not wait for a table at Kuma's. What a fortunate wrong turn that turned out to be. My girl friend and I decided to get different sandwiches so we could share half with the other. We went with the steak and pork sandwiches.  I really liked the steak, it was great. The pork was decent, but I couldn't quite get into the taste of the plantains, just not my thing. This was my first ever experience with Cuban food and I enjoyed it.
