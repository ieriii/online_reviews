One of the best. Even better that it's a BYOB! The portions are huge! Would suggest the Matrimonio. It's a huge plate of strip steak, chicken breast, plantain, yucca and a small baked potato. More than enough to fill you up. My favorite though has to be the Lengua en salsa de alcaparras (aka beef tongue in spanish capers sauce). Amazing! There's always a wait on weekend evenings, so service can be a bit lacking on a busy night. Weeknights are better. Looks like though management has opened up a satellite location a couple doors down in a larger space. It includes 2 bars and a HUGE waiting area, probably to make up for the lack of space in the original spot. So now you don't have an excuse not to try it out!
