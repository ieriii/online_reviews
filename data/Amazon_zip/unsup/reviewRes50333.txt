My friends took me here for my birthday. The wings were great and the waitress was so great! She told me her name but I forgot because I was kind of wasted. She and I did a free shot for my bday and that was really sweet of her. I really wanted wings and they did not disappoint. Delicious! They weren't skimpy and the sauces are good. I'm a fan of the tangy BBQ. I will be back!
