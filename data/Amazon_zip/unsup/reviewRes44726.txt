Gino's vs Giordano's Part II "Overindulgence is a state of mind. The stomach will ALWAYS accommodate, if the mind allows."                      - A very wise (and fat) man - That's right folks! If you've tuned in, then you know that this is the sequel to the much anticipated head to head duel of Chicagoland's deep-dish pizza heavyweights. Who will take the crown? Read on to find out. Round 1- History: Per Giordano's own menu, the place first opened its doors in February 1974 by two brothers from the "old country" who tried to recreate Mamma's recipe (aw, shucks). Contrast this with Gino's tale (as noted on their lovely paper placemats) of two taxi-driving paisanos and their bud who got bored and opened the doors of their first pizzeria in 1966. Dilemma: old word tradition vs. a modern tale of introspection... Verdict: TIE Round 2 - Decor: Now I have no idea what the original Giordano's looked like, but I'd like to think it started as a hole-in-the-wall rather than the sparkling brass monstrosity it has morphed into. I felt like I walked onto the set of Cheers when I stepped in from the rainy Chicago day. Dark woods, slovenly touristas, and tubby businessmen are NOT an attractive mix. Contrast this to the artificial bohemia of Gino's and anyone would be hard-pressed to find a winner. Verdict: a vicious uppercut gives the edge goes to Gino's graffiti-inspired coziness. Round 3 - Food: To tell the truth, almost anyone could combine cheese, tomatoes, and bread and get an easy two stars from me. Pizza is a glorious food and it would really take a brain-damaged monkey to screw it up. Giordano's veggies seem fresh and are still slightly al dente. The tomato sauce isn't as bold or flavorful as Gino's, but inch per square inch, Giordano's pie is larger. The crust on a Giordano's pie is right on. Thick but light, chewy but not dense, and it seemed to be more soggy-resistant than the competitor's crust. Verdict: Giordano's comes back with a vengeance and pulls a stunning upset. I come from Northern California. A place with mild, temperate weather, abundant fresh ingredients, and a food-obsessive culture. I give Chicago my highest praise: You are lucky bastards!
