The entrance to this hotel is literally steps away from a Red Line station, which was a blessing in -30 degree weather. While the hotel gym is small, guests have complimentary access to an actual fitness club near the hotel, so if you're staying in the cooler months, be sure to bring a jacket or sweatshirt to wear over your workout clothes for the brief jaunt outside. The room is a standard Hilton Garden Inn room -- well-appointed, clean, and spacious. Check for the AAA discount, as it saved me $30/night.
