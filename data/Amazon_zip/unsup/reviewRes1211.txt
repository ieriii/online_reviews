Yummmm....hot dogs. Specialty hot dogs, even better! What can I say that hasn't been said before. All of their dogs are AWESOME! I still would recommend one of the fire dogs or super fire dogs with chili on top. It's a spicy classic that they do well. It obviously won't compare to the specialty dogs, but worth a bite or two. Personally I don't think the duck fat fries are unbelievable. They are good, but I honestly like M Burger's and other similar places a little more. But hey, if you are there on a weekend, why not indulge!
