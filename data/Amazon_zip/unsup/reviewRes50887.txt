Once again, I find myself wondering why yelp hasn't adapted and made half stars. This is definitely in between a Yay! I'm a fan. and Woohoo! As good as it gets! Everytime I come to Chicago, I have to stop at Wishbone for brunch. It is an excellent place to go for southern style breakfast. I've had my fare share of items on the menu. You can never go wrong with an omelete. My favorite was a special they had one Sunday morning--broccoli, pesto, and cheese. Swooooooooon. The eggs benedict are good-- I'l admit they're nothing special. The cheese grits are good, but once again--nothing special. The milkshakes are phenom. They definitely bring all the boys to the yard. And finally. A must try for everyone: the freshly squeezed apple juice. It is by far the best apple juice I have ever had. Do not let the green color scare you. It tastes just like a granny smith apple. I know, I know it's apple juice, of course it tastes like apples. No, I'm serious. This warrants an Elaine from Seinfeld "get out!" reaction when you taste it. Mmmmm. The place is always packed--sometimes a drawback when you have a group, which makes getting a table a long wait--but once you sit down the workers are extremely efficient and attentive! As long as I continue to come to Chicago, I will always make a stop at Wishbone. Try it! You won't be sorry!
