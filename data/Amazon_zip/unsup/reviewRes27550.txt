Loved, loved, loved the sashimi... enjoyed the nibbles of the asparagus salad on my friend's plate. The monkfish was as delicious as it is in Hawaii. And the desserts, I am still dreaming of the rose sorbet. An amazing dinner and dining experience. I am surprised the restaurant was half empty the entire time we were there. I look forward to eating here again the next time I'm in Chicago.
