For the price, this place is worth it. It's kind of small in comparison to say, the Avenue, but it has charm. The elevator is a tight fit, and our bathroom wasn't big at all, but the it had all the necessities and it was clean. The beds were decent and the room itself was nice-sized. The biggest perk was being so close to everything. The service was tremendous and we were treated wonderfully by the staff.
