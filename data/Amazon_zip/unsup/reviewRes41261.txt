We arrived on a very cold night, and the restaurant was nice and warm... the perfect night for a bowl of Pho. As we were perusing the menu, my wife came across an interesting entry. She said to all of us: "Look at item #51!!" The waiter overheard her as he was passing by and said rather surprised "You want number 51??" She replied, rather aghast "No!"... because #51 was some meal including COW PENIS! The waiter seemed relieved because he said "Most Americans don't LIKE #51". (I'm not surprised). I said to the waiter, there's only one problem with #51 (only one... really?)... I said "Cows don't HAVE a PENIS"!... to which he quickly responded.... in all sincerity... "No, Not anymore!!" We had a wonderful time, and the Pho was warm, delicious and cow-penis free.
