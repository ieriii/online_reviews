It was just ok. Many of their dishes sounded good in concept but the execution was just wrong. There were so many things I would change about how the dishes were executed. I wish I could have just walked into the kitchen and revamped all the dishes we tried. They were having a wine-tasting with the staff while we were there which made for a less attentive waitstaff. The expedition of the dishes didn't make sense at all. We did a pretty good job of ordering our dishes in a manner that would let the server "course out" our meal but our plates came out in a weird order which distracted our palettes. The highlight of our meal was the Hearts of Palm salad. The Sea Urchin and Crab Linguini lacked the brininess of the sea urchin and needed some acidity to round out the flavors. It does however pair well with the Hearts of Palm Salad. Their Hanger Steak was forgettable and many of the elements didn't stand out, creating an overall "meh" dish. i can't even really remember what else we got because nothing was very memorable. I was a little disappointed in our $80 lunch. I think it could have been well spent somewhere else, which is a super let-down because I had such high hopes for this place. P.S. who ever is hiding the salt from the chef please return, most of our dishes lacked flavor.
