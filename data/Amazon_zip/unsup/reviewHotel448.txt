Very nice clean hotel. Looked more like a 4 star than 3. booked using hot wire wasn't sure what to expect. The staff was very friendly. Very live bar in the main lobby area. George Clinton was even staying there when we were there. The neighbor hood is a bit ruff, however it looks like they are trying to redo the area. But the public transportation is right out the door bus is only 2 steps from door. I will be staying again great price right down town. NICE
