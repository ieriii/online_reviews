After an exhausting few days of packing, we came to Sammy's after our movers put everything into our Upack containers. We were starved and weren't disappointed at the homecooked food. The price was right at about $8 for my chicken sandwich, fries, and a cup of delicious chicken noodle soup. Seemed like it was a friendly, local joint where everyone knew each other. It's probably a place for all the cops to eat at as there were nearly 7 or 8 while we were there. Service was excellent and we were asked 2 times if we needed anything else. It's definitely a dive from the 80's that could use in some sprucing up decor-wise, but it's not a big deal. It's just delicious diner food at great prices!
