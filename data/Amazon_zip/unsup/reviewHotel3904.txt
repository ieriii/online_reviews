My husband and I stayed here during our small, budget honeymoon. We liked the location. Not far to all the things we wanted to see. The room was average, nothing special. There are almost always picketers but they never bothered us. The bathroom tile was a bit thrown together but all in all, nothing interfered with having a comfortable stay. My only disappointment is I didn't get a visit from the infamous ghosts! Lol!
