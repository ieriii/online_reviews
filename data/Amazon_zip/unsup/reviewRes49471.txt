Recently stumbled in here for breakfast after an 8 hour drive to Chicago for some Cardinals games. We were promptly seated and I ordered a great tasting vanilla latte. I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon and my buddy had the ricotta blueberry pancakes. Both dishes were outstanding and I'm still working on these damn ricotta pancakes in my own kitchen. Bin 36 served their pancakes with blueberries on top, I'm trying to incorporate mine into the batter. If I find myself in the area again, looking for a breakfast that doesn't fill the typical mold - I'm headed here.
