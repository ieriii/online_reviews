My husband and I had an early dinner here a few months back (I know...kinda late, but I could've sworn I already wrote a Yelp review on this place). We didn't have reservations, but it wasn't quite dinner time and they were happy to seat us.  First impressions...loved the modern but comfortable decor and natural sunlight filtering in through the skylights. I'm sure they spent some money on design. The service was prompt, and we got a big, complimentary plate of pickles and bbq potato chips to whet our appetites (as if the heavenly smell wasn't enough).  Unfortunately, we kinda choked when we saw the prices on the menu, especially for their famous(?) "competition" bbq. Our waiter explained that the chef/owner competed nationally, as well as on a televised bbq cook-off, and this was her recipe. As curious as we were, we didn't want to fork over +$30 a plate when we knew we could gorge on dah-licious and CHEAP bbq elsewhere.  We settled for their standard pulled pork, hush puppies, slaw, and beans; all tasty, but not quite as memorable as the sticker shock. We're glad we stopped in...great ambiance and service...but we probably won't eat here again the next time we visit Chicago.
