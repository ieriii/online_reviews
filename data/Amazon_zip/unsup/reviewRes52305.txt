I can't begin to explain how much I hate Gino's East... I hate it with a fire that burns hotter than a thousand suns. When it comes to Chicago-style pizza, there are 4 places that compete: 1) Lou Malnati's, 2) Giordano's, 3) Uno's/Due's, and 4) Gino's East. Gino's is by far the worst of the bunch. Their crust tastes like absolute crap. I can't think of a single reason to go to this place. Save your money and time... go to Lou's, Uno's or Giordano's.
