My husband and I returned to Geja's to celebrate the 26th anniversary of our first date! We went on a Sunday at 5:00 pm (reservation made beforehand) and had a booth. Service was VERY attentive and the food was delicious.  Not sure why people would call this place romantic...? It is dark... but it's not intimate and you're cooking your own food! How is this romantic? None the less, you will enjoy the experience surrounded by the music of Spanish and classical guitar. We started off with a cheese fondue that was served with fruit,an assortment of breads, and a tasty side salad. Our main course was beef, chicken, and scallops with assorted vegetables.There were eight delicious dipping sauces to share. The meal ends with a dessert platter of marshmallows to roast, chunks of pineapples, pound cake, strawberries and Rice Krispie treats to dip and a rich, Belgian chocolate fondue. Everything was fresh and delicious; prepared exactly how I like it!! Considering all the food you are getting, I didn't feel it was "pricey" but priced accordingly.You are paying for the fondue experience. It is what it is. It's fondue.
