This is a great place to see in the neighborhood. I think it deserves 4 and half stars, but I can't do that. I love going here from time to time because I know I can rely on the quality dining experience they provide. The food is exceptionally well done. It is pub food with a more modern twist. The farm burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had and the brunch is amazing. The beers are truly great and I love that they have a good variety. The beers get 5 stars. The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 stars overall is because I think they should diversify the dinner menu a little bit. There aren't a lot of non-sandwich options for dinner and of those options only a few are really great. For the ideal experience, I recommend going for lunch or brunch because the menu is fitting for their strengths and its not as crowded.
