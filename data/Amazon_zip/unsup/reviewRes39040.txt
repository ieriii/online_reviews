There is land past Western?!?! Logan what?! As Kyle H. says "L&E is simply amazing" and I didn't go because of the phrase "long man" like John B. did (ha-ha). Karen T. writes "If I could sum up L&E's aesthetic / mood in 4 words, it would be: New American hipster chic." and I can see where she comes up with that. I took one bit of my dish and like Amy H. I said "OH MY HEAVEN!!!". Then again, it was probably more like Molly O. "Duck.Me." (We'll just move that F somewhere else Miss Molly). For more detail about the decor, atmosphere, killer food, stellar service, and fancy drinks please read up on Angie M., Brett D. and Penny S. reviews or any of the other 800+ others.  If I knew places like this existed maybe I'd travel more. But really when the magnificently mischievous Molly O. calls, you run... or take 2 trains, 3 buses, and a piggyback on some old lady built like old Schwarzenegger (Whew! I'll never forget that ride!!)... or you can just drive. Though I will warn you, parking gets a bit challenging and I'm sure it worsens the later it gets. I dig this place!! Get the Roasted Miller Farms Half Chicken, Potato & Mushroom Terrine, Smoked Bacon, Haricot Verts, Chausseur Sauce, you'll be ecstatic!! This review is dedicated to Johny T and his weekly Yelp, the good people at L&E for making me____* in my pants, and to Molly O. for being a fantastic dinner companion (though I can't prove it, I think she might have been stealing bites from my plate while I wasn't looking).  * Come on people!! The word is dance. You never heard that expression "dance in my pants", well now you have.
