I went here for my birthday (as well as my four year anniversary with my significant other) last year and really enjoyed it. It was my first experience with fondue and it was great. The place is dark and intimate, but a bit too intimate. It was a special occasion for us and we had mentioned that to the maitre d'. However, we were still at a table where another couple was placed almost on top of us. I felt they could have been a bit more sensitive to our situation and wonder if it was because we were on the younger side. The food was great, but our server was not terribly friendly or helpful. We noticed (how could you not with how close the tables were) another server carefully and intelligently explaining how everything worked to her customers, and listened in on that exchange in order to know what was going on. Our server did not take the time to explain any of this to us. It is also not a cheap place and if you have are hungry it might not be the perfect place, as fondue does not always have the largest portions! But the cheese and the chocolate fondue were amazing. Since this experience I have been to the Melting Pot and I think, that Geja's is far superior.
