So, since the last time I've been there and my last review... (not to mention boycott of this joint,) I went this past weekend late Friday night. We walked in and were not greeted or anything! Again, is it because they don't want the business, or they don't care, or all the servers are too old or what? So I got annoyed and walked out for a bit til they cleared some tables. About 5 minutes later, we walk back in and are still not greeted. So this time tables are cleared off and so I just sat down at the first table I saw. I told my boyfriend, no way I'm waiting until they greet me standing up. To much of my surprise, they bring us table settings and some waters right away. I was actually surprised they didn't make us move to a smaller table since it was just us two. We ordered one order of the non-marinated short rib meat and one order of ribeye. The ribeye, I don't recommend much, because the proportions were really not worth it for $20. I was very happy they gave so many banchan or side dishes. I didn't have to ask for any lettuce or my favorite green onion sides and meat sauces. I also ordered the nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodle,) it came with a lot of pickled daikon and half a boiled egg, and a slice of pear. Mmmmmm could have used more slices of cucumber though. I'm just picky like that. The broth wasn't bad but not anything special. This is a tricky dish because not many places have good broth.  If anyone is reading this entire post... I gotta give you propz. So, I give them two more stars this time since the last time I would have preferred to give zero stars. I was satisfied with the food and prompt re-filling of water... VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO SOMEONE LIKE ME. teehee.
