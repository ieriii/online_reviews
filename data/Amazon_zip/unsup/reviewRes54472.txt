The Chicago Diner has awesome breakfast. I love their scrambled tofu, french toast, biscuits and gravy, and pancakes. They give you a ton of food so I usually end up over eating when I come here. I do like their lunch but usually go earlier for breakfast. When I do go for lunch, I like their philly cheese steak and reuban sandwiches. They also have good vegan macaroni and cheese! And the best thing is the vegan peanut butter cookie dough milkshake.
