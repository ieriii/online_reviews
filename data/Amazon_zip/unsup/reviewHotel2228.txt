Yeah, the room decor is outdated - but the room size compensates. The customer service was wonderful. I dont know how much the employees are getting paid, but it must be enough to act like they genuinely want you to be there, and they want to wait on you. Do yourself a favor and just explore the hotel. The architecture is amazing; beautiful Victorian marble water fountains are in hallways, and I understand all of the architecture is original. If I had to complain, my one complaint would be the food in the hotel restaurant. Overpriced and not delicious. Overall, though, I would definitely recommend the intercontinental - and of course stay again.
