Best Asian Style upscale food in Chicago that I have found. The Filipino style food is amazing including a new take on some of the more classic Filipino dishes like Pansit. Two negatives:  The Space is Loud. The space can get incredibly load during peak dining time so much so that you can not hear your waiter or the person across the table from you. It doesn't help that they have large round tables in 1/2 of the restaurant, which if you are seated at don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with the person directly across from you. Service is just Ok. The service is just ok and the waitstaff gives off a "I am awesome because I word at a cool restaurant" vibe. The managers are at least nice if the waitstaff messes up your order they comp you as they should.
