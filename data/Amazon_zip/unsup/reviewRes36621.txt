Since my friend introduced me to this place a year ago, I go about once every two weeks. It's always satisfying, and reasonably priced (especially the daily lunch special!). I usually always get the same thing (vegetable egg rolls and Rama Chicken), but if something is consistently great, why stray? My friends usually get the Sushi with similarly high praise. This place has single-handedly renewed my faith in "pan-Asian" restaurants. So rarely can a place do both Thai and Japanese so well.
