Everything at Alinea is amazing. Chef Achatz and his staff really know what they're doing when it comes to molecular gastronomy. I had the 12 course tasting menu, and everything was just awesome. A plus side to the food is the service that you get from the wait staff. They truly try to cater to your needs as a patron to their establishment. Even though the bill was heavy, I would definitely go there again.
