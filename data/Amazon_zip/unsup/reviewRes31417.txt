We tried to go to Nana last Sunday. We did not watch check, please on Friday night and it seemed everyone else in Chicago had. The wait was unbearable, we were told 20 minutes and we were waiting outside for about 40 when we threw in the towel. Fast forward to Friday morning and we decided to give it another go for brunch. We were seated right away. Our waitress was awesome from the start! Very friendly and attentive. My fiance had the duck biscuits and gravy and I had the steak and egg special. Both were very tasty. The biscuits and gravy are not at all traditional, I didn't try the biscuits but he said they were amazing, the gravy was loaded with duck, onions and brussel sprouts, yum! The steak and eggs was huge! I had a whole meal to take home and I was pleasantly full. It comes on a bed of lobster sweet potato hash which was amazing! I had the hollandaise sauce on the side as I am not really a fan, I tried a little and it was good, but too rich for me. We tried some of their bacon as well and it was just okay in my opinion. Definitely worth the two tries to eat here. Very good and original!
