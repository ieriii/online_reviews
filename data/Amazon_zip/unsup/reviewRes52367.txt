Upon arriving in Chicago my GF and I talked about finding the best deep dish pizza in town. Many people recommended to try out Giordano's, but I've had it before and it was ok (bought a frozen one and cooked it at home). We decided to go against popular opinion and try out Gino's East. The wait wasn't long at all, even for a Friday. The decorations are neat with graffiti art throughout displayed across the entire restaurant. We ordered their cheesy bread appetizer, and it just seemed like a big buttery mess. We would have been better off not ordering it. The pizza that we ordered was the Meaty Legend. A combination of pepperoni, italian sausage, canadian bacon, and bacon. It was something to remember. I've never had SO much high quality meat in a pizza. All in all, we were satisfied with picking Gino's East over Giordano's. It would have received an additional star in their rating, but the appetizer brought it down a notch.
