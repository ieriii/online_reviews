Shaw's is another old-school feeling Chicago restaurant. My grandparents have always called this their favorite place to eat in Chicago, for as long as I can remember, so maybe I'm biased a bit, but it is soooo good. The appetizer sampler, the service, the seafood, the desert, the drinks...it's all good at Shaw's. A little pricy for what it is in my opinion, but every time I go I am stuffed. Fat and happy. Thank you Shaws. (Lucky for me, I usually go with my grandparents and they love to buy me dinner!)
