My rating is based on the overall experience in its entirety and not just for the meal. Food: Exceptional! I ordered one of their famous Chicago stuffed pizza and it was to die for. It was so thick and filling I had only one piece. The cheese is stringy and the sauce was not watery or too saucy at all. You can get 1/2 one type of pizza and a 1/2 second type of other pizza for the same price at no additional charge.  Service: Awesome service. Our waiter was really nice and when our pizza came out he put it on our plates for us. He was on top of refilling drinks too.  Atmosphere: Very lively, loud, and a fun place to hang out. The place was huge and super crowded. We waited an hour to get in but the good news is that you can preorder your meal while you wait since it takes 35 mins to make the pizza. So when we were finally seated, the pizza came out and it was hot! The only downfall was the ordering line was not organized so you had to squeeze your way through to place an order. Also, there is very minimal seating if your waiting, so expect to stand most of the time.  Location: It was the perfect location for us since it was walking distance from our hotel, the Allerton. If your situated near the magnificent mile, you're golden.  Overall, I would definitely go back to this place. Fun and Delicious. Highly recommended.
