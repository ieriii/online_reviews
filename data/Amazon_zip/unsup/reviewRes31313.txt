Wow, I'm surprised at the bad reviews of this place. I guess I lucked up coming midway for lunch. I'm all for cozy little nooks with a more creative breakfast/brunch menu and not really concerned if it's organic or not. Love the exposed brick and the artwork. The service was good, but hey, I may be biased since the waitress knew my friend. She was friendly, attentive....yes, a little more on the chatty side, but that was okay; we weren't in a rush. Ask me how I like it on a normal day when I am under time constraints. I had the BLT and it was tasty. The prices were no different than most trendy bruncheries in the city. I'd keep in mind, too, that anytime you're doing organic, it's gonna cost ya. We know that from grocery shopping so why would a restaurant catering to this type of food be any different? Just sayin'...
