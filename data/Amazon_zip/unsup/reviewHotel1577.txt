I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for Hotel 71. First of all I think the Lobby should be so much bigger than it is. It's quite small and when there are people checking in/out it gets super crowded. Uncomfortably crowded, especially when everyone is lining up for the elevators in this little nook. But other than that it's very trendy and the staff is nice. Great location but there are so many other wonderful hotels in the area.
