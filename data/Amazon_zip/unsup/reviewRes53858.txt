Good food but very small portions. If you are hungry you'd have to spend at least $30 on the small dishes to have enough (and that is not including drinks.) Our favorite actually contained no pork.....it was the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde! The grilled octopus was very tender and flavorful. Other favorites: bread croquettes - but you only get 6 small balls for $5. Bread pudding with citrus - served warm and just the right amount. A great ending to our lunch. Misses: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, PickledCherry Peppers & Fried Egg. The tastiest thing on this dish was the fried kale. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. Interesting but would not order again because realistically the bone marrow had little flavor. Service was pretty good although we informed our waitress that she forgot a $22 charge on our check and she seemed more embarrassed than thankful.  They validate parking at a certain lot (forgot which one) but call ahead to find out.
