Went there yesterday with a large group of friends to celebrate birthdays. The food was fantastic! Most of us ordered different things from the menu and they were all good!  Appetizers are to die for there!   Would have gave it 5 stars if it wasn't for the volumn of the music a bit too loud to hear across the table and one uni-sex bathroom to share with everyone between two kitchens so the lines for the bathroom was a pain.. when the kitchen staffs are constantly coming in/out of the tight area.  Would definitely come back again for some yummy Cuban food!
