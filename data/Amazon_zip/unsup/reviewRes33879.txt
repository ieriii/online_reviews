I'm not quite sure why this place has a reputation as such great italian food. The wait was rough, and the bar was tight to squeeze into to wait.  The most "meh" part, however, is the food. Standardly priced, and you get a fair portion, but it was the most bland, 'cookie-cutter' italian I have ever eaten. The pasta sauces had no real zing, and the meats and cheeses included were mediocre at best. WAAAAAAAAAAY better italian to be found in this town, folks (cough cough Sapori!)
