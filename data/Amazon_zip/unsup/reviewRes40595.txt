Wow... 600+ reviews? I'm really impressed. I've heard so much about this place and I'm glad I finally got to go. Unfortunately, I came here after I became a pescatarian, so I can't comment on the pho (my friends said it was good though!) I had a shrimp bun (vermicelli), and I downed that one fast. It had pretty good flavor. My bf loves bun, and he said his was very delicious! I would say that it's in the top 3 for me in terms of bun. It's very crowded and busy. However, we were able to grab a seat on New Year's Day at 7pm with a 10 min wait. I can't wait to come back here one day!
