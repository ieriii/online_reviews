I'm rating the restaurant not the bar, and I gotta say it was average at best.  The service was weird. Our server was really short with us, not exactly friendly. My boyfriend had the brisket and thought it was really fatty and underdone. I had a Tilapia sandwich and it was fine. The fries--meh. The tables were insanely close together and there was a weird server-guy who kept walking by our table every couple of minutes asking if he could take things away. We clearly were still eating. Finally I told him he could take my plate and he kept walking by waiting for my boyfriend to finish. We paid the bill, and wanted to finish our drinks before we left and the guy STILL kept coming by to take A napkin--one at a time. This place was just weird. And the food wasn't good enough to make me wanna go back.
