Our fourth or fifth trip to Anteprima was quite enjoyable, as were the earlier visits. My salad of heirloomtomatoes with diced cucumber, thin-sliced watermelon, dressed with mint, olive oil and lemon juice was the perfect starter on a muggy August evening. My farfalle with a prosciutto ragu was rich and satisfying, a small portion was more than enough. The lady enjoyed her choices as well, and the service was attentive and courteous. Anteprima is very noisy, not the place for a quiet chat, but for those in a festive mood, it's a wonderful reason to visit Andersonville. Moreover, if weather permits, the noise is not an issue if seating is available on the patio out back. Upscale and eclectic Italian food is served, but the cafe is never empty, reservations advised.
