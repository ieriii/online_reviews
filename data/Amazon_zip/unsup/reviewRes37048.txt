Haven't been back to Hopleaf since I left Chicago until last night. As usual, bustling crowd with great vibe and great beer selection. Had dinner with friends outside and the service was spotty and slowish, and the Brisket platter was just "OK." I won't have it again. The Frittes were excellent, and the Stilton Mac & Cheese was awesome. Pretty great place if you know what to (and not to) order on the dinner menu.
