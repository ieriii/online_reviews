Having recently moved to Chicago, I was feeling the need to take a break from the chaos of combining two households into one. Not wanting to cook or go out, we decided to order some comfort food. For me, this was nothing fancy - just a plain cheese pizza, well-done. When I opened the box, I saw a round pizza cut into squares, covered in a thick, impenetrable layer of grease. While I can't take points off for the cutting nonsense (save it for the Sicilian pies), I definitely can justify the low rating by saying it was the single most unappetizing pizza I have ever seen. Honestly, did someone pour french fry grease ONTO the pizza? It was nauseating. Because we had no food, after pulling off the cheese and using about a half a roll of paper towels to soak up the remaining grease, I did eat a couple of the squares. It was mediocre. Perhaps it's something I need to get used to, but I like round pizza to come in slices, not squares. I like my pizza to be edible, not soggy and wet. I like my pizza to have a delicious crust, not blackened. Maybe they were having an off night, maybe it was somebody new...but how can a pizza joint not know how to make a plain cheese? As a teenager I worked in a pizza place and during our down time we used to concoct some pretty wild creations, but this slimy pie beats our worst idea by a mile. Come on.
