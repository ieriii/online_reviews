This place is fantastic! I've had cuban food several times in Florida, and to find it just as good at home in Chicago was a revelation. My date and I went for lunch on a thursday afternoon. We sat outside on the patio, really the best way to do it in this very small place.  For an appetizer, we had the empanadas. There is a selection of about half a dozen different fillings, and you can choose 3. We tried the Chorizo, Cheese and Guava and Goat cheese. All were very good. For our entrees, we both ordered dinners. I had the Ropa Veija which was very good, and served with seasoned white rice and black beans. Very very good. My date had a chicken dish, the name of which escapes me, but she also liked it very much. Fair warning, the portions are HUGE. We both only ate about half of our entrees and took the rest home. After lunch, I had a Cuban Espresso, which is always a wonderful treat, and my date had an iced coffee drink that was very good as well.  All in all, a wonderful little place, not fancy, just great food and a great price. For all we got, the bill was around $45. You can easily come in under that, being that we ordered full dinner portions, and skipped the lunch sandwiches and such that were less costly.
