I've been to Piece now a few times...this is likely among my top 3 thin crust pizzas in the city..possibly even top 2... LOVE the Red pizza...and the white pizza is pretty yummy as well.... It comes out piping hot, fresh tasting and just overall outstanding! A small can easily feed 2-3 people...a medium you likely will have leftovers (ie 3-4 slices). LOVE their beers here...the Camel Toe is my favorite! They didn't have the hefenwizen the last time I went (That one is pretty great too). The wait time varies, on weekends its usually an hour...weeknights I've waited anywhere from 10-45 minutes...service is fast and friendly...the seating can be pretty close to another table FYI. Plenty of TVs for you to watch the games that are on... They have karaoke here on Thursday nights...!! Love this place!
