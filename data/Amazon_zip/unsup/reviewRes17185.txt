Wow this place is huge! Came for my husbands 30th bday back in September. It was great! The wait was a while but mainly because the rest of our party was late. Not a problem though as we sat at the bar and had some great raspberry mojitos. so so good. The bar was packed though but the bartender had a great sense of humor. Our dinner was fantastic....my favorite item on the menu was the corn! Can't remember all that we had, but we shared plates and all of it was delicious. Great place to come for a celebration!
