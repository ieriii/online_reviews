I think the difference between 'Mediterreanean' and 'Persian' is the price. There are some differences in the cuisine but for the most part I think it's the same but Persian restaurants have higher quality ingredients. Think filet kabob instead of beef and you get the picture. Obviously, since I am a fan of it it's not too bad. Noon O Kabab has some pretty good selections, and I give it an A for effort since it does try to set itself apart from the other Mediterranean/Persian restuarants in the city and on this strip. I went with a friend of mine and split the hummus which was pretty good. A smooth consistency and a pretty tasty standout. I had the Fesenjan which is a pomegranate stew with chicken. I ordered it because it was something different....well like I said, A for effort. My friend went with a more traditional approach and got the steak and chicken kabob combination. I was much more pleased with that flavor. If it was a little on the pricey side, again you pay for the higher quality and it does show. I will probably return but get something more along the normal route.
