Went here for the first time last night and was thoroughly impressed with the Uptown Poetry Slam (which happens every Sunday night from 7 - 10.) The emcee Marc Smith has been running this show for over 20 years and is a fantastic performer and improviser in his own right...the poem he ended the night on, a reflection on how he has fallen short of his ideals, was heavy and genuine. Unexpected, as for most of the night Smith's an affectionate prankster. The show begins with an open mic, then has a feature performer, and then the slam competition. The feature performers last night (a duo who tossed their individual poems back and forth in frenetic quasi-collaboration ) were very good and I regret that I didn't catch their names. (Note to Green Mill: you should list the names of the feature performers on your website, dig?) The slam contestants were hot and cold, as they should be. Ultimately you're going there for the energy, to see someone put themselves out there, to catch snippets of feeling.... The band who accompanies the slammers keeps you from drifting away. I was completely won over by the pianist who performed her own song in a sweet-as-honey voice about how quickly you can detest someone who strikes up a conversation with you. As far as the place itself, it's cozy and laid back. There's a long bar that winds around from the entrance to the stage area as well as tables and chairs that get filled up quick so don't try to be fashionably late--early is better. For 6 dollars, you'd be hard pressed to find a comparable night of creativity and verve.
