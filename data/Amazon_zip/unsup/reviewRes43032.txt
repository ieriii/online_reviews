I'm not too big on stuffed pizza, but I was delightfully surprised with the pizza I ate today. Around 7 pm or so I realized I hadn't eaten anything all day, this happens often and it makes me mad. Anyway, decided to stop by this place on our way home. It was pretty packed, obviously everyone else's stomachs realized it was go time as well. We ordered a 14 inch stuffed cheese (yes, extremely hungry and figured we could take the rest home). It was delish, the entire ONE slice that I ate. I really enjoyed it, but I think I'm going to stick with thin crust/pan pizza, I can eat more slices (even if it adds up to the same amount, I feel better about myself for some reason). I couldn't believe I could barely finish that one slice. Either way, to say that I enjoyed this stuffed pizza says a lot, because I usually avoid them.
