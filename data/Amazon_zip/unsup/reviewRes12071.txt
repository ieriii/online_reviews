I need to start by saying--I have never EVER had Papa Rellenas melt in my mouth!!! The Friday night crowd almost made L and I turn around, but, we decided to sit at the bar in the back and make the most of it. ((best idea ever!)) The bar tender was nice to us, make small talk and guided us through his favorite dishes ((all of them)). We ordered a few Dos Equis, some appetizers listened to the variety of Latin music & the smells coming from the kitchen all made for an atmosphere that enchanted us. Unfortunately we were only able to try the Papa Rellena & Bacon Wrapped Dates before our comedy show BUT, Cafe 28 will def get another visit from us!!!
