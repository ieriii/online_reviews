Hands down... the BEST Brazilian steakhouse in Chicago!!! The meat is amazing; it melts in your mouth. I tried pretty much all the other steakhouses in Chicago, and TdB comes close, but Fogo is the original, and it seems the whole meat thing is just natural for them. The minute we walked in, we were warmly greeted and seated within a couple minutes. This place gets booked out, so, reserve a spot if you want to go there on any weekend day (especially if you have a bigger group). The salad bar is not as big as the one at TdB in Chicago, but from our conversation with the manager, it seems they are fine with that (they are sticking to the originality). However, all the selections were great! Service was a little slow, but we were expecting that on a Saturday evening. I can't say any more good things about the meat, it is absolutely outstanding! Papaya cream for dessert is always my favorite pick! Although the strawberry cheesecake looked delicious as well.
