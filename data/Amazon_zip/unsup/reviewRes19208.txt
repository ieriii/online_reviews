A small group of us went on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately at about 8:30 pm, even though it was really busy. I appreciated that they had a fun cocktail list, in addition to their HUGE beer list. Our group ordered a pulled pork burger, portabella burger, regular and veggie burger. 75% of us had their burger on the pretzel bun and two of us upgraded our fries to truffle fries. Yum on all counts! The burgers are enormous, so if you are not a huge eater, you can probably skip the salad or appetizer if you want to have enough room for the main entree. Very reasonably priced burgers for the price and quality. Too bad they don't have dessert, but we'll all be back.
