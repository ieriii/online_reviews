I've dined in and ordered take out from this place SEVERAL times. It's def better when you dine it but either way you gotta try this place. I suggest making reservations on a Friday or Saturday night. They have a really nice bar, pretty upscale decor for such cheap prices. Everything is good here. I've never had a bad dish. I love their creamy garlic salad dressing, calamari, and ribs!! Their ribs are fabulous. If I'm going to pasta I always get the seafood pasta with a spicy red sauce. The service here, always great! They also have great weekday specials. Their menu is huge and everything is sooo good that's my only compliant, it's hard to choose what you want.
