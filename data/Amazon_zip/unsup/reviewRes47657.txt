I went to ZED451 for the first and the LAST time last night. My friend and I showed up at 6pm and were told the wait for the rooftop was 15 minutes, it was over 1 hour. There was one server it seemed, downstairs and we waited 20 minutes to order, 20 minutes to get our drink. My wine glass had someone else's lipstick on it! Are they asleep, who sends that out to a customer? When we finally made it upstairs, it was crowded. On a beautiful day like yesterday, a rooftop is a place to be especially with views like ZED451. The crowd was urban professional, but in my opinion, not that impressive. However, good people watching. The worst part was that once we finally made it upstairs, it took us 20 minutes to snag a seat at the bar, but it took 45 minutes to get a drink! WE WERE SITTING AT THE BAR AND WE COULDN'T GET A DRINK!! The drinks were definitely tasty and the Samosas that we had were also tasty. It took us another 30 minutes to get our second round and at that point I pretty much had it. I asked for the check multiple times and was completely ignored. May I remind everyone reading this, I was sitting at the bar! If the service at the bar was this bad, I shudder to think how long it took everyone else to get their order. If you are someone that appreciates good service, this is NOT the place. Like most people, I go to places for the experience and this experience has been permanently ingrained in my brain. I would rather poke myself in both eyes with a pencil than go back there.
