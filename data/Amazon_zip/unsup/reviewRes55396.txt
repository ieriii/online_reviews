I live very close to here. I brought my Dad on the way to a Sox game since we take the Kedzie brown line. The flavors were great. You get pretty large portions, but don't leave feeling stuffed. We got their saffron persian gelato for dessert. My Dad was wondering ifit was sold it grocery stores; it was a perfect start to a Sox game. Who knew?
