I hate hate hate giving out 5 star reviews to places I've only visited once, but seeing as the experience was just awesome and i probably won't be back for a VERY long time, I'm going to break my own rules. Got here on a friday night around 11:00PM, wanting to grab a late dinner. The place was still quite packed and we had to wait about 25 minutes to get a table. No problem, we'll just belly up to the bar for a drink! The handcrafted cocktail list was awesome, and their beer list was quite respectable. I first had some sort of hot toddy that I can no longer remember the name of. It was delicious! I followed that by a Half Acre Daisy Cutter. Yet another beer I can't find in KC and I loved it! We finally got a table (though well within the amount of time they quoted, so no complaints there) Dinner time! ***random observation*** They have super cute candle holders that I want for my home. We first ordered a small plate to share, and I immediately decided on the scallops w/ braised oxtail and gnocchi. All three are ingredients that I love individually, and having them together was astounding! Seriously, this was "last meal on Earth" good. I honestly cannot recall the last time I had a bite of something that made me as happy as that first bite of this dish. For dinner I had some sort of duck dish. It was good...very good actually, but after the previous course it just didn't stick in my mind. I looked on the online menu for a reminder, but it's not to be found. Maybe a nightly special? Quite good, but again....those damn scallops! I would gladly come back to Longman & Eagle if I lived in Chicago, and I will certainly be back during my next visit.
