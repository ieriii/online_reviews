I know it's a chain, but I can't hold that against it. The food was very solidly good, and the portions are so HUGE that it's insane. You only need one dessert for a table, especially if you're ordering the beignets, which by the way are awesome. There's no reason not to go here, especially if you need convenient eats on Michigan Ave.
