Had such a great time here! Came w/ a group of 8 on a Wednesday night, so we had no wait. Service was excellent and they gave us 2 free desserts! The bill came out to around $40 per person, which was an entree, a drink or 2, and splitting an app, along with tax and tip. All in all, fairly priced. I ordered the salmon, which was great. The pasta dishes were big enough for 2, while the meat/fish were a little smaller. But since they were priced pretty similarly, I'd expect pasta dishes to be bigger. Everyone left full and happy, and we hope to get back soon!
