My review is based solely off the fish and chips and their beer list, because despite the fact I've been here about 5 times, that's all I ever order (foodie sin, I'm aware). Their fish and chips are awesome. Part of the reason that's all I ever order here is because The Gage is where I go when I'm craving fish and chips. It's a vicious cycle, but I'm okay with that. The fish is moist (even though I hate that word), tender, and flaky. The breading is crispy and delicious and strikes the right ratio of fish to breading. Total perfection.  The beer list is solid and I've been given several great recommendations by my server, though I can't seem to remember what they were.  Okay I lied. I've also had a couple of appetizers here, which I've enjoyed too. The fondue was pretty good, though I'm not the biggest Brie cheese fan, so I don't think I enjoyed it to its full potential. The fried zucchini was awesome. I would love to try the poutine (what's not to love about fries and cheese curds slathered in gravy? Thank you Canada for this delicious invention) but I don't enjoy game meats and having never had elk, I wonder if it will ruin the dish for me.   It's a little loud unless you get sat in the back, which is more more pleasant.  Next time, I promise to try something else on the menu. Unless of course, I decide to order the fish and chips...
