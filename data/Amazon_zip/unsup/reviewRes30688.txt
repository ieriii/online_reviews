Oh. My. God. I had tried samples from Chicago Diner at a trade show a few months ago & loved them. I finally was in the neighborhood yesterday & popped on over for a quick bite. Great googly moogly! I ordered the Barbeque Wingz (BBQ seitan wingz). No kidding, I was holding the bites in my mouth for as long as I possibly could because I didn't want the deliciousness to go away! My best friend (a MAJOR carnivore) ordered the Grilled Cheese with Smart Bacon. I asked her what she thought & she responded that it was "very, very good." But her crown jewel was the peanut butter cookie dough shake ... I had some & it was all I could do to not grab it & run so I could steal it all from her. No doubt about it ... I'm *DEFINITELY* coming back here ... weekly, if possible. Now if only they delivered.... PS: Ed. Note: I'm knocking 'em down one star because I ordered these same wingz recently & they were tough & not very warm, like they hadn't been cooked really. One bite I had to spit out in my napkin (embarassing) because I couldn't even bite into it. Disappointing....
