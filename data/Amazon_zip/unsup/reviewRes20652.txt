Long overdue review for the Gage. I came with a large group some time ago. Some of us waited at the bar while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The drinks were perfect. The staff was friendly. We were later seated towards the back. Everyone enjoyed their food. I ordered the Gage burger which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The desserts were outstanding. Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing. My only complaint is that the bathroom is downstairs and it gets a bit hairy having to use stairs after a few drinks. The downstairs is very nice, however.
