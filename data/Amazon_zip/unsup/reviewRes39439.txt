I loved cooking up the delicious meat at San Soo Gab San. But what I would have loved more would be roasting the woman who runs the place on one of those flaming hot grills. It would be like a Korean version of Hansel and Gretel.  She was a pain in the a** the whole time we were there. If I saw her in the street I would shout at her and furiously stomp my foot in the dust. Everything else was great but I don't find it pleasant to have a large woman yelling Konglish nonsense at me while I'm eating.
