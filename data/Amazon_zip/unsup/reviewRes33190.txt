Yolk offers fast service, and a huge menu selection. The space is large and they usually get people in and out pretty quickly. The food is good, solid breakfast food. Today I experienced some overcooked pancakes, which I didn't enjoy so much, but their omelets are quite tasty. The other thing to keep in mind is that the acoustics make it quite loud in there, so don't be going there trying to have a deep conversation. Otherwise, it's a good breakfast option for the South Loop.
