Thumbs up for the decor- they put a lot into making this place classy and authentic, yet it still remains very casual and comfortable. I was all set to order a burger, yet the atmosphere convinced me to go a bit more authentic. I was already drinking Smithwick's (pronounced 'Smittick's' for the unaware), so I decided to complete my pathetic re-living of my trip to Ireland and Britain and order bangers and mash instead of the burger. Bangers and mash, if you've never heard of it, is sausage links that resemble breakfast sausage, mashed potatoes, and usually comes with baked beans. Wilde's version had a delicious chunky brown gravy on the side, and I have to say, the bangers were better than I remember ever having, even in Jolly Ole'. I was a bit disappointed with the portion size, though. For the same price, my princess ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was an enormous plate upon which was a giant delicious sandwich and a healthy pile of fries. (The pile was healthy, not the fries.) While my food was great, I had to steal a bunch of her fries to fill up. Service was good, our waitress had, I think, three tables including ours that were seated at about the same time- I believe folks in the industry call this getting 'slammed'. We had asked to sit up in the front near the open front entryway on what was a beautiful evening and perfect temperature-wise so I think we contributed to said slamming. I thought the waitress did well under these difficult circumstances. Even though it's a tad pricy, we'll definitely be back due to the atmosphere and delicious food.
