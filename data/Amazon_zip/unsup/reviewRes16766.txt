I think this is my 5th time at Carnivale so again I feel I have enough visits to give a rounded review. The moment you hand your keys to Valet you get a good vibe from the building. Step inside the foyer and as you make your way, the decor lures you in further. Once inside the bar welcomes you to a spacious area to enjoy a Mojito or other. Once you step inside the main dining area, you cannot help but look up & all around at more funkiness in decor. The food does not disappoint either. The dish I had this weekend was actually a spicy linguine. No it's not an Italian restaurant, this had a Latin flair to it. They offer some tasty Ceviche as well.
