My first meal out in 2012 was not disappointing. I started it off with my first visit to Lockdown Bar & Grill. We were greeted by two friendly staff members as we entered. Miranda was our server, she was helpful in navigating the extensive beer menu and attentive throughout the meal. It was a Monday, the special was The Bone Collector, (wings). I am not a wing eater but someone else ordered them as an appetizer and they were meaty and delicious. I ordered the Guillotine (wedge) salad, it was average but expensive at $9. When is came to the main course I ordered the Arson Burger, it was huge, cooked to order and as the name indicated Hot as Hell. I loved it. The flavorful Mac & Cheese side could have been in a meal in itself. Because of the generous portions we left with about half the meal to go. The music is a significant part of the atmosphere, it is loud high energy rock. Friendly attentive staff, generous portions of good food, large beer selection. I will be back. Happy New Year!
