While strolling through the aisles of this well stocked market, it made me wonder how many choices does a cook really need to make a meal? With this in mind, I think that this Grocer is definitely geared toward the Gourmet Chef...or at the very least, Gourmet "wannabees". I was impressed by the variety, both imported and domestic, but I doubt I'd frequent this establishment since let's face it, my culinary standards are simply not that high. But while visiting, my friend and I ate at their Bistro so I'll concentrate more on reviewing that, instead. I was very hungry at the time and after giving their menu board the "once-over", the Angus burger stood out above the rest...so I ordered it with great anticipation. When our server brought it to our table and I took my first bite, it was instant disappointment. I love a good burger (thus my reason for ordering it in the first place), but I hate a dry one. Ordering it medium-rare usually guarantees juiciness, but not this time. Oh well, live and learn. At least it robbed the hunger from my belly, and for that, I was very grateful. I just wish the experience didn't cost me nearly $30 overall to do it. In short, it was conveniently located and had a relatively short wait for our food to be served. The price would be reasonable if the food's flavor matched the cost, so I guess I'd be willing to give this place another shot to find out. I'll just try the chicken, instead.
