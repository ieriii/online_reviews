Lettuce Entertain You restaurants (generally) know their stuff, and Wildfire is no exception. Wildfire doesn't blow me away, but the food is good, atmosphere is pleasant, prices are reasonable, and service is great.  My husband and I went to the downtown location for a last minute Friday night dinner - we were sat right away, which was fabulous. We started with wine and the bacon wrapped scallops (very good, but had a bit of grit). He had the bone-in ribeye (medium) for an entree, I had the petit filet (medium rare)... My steak was grossly overcooked - it was medium well+. His was well done. It was so sad, I hate to waste food, especially meat. Our waiter came by and asked how we were and I told him I though my steak was a bit overdone, and he was so apologetic, totally agreed that it was severely overdone, and said that he would get another one going right away. The same for my husband. I hate sending food back, I really do, so when the waiter treated us so well I felt better about it... The second time around was much better, cooked perfectly plus he brought our sides out again. As far as sides go - mashed potatos are wonderful - creamy, flavorful, with the skins still there. The creamed spinach was just okay - I like it more at Ruth's Chris. But, they have so many sides to choose from, there's something for everyone. When the bill came he comped part of out meal - it was very refreshing and again made us feel good about being there. We'll of course be back. I mean really, you can't go wrong with Wildfire.
