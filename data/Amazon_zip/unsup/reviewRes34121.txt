Good food and good service. I am not a really big fan of Italian food but would definitely go back here. A great place to bring family, even with a smaller menu they have a lot to choose from. We started with the mussels and fried calamari, I have never had either so good. Our entrees were all really great and you get a good sized portion for what you pay for. It can get crowded pretty quickly so definitely make a reservation.
