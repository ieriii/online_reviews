Went here for a a late-ish Saturday dinner here- two weeks after opening. Hadthe BBQ sampler, baby greens salad, pork-rub chips, mac n'cheese & some complimentary "house pickles" which were awesome! It was a great sampling of the menu and my boyfriend and I enjoyed every dish! Will definitely be back for the brisket!! The decor is also very nice, lage dining room and upstairs area.... looking forward to coming back after they get their liquor license- I heard something about Mint Julep specials?
