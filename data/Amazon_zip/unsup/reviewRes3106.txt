Well, I for one buy into all the hype, and I didn't even get near the fried chicken. Must be what makes the place smell so pungently aromatic, when you first walk in. I love these new semi-fast food, quick counter Korean fusion places as an alternative to the sit-down Korean joints, even when the word "belly" is in the name. Food is fresh and creative. Service fast and enthusiastic, and It's real low-cost healthy fare. And fusion choices such as Korean Burritos (offered here) and tacos and hot dogs in some other spots. We came here on a week night, a couple roomies and me, in a famished state. We all took advantage of the various Buddha Bowls. Audrey got a side of Korean veggies. I bought a side of Kim Chee for the table. Our little bellies quickly became bigger Buddha bellies by the time we left. With big sighs and an "I can't believe we ate the whole thing" consensus, we were only around $13 poorer, and we got more than our daily minimum of good fresh food. The Kim Chee, which I believe is one of the world's best appetizers, as well as a side, was the best I've had in awhile. Since this place is smack in the middle of my weekly stomping grounds, I can see getting Kim Chee for takeout ($3.95) on a regular basis. I like the casual and minimal space as well as the large common picnic tables where you can sprawl out and eat comfortably. And I don't even mind bussing my own table. I'll be back for the chicken, Chicken Hawk that I am.
