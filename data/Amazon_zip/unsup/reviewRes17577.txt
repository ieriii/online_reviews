Put simply, you get what you pay for: a lively, engaging, sophisticated atmosphere (but not at all stuffy or uncomfortable); excellent and informed service; great pacing; and, most importantly, well-crafted, exciting, and absolutely delicious food and drink. You can tell the restaurant thinks of these elements comprehensively and holistically, and together they ladder up to equal a fabulous dining experience (i.e. you get more than just a meal). For me, Carnivale far exceeded the value of the final bill and I can't wait to go back. Recommendations (btwn 2 people): red sangria (not too sweet), mojitos (the classic is perfect), house ricotta and focaccia starter, rose, Atun entree, Churrasco entree. No room for dessert, but we'll be back.
