I must say I was highly disappointed by this restaurant. After looking at the menu, I expectd a lot from my first experience there. The atmosphere, however, was not conducive for a pleasant dining atmosphere. It was extremely dark, so dark in fact that I could barely see the steps on the stairs and had to use my cell phone to read the menu. Furthermore, the place was noisy as heck like the New York Stock Exchange with less intelligent people. The woman was laughing hysterically and stomping on the floor at some lame joke. I attribute that perhaps to her drunkeness? Let's hope.The food was also disappointing. It was more vietnamese than French and I've eaten better food at a noodle shop in Chinatown. Everything was mediocre. My entre, the salmon with vermicelli was filled with too much lettuce and fillers without much actual noodles. The deserts were also mediocre. I've tasted better things at the local bakery. All in all, I wouldn't go back here. It was too overpriced and I believe only people who haven't experienced good vietnamese food would like this place.
