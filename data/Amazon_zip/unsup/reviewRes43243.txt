Great food horrible horrible staff and manager. It sucks giving this place only 2 stars, because there food is some of the best on Division, when waking up hung over on Sunday and Saturday mornings. I lived next door to this place for a couple of years and recently moved to another area in the city. The staff is friendly ONLY to certain types of people. I feel that all of times Ive been there I've been treated different from everyone else. It got to the point with me just sending my girlfriend inside to order, and I would wait outside. I wont say more but you catch my drift. Don't forget this is just my opinion. Not urban friendly, but hipster, yuppie friendly. Great food - bad owners. Will not go back .
