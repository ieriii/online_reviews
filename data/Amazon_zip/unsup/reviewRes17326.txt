Work with a lot of Indian colleagues. Whenever someone resigns, we go here as a group. They, for the longest time, had a monopoly on Indian food downtown. Food is pretty good but the price keeps going up. In the downtown area, this is my least favorite. That's not to say that it's not good... there are better options out there now.
