I'm always a little nervous when I book a hotel through Hotwire, not knowing what you're going to get. On top of that, I don't know the area well since I'm not from Chicago. I got really lucky, getting into The Drake Hotel for only $139 per night in November. The service was excellent, room was fantastic, and very comfortable bed. The location was great. We walked everywhere. Minutes from all the shopping. The only downside was the gym. Not that I would have used it much, but it would have been nice if they had a pool or gym that was complementary to guests. Instead, you had to pay $10 to use the one in the hotel or a little bit more for a club across the street.
