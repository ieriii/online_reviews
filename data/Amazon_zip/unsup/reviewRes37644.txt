This place was really great - the beer selection is overwhelming if anything, especially for someone that isn't so much a connoisseur as a fan. The food is also great; can't beat a bucket full of mussels and a duck reuben. I was a little too timid to try the pb&j with cheese on it, but maybe next time. I see some complaints about the atmosphere and busyness as I scroll down, and having only been there once, I won't try to refute it all, but when I went it was sunday night after lollapalooza and the wait wasn't bad at all, especially considering there was another bar/burger joint that we couldn't get into at all. Good times.
