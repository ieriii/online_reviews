I'm a Korean living in Lakeview and, trust me, there is no such thing as authentic Korean food here. You're better off making your way up to Lawrence Ave. or even the 'burbs.The bi bim bop at Crisp is mediocre at best with an unappetizing, runny, watery soup that collects at the bottom of the bowl after mixing everything. I can only guess that this comes from the washed veggies that aren't shaken free of excess water. Sesame oil is a key ingredient in this dish so, upon ordering, I made sure that it was included. I also wanted to get an impression of how far this place diverged from the traditional. They told me that the veggies are lightly seasoned with sesame oil before they're placed in the bowl. Lightly seems to be the key word here since I didn't taste any sesame oil at all. Sloppy & lazy. Also, for some of the clueless Yelpers, bi bim bop is SUPPOSED to include sides of hot pepper paste so quit making it sound like it was an extra, complimentary bonus of some kind.Their kimchi is overpriced but good. I like that they offer both radish & cabbage kinds although it wouldn't surprise me if they bought their kimchi from a supermarket.I didn't even bother with the bulgogi since it's pretty gross when it's badly made.But their Seoul Sassy wings are ok. Not nearly as spicy as my Korean palate would prefer but still pretty decent and understandably toned down for the demographics of this neighborhood. If you want huge wings and you're sick of buffalo, bbq and teriyaki, this is the place to go.
