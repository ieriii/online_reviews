Great service! Clean atmosphere. Try the sushi. Try the Maine Lobster Cocktail appetizer. Try a glass of the Jean-Louis Denois Blanc de Blancs, (Languedoc, France) if you're in the mood for sparkling. Great with the lobster. The Oyster Bar is fun. Live music is a great touch. The maitre d' is great! The bartenders are polished and friendly, and if you sit at the Oyster Bar, you can watch the sushi being made to one side of you. Fun for after work groups, families, and dates. Definitely go to their Oyster and Lobster themed festivals. Check out the website or ask your server for details.
