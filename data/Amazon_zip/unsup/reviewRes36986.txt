Solid. They have a great mix of beers on tap and they know their stuff. The wait staff have always been really helpful. I will say it's a huge pain to get into and the location for me makes it even trickier (I went in the winter though, still gotto try that beer garden), but it was definitely worth it. Their clams were also sooooo good and made a great snack to nibble on while drinkin some delicious beer. The food was great, but actually nothing amazing, for me. My friend was vegan and couldn't really find anything she was into. I, myself, don't really like red meat and it severely limited my options. But it was all around ok.
