Get a Tripel Karmeliet on draft. Now. Recently went here with my girlfriend and another couple for dinner, I was immediately struck by the awesome beer list (I didn't even read the bottle list, though it was large, stuck with the excellent Belgian selection and American micro-brews on tap), as well as it being extremely crowded (showed up at 8pm on a Tuesday). The wait for dinner was an hour and a half, but with the beer selection they have, this is hardly a problem. The hostess remembered what we looked like, and searched us out upstairs before our table was ready, which was a nice touch. Hopleaf is famous for their mussels, but since I'm not a big seafood fan, I ordered the Montreal brisket sandwich on sourdough, which was delicious, and everyone else had mussels. Of note are their fries, which are very tasty (though not super crispy), and come in a huge portion with an excellent aioli for dipping. Small downgrade for the waiter service, which was somewhat inattentive and quite slow, though they were extremely busy and appeared to be low on waitstaff. I look forward to going back to Hopleaf again, both as a bar and for dinner!
