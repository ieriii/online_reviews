Went here for a fashion show last weekend. It was pretty late but when it is all said and done I did have a great time, so I would definitely go back. Drinks were about 8 a piece but they were goooood! There was a mandatory coat check when I was there for 3 dollars. The crowd was slightly ghetto though. There were a bunch of Jersey Shore want to be's there and a fight almost ensued in the bathroom over some stupid, petty crap. I managed to stay out of it though. Overall, a fun time. Cool space too.
