Ordered the special banana omelette, which had spicy chicken chorizo with banana peppers, onions, cilantro, and cheese..DELISH! And they're known for their fresh juices, even though I didn't try it, but the coffee was excellent as well! They had carrot cake french toast, which i will go back to try! wait was about 30 min..not bad for sunday brunch and the food comes out fast!
