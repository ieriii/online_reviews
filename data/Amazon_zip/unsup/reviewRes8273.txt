The best pizza I have ever had, period. Worth the wait, worth the money. These folks are serious about pizza. We've been multiple times and have never had any variations in quality. Each visit has proven consistent. I have serious respect for a place that won't open if the dough doesn't turn out right that day. They'd rather lose money by staying closed than to produce an inferior product. Oh, I nearly forgot -- don't bother going here if you're looking for pepperoni. You won't find it on the menu.
