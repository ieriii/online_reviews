I recently hosted our company's holiday lunch party at Sunda. For the second year in a row we booked the small back room on the main dining floor. The team at Sunda are true pros: Nicole's sales team including Tenae and Kelsey know how to make throwing a party, even on a budget, easy and fun.  Once at the event, we were well taken care of by Brian and Shannon, the managers, as well as the wait staff.  The food is served family-style, and there are all inclusive options that include drinks, food and dessert. I highly recommend Sunda for private parties, and we'll be back again next year!
