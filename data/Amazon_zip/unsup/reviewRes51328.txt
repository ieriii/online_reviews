Not impressed. The place was recently remodeled, and since I wasn't there before, I can't say if it's really an improvement. What I can say is that the interior itself is deceptively small, and the vaulted ceilings that SHOULD add light and a feeling of space made me feel like I was in a cavern. One wall had a mural, but the other was almost bare. Our service was polite but slow. There's a bit of a fast-food feel to having to order a size of drink with a sit down meal (especially when it's dinner, not breakfast and you're ordering a soft drink rather than juice). No free refills on my "medium" Coke, though I paid almost $2 for it. The food was fine, but that's about the highest praise I can give. I had had food equally as good if not far superior at any number of taquerias around the city.
