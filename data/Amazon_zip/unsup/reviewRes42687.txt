For a gastropub, it's certainly not over-doing it. But there was something missing that I can't quite put my finger on.  The beer selection was good as expected but my star ratings are always based on lasting impression, and here, I didn't have much of one. I wasn't oogling over anything in particular; at the end of the day, there certainly are other options and up-and-coming restaurants in the city I'd like try before I go back for a second visit.
