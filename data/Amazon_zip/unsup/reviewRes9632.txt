Went on a Friday night, had reservations. Valet is $12 but you can find parking around there. Menu was extensive, including several vegan and veg dishes. We had the spring rolls, the shrimp lettuce rolls. I had the rice noodles with hot ginger sauce and the others in our party tried the snapper and salmon, which they enjoyed. The dessert we chose was the macaroon with ice cream, along with ports. Service was very good and the ambiance is nice, not to stuffy and decorated in a "colonial" style.
