Sometimes I randomly crave their Seoul Sassy chicken. Crisp is probably hands down my favorite restaurant in the city. I'm from Hawaii, so I'm really judgmental of Asian food. The only other equivalent to the Seoul Sassy chicken is the Korean Fried Chicken from Zippy's in Hawaii, and let's face it, Crisp might be better and is so much closer. I love this place because it has great food, especially for the price. Everyone who has eaten at any Korean restaurant knows that Korean food is not cheap.My boyfriend and I usually split the whole chicken combo for $19.99 (comes with 2 cans of pop and 2 sides). It's perfect for sharing and sometimes we'll have enough for one lunch the next day.
