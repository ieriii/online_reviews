We had Nana cater our office holiday party, and it was superb. We asked for a meat tray, a veggie tray, a cheese tray, and some desserts, and what we got was very agreeably out of the ordinary and quite reasonably priced, especially considering the quality of ingredients and preparation. We're planning on having Nana cater our next event; you should too!
