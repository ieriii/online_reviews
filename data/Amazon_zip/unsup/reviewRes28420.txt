Yeah, it's a good life, you know? Swinging into Pequod's on a Friday afternoon and ordering their $5 lunch special can make anyone feel great about what's coming up and what's already occurred. What is the lunch special, you wonder, merely the incredible deal of a personal Chicago style deep dish and a beer. Seriously, at this price you can "splurge" on any of the fantastic appetizers (the garlic bread and mozzarella stick come highly recommended,) and still feel guilty about not having paid full price for a full stomach and a knowing satisfaction that is worth every penny. With the Webster Place theatre across the street, Pequod's also makes a perfect place for dinner dates and if a full sized Chicago deep dish is too daunting the calorically challenged will be thrilled to know that the thin crust pizza is also incredible. In any case the multitude of toppings and perfectly heated ovens almost make the crust moot, as you'll be getting a great pizza no matter what you go with.
