Sweet Jesus, there is no better place to eat in Chicago. As a former resident of Greece and a flaming enthusiast of Greek food, I stand by Greek Islands until the end over any other restaurant in Greektown. I always end up spending obscene amounts of money here because I order everything. I've learned over time that the best idea might be to share an entree with someone. Wait, scratch that. Just get two, you'll have left-overs and be overjoyed by them. As far as appetizers go, I recommend: octopus, saganaki, tzatziki, fried zucchini and horiatiki salad. If I were you, I would check and make sure you go on lamb Rosa Marina night because it is the most delicious thing you will ever eat in your life. The Mediterranean sea bass is also completely delicious. To top it off, get some Agioritiko wine and you will be well on your way to the most euphoric food coma of your life.
