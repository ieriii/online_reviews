AAAAAAAHH. These tortas have ruined me. I can no longer fully enjoy my favorite sandwich shops in Seattle because I now know these sandwiches are out there. I had the Ahodaga and the bf had the Pepito. Both were so delicious, I keep thinking about them a week later.  P.S. Don't get the lemonade, it's way too sweet.
