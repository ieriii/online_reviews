I went to Grand Lux with my family during their most recent visit to Chicago. We decided it would be a nice place to go for Sunday Brunch, The wait was only 5 minutes, due to presenting a card from the hotel my parents stayed in (the hostess said the average wait was 1 hour). The service and food was mediocre and I was not impressed by the menu as a whole. The portions are HUGE and RICH so after eating a 1/4 of my plate I was so sick of what I had ordered. It is never a good thing to still have food left on your plate, still be hungry but be so bored with your meal you just stop eating. Although the decor is lovely the acoustics are bad and it is extremely noisy.
