Sapori Trattoria could not have been better! I made reservations for my family to celebrate my mother's birthday.  when confirming the reservation, they ask my mother's name and when we arrived, the menus said "Happy Birthday, Pam" which was a very nice touch! Bread was just as it should be - soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside and perfectly warm and they kept it coming for my hungry brothers & the hubs.  All entrees were extremely large portions, the lasagna was enormous, and all very tasty! Not one complaint from my picky family.  Wine list was good and service was excellent. And the dessert - YUM! They brought out a birthday dessert plate that was a large piece of each of their tiramisu, bread pudding and some chocolate yumminess that was heavenly.  And we just got a coupon in the mail with a handwritten note thanking us for coming. Great customer service! Will be back!
