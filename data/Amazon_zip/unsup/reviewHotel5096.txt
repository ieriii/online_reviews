Booked the room blind through hotwire for $75 a night. The room was totally worth $75 a night...there is no way it is worth the standard rate of over $200 a night. The beds were comfortable and we had a great view of the city. Nice large flat screen TV. I didn't mind that the room may have been on the small side as some other guests mentioned on here. If I had paid the full rate I may have been more irked...but we were only there to sleep so not a big deal at all. We stayed in the Executive levels of the hotel..not sure if that makes any difference whatsoever in the rooms. Sore points: They charge for EVERYTHING. Parking, gym use, internet...don't open that bottle of water they leave out...it's not free. They even charged me $1.50 to make a local call. I don't mind nominal fees, but $43 a night for parking, $15 per day of internet use....adds up quick.  We were afraid to touch the complimentary coffee or turn on the lights for fear of hidden charges! They also sell jewelry in the lobby which I thought was kind of tacky. I'll leave on a positive note because despite my griping, it's not a bad hotel: The rooms were comfortable and guest services were helpful and efficient. The soaps/shampoos were Crabtree and Evelyn which I love. This is a business class hotel, not a luxury hotel...so if you're expecting the royal treatment it's probably not going to happen. If you can get a great deal through priceline, hotwire etc to offset the cost of parking, go for it!
