Regrettably, I have only been to this little gem perched on the edge of Bucktown and Logan Square twice, but both times have been delicious. The first time I went all out with my friend Janna, ordering appetizers, smoothies, and a full platter of mouth-watering carne asada and plantains. Last night was a completely different affair of guacamole and quick sandwiches/burritos. I'll let my dinner mate rave about her veggie burrito, but I will sing the praises of my egg and bean sandwich. Scrambled egg, pinto beans, Lizano sauce, and spicy peppers layered onto chewy french bread--heavenly! I imagine this sandwich as the ideal street food, satisfying cravings for protein and carbs as one wanders a marketplace in Costa Rica. We sat out on the patio, and enjoyed friendly, timely service. The place only accepts cash (with an ATM inside) and is BYOB, so be prepared...prepared to have a fresh, familiar yet different, delicious meal at one of Chicago's only (possibly only) Costa Rican restaurants.
