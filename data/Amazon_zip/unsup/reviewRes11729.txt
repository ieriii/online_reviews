I really don't understand why there's such a long ass line here week after week. It's definitely solid, but I wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes for it. If you're open to sitting at the bar, you can get seated pretty quickly, which is what we opted for. The food is definitely fresh and fast (I had an omelette) and there are some creative ideas, but I don't feel it's worth all the hype (or wait). If you go, go early so you don't have to wait with all the other hipsters.
