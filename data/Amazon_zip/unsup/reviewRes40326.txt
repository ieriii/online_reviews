I give L&E 4 stars only because the service is inconsistent - sometimes it's friendly and attentive, other times, I feel like the hipster staff doesn't give a shit. But as far as food and drink are concerned, 5 stars all the way. Each time I've gone, I've tried something different. I really like that the menu changes frequently. There isn't a dish that I didn't enjoy. The first time, my husband and I went with another couple and we just ordered a ton of stuff to share. The second time, we took more of a traditional appetizer/main course approach. The stand-outs were: Pretzel with Welsh Rarebit - imagine a savory donut with fantastic boozy, cheesy, mustardy sauce. So good. The seared scallops with braised oxtail - wonderful combination of textures and flavors. Lobster Parfait - looks like a dessert, but is a heavenly combination of seafood and vegetables. Candied Pork shank - this was a seasonal item, served with greens and maybe some grits - absolutely phenomenal. My husband has been having candied pork dreams ever since. Warm Gruyere Donuts - sweet Moses these are amazing. I could just eat these for a meal. Like, every day. (cheese + donuts = heaven) The cocktail and beer list are fantastic as well. Perhaps what I love most about L&E is that you can tailor the experience to your budget/taste each time. It's perfect for a sharing feast, but you can easily be satisfied with a starter and entree. I think it deserves that Michelin star!
