This place is fantastic. I can't say enough good things about it. I have been eating here for years. The menu variety is good and the food is even better. My favorite items include the Radical Ruben, the Caesar Salad w/chicken, and the Nachos. Save room for dessert because the cookies are excellent. If you are ever there in the Fall when they have pumpkin ice cream, order the pumpkin milkshake, one of the best things I have ever eaten. Always a treat to eat here.
