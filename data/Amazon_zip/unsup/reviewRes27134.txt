I came here on a Sunday evening to try the famous carmelized crust. Because I arrived at an off-peak hour (5pm) and was with only one other person, we were seated right away without reservations on the second floor. I prepared myself for a long wait, so my dining companion and I ordered some Goose Island and jalepeno poppers to pass the time. The poppers were pretty good. They were filled with cheddar cheese, and although I prefer the cream cheese jalepeno poppers, these were hot and cheesy and fried and really, what more could you ask for? Our spinach and garlic deep dish arrived about 45 minutes later. We decided to go with spinach and garlic to compare it to Giordano's, whose spinach and garlic pizza is out of this world. This pizza was also excellent. The actual cheesy-garlicky-spinach part of the pizza probably wasn't as good as giardano's because the amount of toppings was kind of weak, but this is not to say that it was bad. It was still delicious. The crust, of course, was insanely good. Chewy, crispy, doughy- all at the same time. How is this even possible? One of life's great mysteries. Make your life easier by anticipating the long wait for the pizza and avoid waiting for a table by making reservations or going at an off hour. Enjoy some beer while you wait, and then dive into some incredibile chicago-style deep dish!
