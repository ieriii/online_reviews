I'm just going straight for the food. Yes there is very cool and somewhat esoteric beer list and the space is unique (it has that beer hall, minimalistic feel) but the food stands out above the rest. It is what you would expect from the boys at Blackbird and avec. Creative yet sensible, high quality product presented in a way that the owners would eat everyday. The restaurant pays homage to the pig, evidenced by the fired pork rind appetizer (not ashamed to say they were delicious), and the many things pork. Ordering any of these dishes will do you right. But even the seafood will blow you away. The crudo is spot on and the mussels simmered in a citrusy beer that's available on the menu will blow you away - even if you don't like mussels. There is also the chicken - yes pedestrian in theory but I am willing to bet it is the BEST chicken you will ever eat. Juicy, flavorful and fabulous served with french fries cooked in lard. YUM!!!
