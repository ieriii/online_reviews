This place was delicious but some of the dishes were a little salty and pickled for my tastes. I loved the diverse menu and most of my dishes specifically the fried deviled eggs, the chicken thighs, and the crispy pig ears. The pork shoulder was mediocre (Avec has a great one if you're into that kind of dish). We ordered more but they don't stand out. I agree with some of the other Yelpers about the community sitting. We sat next to some obnoxious patrons who acted like they've never seen a group of Asian women before. They were facing us while we ate and talked about us like we weren't sitting next to them. Fortunately, the food made up for the akward seating arrangements. Sad to say some of my dishes were forgettable.
