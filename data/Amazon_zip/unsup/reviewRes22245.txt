I went to Superdawg on 03/28/10. This was my first time ever going there. There chocolate shakes and malts were excellent, however they were small for the price. The container the hot dogs and fries come in made the contents soggy by the time i got home (10 minute drive). The actual hot dog was very good. The hot dog was juicy, not overcooked, and had all the right fixings. The fries were as stated soggy and not very good from being in the container too long. Overall: A really cool place with good food, but pricey.
