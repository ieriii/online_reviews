We stopped in this past Saturday afternoon and sat at the bar. The female bartender was MIA for the first five minutes, then when she showed back up, she was busy at the end of the bar for another five minutes. When she finally got to us, I ordered a beer, and my friend asked for some sort of mixed drink. The bartender said something about not being sure if they had that as she walked off. After another five minutes, she came back and we asked her about it again since we thought we saw it on the back bar. At this point she sarcastically berated us like a couple of two year olds. We looked at each other, somewhat stunned, and got up to leave. She asked, "Just because I don't have it? Fine!" I tried to respond to her that it was actually because of her crappy attitude, but she was already walking away in an attempt to ignore us, as she knew we were pissed. We ended up going to another pizza place in the neighborhood where they could not have been more friendly. It was like night and day. We're not demanding customers-- we've worked in the service industry before, and we'll put up with mediocre service if the person is swamped or whatever. One thing I can't take is a pompous or hostile attitude. Maybe you're experience will be different, but one interaction like that is enough to keep me away.
