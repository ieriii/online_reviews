I was re-introduced to Piece by a co-friend (coworker/friend) who was appalled by my lack of excitement over the pizza product being churned out here on gigantic baking sheets. On my first experience the pizza was fine but it was nothing that left me dying to come back. During this recent trip my friend ordered her faves for me to try. The first - white pizza with feta, tomato, and artichoke (three of my favorite foods basically). Again, the white pizza was so-so. There is something really missing with it. The other pizza we tried had everything flavor-wise the other pizza lacked. Wow was it delicious! Imagine if you can; red sauce, pepperoni, jalapeo peppers, and green peppers. It was a flavor carnival and I wanted to be the ring leader. If I come back I'll be sure to go with something similar.
