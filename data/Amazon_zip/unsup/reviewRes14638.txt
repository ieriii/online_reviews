Party of 4 breakdown: everyone loved the polenta fries, and the bacon fat popcorn was alright. The curry was fantastic. The pork belly and egg sandwich was "the best sandwich of my husband's life." The hombre burger was good, but the fish and chips was just ok. And the beer was tasty, too, especially because you can buy a 5 oz. taste to make sure you like it! All in all- we can't wait to go back!
