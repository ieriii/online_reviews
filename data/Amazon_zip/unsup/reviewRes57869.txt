I've never had Ethiopian before, so I was a little bit nervous. I always like to try to find the menu online beforehand, so I could get an idea of what I'm in for. I found a number of things I'd be interested in trying, but I needn't have done that, because the group I dine with decided to order as a group, and not individually. We had an eclectic mix of vegetarian and meat dishes, and there was not one thing I did not enjoy! The wait staff was very friendly and informative, explaining all the dishes as well as the drinks that were brought. The food was so good, I can't wait to go back! The ONLY downside is we did not ask for utensils, and as we were utilizing the bread base to eat with, we all got full rather quickly, leaving a lot left over. In all fairness, I could give the restaurant 5 stars, but being as I have nothing to compare it to, I can't say it's as good as it gets...yet.
