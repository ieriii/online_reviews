My partner became a vegetarian a few months ago and I am reviewing this restaurant as a meat eater. However, I have to say this place is fantastic. Delicious vegetarian/vegan food that tastes amazing!!!! I had the burritos and I really enjoyed it. My partner had the burger and the "meat" looked and tasted just like real meat. That's freakin' great. The service was great and our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the products. But be prepared, if you go after 6 PM, even on a weekday there's probably going to be a lengthy wait time. We waited for 45 minutes in a heated tent out back before we were able to get a seat. I think the only two cons for me was the seating arrangement and the price. The quarters were a little tight and it felt like we were basically eating at the same table with 5 women on our right and another 2 patrons on our left. We were so close they were even chatting with us, which I guess is cool... but not when you are trying to have a romantic evening out to dinner. I think next time we'll ask for a booth. The price was a little expensive. When we got our bill, I was like WHOA. Truly, I think it was those organic sodas which were like 2.75 each - no refills, just cans - dayyyuuummm! Our total for two entrees, an appetizer, and two drinks was close to $50. Food was super good though. We'll for sure go back. Wooo!
