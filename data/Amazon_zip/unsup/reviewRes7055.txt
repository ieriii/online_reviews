Go, its fun, unique and pretty good food. The food they use seems much higher quality that most BBQ joints. It was all good except for their sauces. Not one of their sauces grabbed me and as good as the meet was, it called for sauce. It wasn't bad but the stuff I make myself is better. The chili there is an awesome order...get it! the wings were good too. I liked the beans and enjoyed all of the sides.  Service was A Plus! We even got to see the smokers in the kitchen by the beautiful blonde owner/ chef. I feel like the owner should be a brother missing a finger, sweating over his craft..like at KC"S Arthur Bryants or LC's, but it was a nice if not telling gesture. Perfect scenario...sneak Smoke Daddy Sauce in with you and then you would have a 5 star experience.
