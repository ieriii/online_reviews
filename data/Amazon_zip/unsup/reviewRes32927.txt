This was my first time eating Ethiopian food and I really enjoyed it. The host was extremely friendly and explained the whole menu to me, my wife + 2 1/2yr old. We got a sampler appetizer that was delicious and came out in about 5 minutes of ordering. We got a combo vege and meat sampler as an entre which was also great. Surprisingly filling due to the doughy bread u eat with the food. The etheopian beer and honey wine were tasty. Restaurant iteself is small -to-medium size with minimal but nice decor. Unfortunately we couldn't stay late enough for the live music but I plan on returning for that. The place seemed very family friendly and the host said he was working on getting coloring menus for kids. Great thing is that this place works families and dates. Highly recommended
