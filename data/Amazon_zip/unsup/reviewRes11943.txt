We went to Piece for lunch on Sunday afternoon with another couple and their toddler. I loved how friendly the staff are and how comfortable it was to eat lunch with two toddlers at our table. The booth worked very well for us because we could stuff our kids in the middle and block all exits :) After debating for a while between the white or red sauce, we went with the red after seeing the pizza served to the next table. My husband also ordered a mixed greens salad, which was served with caramelized pecans and crumbly cheese. I am not a salad fan, but I liked the little I ate. Of course, the main attraction was the pizza, which did not disappoint. Our toppings - mushroom, sausage, bacon. The crust was just right - thin and crispy. Definitely a repeat!
