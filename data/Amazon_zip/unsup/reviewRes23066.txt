I know, I know, it makes no sense.  How could've I possibly waited this long before trying Irazu??? I don't get it either.  I've driven by, thought of driving by and planned on driving by multiple times, but never went to this area with the sole purpose of stopping at Irazu.  Well, I got my priorities in order and scheduled a date. With my mommy. I had recently moved out and we hadn't spent much time together since, so I took her to Irazu for lunch. Both she and I really enjoyed it.  I have to admit that I'm really picky when it comes to meat, I get grossed out with anything chewy or tough but I did not have that problem with their Pepito sandwich. The steak was perfect. We also tried some empanadas, a Palmito salad, mom had the Casado, and of course, we tried the Oatmeal shake. I LOVE the sweet plaintains!! I'm craving some now, actually. The service was wonderful. We were lucky enough to stop in at a time when the place was practically empty, so, no wait time. Couldn't have had a better experience. Irazu, I luv U!
