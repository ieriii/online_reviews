Some of the reviews had me a bit wary of this hotel, but we got such a great deal through Expedia that we had to try it. I'm so glad we did--I love this place! Recently renovated, the decor is charming. Walking in to the spacious and attractive lobby, greeted by smiling and helpful staff, you know you are in for a treat. Its location is simply unbeatable--right across the street from Lincoln Park, a couple of blocks from the North Ave. Beach, a stone's throw from major bus lines (the 22, the 151) that will get you anywhere around Chicago you care to go. Our particular room was small but affordable, well-kept and attractively decorated in sort of a "Mad Men" '60's style (to borrow a description from other reviewers). Larger rooms are available, but as we spent all of our time out exploring Chicago, the size of the room was not a problem for us. Oh, and do ask for a lake view room--so worth it! The hotel also has a wonderful little breakfast cafe with delicious cherry scones and raspberry muffins made fresh daily, and a great restaurant for dinner. The rooftop bar is now open and holy moly what a view! The bar is a real party scene on the weekends, but go up during the week when it's a bit quieter and enjoy a drink while watching the sunset--it is heavenly! The staff is excellent--friendly, professional, knowledgeable and just plain fun! Although there is no concierge as such, everyone behind the lobby counter was able to answer our touristy questions (where is the nearest ATM, which bus will get us to xyz, where is the best local place to get an Italian meat sandwich...). All in all, it's a great hotel. We'll stay here again the next time we visit Chicago.
