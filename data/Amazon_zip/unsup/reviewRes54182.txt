Don't get me wrong, the food at Xoco is amazing, and that's part of the problem! I want and expect a lot more. A $12 sandwich should have about three times the amount of meat served on my Pork Belly Torta. The deliciously-tender salsa negra topped pork was barely noticeable hiding between the halves of the crisp wood-oven toasted bread.Yeah, yeah, local and all-natural ingredients drive up the price, but seriously, don't be so skimpy! Next time I want salsa negra pork belly, I'll make three pounds of it at home for the same price (with Bayless' own recipe) and eat myself silly!
