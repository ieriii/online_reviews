So the first time I went here I was so loaded (open 24 hours!) that all I remembered was how good it was, and I wound up going back the next morning at like 10 a.m. just to confirm it wasn't an ETOH induced false positive. Two giant steak burritos and about a gallon of black salsa later, yeah, good stuff. It's that good people - and not just after the taps are turned off for the night, but even in the light of day.  I'm partial to the black salsa (caliente!) but he green is delicious too (caliente!). I usually get the chicken super (burrito) but the steak is incredible too. Pork tends toward the fatty. The burritos are big. If you get the steak, go purist and just get onions and cilantro. Steak tacos have good proportions too. And often I just go there for the salsa, get a few large tubs to bring home just for me! Now, they've patched the bullet holes in the bathroom walls, got rid of the espanol-only fat guy with the sour face that used to work the register, got a new menu, and yes, I've seen the kiss of death for any city "joint" - the dreaded suburban blonde wife, minivan full of little blonde cookie cutter kids pulling up in front because they want a "city" experience (they've almost killed the 'Spoke dead). But for the most part they've kept the food the same (i.e., they haven't cleaned the grill in years). Note: go to the yellow Pasadita, not the one that has brains on the menu, and not the one across the street. If you know Pasadita you know what I'm talking about. Six flags.
