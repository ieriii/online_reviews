If you get anything at Opart, get the crab Rangoons. I loves me some Rangoons, but these are the ones I will be craving from now on. Oh man soooo good. Hokay, so. We had the Pad Thai with chicken and Gaeng Panang also with chicken. The Pad Thai was a little sweeter than I'm used to and I'm not sure that I liked that about it. Don't get me wrong, it was still pretty darn good. The Gaeng was realllllly good. We got it at a medium spice level and we both felt that it was very mediumly spicy (just pretend those are real words).  The place was hopping for a Sunday night! The service was ok - my friend's water glass was empty a couple times and that kinda bugs me. We thought it would be a fab place for a group dinner. All in all, a delightful Thai experience.
